"Victoria Brignell was left on a plane for more than 90 minutes at Gatwick Airports must stop failing disabled passengers or they could face legal action, the UK regulator has warned. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said it understood the recruitment challenges facing the industry but some recent incidents were ""unacceptable"". In some cases disabled passengers had been left waiting hours on planes for help to get off, it said. The industry has been struggling with staff shortages in recent months. Airlines and airports cut thousands of jobs during the pandemic, when Covid restrictions virtually shut down international travel. However, since the demand for flights has returned they have found it difficult to recruit and train new staff quick enough, leading to delays and cancellations. 'It happened again':  Wheelchair-users left on planes Why are so many flights being cancelled? In a letter to airports,external, the CAA said assistance was continuing to be provided in a timely manner ""for the vast majority of passengers"". But the regulator said it was ""disappointing"" there had been a ""dip in performance at some airports"" in recent months, with more disabled and less mobile passengers having to wait longer for assistance than usual. It said it was ""very concerned"" about increased reports of ""significant service failings"", including passenger's wheelchairs not being unloaded in a timely manner and disabled individuals being helped off planes hours after other flyers. The CAA added that a higher proportion of passengers at some airports were also using assistance services, although the cause of this increase in demand was not clear. The regulator said it would be asking all airports with a high number of passengers using assistance services to set out by 21 June what measures they had taken to stop ""significant service failures happening in the future"". ""We will continue to closely monitor the quality of service provided and if these significant service failures continue, we will consider what further action is needed, including using enforcement powers,"" it added. The CAA has powers to investigate and prosecute breaches of aviation rules,externaland some breaches of consumer protection requirements. The BBC's Frank Gardner said he had been left waiting for assistance several times Earlier this week,one disabled passenger, Victoria Brignell, said she was left on a plane at Gatwick for more than an hour and a half after it had landed, despite booking assistance three months in advance. Another wheelchair usersaid he waited more than two hours for someone to help him disembark at Manchester Airport. Both airports apologised, with Manchester blaming staff shortages. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner, who uses a wheelchair, said such situations were becoming ""depressingly familiar"". ""The airports seem to be slipping back. The level of investment and effort that goes into making money at these airports isn't matched by the effort and money that needs to go into getting disabled passengers off the plane at the same time as everybody else,"" he said earlier this week. The UK government recommends passengers request assistance through their airline, tour operator or travel agent at least 48 hours before travel If a passenger has not pre-notified, assistance will always still be provided but you might have to wait longer to be helped If things go wrong and you're unhappy, the CAA recommends you take your complaint directly to the airline or airport If you remain dissatisfied, you can refer your complaint to an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) body which provides alternative methods, such as mediation and conciliation, instead of going to court Airport apologises to disabled woman left on plane Wheelchair user trapped on plane calls for change 'It happened again': Wheelchair-users left on planes Will my summer holiday flights be cancelled?

"Julee Cruise said it was ""so much fun"" to be part of Twin Peaks' success Twin Peaks creator David Lynch has paid tribute to Julee Cruise, who recorded the TV show's haunting theme, as ""a great musician, a great singer and a great human being"". Cruise sang Falling from Lynch's 1990 drama, with the song reaching the top 10 in the UK singles chart. She also performed on the soundtrack to his 1986 film Blue Velvet. Cruise's husband Edward Grinnan earlier wrote on Facebook that the 65-year-old had ""left this realm on her own terms"". Musicians paying tribute included singer-songwriterJohn Grant, who said,externalshe was ""one of the greatest"". In his tribute on YouTube, Lynch said: ""I just found out that the great Julee Cruise passed away. Very sad news.

Cruise first collaborated with Lynch after working as a talent scout for composer Angelo Badalamenti, who had been asked to work on the song Mysteries of Love for the Blue Velvet soundtrack. Cruise struggled to find a suitably ethereal vocalist, so decided to have a go at singing the track herself. ""I actually never sang in that trademark 'Julee Cruise voice' before I worked with Angelo and David,""she told The Guardian in 2017,external. ""I was always a real belter, lots of power. Working with them changed me."" Cruise with director David Lynch (left) and composer Angelo Badalamenti in 1989 The trio worked together on the 1989 album Floating into the Night, with Lynch writing the lyrics and Badalamenti composing the music. The LP included Falling and other songs that would go on to feature in Twin Peaks the following year. Cruise also had a small role in the series, and in the 1992 spin-off film Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me and the 2017 revival Twin Peaks: The Return. ""It was so much fun to be part of something that just went ba-boom!"" she told the Los Angeles Times in 2017. ""You didn't know it was going to do that. What a nice surprise life takes you on."" Rob da Bank: Why I love the Twin Peaks soundtrack so much Cruise recorded a second solo album, The Voice of Love, with Lynch and Badalamenti in 1993, and Lynch directed her in an avant-garde one-hour concert film, Industrial Symphony No 1, in 1990. Beyond those collaborations, she also toured with the B-52s, filling in for Cindy Wilson in the 1990s, and performed with Bobby McFerrin. Edward Grinnanwrote on Facebook,external: ""She left this realm on her own terms. No regrets. She is at peace.

"Liverpool has accused French police of seeking confrontation A chain of failures marred the Champions League final in Paris last month, a French government report says. They included lack of preparation for travelling fans, huge numbers of people without tickets or fake ones, and security failures at the stadium. The report does not apportion blame, but recommends improvements which the government says will be implemented. The fiasco included tear-gassing fans before the match on 28 May and attacks on them by local youths afterwards. Real Madrid won the match 1-0 against Liverpool at the Stade de France. The chaos - and the initial French response seeking to blame fans for the trouble - has prompted uproar in France as well as the UK and Spain. Liverpool fans react as they queue to access Stade de France before Champions League Final on 28 May Liverpool fans have complained of fearing for their safety in a crush while trying to get into the stadium, despite arriving hours earlier. But they have also told of local gangs from the Saint-Denis area descending on crowds after the match, stealing phones and watches and threatening them with knives. Liverpool's mayor has accused French police officers of being too quick to threaten fans with batons. Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin has particularly come under fire for blaming the trouble outside the stadium on ""massive, industrial-scale"" ticket fraud which caused Liverpool fans to turn up en masse. But the author of the report, Michel Cadot, the government's envoy for Olympics and other major sporting event preparations, said that Mr Darmanin's claim that as many as 40,000 Liverpool fans were to blame for the chaos should be ""relativised"". In his 30-page report - the first official conclusion of a government inquiry - Mr Cadot highlighted: Travel to the venue: Mistakes with signposting safe routes for the fans, aggravated by a strike on the underground train line Sheer numbers: ""Uncontrolled influx of additional members of the public without tickets or with fake ones, in unprecedented proportions"". Stadium security: A ""rupture"" in checks and security measures around the stadium, adding that ""the organisers and policemen were overwhelmed by the situation"". Harrowing accounts of post-match violence spark debate How the Champions League final trouble unfolded The violence and the way it had been dealt with had ""raised questions from outside observers about our country's ability to deliver and succeed in the major sporting events for which we will soon be responsible"" said the report. Paris is to play host to the 2023 Rugby World Cup and 2024 Olympics. The report makes five recommendations, including the creation of a national committee to pilot major international sporting events, and the introduction of fully electronic tickets to reduce the risks of fraud. In a first reaction, French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said she had asked the interior and sports ministers ""to take up the recommendations to put them in place without delay"".

Ukrainian students Pavlo Denysenko and Snizhana Berezhna at Coventry University, one of the universities where Zelensky spoke to students over Zoom In case you missed it, here's a recap of the main headlines today: As we reported earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought tojustify Moscow's invasion of Ukraine by saying his country is trying to regain its ""original territories""- just as previous Russian ruler, Peter the Great did in the 18th century. In response, Estonia's foreign minister summoned the Russian ambassador to condemn Putin's ""completely unacceptable"" praise for the 18th century ruler. Speaking on Thursday, Putin specifically mentioned Narva, which belongs to Estonia, one of the three Baltic States and a member of Nato, Reuters reports. In a statement, Estonia's foreign minister, who summoned ambassador Vladimir Lipayev, said: ""At a time when Russia is... trying to destroy the statehood and people of Ukraine, it is also completely unacceptable."" Estonia was part of the Russian Empire for more than two centuries, only regaining independence in 1918 - before losing it to the Soviet Union until 1991. Zelensky addressed hundreds of students in the UK over a Zoom call Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to hundreds of university students across the UK earlier as part of an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union. The president gave a 15-minute opening speech over Zoom and then took questions, mostly focused on rebuilding Ukraine after the war. Here's what we learned:  More from the event here. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (left) with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he's asked Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic to join the European Union's sanctions on Russia. Serbia is not in the EU, though it has applied to join and is in talks. Scholz was in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, today to meet the country's President Aleksandar Vucic. Speaking at a news conference, Scholz said joining the sanctions made sense given Serbia aspired to join the 27-member bloc. But Vucic said the EU should consider the fact that Serbia and Russia had special relations that dated a long way back. Smoke over Severodonetsk this week We've been reporting on the situation in Severodonetsk in recent days - the city in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine which is currently seeing the worst of the fighting. According to the Ukrainian military, the Russians have continued assault operations in the area of Severodonetsk today to try and get full control of the city and create the conditions to surround Ukrainian units. In a Facebook update, Ukraine's General Staff said: ""The fighting continues. The enemy fired artillery in the area of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Ustynivka, Toshkivka, Zolote and Hirske."" And the Russian military is preparing to resume its offensive on the city of Slovyansk, also in the Donetsk region, the report said. Read more on the battle for Severodonetsk BBC World News We've got some more reaction to the death sentences given to three men who were fighting for the Ukrainian military against Russian forces. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK said the ""harsh"" sentence of capital punishment did not exist in his country. Speaking on BBC World News, Vadym Prystaiko said there were continuing discussions about prisoner swaps and the release of soldiers. Mr Prystaiko said he was in ""constant contact"" with the families of the two Britons captured by Russian forces and urged them to ""trust"" in Ukraine's ability to negotiate. The men were sentenced to death by a court in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic which is not recognised internationally. Discussing the reported suffering in Mariupol, he explained his fears that the ""situation
is not going to get easier"" as temperatures increase. Ukraine needs a combination of political, military and financial support to rebuild the country, he added. Ukraine has sown 13.4 million hectares with key agricultural crops this spring, which is 93% of its target for the season, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports, citing the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food. As we've been reporting regularly in recent days, Ukraine is one of the world's key food producers and there have been fears disruption to its industry couldaffect people around the world, with the UN among those warning of the danger of widespread hunger. But Interfax reports that farmers have been able to sow more than 90% of the planned spring target for several main crops, including sunflowers, corn, barley, oats and potatoes, while it has met its target for spring wheat. Harvesting of winter crops in some regions is expected to begin next week, it says. Earlier, Rostyslav Shurma, a deputy head of the President's Office, said Ukraine's goal in 2022 was to harvest at least 70% of last year's volumes. The Russian government is spending $17 million (Â£13 million) on national flags and coats of arms to feature in a weekly patriotic ceremony in rural schools across the nation. This is part of a patriotic push coinciding with the invasion of Ukraine, The Moscow Times reports. From September, every Monday morning, schools will raise the flag and perform the national anthem aimed at boosting ""civic consciousness"", Education Minister Sergei Kravtsov said. The education ministry is already planning to introduce compulsory history lessons from age seven, but only where Russians are shown as the good guys. Some journalists have noted that the money is being spent despite the fact that more than 5,000 Russian schools lack indoor plumbing.

Shevchecnko, who played for teams including Dynamo Kyiv, AC Milan and Chelsea, is Ukraine's record goalscorer and also managed the national team at last year's European Championship. He said on a recent visit to Kyiv he had a ""very nice meeting with the president"", and they were positive they could defend their country and bring peace to Ukraine. ""At the most difficult time in our the history of Ukraine he has brought people together and sent a great message across the world,"" he tells BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Ukraine's people must not give up, we want our democracy we fight for our freedom and that's a massive message to everyone.

Ukrainian students Pavlo Denysenko and Snizhana Berezhna at Coventry University, one of the universities where Zelensky spoke to students over Zoom In case you missed it, here's a recap of the main headlines today: As we reported earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought tojustify Moscow's invasion of Ukraine by saying his country is trying to regain its ""original territories""- just as previous Russian ruler, Peter the Great did in the 18th century. In response, Estonia's foreign minister summoned the Russian ambassador to condemn Putin's ""completely unacceptable"" praise for the 18th century ruler. Speaking on Thursday, Putin specifically mentioned Narva, which belongs to Estonia, one of the three Baltic States and a member of Nato, Reuters reports.

"Russia's foreign minister says three men sentenced to death - two Britons and one Moroccan - committed crimes in a breakaway Ukrainian region All three were convicted by a Russian proxy court in the so-called Donetsk People's Republic UK PM Boris Johnson urges ministers to do ""everything in their power"" to secure the release of the two Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner were fighting with the Ukrainian army and their sentencing is an ""egregious breach"" of the Geneva Conventions, the UK says Meanwhile, there's a risk of a major cholera outbreak in the occupied port city of Mariupol, the UK's Ministry of Defence says The exiled deputy mayor says the 100,000 people still in the city are at growing risk of disease Edited by Rob Corp We're pausing our live coverage now. Thanks for following and we'll be back tomorrow with more updates on the Ukraine war throughout the day. Today's live page was brought to you by: Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan, Rob Corp, Alex Therrien, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, James Clarke, James Harness, George Wright, Dulcie Lee, Charley Adams, Catherine Evans and Francesca Gillett. For around-up of the main Ukraine war headlines, head here -and for the latest on Mariupol,that's here. Ukrainian students Pavlo Denysenko and Snizhana Berezhna at Coventry University, one of the universities where Zelensky spoke to students over Zoom In case you missed it, here's a recap of the main headlines today: As we reported earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought tojustify Moscow's invasion of Ukraine by saying his country is trying to regain its ""original territories""- just as previous Russian ruler, Peter the Great did in the 18th century. In response, Estonia's foreign minister summoned the Russian ambassador to condemn Putin's ""completely unacceptable"" praise for the 18th century ruler. Speaking on Thursday, Putin specifically mentioned Narva, which belongs to Estonia, one of the three Baltic States and a member of Nato, Reuters reports. In a statement, Estonia's foreign minister, who summoned ambassador Vladimir Lipayev, said: ""At a time when Russia is... trying to destroy the statehood and people of Ukraine, it is also completely unacceptable."" Estonia was part of the Russian Empire for more than two centuries, only regaining independence in 1918 - before losing it to the Soviet Union until 1991. Zelensky addressed hundreds of students in the UK over a Zoom call Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to hundreds of university students across the UK earlier as part of an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union. The president gave a 15-minute opening speech over Zoom and then took questions, mostly focused on rebuilding Ukraine after the war. Here's what we learned:  More from the event here. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (left) with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he's asked Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic to join the European Union's sanctions on Russia. Serbia is not in the EU, though it has applied to join and is in talks. Scholz was in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, today to meet the country's President Aleksandar Vucic. Speaking at a news conference, Scholz said joining the sanctions made sense given Serbia aspired to join the 27-member bloc. But Vucic said the EU should consider the fact that Serbia and Russia had special relations that dated a long way back. Smoke over Severodonetsk this week We've been reporting on the situation in Severodonetsk in recent days - the city in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine which is currently seeing the worst of the fighting. According to the Ukrainian military, the Russians have continued assault operations in the area of Severodonetsk today to try and get full control of the city and create the conditions to surround Ukrainian units. In a Facebook update, Ukraine's General Staff said: ""The fighting continues. The enemy fired artillery in the area of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Ustynivka, Toshkivka, Zolote and Hirske."" And the Russian military is preparing to resume its offensive on the city of Slovyansk, also in the Donetsk region, the report said. Read more on the battle for Severodonetsk BBC World News We've got some more reaction to the death sentences given to three men who were fighting for the Ukrainian military against Russian forces. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK said the ""harsh"" sentence of capital punishment did not exist in his country. Speaking on BBC World News, Vadym Prystaiko said there were continuing discussions about prisoner swaps and the release of soldiers. Mr Prystaiko said he was in ""constant contact"" with the families of the two Britons captured by Russian forces and urged them to ""trust"" in Ukraine's ability to negotiate. The men were sentenced to death by a court in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic which is not recognised internationally. Discussing the reported suffering in Mariupol, he explained his fears that the ""situation
is not going to get easier"" as temperatures increase. Ukraine needs a combination of political, military and financial support to rebuild the country, he added. Ukraine has sown 13.4 million hectares with key agricultural crops this spring, which is 93% of its target for the season, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports, citing the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food. As we've been reporting regularly in recent days, Ukraine is one of the world's key food producers and there have been fears disruption to its industry couldaffect people around the world, with the UN among those warning of the danger of widespread hunger. But Interfax reports that farmers have been able to sow more than 90% of the planned spring target for several main crops, including sunflowers, corn, barley, oats and potatoes, while it has met its target for spring wheat. Harvesting of winter crops in some regions is expected to begin next week, it says. Earlier, Rostyslav Shurma, a deputy head of the President's Office, said Ukraine's goal in 2022 was to harvest at least 70% of last year's volumes. The Russian government is spending $17 million (Â£13 million) on national flags and coats of arms to feature in a weekly patriotic ceremony in rural schools across the nation. This is part of a patriotic push coinciding with the invasion of Ukraine, The Moscow Times reports. From September, every Monday morning, schools will raise the flag and perform the national anthem aimed at boosting ""civic consciousness"", Education Minister Sergei Kravtsov said. The education ministry is already planning to introduce compulsory history lessons from age seven, but only where Russians are shown as the good guys. Some journalists have noted that the money is being spent despite the fact that more than 5,000 Russian schools lack indoor plumbing. Liz Truss has spoken with Dmytro Kuleba before, including at this meeting in Warsaw, Poland, in April Earlier we brought you the news thatthe UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss had spoken with her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kulebaabout the death sentences given to three men - two Britons and one Moroccan - by a court in Donetsk. The three men had been members of Ukraine's military and were captured in April while defending the besieged city of Mariupol. Kulebahas now tweeted about the call,,externalsaying he and Truss ""coordinated efforts to step up pressure on Russia"". ""I look forward to the next round of UK sanctions,"" he said. ""We both agreed that no one in the world has a right to get weary of this war until Ukraine prevails."" And he added that both he and Truss ""strongly condemned the sham trial against prisoners of war in the Russian-occupied Donetsk. As combatants, they are protected by international humanitarian law and must be treated accordingly. We keep working together to ensure their release."" Earlier, Truss called the sentences ""an egregious breach of the Geneva Convention"". Shevchenko says his mother has been able to leave Ukraine for Italy but his sister is still in Kyiv Ukrainian football legend Andriy Shevchenko says President Volodymyr Zelensky is ""unbelievable"" and he is very proud of how his country and its people have been dealing with the war. Shevchecnko, who played for teams including Dynamo Kyiv, AC Milan and Chelsea, is Ukraine's record goalscorer and also managed the national team at last year's European Championship. He said on a recent visit to Kyiv he had a ""very nice meeting with the president"", and they were positive they could defend their country and bring peace to Ukraine. ""At the most difficult time in our the history of Ukraine he has brought people together and sent a great message across the world,"" he tells BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Ukraine's people must not give up, we want our democracy we fight for our freedom and that's a massive message to everyone. ""I'm so proud how my country and the people united to stay strong and defend the country."" This weekend Shevchenko will play inSoccer Aid,external- an annual football match involving former players and celebrities. It raises money for Unicef and this year the charity says some of the money raised will go towards helping those impacted by the war. ""This event is going to help a lot of people in Ukraine,"" he says, ""especially kids, we're going to create a lot of great programmes to improve a lot of things for kids.""

Its new Russian buyer has not yet revealed the name of the chain, although the logo has been revealed Aiden Aslin, left, Shaun Pinner, right, and Brahim Saaudun, centre, have been sentenced to death Amnesty International says that three foreign soldiers sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court is a situation that ""has no precedent"". Two Britons, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, and Moroccan national Brahim Saaudun were captured by Russian troops while fighting for Ukraine. All three were convicted by a court which is not internationally recognised in the pro-Russian, so-called Donetsk People's Republic. ""The party which holds full responsibility over these individualsâ circumstances and fate at present, is Russia,"" Denis Krivosheev, from Amnesty International's Eastern Europe and Central Asia office, told Reuters. ""This situation has no precedent. This so-called Donetsk Peopleâs Republic has a so-called criminal code in which it has a so-called death penalty, which this time, and this hasnât happened before, they are applying to prisoners of war,"" he said. Krivosheev said he was concerned this could lead to similar cases. ""Could this happen again? Absolutely."" Chris PartridgeBBC News This video can not be played Low-flying Ukrainian jet skims above trees Ukraine
is an extreme hostile environment for fighter pilots, whether they be Russian
or Ukrainian. Surface-to-air
missile systems cover the skies, ranging from shoulder-launched ""Stinger"" MANPADS to advanced S-300 and S-400 long-range SAMs. Aircraft
carrying out ground attack roles include the Su-25 ""Frogfoot"", a plane thatâs
being used by both sides in this war. Because
of the SAM threat, pilots often fly low and fast to avoid the threat posed by those missile systems. And
one example thatâs appeared on social media shows the lengths - or rather low
heights - Ukrainian pilots are going to avoid being shot down. At one point - at the start of the video - we see that the instrument used to detect radar-guided attacks is activated. This equipment - radar warning receiver - is located on the front panel on the right. It shows, for a brief moment, a missile being launched at the aircraft itself, as shown by the illuminated red area in this image. Itâs likely the speed and low height of the Su-25 allowed it to quickly escape the missile threat, as the RWR alert soon disappears. Similar very low-level runs have been carried out by Russian pilots, such is the strength â and threat - of air defences on both sides in this conflict. A radar warning receiver shows a red light that means a missile is launched at the aircraft itself Ukraine has conducted its 11th prisoner swap with Russia since the invasion began in February, according to a regional governor. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, wrote on the messaging service Telegram that four Russian captives were exchanged for five Ukrainians today. Zelensky spoke at an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union Back to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - who is now taking questions from UK university students. The first comes from the University of Birmingham where the president is asked about the plan to rebuild Ukraine. Zelensky says it will be a ""big project"" that will become ""unstoppable"" once it starts. ""It's all about rebuilding our country, it's all about restarting Ukraine,"" he says. ""I want the people to return to their native streets, their native cities, but that would be a different Ukraine, a Ukraine that has defended its independence, its future and I want this future to be mentally different."" He adds: ""Of course I want to say that we would be able to reconstruct all our buildings but that would depend not only on our wishes but on the financial support."" A question comes in from the University of Glasgow. The president is asked what the government's approach is to the Ukrainian universities in the areas now occupied by Russia. Zelensky says the situation is a ""real tragedy"" and he says they are proposing relocating some universities to the existing universities in the territories that are not occupied. Brits Aiden Aslin, Shaun Pinner and Moroccan Brahim Saadoun were all sentenced to death Thanks for joining us this afternoon - here's the latest on what's been happening in Ukraine: Russia defends death sentences for captured Britons  UK's defence secretary visits Ukraine  Cholera in Mariupol  How long will the war last?  Stay with us for the latest developments as they unfold. Volodymyr Zelensky Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has been speaking to students across the UK in a live broadcast to several universities. The eventhas been organised by the Ukrainian Students Unionand universities taking part include Birmingham, Cambridge, Coventry, Glasgow, LSE, Manchester, Oxford, UCL and City, University of London. Zelensky tells them it's now 107 days since the war began, adding: ""107 days we have been tested for survival"". ""This war is visible and monstrous,"" he says, adding that the Russians ""talk about peaceful goals but... they're killing children and women."" Zelensky speaks about history, and picks out some historical events from the UK cities where the universities are based. ""The [Russian] mission is to delete our
history, our state, our identity, and to deny our existence. And as such to
tell the world that we never existed that we are an artificially created people
like a variety of some kind of plants or animals."" State-owned Russian news channel RT France has gone to a European court to challenge a broadcast ban imposed as part of EU sanctions imposed on Moscow for waging war on Ukraine. Russian media outlets Sputnik and RT have been banned in the EU since 2 March. Both were accused of spreading disinformation. But lawyers for RT France went to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg on Friday to argue that the ban infringed on freedom of information laws. Lawyer Emmanuel Piwnica said the European Council, the body that represents EU member state governments, had ""no right to silence a European medium"". A council representative said that the ban was necessary to protect public order from RT's ""undeniably propagandistic discourse"". A decision will be made later this year. RT had its licence to broadcast in the UK revoked in March. Navtej JohalReporting from Coventry The
venue where Volodymyr Zelensky will be speaking to students at Coventry
University usually hosts cinema nights - but this evening it will be the
Ukrainian president's face on the big screen. Only 75 tickets were made available
for the event, and they were snapped up within hours. The first few
students have started arriving and there are a few Ukrainian flags draped on
the front row. Pavel Pimkin The president of the universityâs Ukraine Society is Pavel Pimkin, 20, whose male relatives are still in his home country. He says heâs feeling âhonoured and nervousâ about asking his nationâs president a question later. The address will also be shown at other British universities that have Ukrainian societies.

""Ukraine's people must not give up, we want our democracy we fight for our freedom and that's a massive message to everyone.

Two Britons, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, and Moroccan national Brahim Saaudun were captured by Russian troops while fighting for Ukraine. All three were convicted by a court which is not internationally recognised in the pro-Russian, so-called Donetsk People's Republic. ""The party which holds full responsibility over these individualsâ circumstances and fate at present, is Russia,"" Denis Krivosheev, from Amnesty International's Eastern Europe and Central Asia office, told Reuters. ""This situation has no precedent. This so-called Donetsk Peopleâs Republic has a so-called criminal code in which it has a so-called death penalty, which this time, and this hasnât happened before, they are applying to prisoners of war,"" he said. Krivosheev said he was concerned this could lead to similar cases. ""Could this happen again? Absolutely.""

is an extreme hostile environment for fighter pilots, whether they be Russian
or Ukrainian. Surface-to-air
missile systems cover the skies, ranging from shoulder-launched ""Stinger"" MANPADS to advanced S-300 and S-400 long-range SAMs. Aircraft
carrying out ground attack roles include the Su-25 ""Frogfoot"", a plane thatâs
being used by both sides in this war. Because
of the SAM threat, pilots often fly low and fast to avoid the threat posed by those missile systems. And
one example thatâs appeared on social media shows the lengths - or rather low
heights - Ukrainian pilots are going to avoid being shot down. At one point - at the start of the video - we see that the instrument used to detect radar-guided attacks is activated. This equipment - radar warning receiver - is located on the front panel on the right. It shows, for a brief moment, a missile being launched at the aircraft itself, as shown by the illuminated red area in this image. Itâs likely the speed and low height of the Su-25 allowed it to quickly escape the missile threat, as the RWR alert soon disappears. Similar very low-level runs have been carried out by Russian pilots, such is the strength â and threat - of air defences on both sides in this conflict. A radar warning receiver shows a red light that means a missile is launched at the aircraft itself Ukraine has conducted its 11th prisoner swap with Russia since the invasion began in February, according to a regional governor. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, wrote on the messaging service Telegram that four Russian captives were exchanged for five Ukrainians today. Zelensky spoke at an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union Back to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - who is now taking questions from UK university students. The first comes from the University of Birmingham where the president is asked about the plan to rebuild Ukraine. Zelensky says it will be a ""big project"" that will become ""unstoppable"" once it starts. ""It's all about rebuilding our country, it's all about restarting Ukraine,"" he says. ""I want the people to return to their native streets, their native cities, but that would be a different Ukraine, a Ukraine that has defended its independence, its future and I want this future to be mentally different."" He adds: ""Of course I want to say that we would be able to reconstruct all our buildings but that would depend not only on our wishes but on the financial support."" A question comes in from the University of Glasgow. The president is asked what the government's approach is to the Ukrainian universities in the areas now occupied by Russia. Zelensky says the situation is a ""real tragedy"" and he says they are proposing relocating some universities to the existing universities in the territories that are not occupied.

The eventhas been organised by the Ukrainian Students Unionand universities taking part include Birmingham, Cambridge, Coventry, Glasgow, LSE, Manchester, Oxford, UCL and City, University of London. Zelensky tells them it's now 107 days since the war began, adding: ""107 days we have been tested for survival"". ""This war is visible and monstrous,"" he says, adding that the Russians ""talk about peaceful goals but... they're killing children and women."" Zelensky speaks about history, and picks out some historical events from the UK cities where the universities are based. ""The [Russian] mission is to delete our
history, our state, our identity, and to deny our existence. And as such to
tell the world that we never existed that we are an artificially created people
like a variety of some kind of plants or animals."" State-owned Russian news channel RT France has gone to a European court to challenge a broadcast ban imposed as part of EU sanctions imposed on Moscow for waging war on Ukraine. Russian media outlets Sputnik and RT have been banned in the EU since 2 March. Both were accused of spreading disinformation. But lawyers for RT France went to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg on Friday to argue that the ban infringed on freedom of information laws. Lawyer Emmanuel Piwnica said the European Council, the body that represents EU member state governments, had ""no right to silence a European medium"". A council representative said that the ban was necessary to protect public order from RT's ""undeniably propagandistic discourse"". A decision will be made later this year. RT had its licence to broadcast in the UK revoked in March. Navtej JohalReporting from Coventry The
venue where Volodymyr Zelensky will be speaking to students at Coventry
University usually hosts cinema nights - but this evening it will be the
Ukrainian president's face on the big screen. Only 75 tickets were made available
for the event, and they were snapped up within hours. The first few
students have started arriving and there are a few Ukrainian flags draped on
the front row. Pavel Pimkin The president of the universityâs Ukraine Society is Pavel Pimkin, 20, whose male relatives are still in his home country. He says heâs feeling âhonoured and nervousâ about asking his nationâs president a question later. The address will also be shown at other British universities that have Ukrainian societies.

"The 340-year-old Gloucester warship was discovered after a cannon was spotted by divers on the seabed The discovery of a shipwrecked warship that sank while carrying a future king has been hailed the most important maritime find since the Mary Rose. The Gloucester ran aground off the coast of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, in 1682, nearly killing the Duke of York, who became King James II of England. The find, which was discovered by divers in 2007, has only just been revealed due to security reasons. Maritime expert Prof Claire Jowitt said it was of ""international importance"". The Gloucester's exact whereabouts were a mystery until it was discovered 15 years ago half-buried in the seabed 28 miles (45km) out to sea, having sunk while navigating treacherous sandbanks. The disaster, in which hundreds of passengers and crew died, threatened to change the course of history. However, the then Duke of York fled the sinking ship with moments to spare and went on to become the Catholic heir to the Protestant throne in an era marked by religious and political unrest. Diarist and naval administrator Samuel Pepys witnessed the Gloucester's sinking Prof Jowitt, an authority on maritime cultural history and based at Norwich's University of East Anglia (UEA), said: ""Because of the circumstances of its sinking, this can be claimed as the single most significant historic maritime discovery since theraising of the Mary Rose in 1982,external. ""The discovery promises to fundamentally change understanding of 17th Century social, maritime and political history. ""It is an outstanding example of underwater cultural heritage of national and international importance... the full story of the Gloucester's last voyage and the impact of its aftermath needs re-telling."" Prof Claire Jowitt said the find was the most important maritime discovery since the Mary Rose in 1982 Norfolk-based printer brothers Julian and Lincoln Barnwell, together with their late father, friend James Little and another unnamed friend, spent four years on diving expeditions to find the Gloucester's watery grave. Lincoln said he was inspired by memories of the Mary Rose's lifting, but the team was feeling defeated when he eventually spotted a large cannon on the seabed. Listen: The Norfolk men who found HMS Gloucester ""It was awe-inspiring and really beautiful,"" he said. ""It instantly felt like a privilege to be there, it was so exciting. ""We were the only people in the world at that moment in time who knew where the wreck lay - that was special and I'll never forget it."" This video can not be played Two divers say it was an ""absolute privilege"" to discover the warship His brother Julian said they initially had no idea how historically significant the Gloucester was. ""We had read the Duke of York was on board but that was it,"" he said. ""We were confident it was the Gloucester, but there are other wreck sites out there with cannons, so it still needed to be confirmed. ""There is still a huge amount of knowledge to be gained from the wreck, which will benefit Norfolk and the nation."" The ship's bell, made in 1681, was raised to the surface in 2012 and proved vital in successfully identifying the vessel Glasses found in the original case and dating back at least 340 years were among the finds at the underwater site Although the team discovered the 340-year-old shipwreck in 2007, it was not until the ship's bell was recovered in 2012 that the Receiver of Wreck and Ministry of Defence decisively identified it. Since then the ""at risk"" site -  in international waters - has had to be protected, which is why the discovery is only now being made public and its exact location undisclosed. Images reveal erosion of 'at risk' 1665 shipwreck Aerial photographs show 125-year-old shipwreck Indiana Jones fan may have found largest coin hoard A major exhibition is being planned to run from February to July 2023 at Norwich Castle Museum. An accompanying research project will also examine the circumstances of the tragedy and conspiracy theories. While the Gloucester was not a slave-trading ship, many people from diverse cultural backgrounds lost their lives and historians will make sure their stories are told, the UEA said. A wine bottle's seal shows the coat of arms of the Legge family, who were ancestors of George Washington Launched in 1654 with 54 guns and 280 crew, The Gloucester is the only surviving third-rate Cromwellian warship. It took part in multiple battles and became part of the Royal Navy fleet after 1660, when King Charles II was restored to the throne. The shipwreck is split down the keel, with remains of the hull submerged in sand, and it is not known how much of it is intact. There are no plans to raise any part of it. As well as the ship's bell, divers have found clothes, shoes, navigational equipment, personal possessions and unopened wine bottles. One of the wine bottles bears a glass seal with the coat of arms of the Legge family - ancestors of George Washington, the first US President. No human remains have been found so far - only animal bones. In a portrait from 1672, the Duke of York is depicted with the royal fleet. He was then Lord High Admiral to his older brother, King Charles II The Gloucester had set sail from Portsmouth to Edinburgh to allow the Duke of York to conduct royal business at the Scottish Parliament. It struck a sandbank during a strong gale 28 miles (45km) off Great Yarmouth on the morning of 6 May 1682 and sank within an hour. The Duke of York and John Churchill, the future Duke of Marlborough, were rescued in the ship's boat. While some of the estimated 330 people on board were rescued by boats from the fleet, it is believed between 130 and 250 sailors and passengers perished. Witnesses claimed the future King saved Catholic priests and his dogs over courtiers and crew, and, given that a royal had to leave a ship first, caused countless deaths by delaying his escape. He accepted no responsibility for the tragedy - despite arguing over the ship's course, as former Lord High Admiral - and blamed the pilot, who was later imprisoned. The diarist Samuel Pepys, who was travelling in the royal fleet, wrote that some survivors and victims were plucked ""half dead"" from the sea. This man - the illegitimate son of King Charles II - may have become King on his father's death, had the Duke of York perished at sea The Duke of York went on to become King James II of England and Ireland (and King James VII of Scotland) in 1685, on his brother's death. Had he drowned in 1682, King Charles II's illegitimate son, James Scott, the Duke of Monmouth, might well have inherited the throne. The reign of King James II - a Catholic - was marked by political and religious turmoil and he was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Some of those who took part had taken a dim view of the Duke over his actions on The Gloucester. The revolution created a new type of state, contributed greatly to the modern world and might not have happened had he died at sea, the UEA said. Alternatively, civil war might have ensued between those who supported the Duke of Monmouth against the claims of the Duke of York's legitimate daughter, Mary and her Dutch husband, William of Orange, it added.

"Oil refineries are making nearly five times as much money from refining petrol as they did year ago, data show. A lack of capacity to refine petrol and diesel from crude oil has helped to push fuel prices to record levels, and increased profits for refinery owners. Petrol prices are at an all-time high though the oil price remains well below record levels. The loss of Russian supplies has stretched an industry which was already at full capacity. Tuesday saw thefastest rise in petrol pricesfor 17 years, and the cost of filling a typical family car has nowpassed Â£100 for the first time, piling costs on motorists. On Thursday, the price of both petrol and diesel rose by nearly a penny a litre, the RAC said, with petrol at 183.16p a litre and diesel at 188.82p. Part of the increase is down to the high price of crude oil, which is currently above $120 per barrel, driven up by fears the war in Ukraine would cut access to supplies from Russia. That has led to billions of pounds of extra profit for oil producers, and led the UK government to impose aÂ£5bn windfall taxon North Sea oil producers. Fuel prices: Why is petrol so expensive in the UK? Fuel cost: How to save petrol and diesel But oil refiners - the companies which turn crude oil into diesel, petrol and other products - are seeing their profits rise substantially too. âThe refiners are printing money at the moment,â says Neil Crosby, senior analyst at the data firm OilX. âMore than they have ever witnessed.â Thereâs a shortage of refining capacity, which has led to substantial increase in the ""refining margin"" â the difference between what they pay for crude oil and what they can make selling the refined products. âThis is a real crunch in terms of the industryâs ability to produce these fuels. That very much turns up in the wholesale price of diesel and petrol,â says Mr Crosby. And that's contributed to the fact that although oil prices are still some way off record highs, petrol and diesel have been setting new records day after day. Figures from the data company Refinitiv show how the business of refining oil has become so profitable in the past year. On the 8 June 2021, refiners were making $9.26 per barrel from refining petrol, and $6.84 per barrel refining diesel. On Wednesday, they were making $43.11 on petrol, up 366%, and $51.13 on diesel, up 648%. Figures published by BP, which owns a number of refineries in Europe and the US, shows its own measure of refining profits, the âRefining Marker Marginâ, up from $7.7 dollars per barrel to $35.7 over the past year. US oil giant ExxonMobil owns a number of refineries, including Fawley in Hampshire, the UKâs largest. Last month the Financial Times quoted its chief executive Darren Woods as saying he did not think that the âvery, very high margin environmentâ was âgood for economies around the world.â A source close to a major refinery owner argued that the refiners donât set the margins themselves. Prices for crude oil, petrol and diesel are determined by the market - what supplies are available, and how much buyers will pay. Before the invasion of Ukraine, much of Europeâs petrol and diesel supply was made inRussian refineries and imported in tankers. In 2020 the UK received 18% of its diesel supply from Russia. Though that supply has not been cut off completely, the volumes coming from Russia are significantly lower as buyers shun Russian exports even before sanctions fully kick in. Fuel stocks were low before the invasion and there was already a global shortage of refining capacity. The sector has not been highly profitable in recent years and attracted little investment. So there was no slack to make up for lost Russian refining capacity. The worldwide lack of refining capability has contributed to high fuel prices in other countries, including the US. In addition, China has cut its exports of refined fuels. And although the UK doesnât import directly from China, this has a knock-on effect on the entire global market, Mr Crosby says.

Thanks for following and we'll be back tomorrow with more updates on the Ukraine war throughout the day. Today's live page was brought to you by: Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan, Rob Corp, Alex Therrien, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, James Clarke, James Harness, George Wright, Dulcie Lee, Charley Adams, Catherine Evans and Francesca Gillett. For around-up of the main Ukraine war headlines, head here -and for the latest on Mariupol,that's here. Ukrainian students Pavlo Denysenko and Snizhana Berezhna at Coventry University, one of the universities where Zelensky spoke to students over Zoom In case you missed it, here's a recap of the main headlines today: As we reported earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought tojustify Moscow's invasion of Ukraine by saying his country is trying to regain its ""original territories""- just as previous Russian ruler, Peter the Great did in the 18th century. In response, Estonia's foreign minister summoned the Russian ambassador to condemn Putin's ""completely unacceptable"" praise for the 18th century ruler. Speaking on Thursday, Putin specifically mentioned Narva, which belongs to Estonia, one of the three Baltic States and a member of Nato, Reuters reports. In a statement, Estonia's foreign minister, who summoned ambassador Vladimir Lipayev, said: ""At a time when Russia is... trying to destroy the statehood and people of Ukraine, it is also completely unacceptable."" Estonia was part of the Russian Empire for more than two centuries, only regaining independence in 1918 - before losing it to the Soviet Union until 1991. Zelensky addressed hundreds of students in the UK over a Zoom call Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to hundreds of university students across the UK earlier as part of an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union. The president gave a 15-minute opening speech over Zoom and then took questions, mostly focused on rebuilding Ukraine after the war. Here's what we learned:  More from the event here. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (left) with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he's asked Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic to join the European Union's sanctions on Russia. Serbia is not in the EU, though it has applied to join and is in talks. Scholz was in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, today to meet the country's President Aleksandar Vucic. Speaking at a news conference, Scholz said joining the sanctions made sense given Serbia aspired to join the 27-member bloc. But Vucic said the EU should consider the fact that Serbia and Russia had special relations that dated a long way back. Smoke over Severodonetsk this week We've been reporting on the situation in Severodonetsk in recent days - the city in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine which is currently seeing the worst of the fighting. According to the Ukrainian military, the Russians have continued assault operations in the area of Severodonetsk today to try and get full control of the city and create the conditions to surround Ukrainian units. In a Facebook update, Ukraine's General Staff said: ""The fighting continues. The enemy fired artillery in the area of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Ustynivka, Toshkivka, Zolote and Hirske."" And the Russian military is preparing to resume its offensive on the city of Slovyansk, also in the Donetsk region, the report said. Read more on the battle for Severodonetsk BBC World News We've got some more reaction to the death sentences given to three men who were fighting for the Ukrainian military against Russian forces. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK said the ""harsh"" sentence of capital punishment did not exist in his country. Speaking on BBC World News, Vadym Prystaiko said there were continuing discussions about prisoner swaps and the release of soldiers. Mr Prystaiko said he was in ""constant contact"" with the families of the two Britons captured by Russian forces and urged them to ""trust"" in Ukraine's ability to negotiate. The men were sentenced to death by a court in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic which is not recognised internationally. Discussing the reported suffering in Mariupol, he explained his fears that the ""situation
is not going to get easier"" as temperatures increase. Ukraine needs a combination of political, military and financial support to rebuild the country, he added. Ukraine has sown 13.4 million hectares with key agricultural crops this spring, which is 93% of its target for the season, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports, citing the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food. As we've been reporting regularly in recent days, Ukraine is one of the world's key food producers and there have been fears disruption to its industry couldaffect people around the world, with the UN among those warning of the danger of widespread hunger. But Interfax reports that farmers have been able to sow more than 90% of the planned spring target for several main crops, including sunflowers, corn, barley, oats and potatoes, while it has met its target for spring wheat. Harvesting of winter crops in some regions is expected to begin next week, it says. Earlier, Rostyslav Shurma, a deputy head of the President's Office, said Ukraine's goal in 2022 was to harvest at least 70% of last year's volumes. The Russian government is spending $17 million (Â£13 million) on national flags and coats of arms to feature in a weekly patriotic ceremony in rural schools across the nation. This is part of a patriotic push coinciding with the invasion of Ukraine, The Moscow Times reports. From September, every Monday morning, schools will raise the flag and perform the national anthem aimed at boosting ""civic consciousness"", Education Minister Sergei Kravtsov said. The education ministry is already planning to introduce compulsory history lessons from age seven, but only where Russians are shown as the good guys. Some journalists have noted that the money is being spent despite the fact that more than 5,000 Russian schools lack indoor plumbing. Liz Truss has spoken with Dmytro Kuleba before, including at this meeting in Warsaw, Poland, in April Earlier we brought you the news thatthe UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss had spoken with her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kulebaabout the death sentences given to three men - two Britons and one Moroccan - by a court in Donetsk.

Thanks for following and we'll be back tomorrow with more updates on the Ukraine war throughout the day. Today's live page was brought to you by: Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan, Rob Corp, Alex Therrien, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, James Clarke, James Harness, George Wright, Dulcie Lee, Charley Adams, Catherine Evans and Francesca Gillett. For around-up of the main Ukraine war headlines, head here -and for the latest on Mariupol,that's here. Ukrainian students Pavlo Denysenko and Snizhana Berezhna at Coventry University, one of the universities where Zelensky spoke to students over Zoom In case you missed it, here's a recap of the main headlines today: As we reported earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought tojustify Moscow's invasion of Ukraine by saying his country is trying to regain its ""original territories""- just as previous Russian ruler, Peter the Great did in the 18th century. In response, Estonia's foreign minister summoned the Russian ambassador to condemn Putin's ""completely unacceptable"" praise for the 18th century ruler. Speaking on Thursday, Putin specifically mentioned Narva, which belongs to Estonia, one of the three Baltic States and a member of Nato, Reuters reports. In a statement, Estonia's foreign minister, who summoned ambassador Vladimir Lipayev, said: ""At a time when Russia is... trying to destroy the statehood and people of Ukraine, it is also completely unacceptable."" Estonia was part of the Russian Empire for more than two centuries, only regaining independence in 1918 - before losing it to the Soviet Union until 1991. Zelensky addressed hundreds of students in the UK over a Zoom call Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to hundreds of university students across the UK earlier as part of an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union. The president gave a 15-minute opening speech over Zoom and then took questions, mostly focused on rebuilding Ukraine after the war. Here's what we learned:  More from the event here. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (left) with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he's asked Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic to join the European Union's sanctions on Russia. Serbia is not in the EU, though it has applied to join and is in talks. Scholz was in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, today to meet the country's President Aleksandar Vucic. Speaking at a news conference, Scholz said joining the sanctions made sense given Serbia aspired to join the 27-member bloc. But Vucic said the EU should consider the fact that Serbia and Russia had special relations that dated a long way back. Smoke over Severodonetsk this week We've been reporting on the situation in Severodonetsk in recent days - the city in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine which is currently seeing the worst of the fighting. According to the Ukrainian military, the Russians have continued assault operations in the area of Severodonetsk today to try and get full control of the city and create the conditions to surround Ukrainian units. In a Facebook update, Ukraine's General Staff said: ""The fighting continues. The enemy fired artillery in the area of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Ustynivka, Toshkivka, Zolote and Hirske."" And the Russian military is preparing to resume its offensive on the city of Slovyansk, also in the Donetsk region, the report said. Read more on the battle for Severodonetsk BBC World News We've got some more reaction to the death sentences given to three men who were fighting for the Ukrainian military against Russian forces. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK said the ""harsh"" sentence of capital punishment did not exist in his country. Speaking on BBC World News, Vadym Prystaiko said there were continuing discussions about prisoner swaps and the release of soldiers. Mr Prystaiko said he was in ""constant contact"" with the families of the two Britons captured by Russian forces and urged them to ""trust"" in Ukraine's ability to negotiate. The men were sentenced to death by a court in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic which is not recognised internationally. Discussing the reported suffering in Mariupol, he explained his fears that the ""situation
is not going to get easier"" as temperatures increase. Ukraine needs a combination of political, military and financial support to rebuild the country, he added. Ukraine has sown 13.4 million hectares with key agricultural crops this spring, which is 93% of its target for the season, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports, citing the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food. As we've been reporting regularly in recent days, Ukraine is one of the world's key food producers and there have been fears disruption to its industry couldaffect people around the world, with the UN among those warning of the danger of widespread hunger. But Interfax reports that farmers have been able to sow more than 90% of the planned spring target for several main crops, including sunflowers, corn, barley, oats and potatoes, while it has met its target for spring wheat. Harvesting of winter crops in some regions is expected to begin next week, it says. Earlier, Rostyslav Shurma, a deputy head of the President's Office, said Ukraine's goal in 2022 was to harvest at least 70% of last year's volumes. The Russian government is spending $17 million (Â£13 million) on national flags and coats of arms to feature in a weekly patriotic ceremony in rural schools across the nation. This is part of a patriotic push coinciding with the invasion of Ukraine, The Moscow Times reports. From September, every Monday morning, schools will raise the flag and perform the national anthem aimed at boosting ""civic consciousness"", Education Minister Sergei Kravtsov said. The education ministry is already planning to introduce compulsory history lessons from age seven, but only where Russians are shown as the good guys. Some journalists have noted that the money is being spent despite the fact that more than 5,000 Russian schools lack indoor plumbing.

"Oil refineries are making nearly five times as much money from refining petrol as they did year ago, data show. A lack of capacity to refine petrol and diesel from crude oil has helped to push fuel prices to record levels, and increased profits for refinery owners. Petrol prices are at an all-time high though the oil price remains well below record levels. The loss of Russian supplies has stretched an industry which was already at full capacity. Tuesday saw thefastest rise in petrol pricesfor 17 years, and the cost of filling a typical family car has nowpassed Â£100 for the first time, piling costs on motorists. On Thursday, the price of both petrol and diesel rose by nearly a penny a litre, the RAC said, with petrol at 183.16p a litre and diesel at 188.82p. Part of the increase is down to the high price of crude oil, which is currently above $120 per barrel, driven up by fears the war in Ukraine would cut access to supplies from Russia. That has led to billions of pounds of extra profit for oil producers, and led the UK government to impose aÂ£5bn windfall taxon North Sea oil producers. Fuel prices: Why is petrol so expensive in the UK? Fuel cost: How to save petrol and diesel But oil refiners - the companies which turn crude oil into diesel, petrol and other products - are seeing their profits rise substantially too. âThe refiners are printing money at the moment,â says Neil Crosby, senior analyst at the data firm OilX. âMore than they have ever witnessed.â Thereâs a shortage of refining capacity, which has led to substantial increase in the ""refining margin"" â the difference between what they pay for crude oil and what they can make selling the refined products. âThis is a real crunch in terms of the industryâs ability to produce these fuels. That very much turns up in the wholesale price of diesel and petrol,â says Mr Crosby. And that's contributed to the fact that although oil prices are still some way off record highs, petrol and diesel have been setting new records day after day. Figures from the data company Refinitiv show how the business of refining oil has become so profitable in the past year. On the 8 June 2021, refiners were making $9.26 per barrel from refining petrol, and $6.84 per barrel refining diesel. On Wednesday, they were making $43.11 on petrol, up 366%, and $51.13 on diesel, up 648%. Figures published by BP, which owns a number of refineries in Europe and the US, shows its own measure of refining profits, the âRefining Marker Marginâ, up from $7.7 dollars per barrel to $35.7 over the past year. US oil giant ExxonMobil owns a number of refineries, including Fawley in Hampshire, the UKâs largest. Last month the Financial Times quoted its chief executive Darren Woods as saying he did not think that the âvery, very high margin environmentâ was âgood for economies around the world.â A source close to a major refinery owner argued that the refiners donât set the margins themselves. Prices for crude oil, petrol and diesel are determined by the market - what supplies are available, and how much buyers will pay. Before the invasion of Ukraine, much of Europeâs petrol and diesel supply was made inRussian refineries and imported in tankers. In 2020 the UK received 18% of its diesel supply from Russia. Though that supply has not been cut off completely, the volumes coming from Russia are significantly lower as buyers shun Russian exports even before sanctions fully kick in. Fuel stocks were low before the invasion and there was already a global shortage of refining capacity. The sector has not been highly profitable in recent years and attracted little investment. So there was no slack to make up for lost Russian refining capacity. The worldwide lack of refining capability has contributed to high fuel prices in other countries, including the US. In addition, China has cut its exports of refined fuels. And although the UK doesnât import directly from China, this has a knock-on effect on the entire global market, Mr Crosby says.

Smoke over Severodonetsk this week We've been reporting on the situation in Severodonetsk in recent days - the city in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine which is currently seeing the worst of the fighting. According to the Ukrainian military, the Russians have continued assault operations in the area of Severodonetsk today to try and get full control of the city and create the conditions to surround Ukrainian units. In a Facebook update, Ukraine's General Staff said: ""The fighting continues. The enemy fired artillery in the area of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Ustynivka, Toshkivka, Zolote and Hirske."" And the Russian military is preparing to resume its offensive on the city of Slovyansk, also in the Donetsk region, the report said. Read more on the battle for Severodonetsk BBC World News We've got some more reaction to the death sentences given to three men who were fighting for the Ukrainian military against Russian forces. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK said the ""harsh"" sentence of capital punishment did not exist in his country. Speaking on BBC World News, Vadym Prystaiko said there were continuing discussions about prisoner swaps and the release of soldiers. Mr Prystaiko said he was in ""constant contact"" with the families of the two Britons captured by Russian forces and urged them to ""trust"" in Ukraine's ability to negotiate. The men were sentenced to death by a court in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic which is not recognised internationally. Discussing the reported suffering in Mariupol, he explained his fears that the ""situation
is not going to get easier"" as temperatures increase. Ukraine needs a combination of political, military and financial support to rebuild the country, he added. Ukraine has sown 13.4 million hectares with key agricultural crops this spring, which is 93% of its target for the season, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports, citing the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food. As we've been reporting regularly in recent days, Ukraine is one of the world's key food producers and there have been fears disruption to its industry couldaffect people around the world, with the UN among those warning of the danger of widespread hunger. But Interfax reports that farmers have been able to sow more than 90% of the planned spring target for several main crops, including sunflowers, corn, barley, oats and potatoes, while it has met its target for spring wheat. Harvesting of winter crops in some regions is expected to begin next week, it says. Earlier, Rostyslav Shurma, a deputy head of the President's Office, said Ukraine's goal in 2022 was to harvest at least 70% of last year's volumes. The Russian government is spending $17 million (Â£13 million) on national flags and coats of arms to feature in a weekly patriotic ceremony in rural schools across the nation. This is part of a patriotic push coinciding with the invasion of Ukraine, The Moscow Times reports. From September, every Monday morning, schools will raise the flag and perform the national anthem aimed at boosting ""civic consciousness"", Education Minister Sergei Kravtsov said. The education ministry is already planning to introduce compulsory history lessons from age seven, but only where Russians are shown as the good guys. Some journalists have noted that the money is being spent despite the fact that more than 5,000 Russian schools lack indoor plumbing.

For around-up of the main Ukraine war headlines, head here -and for the latest on Mariupol,that's here. Ukrainian students Pavlo Denysenko and Snizhana Berezhna at Coventry University, one of the universities where Zelensky spoke to students over Zoom In case you missed it, here's a recap of the main headlines today: As we reported earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought tojustify Moscow's invasion of Ukraine by saying his country is trying to regain its ""original territories""- just as previous Russian ruler, Peter the Great did in the 18th century. In response, Estonia's foreign minister summoned the Russian ambassador to condemn Putin's ""completely unacceptable"" praise for the 18th century ruler. Speaking on Thursday, Putin specifically mentioned Narva, which belongs to Estonia, one of the three Baltic States and a member of Nato, Reuters reports. In a statement, Estonia's foreign minister, who summoned ambassador Vladimir Lipayev, said: ""At a time when Russia is... trying to destroy the statehood and people of Ukraine, it is also completely unacceptable."" Estonia was part of the Russian Empire for more than two centuries, only regaining independence in 1918 - before losing it to the Soviet Union until 1991. Zelensky addressed hundreds of students in the UK over a Zoom call Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to hundreds of university students across the UK earlier as part of an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union. The president gave a 15-minute opening speech over Zoom and then took questions, mostly focused on rebuilding Ukraine after the war. Here's what we learned:  More from the event here. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (left) with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he's asked Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic to join the European Union's sanctions on Russia. Serbia is not in the EU, though it has applied to join and is in talks. Scholz was in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, today to meet the country's President Aleksandar Vucic. Speaking at a news conference, Scholz said joining the sanctions made sense given Serbia aspired to join the 27-member bloc.

"Rishi Sunak has been accused of failing to act to save billions of taxpayers' money that has been used to pay interest on government debt. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank said the losses were due to the Treasury failing to insure against interest rate rises. It meant higher than necessary payments on Â£900bn of reserves created through the quantitative easing (QE) programme. The Treasury said it was the Bank of England's role to decide QE measures. The Bank of England is independent from the Treasury. The Treasury said NIESR's proposal would undermine this independence and be ""hugely damaging"" to the credibility of how public finances were managed. ""Proposals such as this risk undermining the independence of the Bank of England and forcing commercial banks to swap reserves for gilts would be an act of financial repression,"" a Treasury spokesperson said. NIESR's Prof Jagjit Chadha,told the Financial Times,externalthat Mr Sunak's failure to act had left the country with ""an enormous bill and heavy continuing exposure to interest rate risk"". The Bank of England created Â£895bn of moneythrough quantitative easing. Most of this was used to buy government bonds from pension funds and other investors. When those investors put the proceeds in commercial bank deposits at the Bank, it had to pay interest at its official interest rate. Last year, when the official rate was still 0.1%, NIESR said the government should have insured the cost of servicing this debt against the risk of rising interest rates. It said interest payments have ""now become much more expensive"" and it estimatesthe loss over the past year at around Â£11bn,external. ""Such a lost opportunity is an unnecessary cost to the public finances at a very difficult time,"" the think tank said. It suggested converting the debt into government bonds with longer to pay it back. ""It would have been much better to have reduced the scale of short-term liabilities earlier, as we have argued for some time, and to exploit the benefits of longer-term debt issuance. This is very much a question for the Treasury to answer,"" said Prof Chadha. The Treasury said it would not have been commercially viable to convert such a high level of debt. ""The Â£11bn figure is based on the implausible assumption that it would be possible to undertake action of this scale in a single transaction,"" it added. While there never was a single moment where the Treasury made a decision that cost the nation Â£11bn, the analysis from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research does point to some costly missed opportunities. Early last year the Treasury itself was pointing towards the shortening maturity of our national debt as a by-product of the pandemic expansion of borrowing and the Bank of England's QE policy.  The UK has for the past two decades had, by international standards, many more years to repay its loans from the markets, but that was no longer the case. The Treasury was trying to explain why despite the UK borrowing record sums, interest costs were at record lows. So a question arose - why don't they do something about it and lock-in then rock bottom interest rates for many years? It was suggested by NIESR, by Policy Exchange, by Boris Johnson's former economic adviser Gerard Lyons, among others. The Treasury's answer is that to have done so would have interfered with the Bank of England's independence over its QE programme of buying bonds, and that it would have been commercially unviable to refinance Â£600bn of debt in the markets in one go. In addition, though we all know now that there has been a material rise in interest rates, back then, it would have been a bet. In short, they say, they could not have done the transaction that would have ""saved Â£11bn"", and with the benefit of hindsight they might also have put money into gas futures or the used car market and ""saved"" many tens of billions more. But the wider point does raise questions about missed opportunities. And as we enter a new era of rising interest rates, and the reversal of QE, or Quantitative Tightening, many of the fuzzy accounting questions over government debts could have a rather material impact on the economic numbers. Gerard Lyons, the former chief economic adviser to Boris Johnson when the prime minister was Mayor of London, tweeted that the issue was ""all too predictable"". Dr Lyons, now a senior fellow at the Policy Exchange think tank, said the ""UK should've locked into low rates, borrowing more longer dated debt and not over reliance on QE to fund the deficit"". But Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon, tweeted that the ""Â£11bn 'cost' should really be set against the Â£120bn 'benefit' that the QE process has so far yielded for the Exchequer"". ""To be fair to NIESR in their paper of last year they do acknowledge this - but this seems to have been drowned out today.""

"Rishi Sunak has been accused of failing to act to save billions of taxpayers' money that has been used to pay interest on government debt. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank said the losses were due to the Treasury failing to insure against interest rate rises. It meant higher than necessary payments on Â£900bn of reserves created through the quantitative easing (QE) programme. The Treasury said it was the Bank of England's role to decide QE measures. The Bank of England is independent from the Treasury. The Treasury said NIESR's proposal would undermine this independence and be ""hugely damaging"" to the credibility of how public finances were managed. ""Proposals such as this risk undermining the independence of the Bank of England and forcing commercial banks to swap reserves for gilts would be an act of financial repression,"" a Treasury spokesperson said. NIESR's Prof Jagjit Chadha,told the Financial Times,externalthat Mr Sunak's failure to act had left the country with ""an enormous bill and heavy continuing exposure to interest rate risk"". The Bank of England created Â£895bn of moneythrough quantitative easing. Most of this was used to buy government bonds from pension funds and other investors. When those investors put the proceeds in commercial bank deposits at the Bank, it had to pay interest at its official interest rate. Last year, when the official rate was still 0.1%, NIESR said the government should have insured the cost of servicing this debt against the risk of rising interest rates. It said interest payments have ""now become much more expensive"" and it estimatesthe loss over the past year at around Â£11bn,external. ""Such a lost opportunity is an unnecessary cost to the public finances at a very difficult time,"" the think tank said. It suggested converting the debt into government bonds with longer to pay it back. ""It would have been much better to have reduced the scale of short-term liabilities earlier, as we have argued for some time, and to exploit the benefits of longer-term debt issuance. This is very much a question for the Treasury to answer,"" said Prof Chadha. The Treasury said it would not have been commercially viable to convert such a high level of debt. ""The Â£11bn figure is based on the implausible assumption that it would be possible to undertake action of this scale in a single transaction,"" it added. While there never was a single moment where the Treasury made a decision that cost the nation Â£11bn, the analysis from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research does point to some costly missed opportunities. Early last year the Treasury itself was pointing towards the shortening maturity of our national debt as a by-product of the pandemic expansion of borrowing and the Bank of England's QE policy.  The UK has for the past two decades had, by international standards, many more years to repay its loans from the markets, but that was no longer the case. The Treasury was trying to explain why despite the UK borrowing record sums, interest costs were at record lows. So a question arose - why don't they do something about it and lock-in then rock bottom interest rates for many years? It was suggested by NIESR, by Policy Exchange, by Boris Johnson's former economic adviser Gerard Lyons, among others. The Treasury's answer is that to have done so would have interfered with the Bank of England's independence over its QE programme of buying bonds, and that it would have been commercially unviable to refinance Â£600bn of debt in the markets in one go. In addition, though we all know now that there has been a material rise in interest rates, back then, it would have been a bet. In short, they say, they could not have done the transaction that would have ""saved Â£11bn"", and with the benefit of hindsight they might also have put money into gas futures or the used car market and ""saved"" many tens of billions more. But the wider point does raise questions about missed opportunities. And as we enter a new era of rising interest rates, and the reversal of QE, or Quantitative Tightening, many of the fuzzy accounting questions over government debts could have a rather material impact on the economic numbers. Gerard Lyons, the former chief economic adviser to Boris Johnson when the prime minister was Mayor of London, tweeted that the issue was ""all too predictable"". Dr Lyons, now a senior fellow at the Policy Exchange think tank, said the ""UK should've locked into low rates, borrowing more longer dated debt and not over reliance on QE to fund the deficit"". But Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon, tweeted that the ""Â£11bn 'cost' should really be set against the Â£120bn 'benefit' that the QE process has so far yielded for the Exchequer"". ""To be fair to NIESR in their paper of last year they do acknowledge this - but this seems to have been drowned out today."" Labour's shadow treasury minister Tulip Siddiq said: ""These are astronomical sums for the chancellor to lose, and leaves working people picking up the cheque for his severe wastefulness while he hikes their taxes in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis.

"Some items listed as bovine bone appear to be tusks and are advertised for thousands of pounds Sellers are flouting eBay's self-imposed ban on the sale of elephant ivory by listing it under pseudonyms. An investigation by the BBC and legal experts found ivory objects were often listed as ""bovine bone"". We bought three such items on eBay UK and tested them in an independent lab. Two were confirmed to be made of ivory. An analysis by ivory trade experts also indicated that thousands of elephant ivory objects have been sold on the site since the company banned its sale. The investigation was started in 2018 by Dr Caroline Cox at the University of Portsmouth. She and other ivory trade experts say  online trade is continuing despite a new UK-wide ban on the sale of ivory, which came into force on 6 June. This video can not be played How to spot ivory: Watch experts show BBC Science Correspondent Victoria Gill how to identify ivory listed for sale online It is more than 10 years sinceeBay announced its own complete, worldwide ban on ivory sales,external. An online post stated that the global ban would ""protect buyers and sellers, as well as animals in danger of extinction"". In 2018 Dr Cox and her team carried out a three month online study, tracking ""bovine bone"" as a sale category on eBay's UK site. The team tracked 632 pieces of bovine bone that were sold on eBay UK; more than 500 of those were determined to be ivory. For this online forensic study, Dr Cox explained, she was able to use pictures and information in listings that provide buyers - and investigators - with clear evidence of what the objects are actually made of. ""Ivory has a distinct, creamy colour,"" she explained. ""And a listing will often mention the weight of the item being sold - very accurately and specifically - because that's the measure of ivory's value."" Tell-tale 'Schreger lines' are the growth lines of a tusk that can be seen in carved ivory, seen here in this piece recently listed for sale on eBay The key piece of evidence is in the image of an object. Carved ivory has distinct and visible growth lines called Schreger lines, which you can think of as tree rings, but for teeth and tusks. ""These are unique to ivory,"" said Dr Cox. Investigators and law enforcement officers have long employed these visual techniques to identify illegal ivory, both in seizures of the material and when they are investigating the online trade. BBC News bought three objects listed on eBay as bovine bone to have tested in an independent lab. We bought and tested an ornament that was listed on eBay as 'bovine bone' Of three items we bought, a small, carved African head ornament, a bracelet and a set of figurines, two were chemically confirmed by scientists in the Oxford University School of Archaeology to be made of elephant tusk. Poaching drives elephants closer to the brink Vaccine trial for killer elephant virus begins Why scientists are freezing threatened species A bovine bone bracelet we bought for Â£25 was confirmed to be elephant tusk In a statement responding to the BBC's findings, eBay said that it had been working to tackle the illegal trade in elephant ivory for nearly a decade. ""We blocked or removed over 265,000 listings prohibited under our animal products policy in a recent two-year period,"" a spokesperson told BBC News in an email. ""Our proactive approach means that illicit ivory sellers are forced to use obscure 'code words' [for items] which very rarely - if at all - get sold, because buyers can't find them."" The ivory trade experts who started this investigation pointed out that they tracked 500 eBay sales of ivory to completion over just three months in 2018. And the same code words or pseudonyms, primarily ""bovine bone"", were used repeatedly. Laws on the ivory trade differ from country to country. On Monday, the UK brought into force what it called ""one the toughest bans on elephant ivory sales in the world"". From 6 June, trade in elephant teeth and tusks is illegal in the UK, punishable by fines of up to Â£250,000 or up to five years in prison. EBay is not the only online platform that wildlife traders have exploited. During our investigation of the pet trade in endangered apes back in 2017, we found animals beingadvertised on Instagram, in posts that the company subsequently removed. And in April of this year, researchers from a conservation campaign group called Avaaz published a report citing""129 pieces of potentially harmful wildlife trafficking content"" posted on Facebook,external,"" including posts selling or seeking cheetahs, monkeys, pangolins and pangolin scales, lion cubs, elephant tusks, and rhino horn. In response to the report, Facebook's parent company Meta said: ""We prohibit the trading of endangered wildlife or their parts. Meta is a dedicated member of theCoalition to End Wildlife Trafficking Online.,external"" John Scanlon, CEO of the Elephant Protection Initiative Foundation, said that these online platforms had ""enormous reach and impact"". ""If they are not carefully policed, they are an efficient vehicle for criminals to sell illicit goods in any country,"" he said. ""So it's deeply troubling when an online platform makes big commitments about policing trade, but then fails to deliver."" ""The international community has made great progress at closing down legal ivory markets in recent years, of which the new UK legislation is just the latest example. But this progress risks being seriously undermined by leakages online."" Conservationists point out though that threats to Africa's elephants are changing. There are now just over 400,000 elephants across the African continent ""Organised ivory poaching remains a threat in some regions, especially in central Africa, but has been much reduced in parts of eastern and southern Africa,"" said Mr Scanlon. ""We believe that the biggest emerging threat comes from the increasing competition between growing human populations and elephants for land and resources, especially as the impact of climate change is beginning to be felt."" Dr Cox and other wildlife trade experts are concerned though that, as national legislation is tightened, more products like ivory could move online, especially if platforms are not policed. ""Sites like eBay operate by allowing millions of sellers all around the world to advertise across international borders,"" Dr Cox pointed out. She added that the company's failure to enforce its ban on the trade in ivory provided a safe space for a trade that threatened wildlife.

"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer opposes law to change Northern Ireland Protocol Proposed legislation to disapply part of the Northern Ireland Protocol is not the way forward, Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer has said. Sir Keir accepted there were practical problems with the protocol but said he thought they could be fixed through negotiations, ""guile and hard work"". The protocol legislation is expected to be published on Monday. Sir Keir made the comments in an interview with the BBC after meeting the SDLP and Alliance on Friday. Unionist parties oppose the Northern Ireland Protocol and say it diminishes their Britishness. A row over its impact has created a block on forming a devolved government in Northern Ireland, with the DUP blocking the establishment of the assembly since Sinn FÃ©in emerged as the largest party in last month's election Sir Keir said the planned government legislation would breach international law and that he would scrap it if he became prime minister. ""I also think it will be an impediment to the negotiations,"" he said. Sir Keir Starmer and Shadow Secretary of State Peter Kyle talk to assembly speaker Alex Maskey at Stormont Sir Keir said he believed there was scope for a veterinary agreement that would potentially resolve a ""high percentage"" of the issues in the protocol. He added: ""When I think of all the issues, all the challenges that have been overcome in the last 20 years I don't think that the remaining issues of the protocol are incapable of resolution."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it was refreshing to have a ""grown-up in leadership in London engaging properly with political parties here and with the Irish government."" ""It's what's been missing, frankly, from this British government over the past number of years. What we've seen from Boris Johnson has been unilateral action on legacy,"" he added. ""Now, on Monday, we're going to see unilateral action on the protocol, having had no conversations with parties here, no conversations with the Irish government, and just taking a wrecking ball to the progress that we've had."" Alliance leader Naomi Long said reform of the Stormont institutions was necessary to prevent single parties such as the DUP from being able to block the formation of a devolved executive. ""The issues with the protocol really do not justify the egregious breach of international law and international trust that the government are now embarking on via legislation basically at the behest of the DUP,"" she said. ""If the government wants to take some legislation forward so that these institutions here can be restored and that they can do that on a stable footing, they should be looking to reform these institutions in legislation to ensure that no party can hold the institutions to ransom going forward."" Sir Keir has also committed to voting against acontroversial legacy bill proposed by the governmentwhich has seen widespread opposition from local parties and victims' groups. Sir Keir Starmer arriving at Stormont on Friday morning A central element of the proposals involves immunity from prosecution for those who co-operate with investigations run by a new information recovery body. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Brexit and Northern Ireland: What does each side want? Fact-checking claims about Brexit and Northern Ireland The trade deal governs how goods enter Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and was agreed by the UK government and the European Union following the Brexit vote in 2019. It was designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland when the UK left the European Union. However, it led to new goods checks at Northern Ireland sea ports on some products from Great Britain, effectively creating a new trade border in the Irish Sea. Unionist parties, including the DUP, argue that this has led to extra costs and unnecessary delays, as well as undermining the union between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP, which has the second highest number of Stormont seats,has refused to support the election of a new speaker or first and deputy first ministeruntil there is ""action"" on the protocol. The BBC understands there is still some work being done on the legal text of the new protocol bill, which has yet to be signed off by ministers. Liz Truss is said to be keen for the legislation to get through the Commons before the summer recess. Meanwhile Conall Donnelly, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Meat Exporters Association (NIMEA) urged the UK government to ""not ignore the benefits of the protocol"". Mr Donnelly said its members were heavily dependent on trade from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, with Northern Ireland businesses annually importing about Â£200m in beef across the Irish Sea for further processing. He said the current trading arrangements were providing an effective and workable platform for trade and members of the association benefitted from unfettered trade with Great Britain and Europe. He argued the UK and EU should commit to agreed solutions rather than taking unilateral action which could potentially jeopardise jobs and business opportunities in Northern Ireland. ""We recognise that some aspects of the protocol need to be fixed, such as the facilitation of retail movements or certain food and farming issues but there are solutions to these issues, which can be jointly agreed through compromise, and it is essential that business is involved in that process to ensure that solutions are practical,"" he said.

But this progress risks being seriously undermined by leakages online."" Conservationists point out though that threats to Africa's elephants are changing. There are now just over 400,000 elephants across the African continent ""Organised ivory poaching remains a threat in some regions, especially in central Africa, but has been much reduced in parts of eastern and southern Africa,"" said Mr Scanlon. ""We believe that the biggest emerging threat comes from the increasing competition between growing human populations and elephants for land and resources, especially as the impact of climate change is beginning to be felt."" Dr Cox and other wildlife trade experts are concerned though that, as national legislation is tightened, more products like ivory could move online, especially if platforms are not policed. ""Sites like eBay operate by allowing millions of sellers all around the world to advertise across international borders,"" Dr Cox pointed out. She added that the company's failure to enforce its ban on the trade in ivory provided a safe space for a trade that threatened wildlife.

"Russia's foreign minister says three men sentenced to death - two Britons and one Moroccan - committed crimes in a breakaway Ukrainian region All three were convicted by a Russian proxy court in the so-called Donetsk People's Republic UK PM Boris Johnson urges ministers to do ""everything in their power"" to secure the release of the two Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner were fighting with the Ukrainian army and their sentencing is an ""egregious breach"" of the Geneva Conventions, the UK says Meanwhile, there's a risk of a major cholera outbreak in the occupied port city of Mariupol, the UK's Ministry of Defence says The exiled deputy mayor says the 100,000 people still in the city are at growing risk of disease Edited by Rob Corp We're pausing our live coverage now. Thanks for following and we'll be back tomorrow with more updates on the Ukraine war throughout the day. Today's live page was brought to you by: Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan, Rob Corp, Alex Therrien, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, James Clarke, James Harness, George Wright, Dulcie Lee, Charley Adams, Catherine Evans and Francesca Gillett. For around-up of the main Ukraine war headlines, head here -and for the latest on Mariupol,that's here. Ukrainian students Pavlo Denysenko and Snizhana Berezhna at Coventry University, one of the universities where Zelensky spoke to students over Zoom In case you missed it, here's a recap of the main headlines today: As we reported earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought tojustify Moscow's invasion of Ukraine by saying his country is trying to regain its ""original territories""- just as previous Russian ruler, Peter the Great did in the 18th century. In response, Estonia's foreign minister summoned the Russian ambassador to condemn Putin's ""completely unacceptable"" praise for the 18th century ruler. Speaking on Thursday, Putin specifically mentioned Narva, which belongs to Estonia, one of the three Baltic States and a member of Nato, Reuters reports. In a statement, Estonia's foreign minister, who summoned ambassador Vladimir Lipayev, said: ""At a time when Russia is... trying to destroy the statehood and people of Ukraine, it is also completely unacceptable."" Estonia was part of the Russian Empire for more than two centuries, only regaining independence in 1918 - before losing it to the Soviet Union until 1991. Zelensky addressed hundreds of students in the UK over a Zoom call Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to hundreds of university students across the UK earlier as part of an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union. The president gave a 15-minute opening speech over Zoom and then took questions, mostly focused on rebuilding Ukraine after the war. Here's what we learned:  More from the event here. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (left) with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he's asked Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic to join the European Union's sanctions on Russia. Serbia is not in the EU, though it has applied to join and is in talks. Scholz was in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, today to meet the country's President Aleksandar Vucic. Speaking at a news conference, Scholz said joining the sanctions made sense given Serbia aspired to join the 27-member bloc. But Vucic said the EU should consider the fact that Serbia and Russia had special relations that dated a long way back. Smoke over Severodonetsk this week We've been reporting on the situation in Severodonetsk in recent days - the city in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine which is currently seeing the worst of the fighting. According to the Ukrainian military, the Russians have continued assault operations in the area of Severodonetsk today to try and get full control of the city and create the conditions to surround Ukrainian units. In a Facebook update, Ukraine's General Staff said: ""The fighting continues. The enemy fired artillery in the area of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Ustynivka, Toshkivka, Zolote and Hirske."" And the Russian military is preparing to resume its offensive on the city of Slovyansk, also in the Donetsk region, the report said. Read more on the battle for Severodonetsk BBC World News We've got some more reaction to the death sentences given to three men who were fighting for the Ukrainian military against Russian forces. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK said the ""harsh"" sentence of capital punishment did not exist in his country. Speaking on BBC World News, Vadym Prystaiko said there were continuing discussions about prisoner swaps and the release of soldiers. Mr Prystaiko said he was in ""constant contact"" with the families of the two Britons captured by Russian forces and urged them to ""trust"" in Ukraine's ability to negotiate. The men were sentenced to death by a court in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic which is not recognised internationally. Discussing the reported suffering in Mariupol, he explained his fears that the ""situation
is not going to get easier"" as temperatures increase. Ukraine needs a combination of political, military and financial support to rebuild the country, he added. Ukraine has sown 13.4 million hectares with key agricultural crops this spring, which is 93% of its target for the season, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports, citing the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food. As we've been reporting regularly in recent days, Ukraine is one of the world's key food producers and there have been fears disruption to its industry couldaffect people around the world, with the UN among those warning of the danger of widespread hunger. But Interfax reports that farmers have been able to sow more than 90% of the planned spring target for several main crops, including sunflowers, corn, barley, oats and potatoes, while it has met its target for spring wheat. Harvesting of winter crops in some regions is expected to begin next week, it says. Earlier, Rostyslav Shurma, a deputy head of the President's Office, said Ukraine's goal in 2022 was to harvest at least 70% of last year's volumes. The Russian government is spending $17 million (Â£13 million) on national flags and coats of arms to feature in a weekly patriotic ceremony in rural schools across the nation. This is part of a patriotic push coinciding with the invasion of Ukraine, The Moscow Times reports. From September, every Monday morning, schools will raise the flag and perform the national anthem aimed at boosting ""civic consciousness"", Education Minister Sergei Kravtsov said. The education ministry is already planning to introduce compulsory history lessons from age seven, but only where Russians are shown as the good guys. Some journalists have noted that the money is being spent despite the fact that more than 5,000 Russian schools lack indoor plumbing. Liz Truss has spoken with Dmytro Kuleba before, including at this meeting in Warsaw, Poland, in April Earlier we brought you the news thatthe UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss had spoken with her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kulebaabout the death sentences given to three men - two Britons and one Moroccan - by a court in Donetsk. The three men had been members of Ukraine's military and were captured in April while defending the besieged city of Mariupol. Kulebahas now tweeted about the call,,externalsaying he and Truss ""coordinated efforts to step up pressure on Russia"". ""I look forward to the next round of UK sanctions,"" he said. ""We both agreed that no one in the world has a right to get weary of this war until Ukraine prevails."" And he added that both he and Truss ""strongly condemned the sham trial against prisoners of war in the Russian-occupied Donetsk. As combatants, they are protected by international humanitarian law and must be treated accordingly. We keep working together to ensure their release."" Earlier, Truss called the sentences ""an egregious breach of the Geneva Convention"". Shevchenko says his mother has been able to leave Ukraine for Italy but his sister is still in Kyiv Ukrainian football legend Andriy Shevchenko says President Volodymyr Zelensky is ""unbelievable"" and he is very proud of how his country and its people have been dealing with the war. Shevchecnko, who played for teams including Dynamo Kyiv, AC Milan and Chelsea, is Ukraine's record goalscorer and also managed the national team at last year's European Championship. He said on a recent visit to Kyiv he had a ""very nice meeting with the president"", and they were positive they could defend their country and bring peace to Ukraine. ""At the most difficult time in our the history of Ukraine he has brought people together and sent a great message across the world,"" he tells BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Ukraine's people must not give up, we want our democracy we fight for our freedom and that's a massive message to everyone. ""I'm so proud how my country and the people united to stay strong and defend the country."" This weekend Shevchenko will play inSoccer Aid,external- an annual football match involving former players and celebrities.

""This situation has no precedent.

Krivosheev said he was concerned this could lead to similar cases. ""Could this happen again? Absolutely."" Chris PartridgeBBC News This video can not be played Low-flying Ukrainian jet skims above trees Ukraine
is an extreme hostile environment for fighter pilots, whether they be Russian
or Ukrainian. Surface-to-air
missile systems cover the skies, ranging from shoulder-launched ""Stinger"" MANPADS to advanced S-300 and S-400 long-range SAMs. Aircraft
carrying out ground attack roles include the Su-25 ""Frogfoot"", a plane thatâs
being used by both sides in this war. Because
of the SAM threat, pilots often fly low and fast to avoid the threat posed by those missile systems. And
one example thatâs appeared on social media shows the lengths - or rather low
heights - Ukrainian pilots are going to avoid being shot down. At one point - at the start of the video - we see that the instrument used to detect radar-guided attacks is activated. This equipment - radar warning receiver - is located on the front panel on the right. It shows, for a brief moment, a missile being launched at the aircraft itself, as shown by the illuminated red area in this image. Itâs likely the speed and low height of the Su-25 allowed it to quickly escape the missile threat, as the RWR alert soon disappears. Similar very low-level runs have been carried out by Russian pilots, such is the strength â and threat - of air defences on both sides in this conflict. A radar warning receiver shows a red light that means a missile is launched at the aircraft itself Ukraine has conducted its 11th prisoner swap with Russia since the invasion began in February, according to a regional governor. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, wrote on the messaging service Telegram that four Russian captives were exchanged for five Ukrainians today. Zelensky spoke at an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union Back to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - who is now taking questions from UK university students. The first comes from the University of Birmingham where the president is asked about the plan to rebuild Ukraine. Zelensky says it will be a ""big project"" that will become ""unstoppable"" once it starts. ""It's all about rebuilding our country, it's all about restarting Ukraine,"" he says. ""I want the people to return to their native streets, their native cities, but that would be a different Ukraine, a Ukraine that has defended its independence, its future and I want this future to be mentally different."" He adds: ""Of course I want to say that we would be able to reconstruct all our buildings but that would depend not only on our wishes but on the financial support."" A question comes in from the University of Glasgow. The president is asked what the government's approach is to the Ukrainian universities in the areas now occupied by Russia. Zelensky says the situation is a ""real tragedy"" and he says they are proposing relocating some universities to the existing universities in the territories that are not occupied.

"Millions of unused masks and other Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) bought at the height of the Covid pandemic are to be burned or recycled. The government says it will use the fires to generate power - but a spending watchdog has attacked the cost and environmental impact of the plan. The Public Accounts Committee said some of the Â£4bn worth of unused PPE did not meet NHS standards. The Department of Health (DoH) said the committee's claims were ""misleading"". A spokesman said: ""We make no apology for procuring too much PPE rather than too little, and only 3% of the PPE we procured was unusable in any context."" Labour queries PPE contracts and Tory peer links PPE waste could be recycled - health minister 'Counterfeit' masks warnings repeatedly dismissed The report by the Public Accounts Committee - which scrutinises government spending - said that between 2020-21, the Department of Health spent Â£12bn on PPE, butÂ£8.7bn had to be written off. At the start of the pandemic, countries around the world were clamouring for PPE which sent prices soaring. The DoH has argued that it was better to purchase PPE despite the ""globally inflated market"" rather than risk running out of equipment. A total of Â£4.7bn was written off because the market price of PPE at the end of the year was lower than the price paid at the height of the pandemic. The committee says a further Â£4bn was lost because equipment, such as masks and gowns, did not meet NHS standards, was defective or not needed. It said the government had hired two commercial waste partners to get rid of the unused items - amounting to 15,000 pallets a month - through a combination of recycling and burning to generate power. The committee warned the costs and environmental impact were ""unclear"" and asked the department to set out full details of how the equipment would be discarded. The DoH insisted it did have a clear strategy for disposing of the items adding that it was using ""a range of measures to manage excess stock of PPE"" such as donating equipment to charities and transport agencies. The committee was critical of the department's overall provision of PPE at the start of the pandemic describing it as ""haphazard"" and noting that 24% of the PPE contracts awarded were now in dispute. Committee chairwoman Dame Meg Hillier, a Labour MP, said: ""The story of PPE purchasing is perhaps the most shameful episode of the UK government response to the pandemic. ""At the start of the pandemic health service and social care staff were left to risk their own and their families' lives due to the lack of basic PPE. ""In a desperate bid to catch up the government splurged huge amounts of money, paying obscenely inflated prices and payments to middlemen in a chaotic rush during which they chucked out even the most cursory due diligence."" She added the department had been failing to comply with rules on managing public money before the pandemic and suggested ""inappropriate unauthorised payoffs made to staff by health bodies"", as part of planned large-scale NHS restructuring, was ""increasing the risk of this happening again."" Royal College of Nursing chief executive Pat Cullen said nurses would find the report ""galling"", adding: ""If this money had been used more wisely and decent quality PPE bought in the first place, then nurses' lives might have been saved."" Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""Ministers have been carelessly burning taxpayers' money by the billion as unusable gowns, goggles, and gloves literally go up in flames.""

"Forensic experts examined a boat with traces of blood in Vale Do Javari Police in Brazil are examining blood found in the search for British journalist Dom Phillips and local indigenous expert Bruno Pereira. Traces of blood found on a boat belonging to a fisherman, who has been arrested, will be tested to see whether it is human or animal. The pair went missing while travelling by boat on a reporting trip in the Amazon rainforest on Sunday. Mr Pereira recently received threats over his work against illegal fishing. The authorities said they were hopeful of finding the two men alive, but did not exclude any outcome, including that of murder in a region where drug-trafficking and poaching are rife, AFP news agency reports. Both Mr Pereira, 41, and Mr Phillips, 57, who has written about threats to the Amazon for publications such as the Guardian and the Washington Post, are hugely experienced and planned their journeys thoroughly. They reportedly had a new boat and plenty of fuel. In London, the journalist's sister, Sian Phillips, called on the UK authorities to put pressure on the Brazilian government to find the two men. ""We want to carry on with the search,"" she said in a statement to the media during a gathering of about 30 people in front of the Brazilian embassy. ""We want to find out what is happening to them and we want anyone responsible for any criminal act to be brought to justice. We want a persistent deep and open investigation."" Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who was in Los Angeles for a summit, said: ""Let's pray to God that they are still alive,"" but added, ""With each day that passes, those chances fade."" The blood traces were found on the boat of fisherman Amarildo da Costa, known locally as ""Pelado"", who was questioned in the town of Atalaia do Norte. He has been charged with illegal possession of restricted ammunition. Police say he was one of the last people to see Mr Pereira and Mr Phillips. Placards outside the Brazilian embassy showed Dom Phillips (L) and Bruno Pereira Mr da Costa is also suspected of involvement in illegal fishing for a buyer in Peru, police sources told Reuters news agency. A lawyer for the fisherman, Davi Oliveira, told Reuters his client was not involved in the disappearance of the two men and was engaged in legal fishing. The same lawyer has since stepped away from the case, the news agency adds. Six other people have been questioned in connection with the men's disappearance. Some 250 members of the security forces have been taking part in the search, up from just about a dozen in the first days. They include divers and experts in jungle terrain. Two helicopters are also being used, as well as more than a dozen boats and drones. Lead investigator Alexandre Fontes described the area as a ""very complicated region"" which he said could only be reached by helicopter, small plane or boat. Indigenous rights groups which Mr Pereira worked with were the first to raise the alarm about the disappearance of the expert on isolated indigenous groups and the journalist. The area where they disappeared is home to some 6,300 indigenous people from more than 20 groups. As well as clashes with fishermen catching protected stock, it has also seen incursions by illegal gold miners, loggers and drug-traffickers who smuggle cocaine from Peru. Both Mr Pereira, who has worked for the government's indigenous affairs agency Funai, and Mr Phillips, who was carrying out research for a book on the Amazon, documented these threats as part of their work.

"Dozens of fake Musk livestreams appear on YouTube daily YouTube is being criticised for failing to tackle a network of cyber-criminals streaming fake Elon Musk videos to scam viewers. The criminals are hijacking YouTube accounts and using the videos to promote bogus cryptocurrency giveaways. BBC News found dozens of these streams being watched by tens of thousands of people over four days this month. On Tuesday, Elon Musk said YouTube was not tackling ""scam ads"". YouTube says it removes channels that are reported. For many months, the streams have been fooling thousands of people into sending cryptocurrency to criminals, thinking they will receive a prize from Mr Musk. One of the most common links to website https://elon-x2.live/, which invites people to double their money by sending Bitcoin or Ethereum to the digital-wallet addresses advertised. The livestreams advertise bogus cryptocurrency giveaway offers Wallet transaction history shows the scammers made $243,000 (Â£194,000) in just over a week: 23 transfers of bitcoin totalling 7.68923261 coins worth $234,000 18 transfers of ethereum totalling 5.016 coins worth $9,000 Analysts at Whale Alert say giveaway scammer wallets they track show profits of: $98m in 2021 $30m so far this year Chilean musician Aisack was a victim of the cyber-criminals Every few days, the hackers change the name and picture of dozens of YouTube channels to make them look like official Tesla channels, the electric-car manufacturer of which Mr Musk is chief executive. They are thought to buy email-and-password pairs from previous data breaches online - or simply try common passwords with known email addresses. 'I lost Â£400,000 to fake Elon Musk giveaway scam' Dead YouTuber hacked by Musk Bitcoin scammers Chilean urban-music artist Aisack had YouTube channel hacked and hijacked two weeks ago. ""My followers on other social networks started asking me what is going on with the name of my channel and were very confused about why I was streaming Tesla content,"" he said. ""It is very frustrating that your YouTube channel is hacked after dedicating so many years of work to it. ""I feel completely violated and insecure. ""The hacking of my channel has hurt me a lot, since I am a few days away from releasing a new music video and now I am creating a second channel as a back-up and re-uploading more than 10 years of work on YouTube. ""YouTube is not doing enough on security issues to prevent hacker attacks, since many users are in the same situation as me."" Hackers change the name and profile of YouTube channels to Tesla to make them look legitimate YouTube said it had removed one of the channels BBC News had alerted it to, adding: ""We have strict Community Guidelines prohibiting scams, including Impersonation and hacking."" Last year, one man hoping to double his moneysent scammers $400,000 worth of bitcoins, after seeing a fake advert on Twitter. So far this year, scammers are having less success, Whale Alert founder Frank van Weert said, but still making millions and set for a boost if the price of Bitcoin rises. Scammers are illegally using footage and imagery from financial firm ARK Invest ""The numbers are going down compared to 2021 - but there are still plenty of victims falling for it, as they evolve their tactics,"" Mr Van Weert said. ""Right now, they have been overfishing the sea a bit, especially with Bitcoin prices going down, but that will change as not enough is being done to stop them."" The scammers could be stopped if cryptocurrency exchanges blocked their wallets to prevent them cashing out their stolen coins, he added. The vast majority of the fake livestreams show financial firm ARK Invest's July panel with Musk and then Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey An spokeswoman told BBC News ARK ""is aware of hacked third-party YouTube channels fraudulently posing as ARK"". ""These accounts are impersonators and not affiliated with ARK Invest in any way,"" she said. ""ARK Invest will never use YouTube or other social media to solicit money, including cryptocurrency.""

"Women are wasting their time and money buying do-at-home menopause-testing kits, top UK doctors say. The urine tests are not predictive enough to tell whether a woman is going through the phase when her periods will stop, they warn. Results could cause anxiety and confusion, and might even contribute to unplanned pregnancies, says the British Menopause Society. Manufacturers say the kits should never replace medical advice. One company that makes them said the tests could help women worried about the perimenopause, when periods can become erratic. A few companies sellUK-approved,externalmenopause tests online and in shops. They can be bought without a prescription, for about Â£10 for a pack of two. The tests, which give a result within minutes, accurately measure levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which helps manage the menstrual cycle. But experts say it is not a reliable marker of the menopause or perimenopause. The tests can be unhelpful and potentially misleading, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), along with other leading experts in women's health, says. NHS guidelines,externalalso discourage FSH testing for over-45s with classic menopausal symptoms - such as hot flushes - because it adds nothing diagnostically. The manufacturer of the Self Check Menopause test says while menopause cannot be defined by a single simple test, hormonal imbalance is the most important indicator. And a constant high FSH level may indicate ""the ovaries are not working"" and ""no egg production is happening"". But experts say the fact FSH levels fluctuate throughout the menstrual cycle and from month to month makes it a poor indicator. The Co-op Pharmacy website says women can discuss their results with a pharmacist. The Self Check website says its kits ""can alleviate the worry and tension that normally affect women during their menopausal years, especially those women who display acute symptoms that can disturb daily routine"". ""These kits bring a feeling of being in charge of your health by knowing your FSH levels and seeking medical help to combat any of them successfully,"" it says. Director Dr John Rees told BBC News: ""The pack includes two tests, the second test to be taken a week later and only if both tests are positive to consider menopause. ""Whatever the result, users of self-tests, including the Self Check Menopause test are instructed to speak with their doctor before taking any action on the result. ""The instructions provided with the tests are reviewed and agreed with the regulators prior to approval for use. ""Self-test kits are not meant to replace traditional healthcare pathways but can prompt people to speak with their doctor about their health concerns whether they have a positive or negative result."" A spokeswoman for the makers of another kit said: ""The instructions for use claims only that 'Flourish Menopause Test Kit can detect the presence of FSH in urine as soon as the concentration goes up from 25 mIU/mL [milli-international units per millilitre] and over' and does not claim that the test directly diagnoses menopause process. ""It should be used as an indicator only in conjunction with other methods."" Leading menopause and hormone doctor Annice Mukherjee, from theSociety of Endocrinology,external, said FSH urine tests were ""another example of exploitation of mid-life women by the commercial menopause industry, who have financial conflicts of interest"". She accused them of using misleading information about ""FSH sometimes being a helpful marker of menopause"" and called the perimenopause a ""hormone rollercoaster"". ""It's not helpful for women to access [FSH] directly,"" she said. ""It is not a reliable marker of perimenopause and can causes more confusion among women taking the test. ""At worst, misinterpretation of results can cause harm."" For example, a women might interpret a high reading to mean she is menopausal and unlikely to be fertile - but high FSH can also be seen just before the ovary releases an egg, so she could become pregnant. Similarly, a negative test does not necessarily indicate someone is not perimenopausal. The kits' instructions explain this -  and warn some medications, including oral contraceptives, can make the result unreliable. RCOG,externalspokesman consultant gynaecologist Haitham Hamoda, from King's College Hospital, who chairs theBritish Menopause Society,external, said: ""The RCOG does not recommend over-the-counter menopause tests as they are not a good method of detecting menopause or perimenopause. ""These tests are limited by only measuring FSH, rather than looking at the wider clinical picture. ""We would encourage women to seek support from a healthcare professional if they think they might be experiencing the menopause rather than purchasing these tests."" There is no single test The first sign is usually a change in the normal pattern of periods - they may become unusually light or heavy and irregular There may be other symptoms, such as hot flushes, night sweats and difficulty sleeping A doctor should be able to tell, based on age and symptoms Going through it before the age of 40 is unusual and a doctormay recommend seeing a specialist and having blood tests,external Source:NHS,external Have you used a menopause home-test kit?

"Ziggy is a corn snake, native to north America Teresa Morris has owned Ziggy, a corn snake, for four years. She took him in after a family member didn't have the time to look after him. But now, with energy bills increasing, Teresa can no longer afford to keep him. ""I'm not happy about it, but I have to make firm choices, because financially the heat lamp is on all day."" Teresa, who worked as a carer, says her bills have gone up by more than Â£20 a month. ""It's a big emotional blur, but he's my family and he should be respected."" What are reptiles? One in five reptiles is threatened with extinction She handed over Ziggy to the National Centre for Reptile Welfare (NCRW) in Tonbridge, Kent, which has seen a surge in the number of snakes and other reptiles being handed in. Director Chris Newman said more reptiles were left with the centre in the first three months of 2022 than in the whole of 2021. There has been a particular increase in bearded dragons being given up by their owners His team, which includes students from Hadlow College, has been analysing the reasons why reptiles have been abandoned or surrendered. ""Finance seems to be the big issue. People are worrying about not being able to afford to heat and feed the animals,"" he said. The study found 80% of pets being handed in to them are because of  ""economic reasons"". In particular, the NCRW has seen a spike in bearded dragons, which can be particularly expensive to feed and keep warm. The centre has now been forced to accept more bearded dragons only in an emergency. In Wolverhampton, in the West Midlands, the charity the Proteus Reptile Trust, has also seen a spike in the number of reptiles being handed in. It has also seen a rise in pets being dumped in cardboard boxes and outside pet shops. Amy Taranaski, centre co-ordinator said: ""We can only take so many reptiles in as we have limited funding. Our big concern is what happens to these reptiles when we cannot help."" The centre is looking to switch to renewable energy in order to keep up with demand. With the cost of living increasing, the RSPCA says it expects the problem of reptiles being handed in to get worse. Cold-blooded reptiles need an external source of heat RSPCA scientific officer Evangeline Button said: ""We are really worried that we will see more animals being abandoned because their owners cannot meet the financial challenges of keeping them on."" Reptiles in particular are vulnerable because they do not tend to be native to the UK. This means they need a carefully controlled environment which includes 24-hour light and heating. The RSPCA has suggested some ways to save money, which include buying second-hand equipment. But it stresses that people should check that everything is working properly, to ensure their pets are safe.

"JJ Abrams has directed films in the Star Wars franchise A major television series from Star Wars director JJ Abrams, which was due to film in Belfast, has been cancelled. The sci-fi drama Demimonde was set to be broadcast on the United States network HBO. Crew who had started working on the project in Belfast have been stood down. Northern Ireland Screen said they would be looking in the coming weeks for a project to replace it, and it would get back its Â£1m investment. JJ Abrams is best known for directing Star Wars and the Mission Impossible films. BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme understands crew who were working in pre-production on the project were sent home while negotiations took place between JJ Abrams' production company Bad Robot and HBO. The film industry publication The Hollywood Reporterbroke the news that the show was not going ahead due to ""budget issues"",external. The television series was in pre-production at the Titanic Studios in Belfast, which previously housed Game of Thrones and the upcoming blockbuster film Dungeons and Dragons. This video can not be played Belfast filming for new JJ Abrams series cancelled It was expected that Demimonde would be in the studios for more than a year, which would have provided well-paid work for local film crews. Northern Ireland Screen chief executive Richard Williams told Good Morning Ulster the production would have provided work for about 600 people. He said it was not unusual for a project to drop out, and NI Screen would be looking for another in Los Angeles in the coming weeks. ""We've had this happen before, we had a project just to drop out before lockdown and had it replaced by Dungeons and Dragons,"" Mr Williams said. ""We'll just have to go out to find another project. ""I would be very disappointed if we didn't have a new project slated by the middle of autumn, certainly before Christmas - but time is lost, money is lost for sure."" He said the money the screen agency invested in the pilot - which had not yet been shot - would be recouped, adding: ""We had invested in the pilot to the tune of just over a million pounds. We will have a swift conversation with HBO to get that money retrieved."" Securing Demimonde to shoot in Belfast was a big coup for Northern Ireland Screen. Northern Ireland's film and television industry has been boosted recently by securing major projects likeThe Northman,The School for Good and Evil,Lift and Dungeons and Dragons. HBO has been approached for comment.

Thanks for following and we'll be back tomorrow with more updates on the Ukraine war throughout the day. Today's live page was brought to you by: Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan, Rob Corp, Alex Therrien, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, James Clarke, James Harness, George Wright, Dulcie Lee, Charley Adams, Catherine Evans and Francesca Gillett. For around-up of the main Ukraine war headlines, head here -and for the latest on Mariupol,that's here. Ukrainian students Pavlo Denysenko and Snizhana Berezhna at Coventry University, one of the universities where Zelensky spoke to students over Zoom In case you missed it, here's a recap of the main headlines today: As we reported earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought tojustify Moscow's invasion of Ukraine by saying his country is trying to regain its ""original territories""- just as previous Russian ruler, Peter the Great did in the 18th century. In response, Estonia's foreign minister summoned the Russian ambassador to condemn Putin's ""completely unacceptable"" praise for the 18th century ruler. Speaking on Thursday, Putin specifically mentioned Narva, which belongs to Estonia, one of the three Baltic States and a member of Nato, Reuters reports. In a statement, Estonia's foreign minister, who summoned ambassador Vladimir Lipayev, said: ""At a time when Russia is... trying to destroy the statehood and people of Ukraine, it is also completely unacceptable."" Estonia was part of the Russian Empire for more than two centuries, only regaining independence in 1918 - before losing it to the Soviet Union until 1991. Zelensky addressed hundreds of students in the UK over a Zoom call Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to hundreds of university students across the UK earlier as part of an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union. The president gave a 15-minute opening speech over Zoom and then took questions, mostly focused on rebuilding Ukraine after the war. Here's what we learned:  More from the event here. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (left) with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he's asked Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic to join the European Union's sanctions on Russia. Serbia is not in the EU, though it has applied to join and is in talks. Scholz was in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, today to meet the country's President Aleksandar Vucic. Speaking at a news conference, Scholz said joining the sanctions made sense given Serbia aspired to join the 27-member bloc. But Vucic said the EU should consider the fact that Serbia and Russia had special relations that dated a long way back. Smoke over Severodonetsk this week We've been reporting on the situation in Severodonetsk in recent days - the city in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine which is currently seeing the worst of the fighting. According to the Ukrainian military, the Russians have continued assault operations in the area of Severodonetsk today to try and get full control of the city and create the conditions to surround Ukrainian units. In a Facebook update, Ukraine's General Staff said: ""The fighting continues. The enemy fired artillery in the area of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Ustynivka, Toshkivka, Zolote and Hirske."" And the Russian military is preparing to resume its offensive on the city of Slovyansk, also in the Donetsk region, the report said. Read more on the battle for Severodonetsk BBC World News We've got some more reaction to the death sentences given to three men who were fighting for the Ukrainian military against Russian forces. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK said the ""harsh"" sentence of capital punishment did not exist in his country. Speaking on BBC World News, Vadym Prystaiko said there were continuing discussions about prisoner swaps and the release of soldiers. Mr Prystaiko said he was in ""constant contact"" with the families of the two Britons captured by Russian forces and urged them to ""trust"" in Ukraine's ability to negotiate. The men were sentenced to death by a court in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic which is not recognised internationally. Discussing the reported suffering in Mariupol, he explained his fears that the ""situation

Ukraine has sown 13.4 million hectares with key agricultural crops this spring, which is 93% of its target for the season, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports, citing the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food. As we've been reporting regularly in recent days, Ukraine is one of the world's key food producers and there have been fears disruption to its industry couldaffect people around the world, with the UN among those warning of the danger of widespread hunger. But Interfax reports that farmers have been able to sow more than 90% of the planned spring target for several main crops, including sunflowers, corn, barley, oats and potatoes, while it has met its target for spring wheat. Harvesting of winter crops in some regions is expected to begin next week, it says. Earlier, Rostyslav Shurma, a deputy head of the President's Office, said Ukraine's goal in 2022 was to harvest at least 70% of last year's volumes. The Russian government is spending $17 million (Â£13 million) on national flags and coats of arms to feature in a weekly patriotic ceremony in rural schools across the nation.

"Some items listed as bovine bone appear to be tusks and are advertised for thousands of pounds Sellers are flouting eBay's self-imposed ban on the sale of elephant ivory by listing it under pseudonyms. An investigation by the BBC and legal experts found ivory objects were often listed as ""bovine bone"". We bought three such items on eBay UK and tested them in an independent lab. Two were confirmed to be made of ivory. An analysis by ivory trade experts also indicated that thousands of elephant ivory objects have been sold on the site since the company banned its sale. The investigation was started in 2018 by Dr Caroline Cox at the University of Portsmouth. She and other ivory trade experts say  online trade is continuing despite a new UK-wide ban on the sale of ivory, which came into force on 6 June. This video can not be played How to spot ivory: Watch experts show BBC Science Correspondent Victoria Gill how to identify ivory listed for sale online It is more than 10 years sinceeBay announced its own complete, worldwide ban on ivory sales,external. An online post stated that the global ban would ""protect buyers and sellers, as well as animals in danger of extinction"". In 2018 Dr Cox and her team carried out a three month online study, tracking ""bovine bone"" as a sale category on eBay's UK site. The team tracked 632 pieces of bovine bone that were sold on eBay UK; more than 500 of those were determined to be ivory. For this online forensic study, Dr Cox explained, she was able to use pictures and information in listings that provide buyers - and investigators - with clear evidence of what the objects are actually made of. ""Ivory has a distinct, creamy colour,"" she explained. ""And a listing will often mention the weight of the item being sold - very accurately and specifically - because that's the measure of ivory's value."" Tell-tale 'Schreger lines' are the growth lines of a tusk that can be seen in carved ivory, seen here in this piece recently listed for sale on eBay The key piece of evidence is in the image of an object. Carved ivory has distinct and visible growth lines called Schreger lines, which you can think of as tree rings, but for teeth and tusks. ""These are unique to ivory,"" said Dr Cox. Investigators and law enforcement officers have long employed these visual techniques to identify illegal ivory, both in seizures of the material and when they are investigating the online trade. BBC News bought three objects listed on eBay as bovine bone to have tested in an independent lab. We bought and tested an ornament that was listed on eBay as 'bovine bone' Of three items we bought, a small, carved African head ornament, a bracelet and a set of figurines, two were chemically confirmed by scientists in the Oxford University School of Archaeology to be made of elephant tusk. Poaching drives elephants closer to the brink Vaccine trial for killer elephant virus begins Why scientists are freezing threatened species A bovine bone bracelet we bought for Â£25 was confirmed to be elephant tusk In a statement responding to the BBC's findings, eBay said that it had been working to tackle the illegal trade in elephant ivory for nearly a decade. ""We blocked or removed over 265,000 listings prohibited under our animal products policy in a recent two-year period,"" a spokesperson told BBC News in an email. ""Our proactive approach means that illicit ivory sellers are forced to use obscure 'code words' [for items] which very rarely - if at all - get sold, because buyers can't find them."" The ivory trade experts who started this investigation pointed out that they tracked 500 eBay sales of ivory to completion over just three months in 2018. And the same code words or pseudonyms, primarily ""bovine bone"", were used repeatedly. Laws on the ivory trade differ from country to country. On Monday, the UK brought into force what it called ""one the toughest bans on elephant ivory sales in the world"". From 6 June, trade in elephant teeth and tusks is illegal in the UK, punishable by fines of up to Â£250,000 or up to five years in prison. EBay is not the only online platform that wildlife traders have exploited. During our investigation of the pet trade in endangered apes back in 2017, we found animals beingadvertised on Instagram, in posts that the company subsequently removed. And in April of this year, researchers from a conservation campaign group called Avaaz published a report citing""129 pieces of potentially harmful wildlife trafficking content"" posted on Facebook,external,"" including posts selling or seeking cheetahs, monkeys, pangolins and pangolin scales, lion cubs, elephant tusks, and rhino horn. In response to the report, Facebook's parent company Meta said: ""We prohibit the trading of endangered wildlife or their parts. Meta is a dedicated member of theCoalition to End Wildlife Trafficking Online.,external"" John Scanlon, CEO of the Elephant Protection Initiative Foundation, said that these online platforms had ""enormous reach and impact"". ""If they are not carefully policed, they are an efficient vehicle for criminals to sell illicit goods in any country,"" he said. ""So it's deeply troubling when an online platform makes big commitments about policing trade, but then fails to deliver."" ""The international community has made great progress at closing down legal ivory markets in recent years, of which the new UK legislation is just the latest example. But this progress risks being seriously undermined by leakages online."" Conservationists point out though that threats to Africa's elephants are changing. There are now just over 400,000 elephants across the African continent ""Organised ivory poaching remains a threat in some regions, especially in central Africa, but has been much reduced in parts of eastern and southern Africa,"" said Mr Scanlon. ""We believe that the biggest emerging threat comes from the increasing competition between growing human populations and elephants for land and resources, especially as the impact of climate change is beginning to be felt."" Dr Cox and other wildlife trade experts are concerned though that, as national legislation is tightened, more products like ivory could move online, especially if platforms are not policed. ""Sites like eBay operate by allowing millions of sellers all around the world to advertise across international borders,"" Dr Cox pointed out. She added that the company's failure to enforce its ban on the trade in ivory provided a safe space for a trade that threatened wildlife.

Thanks for following and we'll be back tomorrow with more updates on the Ukraine war throughout the day. Today's live page was brought to you by: Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan, Rob Corp, Alex Therrien, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, James Clarke, James Harness, George Wright, Dulcie Lee, Charley Adams, Catherine Evans and Francesca Gillett. For around-up of the main Ukraine war headlines, head here -and for the latest on Mariupol,that's here. Ukrainian students Pavlo Denysenko and Snizhana Berezhna at Coventry University, one of the universities where Zelensky spoke to students over Zoom In case you missed it, here's a recap of the main headlines today: As we reported earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought tojustify Moscow's invasion of Ukraine by saying his country is trying to regain its ""original territories""- just as previous Russian ruler, Peter the Great did in the 18th century. In response, Estonia's foreign minister summoned the Russian ambassador to condemn Putin's ""completely unacceptable"" praise for the 18th century ruler. Speaking on Thursday, Putin specifically mentioned Narva, which belongs to Estonia, one of the three Baltic States and a member of Nato, Reuters reports. In a statement, Estonia's foreign minister, who summoned ambassador Vladimir Lipayev, said: ""At a time when Russia is... trying to destroy the statehood and people of Ukraine, it is also completely unacceptable."" Estonia was part of the Russian Empire for more than two centuries, only regaining independence in 1918 - before losing it to the Soviet Union until 1991. Zelensky addressed hundreds of students in the UK over a Zoom call Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to hundreds of university students across the UK earlier as part of an event organised by the Ukrainian Students Union. The president gave a 15-minute opening speech over Zoom and then took questions, mostly focused on rebuilding Ukraine after the war. Here's what we learned:  More from the event here. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (left) with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he's asked Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic to join the European Union's sanctions on Russia. Serbia is not in the EU, though it has applied to join and is in talks. Scholz was in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, today to meet the country's President Aleksandar Vucic. Speaking at a news conference, Scholz said joining the sanctions made sense given Serbia aspired to join the 27-member bloc. But Vucic said the EU should consider the fact that Serbia and Russia had special relations that dated a long way back. Smoke over Severodonetsk this week We've been reporting on the situation in Severodonetsk in recent days - the city in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine which is currently seeing the worst of the fighting. According to the Ukrainian military, the Russians have continued assault operations in the area of Severodonetsk today to try and get full control of the city and create the conditions to surround Ukrainian units. In a Facebook update, Ukraine's General Staff said: ""The fighting continues. The enemy fired artillery in the area of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Ustynivka, Toshkivka, Zolote and Hirske."" And the Russian military is preparing to resume its offensive on the city of Slovyansk, also in the Donetsk region, the report said. Read more on the battle for Severodonetsk BBC World News We've got some more reaction to the death sentences given to three men who were fighting for the Ukrainian military against Russian forces. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK said the ""harsh"" sentence of capital punishment did not exist in his country. Speaking on BBC World News, Vadym Prystaiko said there were continuing discussions about prisoner swaps and the release of soldiers. Mr Prystaiko said he was in ""constant contact"" with the families of the two Britons captured by Russian forces and urged them to ""trust"" in Ukraine's ability to negotiate. The men were sentenced to death by a court in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic which is not recognised internationally. Discussing the reported suffering in Mariupol, he explained his fears that the ""situation
is not going to get easier"" as temperatures increase. Ukraine needs a combination of political, military and financial support to rebuild the country, he added.

"Some items listed as bovine bone appear to be tusks and are advertised for thousands of pounds Sellers are flouting eBay's self-imposed ban on the sale of elephant ivory by listing it under pseudonyms. An investigation by the BBC and legal experts found ivory objects were often listed as ""bovine bone"". We bought three such items on eBay UK and tested them in an independent lab. Two were confirmed to be made of ivory. An analysis by ivory trade experts also indicated that thousands of elephant ivory objects have been sold on the site since the company banned its sale. The investigation was started in 2018 by Dr Caroline Cox at the University of Portsmouth. She and other ivory trade experts say  online trade is continuing despite a new UK-wide ban on the sale of ivory, which came into force on 6 June. This video can not be played How to spot ivory: Watch experts show BBC Science Correspondent Victoria Gill how to identify ivory listed for sale online It is more than 10 years sinceeBay announced its own complete, worldwide ban on ivory sales,external. An online post stated that the global ban would ""protect buyers and sellers, as well as animals in danger of extinction"". In 2018 Dr Cox and her team carried out a three month online study, tracking ""bovine bone"" as a sale category on eBay's UK site. The team tracked 632 pieces of bovine bone that were sold on eBay UK; more than 500 of those were determined to be ivory. For this online forensic study, Dr Cox explained, she was able to use pictures and information in listings that provide buyers - and investigators - with clear evidence of what the objects are actually made of. ""Ivory has a distinct, creamy colour,"" she explained. ""And a listing will often mention the weight of the item being sold - very accurately and specifically - because that's the measure of ivory's value."" Tell-tale 'Schreger lines' are the growth lines of a tusk that can be seen in carved ivory, seen here in this piece recently listed for sale on eBay The key piece of evidence is in the image of an object. Carved ivory has distinct and visible growth lines called Schreger lines, which you can think of as tree rings, but for teeth and tusks. ""These are unique to ivory,"" said Dr Cox. Investigators and law enforcement officers have long employed these visual techniques to identify illegal ivory, both in seizures of the material and when they are investigating the online trade. BBC News bought three objects listed on eBay as bovine bone to have tested in an independent lab. We bought and tested an ornament that was listed on eBay as 'bovine bone' Of three items we bought, a small, carved African head ornament, a bracelet and a set of figurines, two were chemically confirmed by scientists in the Oxford University School of Archaeology to be made of elephant tusk. Poaching drives elephants closer to the brink Vaccine trial for killer elephant virus begins Why scientists are freezing threatened species A bovine bone bracelet we bought for Â£25 was confirmed to be elephant tusk In a statement responding to the BBC's findings, eBay said that it had been working to tackle the illegal trade in elephant ivory for nearly a decade. ""We blocked or removed over 265,000 listings prohibited under our animal products policy in a recent two-year period,"" a spokesperson told BBC News in an email. ""Our proactive approach means that illicit ivory sellers are forced to use obscure 'code words' [for items] which very rarely - if at all - get sold, because buyers can't find them."" The ivory trade experts who started this investigation pointed out that they tracked 500 eBay sales of ivory to completion over just three months in 2018. And the same code words or pseudonyms, primarily ""bovine bone"", were used repeatedly. Laws on the ivory trade differ from country to country. On Monday, the UK brought into force what it called ""one the toughest bans on elephant ivory sales in the world"". From 6 June, trade in elephant teeth and tusks is illegal in the UK, punishable by fines of up to Â£250,000 or up to five years in prison. EBay is not the only online platform that wildlife traders have exploited. During our investigation of the pet trade in endangered apes back in 2017, we found animals beingadvertised on Instagram, in posts that the company subsequently removed. And in April of this year, researchers from a conservation campaign group called Avaaz published a report citing""129 pieces of potentially harmful wildlife trafficking content"" posted on Facebook,external,"" including posts selling or seeking cheetahs, monkeys, pangolins and pangolin scales, lion cubs, elephant tusks, and rhino horn. In response to the report, Facebook's parent company Meta said: ""We prohibit the trading of endangered wildlife or their parts. Meta is a dedicated member of theCoalition to End Wildlife Trafficking Online.,external"" John Scanlon, CEO of the Elephant Protection Initiative Foundation, said that these online platforms had ""enormous reach and impact"". ""If they are not carefully policed, they are an efficient vehicle for criminals to sell illicit goods in any country,"" he said. ""So it's deeply troubling when an online platform makes big commitments about policing trade, but then fails to deliver."" ""The international community has made great progress at closing down legal ivory markets in recent years, of which the new UK legislation is just the latest example. But this progress risks being seriously undermined by leakages online."" Conservationists point out though that threats to Africa's elephants are changing. There are now just over 400,000 elephants across the African continent ""Organised ivory poaching remains a threat in some regions, especially in central Africa, but has been much reduced in parts of eastern and southern Africa,"" said Mr Scanlon. ""We believe that the biggest emerging threat comes from the increasing competition between growing human populations and elephants for land and resources, especially as the impact of climate change is beginning to be felt."" Dr Cox and other wildlife trade experts are concerned though that, as national legislation is tightened, more products like ivory could move online, especially if platforms are not policed. ""Sites like eBay operate by allowing millions of sellers all around the world to advertise across international borders,"" Dr Cox pointed out. She added that the company's failure to enforce its ban on the trade in ivory provided a safe space for a trade that threatened wildlife.

"Paula Hudgell (l), with adopted son Tony, says everyone needs to play their part in keeping children safe The number of child cruelty offences in England jumped by a quarter last year, according to police data collected by the NSPCC. The child protection charity blames the stress many families felt during the pandemic for the rise, and backs recent high-profile calls for earlier help. ""This must be a priority for government,"" said NSPCC chief executive Sir Peter Wanless. Ministers have promised ""a fundamental shift"" in help for struggling families. The NSPCC sent Freedom of Information requests to each of England's 39 police forces and 36 responded. There were more than 26,000 offences recorded where a child suffered neglect or cruelty in the year to the end of March 2022, up from just over 21,000 the year before, the figures suggest. This amounts to an average of 72 cases of child neglect or cruelty each day, the charity calculates. Some of the increase may be down to better awareness and recording by police, but the charity says the findings are worrying. It says communities have an important role to play and wants anyone who is concerned about a child to contact the NSPCC or the authorities. And it is also calling for more help to be available to families before they reach crisis point. Last month, a major review echoed those calls and concludedthat council-run child protection services in England needed to shift from crisis intervention to providing more early support to struggling families. The review, led by Josh MacAlister called for Â£2.6bn over five years to transform the system and prevent the number of children in care - already at record levels - rising above 100,000. Aseparate report into the deaths of toddlers Arthur Labinjo-Hughes and Star Hobson,both murdered by their parents' partners in 2020, said concerns of their wider families were too often ""disregarded"" by professionals. The NSPCC hopes the new data will ""reinforce to government, the need for fundamental changes to the child protection system"". ""But our message isn't just for politicians. It's vital to remember that child abuse can be prevented,"" said Sir Peter. The figures are being released on the charity's flagship Childhood Day, to help raise awareness of ""how everyone can play their part in keeping children safe"". ""We play our part in many ways,"" said campaigner Paula Hudgell, from Kent. Her adopted son Tony hadboth his legs broken as a six-month-old baby by his biological parents,who also failed to get help for him for several days. ""We have witnessed first-hand the devastating effect of child cruelty and neglect, and hope no child ever experiences what Tony went through. However, this won't be made possible without government leading the way and reforming the children's social care system,"" said Paula. A government official said: ""Every child deserves to be safe, happy, and loved. ""We have already improved how safeguarding agencies work together locally, putting a shared and equal duty on police, councils and health in local areas to work together to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. ""Following the review into the tragic deaths of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes and Star Hobson, we also announced the launch of a new child protection ministerial group that will champion safeguarding at highest levels of government. ""We will set out an ambitious action plan later this year aimed at bringing about a fundamental shift in how we support the most vulnerable children and families.""

"Women are wasting their time and money buying do-at-home menopause-testing kits, top UK doctors say. The urine tests are not predictive enough to tell whether a woman is going through the phase when her periods will stop, they warn. Results could cause anxiety and confusion, and might even contribute to unplanned pregnancies, says the British Menopause Society. Manufacturers say the kits should never replace medical advice. One company that makes them said the tests could help women worried about the perimenopause, when periods can become erratic. A few companies sellUK-approved,externalmenopause tests online and in shops. They can be bought without a prescription, for about Â£10 for a pack of two. The tests, which give a result within minutes, accurately measure levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which helps manage the menstrual cycle. But experts say it is not a reliable marker of the menopause or perimenopause. The tests can be unhelpful and potentially misleading, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), along with other leading experts in women's health, says. NHS guidelines,externalalso discourage FSH testing for over-45s with classic menopausal symptoms - such as hot flushes - because it adds nothing diagnostically. The manufacturer of the Self Check Menopause test says while menopause cannot be defined by a single simple test, hormonal imbalance is the most important indicator. And a constant high FSH level may indicate ""the ovaries are not working"" and ""no egg production is happening"". But experts say the fact FSH levels fluctuate throughout the menstrual cycle and from month to month makes it a poor indicator. The Co-op Pharmacy website says women can discuss their results with a pharmacist. The Self Check website says its kits ""can alleviate the worry and tension that normally affect women during their menopausal years, especially those women who display acute symptoms that can disturb daily routine"". ""These kits bring a feeling of being in charge of your health by knowing your FSH levels and seeking medical help to combat any of them successfully,"" it says. Director Dr John Rees told BBC News: ""The pack includes two tests, the second test to be taken a week later and only if both tests are positive to consider menopause. ""Whatever the result, users of self-tests, including the Self Check Menopause test are instructed to speak with their doctor before taking any action on the result. ""The instructions provided with the tests are reviewed and agreed with the regulators prior to approval for use. ""Self-test kits are not meant to replace traditional healthcare pathways but can prompt people to speak with their doctor about their health concerns whether they have a positive or negative result."" A spokeswoman for the makers of another kit said: ""The instructions for use claims only that 'Flourish Menopause Test Kit can detect the presence of FSH in urine as soon as the concentration goes up from 25 mIU/mL [milli-international units per millilitre] and over' and does not claim that the test directly diagnoses menopause process. ""It should be used as an indicator only in conjunction with other methods."" Leading menopause and hormone doctor Annice Mukherjee, from theSociety of Endocrinology,external, said FSH urine tests were ""another example of exploitation of mid-life women by the commercial menopause industry, who have financial conflicts of interest"". She accused them of using misleading information about ""FSH sometimes being a helpful marker of menopause"" and called the perimenopause a ""hormone rollercoaster"". ""It's not helpful for women to access [FSH] directly,"" she said. ""It is not a reliable marker of perimenopause and can causes more confusion among women taking the test. ""At worst, misinterpretation of results can cause harm."" For example, a women might interpret a high reading to mean she is menopausal and unlikely to be fertile - but high FSH can also be seen just before the ovary releases an egg, so she could become pregnant. Similarly, a negative test does not necessarily indicate someone is not perimenopausal. The kits' instructions explain this -  and warn some medications, including oral contraceptives, can make the result unreliable. RCOG,externalspokesman consultant gynaecologist Haitham Hamoda, from King's College Hospital, who chairs theBritish Menopause Society,external, said: ""The RCOG does not recommend over-the-counter menopause tests as they are not a good method of detecting menopause or perimenopause. ""These tests are limited by only measuring FSH, rather than looking at the wider clinical picture. ""We would encourage women to seek support from a healthcare professional if they think they might be experiencing the menopause rather than purchasing these tests."" There is no single test The first sign is usually a change in the normal pattern of periods - they may become unusually light or heavy and irregular There may be other symptoms, such as hot flushes, night sweats and difficulty sleeping A doctor should be able to tell, based on age and symptoms Going through it before the age of 40 is unusual and a doctormay recommend seeing a specialist and having blood tests,external Source:NHS,external Have you used a menopause home-test kit?

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson on housing benefit changes: ""It's time to turn benefits to bricks."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has unveiled plans to allow benefits to be put towards mortgages in England, as he sought to relaunch his premiership. He made the ""benefits-to-bricks"" pledge in his first big speech since surviving a bid to oust him by Tory MPs. Speaking in Blackpool, he also vowed to extend a scheme to allow social tenants to buy their homes. But critics say the proposals are unworkable and would make the housing crisis worse. In Monday's confidence vote on Mr Johnson's leadership, four in 10 Tory MPs backed getting rid of him, amid anger over widespread Covid rule-breaking in Downing Street during lockdown. Under-fire Johnson vows to get on with the job Is the government meeting its new-homes target? Chris Mason: Boris Johnson faces political and economic gales There is also disquiet among Conservatives over the government's decision to raise National Insurance, while the cost of living is soaring and the public finances have been battered by the expense of dealing with Covid. In a wide-ranging speech aimed at demonstrating he has not run out of ideas and is focused on issues that most matter to voters, Mr Johnson promised more help ""over the next few weeks"" to deal with 40-year-high inflation driven by energy price rises. ""Global headwinds are strong... but our engines are stronger,"" said Mr Johnson, adding that ""we are on your side"" in cutting the cost of fuel, childcare, transport and other living expenses. ""And, while it's not going to be quick or easy, you can be confident that things will get better, that we will emerge from this a strong country with a healthy economy,"" the prime minister told the audience at Blackpool and The Fylde College. He said ""economic growth"" was the answer and he hoped tax cuts - which have been demanded by some Tory MPs - would come ""sooner rather than later"". Mr Johnson restated the government's commitment to extending a home-buying scheme, known as right to buy, to housing association tenants. He said he wanted to extend it ""within existing spending plans"" and ensure a ""one-for-one replacement"" of each home sold. This video can not be played Watch: Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says PM's new housing policy is the ""wrong approach"" The prime minister also said universal credit recipients would get to choose whether to spend their benefits on rent or put them towards a mortgage. The government will explore discounting Lifetime ISA and Help to Buy ISA savings from Universal Credit eligibility rules, Mr Johnson said. Currently, claimants are only eligible for universal credit if they have savings below Â£16,000, and Lifetime ISAs are included in this limit. Changing these policies would ""help millions realise the dream of home ownership"", Mr Johnson said. Housing benefits, which help low-income or unemployed people pay their rent, cost the government around Â£30bn a year, much of which goes to private landlords. A person is not usually eligible for the payments if they have a mortgage. This speech was in the diary before the confidence vote on Monday but it nevertheless became a chance to try and reset Boris Johnson's premiership. This was a prime minister who wanted to talk political plans - not personal problems. Mr Johnson wants to focus on ways to help households with costs - but there are big questions about how and when the policies announced today will be delivered. This won't be an overnight equivalent of Thatcher's council house scheme. The PM also failed to commit to the pledge to build 300,000 houses a year in England by 2025 - something which was in the 2019 Conservative general election manifesto. It's looked increasingly unlikely since the government dropped plans to reform the planning system in England to make it easier for developers to win approval. A reminder perhaps that housing pledges can often be easier in theory than in practice. About two million council homes in England have been sold under right to buy since 1980 Labour's shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy questioned whether people on benefits could afford mortgage deposits, saying: ""This speech was yet more evidence that the prime minister and his tired government are out of ideas. ""You can't solve a housing crisis with back-of-the-envelope policies that have no realistic chance of success."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""Boris Johnson has lost the confidence of his party, Parliament and the country. The desperate attempt to relaunch his leadership today will do nothing to win it back."" It's not entirely clear how the government's right-to-buy policy is going to work: There is already a shortage of social housing without selling properties - 1.1 million people are on waiting lists The government has not revealed who will be able to take advantage of the scheme, how much it will cost and whether it will be capped It's the third such pilot scheme - previous ones found that some housing association properties were not eligible to be sold and there was concern about the financial risks being taken on by participants While the government has said that there will be funding for housing associations to replace each home sold, previous pilots have had problems with replacements coming quickly enough or being like-for-like The policy depends on negotiations with housing associations, which will not necessarily want to take part. Council tenants in England have been able to buy their homes at a discount since 1980, when Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher introduced the policy. But the same is not true for people renting from housing associations, unless their property was once owned by a local authority and they lived in it during this period. Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, called Mr Johnson's housing proposals ""baffling, unworkable, and a dangerous gimmick"". Extending the right to buy would ""put our rapidly shrinking supply of social homes at even greater risk,"" she added. Right-to-buy: A tainted gift?
