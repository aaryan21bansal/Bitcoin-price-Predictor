"This video can not be played WATCH: Chris Fox takes a first look at Google's new Pixel 3a smartphones Google is to sell a range of lower-cost smartphones as part of an effort to jump-start sales of its Pixel brand. In addition, the company has shown off its first voice-controlled smart screen for the home to feature a camera. This allows it to offer more personalised features than a previous model, but also risks provoking a privacy backlash. Other announcements at its annual developers conference included enhancements to its search tool. The Pixel 3a and larger Pixel 3a XL will cost Â£399 and Â£469 respectively, making them roughlyhalf the price of the seven-month-old Pixel 3 originals. Until now, Google had charged one of the highest entry-point prices for an Android handset, with its basic model costing Â£70 more than Samsung's Galaxy S10e and Â£40 more than Huawei's P30, and no option to buy a ""mid-range"" alternative. The new versions share many of the features of the more expensive Pixels, including OLED (organic light-emitting diode) displays for rich colours and the firm's much-lauded Night Sight facility, which uses machine-learning based artificial intelligence to enhance images taken in low-light conditions. The new phones only feature a single selfie camera and have a plastic body In addition, they will also provide use of Google's new augmented reality maps, which superimpose arrow graphics over views of the scene ahead. This, the firm claims, will make it easier to judge which direction to set off in. But to help cut costs the new handsets: have a single selfie camera, excluding a second wider-angle version cannot be charged wirelessly have bodies made out of plastic rather than metal and glass use Qualcomm's mid-range Snapdragon 670 processor rather than the more powerful 845 chip the 3a XL has a smaller 6in display than the 3 XL's 6.3in model The new phones do, however, include a 3.5mm headphone socket unlike the premium versions. ""For us, what's important is for Pixel to get into the hands of more and more people,"" Mario Queiroz, chief of Google's product division, told the BBC. ""Most phones in this general price range are phones from last year or from two years ago, or they are phones that are 'specced' very differently and even have different brands. ""We wanted to bring a true Pixel experience to this price point."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Google shipped close to 20% more Pixel phones over the October-to-March period compared with the same six months the previous year, according to market research firm IDC. However, it still only accounted for a 0.3% share of the global smartphone market, making it the 26th bestselling brand. ""The Pixel 3's price-point in the ultra-high-end meant fierce competition from Apple, Huawei and Samsung,"" commented IDC's Marta Pinto. Pixel sales should also benefit from the fact that in the US the range will no longer be exclusive to one mobile network's stores. Allow Twitter content?

But one expert said the move to offer lower-cost models posed risks of its own. ""Many consumers are fed up with the spiralling cost of high-end smartphones,"" commented Ben Wood from the consultancy CCS Insight. ""However, this takes Google into dangerous territory from the perspective of competing with existing Android phone-makers. Licensees such as Samsung, which recently refreshed its mid-tier Galaxy A range, won't welcome additional competition at a time when the smartphone market is already in decline."" The Nest Hub Max adds a camera and has a bigger screen than its predecessor Another hardware launch at the IO event involved a larger version of Google's voice-controlled smart display for the home. The device now features a 10in, rather than 7in touchscreen and introduces a camera, which can be used for video chats as well as to provide home security via motion-triggered recordings saved online. The new machine is called the Nest Hub Max, and the existing smaller version is being renamed the Nest Home Hub, representing an extension to the brand. Nest used to be run as an independent smart home business within parent company Alphabet, but was subsumed by the Google division last year. The camera makes several features possible, including: the ability to control music and other software with hand gestures face-recognition to provide personalised greetings and suggestions when it detects different family members entering a room an automatic framing facility to keep a person's face centred as they move about while taking part in a video call The demo showed a woman silencing a Google Nest by raising her hand However, it is likely to raise privacy concerns. Google explicitly said it had excluded a camera in the original modelto help people feel comfortable placing it in their homes. However, it brings the company in line with Facebook and Amazon, which have released similar camera-enabled devices despite claims that theycould pose privacy threats,external. The Next Hub Max has a louder speaker than the earlier version For its part, Google has said a small green light will always signal when the camera is streaming footage and that nothing will be streamed or recorded unless the function is explicitly enabled by owners. It also told the BBC that captured footage would not be viewed by its staff in a similar fashion to how theysometimes listen to voice recordings to improve speech recognition. ""Footage from that Nest cam will not be used or reviewed,"" said product manager Edward Kenney. Earlier at IO, chief executive Sundar Pichai announced that Google's search results would soon start to include podcasts. Sundar Pichai showed off Duplex's newest automated booking facilities at the start of the event Users will be able to listen to the recordings directly from the results page, he said, or save them for later playback if they prefer. They will also be searchable by content as well as title. The firm's augmented reality chief Aparna Chennapragada was next on stage to demo how the technology - which mixes together computer graphics with real-world views - will also be used to enhance results. A shark took to the stage in Augmented Reality She revealed that relevant searches would now yield 3D models that can be rotated and viewed on Google's own page or superimposed over a camera-captured image of the surrounding area. This, she suggested, would help students explore new concepts or see how consumer goods would match with their current possessions. Allow Twitter content?

Apple has also taken time to promote augmented reality at its recent developer conferences, but outside of gaming the tech has proved more of a gimmick than a compelling feature for many users across their day-to-day activities. In a follow-up to last year's big announcement - a feature that allows Google to phone businesses and make computer-controlled voice bookings on a person's behalf - the company revealed plans to add fresh capabilities to its Duplex software. In the future, it said it aimed to make it possible for users to ask its virtual assistant to book a movie ticket or a rental car for their next trip, for example. It said its software would then automatically find a relevant rental car company and fill out all the forms including information about dates and vehicle preference by making reference to past choices and Gmail correspondence.

Duplex is available in most of the US but has yet to launch elsewhere. Other announcements included: an ""incognito mode"" for Google Maps, so the app can be used without keeping a record of past searches and travel the introduction of a ""dark theme"" to the next version of Android - a mode in which white text and icons are shown on dark backgrounds rather than the reverse. Google said use of the function should extend battery life ""Focus mode"" is also coming to Android devices in the autumn, which will allow users to disable distracting apps Google Assistant is getting voice-activated ""driving mode"". Users will be able to ask the Assistant to check their calendar for where they are going, and it will then suggest a route and ask whether they want to respond to messages or calls that come while en route. It will launch automatically once the phone links to the vehicle's Bluetooth connection Analysis:Dave Lee, North America technology reporter at Google IO What's most impressive this year is the extent to which Google can now do a lot of work on-device, rather than sending information - and personal data - back and forth to a server. Live text-captioning of video with a smartphone in airplane mode is truly an impressive technological feat. This is Google's strategy to combat Apple's ""what happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone"" publicity push, and it's likely to be effective - not to mention an approach we can get behind. But, as ever, this keynote was a bag of contradictions: A host of new features, and new products, that demand you look at a screen intently - followed by the company's flimsy ""commitment"" to helping us look at screens less often. It's also worth noting how Google is slowly chipping away at our privacy boundaries. Seven months ago, when it launched the Home Hub, the device didn't have a camera. The firm said it was ""so that it was comfortable to us in the private spaces of your home like your bedroom"". Now the Home Hub has been rebranded the Nest Hub, and the next version will have a camera after all. One feature is the ability to turn off its alarm by saying ""stop"" - no longer requiring the ""hey Google"" wake words. How long, I wonder, until Google tries to do away with wake words altogether by incentivising users to turn them off in return for new features? Google rounded off its event with details about how it is applying machine learning technologies beyond consumer goods. This included an effort to predict where floods are most likely to cause damage and work to spot cancer symptoms. Google says it will publish more details about its work to detect cancer in one of Nature's scientific journals Google AI's Dr Lily Peng gave the example of a lung cancer patient who had shown advanced symptoms of the disease one year after being given the all-clear. She said that five out of six human experts shown a scan had missed the early signs of the disease's recurrence because they were so minute. The Google model was trained on anonymised images obtained from the National Cancer Institute, Dr Peng added. ""By looking at many examples the model learns to detect malignancy with performance that meets or exceeds that of trained radiologists,"" she said. The research is likely to face further scrutiny when it is published by Nature soon. Cut-price Google Pixel gets AR maps.

"Mike Pompeo met with Barham Salih, the president of Iraq, in Baghdad US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made an unscheduled, fleeting visit to Iraq, amid growing tensions with Iran. Mr Pompeo cancelled a trip to Berlin to meet Iraqi leaders during a four-hour stop in the capital Baghdad. He told the leaders that the US did not ""want anybody interfering in their country"", and asked them to protect US troops in Iraq. The visit came days after the US deployed an aircraft carrier, USS Abraham Lincoln, to the region. Officials said the deployment was in response to threats to US forces and its allies from Iran. On Tuesday it was revealed the US was sending B-52 bombers. The US has given little information about the exact nature of the reported threat, which Iran has dismissed as nonsense. John Bolton, the US national security adviser, said only that the US was acting ""in response to a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings"" on announcing the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln on Sunday. Mr Pompeo is also due to visit London on Wednesday, where he is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Theresa May and British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt. While in Baghdad, the US secretary of state met the Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi and President Barham Salih, and explained the US's security concerns to them. He also asked them to protect US troops and citizens in the country. Mr Pompeo later said that the leaders ""provided assurances that they understood that was their responsibility"". Mr Pompeo, right, cancelled a planned visit to Germany in order to go to Baghdad ""We wanted them to know about the increased threat stream that we had seen, to give them a little bit more background so that they would have enough information that they could ensure that they were doing all that they could to provide protection for our team,"" he said. ""They understood, too, it's important for their country. We don't want anybody interfering in their country, certainly not by attacking another nation inside of Iraq, and there was complete agreement."" Speaking to reporters after the meeting, he also directly linked the visit to the recent escalation with Iran, which neighbours Iraq. US sends aircraft carrier and bombers to 'warn Iran' Iran nuclear deal: Rouhani to make an announcement Mr Pompeo said that he wanted to ""speak with the leadership there [in Iraq], to assure them that we stood ready to continue to ensure that Iraq is a sovereign, independent nation"". He also said that he wanted to help them become less dependent on energy deals with Iran. Acting Pentagon spokesman Charles Summers said in a statement that the US did ""not seek war with the Iranian regime, but we will defend US personnel, our allies and our interests in the region"". ""The deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and a bomber task force are considered a prudent step in response to indications of heightened Iranian readiness to conduct offensive operations against US forces and our interests,"" he added. A B-52 bomber task force is being deployed alongside the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group Officials first announced that the aircraft carrier was being sent to the Gulf on Sunday. Mr Bolton said at the time that it was to send ""a clear and unmistakable message to the Iranian regime that any attack on United States interest or on those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force"". In response, Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted that ""the #B_Team is at it again,external"". ""From announcements of naval movements (that actually occurred last month) to dire warnings about so-called 'Iranian threats',"" he added. ""If US and clients don't feel safe, it's because they're despised by the people of the region - blaming Iran won't reverse that."" Iran's state-run broadcaster Press TV also dismissed the deployment as ""a 'regularly scheduled' one by the US Navy, and Bolton has just tried to talk it up"". Tensions between the US and Iran can be traced back to Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979, which overthrew the pro-Western Shah and established a radical anti-US regime in its place. But relations have been particularly fraught between the two nations since President Trump took office in 2017. This most recent escalation comes on the eve of the anniversary of Mr Trump unilaterally withdrawing from a landmark nuclear deal the US and other nations had agreed with Iran in 2015. Under the accord, Iran had agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for relief from sanctions - sanctions that have since been reinstated. How Iranian TV reported the revolution in 1979 And last month, the White House said it would end exemptions from sanctions for five countries - China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey - that were still buying Iranian oil. At the same time the US also blacklisted Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps, designating it as a foreign terrorist group. The Trump administration hopes to compel Iran to negotiate a ""new deal"" that would cover not only its nuclear activities, but also its ballistic missile programme and what officials call its ""malign behaviour"" across the Middle East. The sanctions have led to a sharp downturn in Iran's economy, pushing the value of its currency to record lows, driving away foreign investors, and triggering protests. Iran has repeatedly threatened to retaliate to the US measures by blocking the Strait of Hormuz - though which about a fifth of all oil consumed globally pass.

"A British soldier has been killed by an elephant during a counter-poaching operation in Malawi. Mathew Talbot, 22, of the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards, was on patrol in Liwonde National Park on 5 May when he was charged by the animal. His commanding officer, Lt Col Ed Launders, described Guardsman Talbot as ""determined and big-hearted"". Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt said he served with ""great courage and professionalism"". She added: ""This tragic incident is a reminder of the danger our military faces as they protect some of the world's most endangered species from those who seek to profit from the criminal slaughter of wildlife."" Kensington Palace said the Duke of Cambridge was writing to Gdsm Talbot's family to offer his condolences. 'Why I'm helping stop poachers in Malawi' UK troops join Malawi anti-poaching fight South Africa: Poacher killed by elephant Gdsm Talbot, who was from the West Midlands, was serving in his first operational deployment, the Ministry of Defence said. Mathew Talbot had volunteered to support counter-poaching operations The patrol of armed British army soldiers and African Park Rangers was walking through tall grass - up to 7ft (2.1m) high - when they disturbed an unseen herd of elephants. One of them charged at Gdsm Talbot. He died soon after from his injuries. No-one else on the patrol was hurt. He leaves behind his father Steven, his mother Michelle, his sisters Aimee and Isabel, and his girlfriend, Olivia. In a statement, the MoD said Gdsm Talbot ""was not unfamiliar"" with Africa and had volunteered to support counter-poaching in Malawi. ""With his keen interest in military history he was proud to have joined a regiment with such a rich and long lineage,"" it added. Operation Corded, the name given to the Army's counter-poaching deployment in Malawi, assists in the training of rangers in a bid to help them crack down on the illegal wildlife trade. Park rangers are taught skills such as tracking, partnered patrolling, communications, surveillance, and intelligence-sharing - with the first deployment taking place in August 2017. The former defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, announced the expansion of the UK's counter-poaching training at two parks in Malawi - doubling the number of rangers mentored by soldiers to 120 - in 2018. Gdsm Talbot's company commander, Maj Richard Wright, said that while he had only known the soldier for a short time, ""he never failed to make me smile"". Lt Col Launders added: ""Mathew was loved by his brothers in arms in the Coldstream Guards. We will sorely miss his humour, selflessness and unbeatable spirit."" Shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith described the death as ""tragic news"". She added: ""It underlines the dedication and selflessness of our armed forces personnel serving across the world. ""My thoughts are with his family at this difficult time."" Elephant poaching is a huge problem across Africa - some estimates say 30,000 are killed every year - and there are probably only around 450,000 left. In many places it has become literally a war against poachers - that's why rangers are trained by British troops. But there are different views over how to stop the illegal ivory trade. International campaigns - backed by countries like Kenya - want a complete end to all ivory trade to prevent criminals exploiting permit loopholes. But some southern African countries which account for the majority of Africa's elephants, believe limited and well-regulated trade in ivory can raise money to pay for conservation. Botswana, which has been hosting an elephant summit over the past few days, has perhaps 130,000 of the animals - more than anywhere else - and has problems with human and elephant conflict. The peculiar gift of elephant-foot stools to visiting leaderswas a strong message in support of trade. Under the management of a new president, it looks likely to re-introduce hunting -which is popular with rural voters - in an election year.

"This video can not be played Falklands veteran left isolated by navy axe A Falklands veteran forced out of the Royal Navy over his sexuality plans to sue for the return of military honours. Joe Ousalice, 68, served for nearly 18 years but was discharged in 1993 when there was a ban on LGBT people serving in the armed forces. His lawyers want other military personnel who were dismissed over their sexuality to have lost medals returned. The MoD said it would be ""inappropriate"" to comment as legal proceedings are ongoing. A spokesperson added: ""We are currently looking at how personnel discharged from service because of their sexuality, or now abolished sexual offences, can have their medals returned."" Mr Ousalice's lawyer Emma Norton says the MoD has made similar statements in the past. Mr Ousalice is a former radio operator who now lives in Southampton. He served in the Falklands War in which he lost two comrades, did six tours of duty in Northern Ireland and was also posted to conflict zones in the Middle East. ""I loved life in the navy, because of the comradeship,"" he said. ""It was my life."" His work was praised by his seniors and he was awarded a Long Service and Good Conduct medal in 1991. But he knew when he joined up that he had to hide the fact that he was bisexual. ""It was a double life I was living. I was watching every day what I was saying, what I was doing."" He says that when ashore he never visited gay pubs and on board ship he didn't associate with sailors who he knew were gay. ""I knew if I did I would have the SIB (Special Investigation Branch) on my back doing covert operations, shadowing me with cameras, taking photographs of what I was getting up to."" Mr Ousalice says he would never visit gay pubs as he feared investigators would track him But throughout his career he felt the SIB was monitoring his behaviour and he says he was regularly questioned by investigators. While ashore in 1992, he was arrested by civilian police and charged with gross indecency with another man. He pleaded not guilty but was convicted. He lost an appeal but his sentence was reduced to a conditional discharge. Battling to be Bi Soon afterwards he was accused by the navy of indecently assaulting another sailor. ""It wasn't true,"" he said. ""The navy had interviewed me several times about my sexuality and they could never get shut of me."" At a court martial he was cleared of the assault charge but was found guilty of being in bed with the other sailor - something he has always denied. He says he was also forced to disclose his sexuality. He was dismissed on the grounds that his conduct was prejudicial to good order and naval discipline. An officer wrote: ""He may attempt to corrupt others in the future"", adding that ""the needs of the service must come first"". Mr Ousalice's medal and three Good Conduct Badges were taken from him. Joe Ousalice (on right) receiving a medal ""After the court martial was completed a guy came in with a pair of scissors and said 'sorry mate, I need your medal' and just cut the medal off me. ""The fact that I had been to the Middle East, to the Falklands, to Northern Ireland six times means a lot to me and that medal is proof to me that I was good enough for all those years and yet somebody can just come and take it away from you."" He was allowed to keep his medals from the Falklands and Northern Ireland. Mr Ousalice had hoped that the lifting of the ban on LGBT people in the armed forces in 2000 would help him in his long battle to have his medal returned. Down the years he has appealed to politicians of both main parties without success. Now, human rights organisation Liberty has taken on his case and plans to sue the MoD. The group argues that Mr Ousalice was discharged ""entirely because of his sexuality"" and it is calling on the MoD to apologise. Emma Norton, its head of legal casework, argues that the MoD's actions infringed Mr Ousalice's human rights. Mr Ousalice (highlighted) has not sought compensation and says he just wants his medal back After being discharged, Mr Ousalice was unemployed and penniless - having to scavenge for potatoes at a local farm to feed himself. There was also the emotional toll of being forced out of the job he loved: ""It was like a bereavement. I'd lost all those other people I worked with."" He found other work but his financial losses also included a reduced pension. He has never sought any compensation. Now in poor health, he added: ""I'm disgusted at the way I have been treated and I just want my medal back."" Thrown out of the navy for being gay.

"Every adult in the UK should receive a weekly basic income of Â£48, according to the recommendations in a new report. The move could be paid for by scrapping more than 1,000 tax reliefs,a report by Professor Guy Standing, a professor at SOAS University suggests.,external The Labour Party - which has previously floated the idea of a basic income - said it would study the report ahead of drawing up its next manifesto. A universal basic income is already being trialled in other countries. The report, entitled Basic Income as Common Dividends: Piloting a Transformative Policy, was written by Professor Standing, an authority on the concept of the basic income. He was asked to write it by the Progressive Economy Forum, a left-leaning group of economists. Advocates of a basic income say it reduces poverty and inequality by providing a guaranteed income. But Conservative deputy chairman Helen Whately said it would be ""a kick in the teeth to hardworking taxpayers"". ""It would mean benefit payments for everyone, from Premier League footballers to investment bankers and even prisoners, costing billions, while hammering ordinary workers in the pocket by scrapping the tax-free income allowance."" The Treasury also criticised the report, saying it was ""committed to supporting working people keep more of what they earn, while providing a strong and sustainable safety net for those who need it"". ""Our policies are highly redistributive - this year the lowest income households will receive over Â£4 in public spending for every Â£1 they pay in tax, while the highest income households will contribute over Â£5 in tax for every Â£1 they receive in public spending,"" it added. Universal basic income, or UBI, means that everyone gets a set monthly income, regardless of means. The author of this latest report, Professor Guy Standing, told the BBC: ""A basic income would be paid in cash, a moderate amount, a basic amount unconditionally to each individual man and woman equally, a smaller amount for a child and the good thing is it would be unconditional and it wouldn't be means tested and it would be a right, an economic right."" Professor Standing said the amount would change over time as the funding for a basic income is built up. However, initially he said the weekly sum would be Â£48, which he said would be a ""significant amount for many people"". ""Now Â£48 is not a lot for most people but for a lot of people out there they have Â£20 left at the end of the week after they've paid their rent and their food, so this is a significant amount for many people."" A lower sum would be paid to children, under these proposals. A rough calculation shows that if about 60 million people were paid Â£48 a week, that would come to about Â£150bn a year. Professor Standing said there are 1,156 tax reliefs in the UK at the moment and if they were scrapped that would pay for a basic income. ""What that means [is] it's income foregone by the Treasury. Most of these tax reliefs didn't have any economic rationale and they're giveaways that are increasing inequality. ""If we phased out those tax reliefs the total revenue foregone by the Treasury from tax reliefs is Â£420bn per year and that's their own estimates, not mine,"" he added. Some countries have tested paying a basic income to citizens. In western Kenya, the government is paying every adult in one village $22 a month for 12 years to see if a regular payment can help lift them out of poverty. The Netherlands and Italy have also launched trials, while Scotland is considering piloting basic income schemes in four cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell recently said that Labour would include a plan for universal basic income in its next general election manifesto. Finland basic income 'did not help jobless' Ontario cuts basic income project short Basic income pilot considered in Glasgow However, a two-year trial in Finland, where a sample of 2,000 unemployed adults were given â¬560 a month, was not extended. And in Canada, Ontario's newly elected centre-right government said it was scrapping a three-year basic income pilot project that hoped to discover whether it was better than existing welfare schemes. No, there have been a couple of similar studies this year alone. In March the New Economics Foundation think tankpublished a report,externalin which it proposed replacing the personal tax allowance with a Weekly National Allowance of Â£48. However, it did not call it a basic income. A week later the leftwing think tank Compass, suggested a universal basic income of Â£60 for each adult, Â£175 for those over 65 and Â£40 for children under the age of 18. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, who is attending the launch of the independent study on Tuesday, welcomed the report. He said: ""This report is an important contribution to the debate around inequality, austerity, poverty and how we establish a fair and just economic system. ""There have been pilots of 'basic income' elsewhere and Guy Standing has looked at them and come forward with proposals. ""Whatever mechanism we use, whether 'basic income' or another, we have to lead in developing a radical mechanism aimed at eradicating poverty, but also means testing. ""We will be studying the contents and recommendations of this report carefully as we put together our reform policies for the next Labour government."" Opponents of a basic income are worried about how it would be paid for and what cuts would have to be made elsewhere. And the government has previously said a universal basic income would not work for those who need more support, such as disabled people and those with caring responsibilities.

"Union organiser Lydia Hughes joined Uber drivers in their strike Hundreds of Uber drivers in London, Birmingham, Nottingham and Glasgow have staged a protest against the firm. They will be joined by drivers in the US cities of New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, Philadelphia and Washington DC in striking over pay and work conditions. The protests come days before the company lists its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Uber said drivers were ""at the heart of our service"". The United Private Hire Drivers Branch of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) said the nine-hour boycott of the app would take place between 07:00 and 16:00. Union members organised a protest near Uber's London offices In the US, members of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance will strike from 07:00 to 09:00 local time. There, Uber drivers will be joined by members working for Lyft and other taxi-booking apps. Union branch co-ordinator Lydia Hughes joined Uber drivers in their strike today. ""They're going public and their founders are going to make billions off the hard work of Uber drivers who make the app run,"" she told World Service radio. Drivers ""are demanding rights, a minimum wage, holiday pay and there's no reason they don't deserve that."" Uber drivers were also protesting in New York The unions would like to cut the commission the taxi-hailing apps take. The IWGB in the UK said it would like Uber's commissions to be reduced from 25% to 15% and for fares to be increased to Â£2 a mile from about Â£1.25. The NYTWA in New York said it wanted commissions of 15% to 20% and better job security. ""I'm striking for my kid's future. I have a five-year-old son, and I drive for Uber to support him,"" said Sonam Lama, a NYTWA member and Uber driver since 2015. This video can not be played 'I was working more than 60 hours a week' An Uber spokeswoman said: ""Drivers are at the heart of our service - we can't succeed without them - and thousands of people come into work at Uber every day focused on how to make their experience better, on and off the road. ""Whether it's being able to track your earnings or stronger insurance protections, we'll continue working to improve the experience for and with drivers."" The company has argued previously that it is transparent when it comes to pay and that drivers have earned more than $78bn (Â£59.7bn) since 2015, as well as $1.2bn in tips since tipping was introduced on its software in July 2017. Uber last month warned it ""may not achieve profitability"" when it released details of its share plan listing. Uber said that its most recent annual sales rose to $11.2bn and losses narrowed to $3bn. Traffic grinds to a halt during a protest against Uber on 12 April in Buenos Aires But it also said it expected operating expenses to ""increase significantly"". The company did not disclose how it will price its shares on 9 May, but it is reportedly targeting a range of $48 to $55. That would potentially give the 10-year old firm a value of up to $100bn, making it the biggest initial public offering this year. Uber is also expected to raise about $10bn through the flotation. Last year, Uber lost an appealagainst a ruling that its drivers should be treated as workers rather than self-employed. In March, German cab drivers protested in Munich against the liberalisation of the Taxi market and Uber In 2016 a tribunal ruled drivers Mr Farrar and Yaseen Aslam were Uber staff and entitled to holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the minimum wage and the ruling was upheld by the Court of Appeal. But Uber pointed out that one of the three judges backed its case and said it would appeal to the Supreme Court.

"Labour's team including Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer have been negotiating with the government ""Constructive and detailed"" - that sounds quite positive - Number 10's description of the talks today. ""Robust"" - not quite so chirpy - Labour's use of political speak for what most of us might call a bit tricky. ""Disingenuous"" - oh dear - a different Labour source's description of ministers' claim that what they were putting on the table in the cross-party talks today was something genuinely new on the vexed question of customs arrangements after we leave the EU. As we reported this morning there didn't really seem to be much from the government that was concrete beyond what's already possible under the agreement that's been hammered out with Brussels. The divorce deal and indeed yes, you guessed it, the backstop, both have forms of temporary customs unions in them to make trade between the UK and the EU easier. Of course the precise language and mechanisms matter enormously. But was there some big shiny new offer today? The short answer is: no. And after hours of talks this afternoon, Labour sources suggest ministers in the end more or less admitted that in pointed discussions. May to meet senior Tory amid calls to resign Brexit: A really simple guide UK will take part in European elections As we've talked about here before, the cross-party talks process is real. Plenty of people in the Tory party hate it. Plenty of people in the Labour Party hate it. But inside both leaders' camps, there is a genuine desire, more intense since they both had a bad night at the polls on Thursday, to see if they can sketch out a joint escape route from the mess of Brexit. But the historically awful result for the prime minister does not seem to have shocked her into ditching her red lines - at least not yet. It's important to understand this process is always unlikely to end up with some kind of joint defining pact - sources involved joke about the preposterous idea of some kind of May-Corbyn Rose Garden love-in - fond or awful memories of that summer's day when the Cameron-Clegg bromance was born in public (take your pick which). The fact the talks have gone on for so long hint that there is serious merit in finding some kind of agreement on some kind of process. At the very least senior figures in the government hope that the talks might mean Labour would allow the Brexit legislation to move on to its next phase. In nerd terms, this is to allow the Withdrawal Bill to get through its so-called ""second reading"", knowing that at the next stage in Parliament where a committee of MPs would pore over every line, multiple layers of objections would be made, suggestions and changes put forward and then voted on, before finally, the bill would have its third reading, when MPs are able to give their final yes or no. It is hard right now though to make a call on whether that is viable. One former minister, experienced and not prone to make wild prediction, told me Number 10 was in ""la la land"" if they believed that could happen. About half an hour later, another former and experienced minister told me they believe, in fact, it will fly and perhaps by the end of this month. Whoever you ask, it is clear it is not straightforward. So when the two teams sit down again on Wednesday afternoon, whether it is ""constructive"" or ""robust"", there's still an awful lot to do.

"The UK will return 73 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) to Brussels and Strasbourg. The election happens every five years in EU countries. Voters must be registered to vote, be 18 years old or over on 23 May, be a British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizen or a citizen of an EU country. You have to be resident at a UK address (or a British citizen living abroad who has been registered to vote in the UK in the last 15 years) and not be legally excluded from voting. The deadline to register for the EU elections has now passed so anyone who has not already registered will not be able to take part. A party-by-party guide to the UK's European elections How do European elections work? Why the European elections couldn't be avoided Pollwatch: European elections If you are a citizen of an EU country and are resident in the UK, you can vote either in the UK or in your home country. In either case, you must have registered before the deadline. Voters will choose 73 MEPs in 12 multi-member regional constituencies. Each region has a different number of MEPs based on its population. MEPs are elected in order as listed by their party, based on the parties' total share of the vote in each region. In the nine English regions, Wales and Scotland, the number of MEPs is calculated using a form of proportional representation known as the D'Hondt formula, a complex system devised by Belgian mathematician and lawyer Victor D'Hondt in the late 19th Century. The process is slightly different in Northern Ireland, where the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system is used.Here is a guide to how the two work. We havea guide hereon what we know so far about how the main parties are preparing for the 23 May polls. The UK will go to the polls on Thursday 23 May, between 07:00 and 22:00 BST. The Netherlands also votes that day, but voting in other EU nations will take place at varying times over the following three days, with the whole process completed by 22:00 BST on Sunday 26 May. At the polling station, you will be given a long ballot paper listing all the parties putting up candidates in your region and candidates' names, as well as any independents standing. To vote for a party or individual, put a cross inside the box next to their name. If you live in England, Wales and Scotland, you are only allowed to choose one party or individual to vote for. In Northern Ireland - which uses a different electoral system - voters are able to rank the parties in order of preference. For instance, if there are five parties standing, voters can rank them from one to five, putting a one next to their first choice. Here is the European Parliament's own explainer,externalof how it all works. Change, in terms of both MEPs and vote share, is compared to the results of the last election in 2014. It doesn't take account of any changes between elections caused by defections or internal party re-organisation. National parties don't have to declare which European group they're affiliated with until they have been elected and start sitting with that group. Any people elected for national parties that we don't know the European allegiance of will go in to an 'Others' category at first, which will slowly reduce down to zero as MEPs either announce which European group they'll sit with or declare themselves as non-attached members or independents. That process could take several weeks. Any MEPs elected for Emmanuel Macron's En Marche party will fall in to this category at first, as will any for Change UK, as both were formed after the 2014 election and have no sitting MEPs. We know where Nigel Farage's Brexit Party will sit because several former-UKIP MEPs that have defected to the party have already joined the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group. Our vote share figures also only come from national parties where we know which European group they'll sit in. If MEPs from the same national party sit in different European groups, we split the share of the vote their party received in the same proportion. So if a national party gets 300,000 votes and three MEPs, but two sit with the centre-right EPP and one sits in the conservative ECR, we'll give 200,000 votes to the EPP and 100,000 to the ECR. MEPs sit and vote in groups with like-minded politicians from the other member states, not necessarily with people from the same country. For example, from 2014-2019 the 20 UK Labour MEPs sat with an Alliance of Socialists and Democrats. Most UK Conservatives were in a group called the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, and the one serving Liberal Democrat MEP sat with an Alliance of Liberals and Democrats. Members of national parties don't have to sit in the same European grouping as one another, but most do. Under EU rules these groups need to have at least 25 members, made up of MEPs from at least a quarter of EU member states (currently seven out of 28). This means that some groups might not be able to re-form after the election, if they lose members from certain countries or go below 25 overall. It's also possible for MEPs to not belong to any political group. They are known as non-attached members or independents. For our results, we'll be treating the groups as they are before the election and assuming that all MEPs from the same national party will sit in the same European groups until we know otherwise. More about each group on the European Parliament website.,external Counting is also done on a country-by-country basis - but the results are kept secret until all voting is finished. They will be announced from 22:00 BST on 26 May. Where do the parties stand on Brexit? Pollwatch: European elections A really simple guide to the European elections How do European elections work?

""Today, we are so much more than simply neighbours: we are friends and natural partners, bound together by our common experience, mutual interests and shared values, and deeply invested in each other's futures,"" he said. The prince and the Duchess of Cornwall met Chancellor Angela Merkel ""Whatever is negotiated and agreed between governments and institutions, it is more clear to me than it has ever been, that the bonds between us will, and must, endure."" The prince continued: ""Our countries and our people have been through so much together. ""As we look towards the future, I can only hope that we can also pledge to redouble our commitment to each other and to the ties between us. ""In so doing, we can ensure that our continent will never again see the division and conflict of the past; that together, we will continue to be an indispensable force for good in our world; and that the friendships and partnerships that bind us together will continue to create opportunity for us all.""

"Every adult in the UK should receive a weekly basic income of Â£48, according to the recommendations in a new report. The move could be paid for by scrapping more than 1,000 tax reliefs,a report by Professor Guy Standing, a professor at SOAS University suggests.,external The Labour Party - which has previously floated the idea of a basic income - said it would study the report ahead of drawing up its next manifesto. A universal basic income is already being trialled in other countries. The report, entitled Basic Income as Common Dividends: Piloting a Transformative Policy, was written by Professor Standing, an authority on the concept of the basic income. He was asked to write it by the Progressive Economy Forum, a left-leaning group of economists. Advocates of a basic income say it reduces poverty and inequality by providing a guaranteed income. But Conservative deputy chairman Helen Whately said it would be ""a kick in the teeth to hardworking taxpayers"". ""It would mean benefit payments for everyone, from Premier League footballers to investment bankers and even prisoners, costing billions, while hammering ordinary workers in the pocket by scrapping the tax-free income allowance."" The Treasury also criticised the report, saying it was ""committed to supporting working people keep more of what they earn, while providing a strong and sustainable safety net for those who need it"". ""Our policies are highly redistributive - this year the lowest income households will receive over Â£4 in public spending for every Â£1 they pay in tax, while the highest income households will contribute over Â£5 in tax for every Â£1 they receive in public spending,"" it added. Universal basic income, or UBI, means that everyone gets a set monthly income, regardless of means. The author of this latest report, Professor Guy Standing, told the BBC: ""A basic income would be paid in cash, a moderate amount, a basic amount unconditionally to each individual man and woman equally, a smaller amount for a child and the good thing is it would be unconditional and it wouldn't be means tested and it would be a right, an economic right."" Professor Standing said the amount would change over time as the funding for a basic income is built up. However, initially he said the weekly sum would be Â£48, which he said would be a ""significant amount for many people"". ""Now Â£48 is not a lot for most people but for a lot of people out there they have Â£20 left at the end of the week after they've paid their rent and their food, so this is a significant amount for many people."" A lower sum would be paid to children, under these proposals. A rough calculation shows that if about 60 million people were paid Â£48 a week, that would come to about Â£150bn a year. Professor Standing said there are 1,156 tax reliefs in the UK at the moment and if they were scrapped that would pay for a basic income. ""What that means [is] it's income foregone by the Treasury. Most of these tax reliefs didn't have any economic rationale and they're giveaways that are increasing inequality. ""If we phased out those tax reliefs the total revenue foregone by the Treasury from tax reliefs is Â£420bn per year and that's their own estimates, not mine,"" he added. Some countries have tested paying a basic income to citizens. In western Kenya, the government is paying every adult in one village $22 a month for 12 years to see if a regular payment can help lift them out of poverty. The Netherlands and Italy have also launched trials, while Scotland is considering piloting basic income schemes in four cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell recently said that Labour would include a plan for universal basic income in its next general election manifesto. Finland basic income 'did not help jobless' Ontario cuts basic income project short Basic income pilot considered in Glasgow However, a two-year trial in Finland, where a sample of 2,000 unemployed adults were given â¬560 a month, was not extended. And in Canada, Ontario's newly elected centre-right government said it was scrapping a three-year basic income pilot project that hoped to discover whether it was better than existing welfare schemes. No, there have been a couple of similar studies this year alone. In March the New Economics Foundation think tankpublished a report,externalin which it proposed replacing the personal tax allowance with a Weekly National Allowance of Â£48. However, it did not call it a basic income. A week later the leftwing think tank Compass, suggested a universal basic income of Â£60 for each adult, Â£175 for those over 65 and Â£40 for children under the age of 18. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, who is attending the launch of the independent study on Tuesday, welcomed the report. He said: ""This report is an important contribution to the debate around inequality, austerity, poverty and how we establish a fair and just economic system. ""There have been pilots of 'basic income' elsewhere and Guy Standing has looked at them and come forward with proposals. ""Whatever mechanism we use, whether 'basic income' or another, we have to lead in developing a radical mechanism aimed at eradicating poverty, but also means testing. ""We will be studying the contents and recommendations of this report carefully as we put together our reform policies for the next Labour government.""

The rear of the home was blown out by a series of explosions at the property in The Street in Lidgate, near Newmarket in Suffolk. Crews began tackling the blaze at about midday and specialist dogs were later brought in after two people were ""unaccounted for"". The cause of the explosion is unknown and a joint fire and police investigation is taking place. Officers said the fire was believed to have been caused by a gas explosion. Police said the road was likely to remain closed ""for quite some time"" One neighbour said it rattled the windows of homes further along the road, and described it as a ""huge explosion"". Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service said it had sent four crews to deal with the blaze. Fire officers had spent the afternoon trying to establish the whereabouts of the two missing people. Incident commander Darren Reeve said: ""We are working extremely hard to try and identify if we have anyone in or not."" Police said the road was likely to remain closed ""for quite some time"".

"Singer Don McLean has criticised a US university after a lifetime achievement award was rescinded because of his 2016 arrest for domestic abuse. The American Pie star was due to be presented with the George and Ira Gershwin Award by the UCLA Student Alumni Association. But it withdrew the honour, saying it ""rejects any behaviour - including violence and the threat of violence"". McLean responded: ""This has been all over the internet for three years."" Although he denied physically assaulting now-ex-wife Patrisha McLean, the singer pleaded guilty to domestic violence assault in 2016 as part of a plea agreement after police were called to a disturbance at his home. The charges were dismissed in 2017 under the terms of the deal, which included staying out of trouble for a year. Don McLean finalises divorce with wife McLean denies further assault charges What do American Pie's lyrics really mean? Since their divorce, Mrs McLean - whoalleges a pattern of abuse going back three decades- has become an advocate speaking against domestic abuse. ""You... took [the award] back because you found out about my squabble with my ex wife,"" McLean wrote. ""This has been all over the internet for three years. Are you people morons? This is settled law."" Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

Previous recipients include Linkin Park, The Who, Alanis Morissette and Dame Julie Andrews. In a statementreported by the Portland Press Herald,external, the Student Alumni Association said: ""We extend our support to survivors of domestic violence.""

"This video can not be played WATCH: Chris Fox takes a first look at Google's new Pixel 3a smartphones Google is to sell a range of lower-cost smartphones as part of an effort to jump-start sales of its Pixel brand. In addition, the company has shown off its first voice-controlled smart screen for the home to feature a camera. This allows it to offer more personalised features than a previous model, but also risks provoking a privacy backlash. Other announcements at its annual developers conference included enhancements to its search tool. The Pixel 3a and larger Pixel 3a XL will cost Â£399 and Â£469 respectively, making them roughlyhalf the price of the seven-month-old Pixel 3 originals. Until now, Google had charged one of the highest entry-point prices for an Android handset, with its basic model costing Â£70 more than Samsung's Galaxy S10e and Â£40 more than Huawei's P30, and no option to buy a ""mid-range"" alternative. The new versions share many of the features of the more expensive Pixels, including OLED (organic light-emitting diode) displays for rich colours and the firm's much-lauded Night Sight facility, which uses machine-learning based artificial intelligence to enhance images taken in low-light conditions. The new phones only feature a single selfie camera and have a plastic body In addition, they will also provide use of Google's new augmented reality maps, which superimpose arrow graphics over views of the scene ahead. This, the firm claims, will make it easier to judge which direction to set off in. But to help cut costs the new handsets: have a single selfie camera, excluding a second wider-angle version cannot be charged wirelessly have bodies made out of plastic rather than metal and glass use Qualcomm's mid-range Snapdragon 670 processor rather than the more powerful 845 chip the 3a XL has a smaller 6in display than the 3 XL's 6.3in model The new phones do, however, include a 3.5mm headphone socket unlike the premium versions. ""For us, what's important is for Pixel to get into the hands of more and more people,"" Mario Queiroz, chief of Google's product division, told the BBC. ""Most phones in this general price range are phones from last year or from two years ago, or they are phones that are 'specced' very differently and even have different brands. ""We wanted to bring a true Pixel experience to this price point."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Google shipped close to 20% more Pixel phones over the October-to-March period compared with the same six months the previous year, according to market research firm IDC. However, it still only accounted for a 0.3% share of the global smartphone market, making it the 26th bestselling brand. ""The Pixel 3's price-point in the ultra-high-end meant fierce competition from Apple, Huawei and Samsung,"" commented IDC's Marta Pinto. Pixel sales should also benefit from the fact that in the US the range will no longer be exclusive to one mobile network's stores. Allow Twitter content?

But one expert said the move to offer lower-cost models posed risks of its own. ""Many consumers are fed up with the spiralling cost of high-end smartphones,"" commented Ben Wood from the consultancy CCS Insight. ""However, this takes Google into dangerous territory from the perspective of competing with existing Android phone-makers. Licensees such as Samsung, which recently refreshed its mid-tier Galaxy A range, won't welcome additional competition at a time when the smartphone market is already in decline."" The Nest Hub Max adds a camera and has a bigger screen than its predecessor Another hardware launch at the IO event involved a larger version of Google's voice-controlled smart display for the home. The device now features a 10in, rather than 7in touchscreen and introduces a camera, which can be used for video chats as well as to provide home security via motion-triggered recordings saved online. The new machine is called the Nest Hub Max, and the existing smaller version is being renamed the Nest Home Hub, representing an extension to the brand. Nest used to be run as an independent smart home business within parent company Alphabet, but was subsumed by the Google division last year. The camera makes several features possible, including: the ability to control music and other software with hand gestures face-recognition to provide personalised greetings and suggestions when it detects different family members entering a room an automatic framing facility to keep a person's face centred as they move about while taking part in a video call The demo showed a woman silencing a Google Nest by raising her hand However, it is likely to raise privacy concerns. Google explicitly said it had excluded a camera in the original modelto help people feel comfortable placing it in their homes. However, it brings the company in line with Facebook and Amazon, which have released similar camera-enabled devices despite claims that theycould pose privacy threats,external. The Next Hub Max has a louder speaker than the earlier version For its part, Google has said a small green light will always signal when the camera is streaming footage and that nothing will be streamed or recorded unless the function is explicitly enabled by owners. It also told the BBC that captured footage would not be viewed by its staff in a similar fashion to how theysometimes listen to voice recordings to improve speech recognition. ""Footage from that Nest cam will not be used or reviewed,"" said product manager Edward Kenney. Earlier at IO, chief executive Sundar Pichai announced that Google's search results would soon start to include podcasts. Sundar Pichai showed off Duplex's newest automated booking facilities at the start of the event Users will be able to listen to the recordings directly from the results page, he said, or save them for later playback if they prefer. They will also be searchable by content as well as title. The firm's augmented reality chief Aparna Chennapragada was next on stage to demo how the technology - which mixes together computer graphics with real-world views - will also be used to enhance results. A shark took to the stage in Augmented Reality She revealed that relevant searches would now yield 3D models that can be rotated and viewed on Google's own page or superimposed over a camera-captured image of the surrounding area. This, she suggested, would help students explore new concepts or see how consumer goods would match with their current possessions. Allow Twitter content?

Apple has also taken time to promote augmented reality at its recent developer conferences, but outside of gaming the tech has proved more of a gimmick than a compelling feature for many users across their day-to-day activities. In a follow-up to last year's big announcement - a feature that allows Google to phone businesses and make computer-controlled voice bookings on a person's behalf - the company revealed plans to add fresh capabilities to its Duplex software. In the future, it said it aimed to make it possible for users to ask its virtual assistant to book a movie ticket or a rental car for their next trip, for example. It said its software would then automatically find a relevant rental car company and fill out all the forms including information about dates and vehicle preference by making reference to past choices and Gmail correspondence.

Duplex is available in most of the US but has yet to launch elsewhere. Other announcements included: an ""incognito mode"" for Google Maps, so the app can be used without keeping a record of past searches and travel the introduction of a ""dark theme"" to the next version of Android - a mode in which white text and icons are shown on dark backgrounds rather than the reverse. Google said use of the function should extend battery life ""Focus mode"" is also coming to Android devices in the autumn, which will allow users to disable distracting apps Google Assistant is getting voice-activated ""driving mode"". Users will be able to ask the Assistant to check their calendar for where they are going, and it will then suggest a route and ask whether they want to respond to messages or calls that come while en route. It will launch automatically once the phone links to the vehicle's Bluetooth connection Analysis:Dave Lee, North America technology reporter at Google IO What's most impressive this year is the extent to which Google can now do a lot of work on-device, rather than sending information - and personal data - back and forth to a server. Live text-captioning of video with a smartphone in airplane mode is truly an impressive technological feat. This is Google's strategy to combat Apple's ""what happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone"" publicity push, and it's likely to be effective - not to mention an approach we can get behind. But, as ever, this keynote was a bag of contradictions: A host of new features, and new products, that demand you look at a screen intently - followed by the company's flimsy ""commitment"" to helping us look at screens less often. It's also worth noting how Google is slowly chipping away at our privacy boundaries. Seven months ago, when it launched the Home Hub, the device didn't have a camera. The firm said it was ""so that it was comfortable to us in the private spaces of your home like your bedroom"". Now the Home Hub has been rebranded the Nest Hub, and the next version will have a camera after all. One feature is the ability to turn off its alarm by saying ""stop"" - no longer requiring the ""hey Google"" wake words. How long, I wonder, until Google tries to do away with wake words altogether by incentivising users to turn them off in return for new features? Google rounded off its event with details about how it is applying machine learning technologies beyond consumer goods. This included an effort to predict where floods are most likely to cause damage and work to spot cancer symptoms. Google says it will publish more details about its work to detect cancer in one of Nature's scientific journals Google AI's Dr Lily Peng gave the example of a lung cancer patient who had shown advanced symptoms of the disease one year after being given the all-clear. She said that five out of six human experts shown a scan had missed the early signs of the disease's recurrence because they were so minute. The Google model was trained on anonymised images obtained from the National Cancer Institute, Dr Peng added. ""By looking at many examples the model learns to detect malignancy with performance that meets or exceeds that of trained radiologists,"" she said. The research is likely to face further scrutiny when it is published by Nature soon. Cut-price Google Pixel gets AR maps.

"This video can not be played 'We will never give up': Ekrem Imamoglu addresses supporters The EU and leading member states have sharply criticised a decision in Turkey to re-run Istanbul's mayoral election, after a shock opposition win. An EU spokesperson called on Turkey's electoral body to explain the controversial decision ""without delay"". Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Mass called the re-run ""incomprehensible"". The move was also criticised by the French government and by leading MEP Guy Verhofstadt, who said Turkey was ""drifting towards dictatorship"". The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last month lost the mayorship of Turkey's biggest city by a narrow margin, but Mr Erdogan refused to accept defeat. The AKP claims that there were irregularities that invalidate the vote. The decision to hold a new poll on 23 June sparked protests across Istanbul on Monday. Hundreds of people gathered in several districts, banging pots and pans and shouting anti-government slogans. Istanbul rerun a risky strategy for Erdogan Turkey's rulers are bad losers, says incumbent Erdogan: Turkey's pugnacious president ""Ensuring a free, fair and transparent election process is essential to any democracy and is at the heart of the European Union's relations with Turkey,"" the EU's diplomatic chief, Federica Mogherini, said in a statement. The French government called on Turkish authorities to show ""respect for democratic principles, pluralism, fairness [and] transparency"". Mr Verhofstadt, the Belgian leader of the liberal group in the European parliament,  said on Twitter that the Istanbul rerun threatened to make continuing EU accession talks ""impossible"". Opposition candidate Ekrem Imamoglu, who won the mayoral election but has now been stripped of his duties, described the move as ""treacherous"". His CHP party has accused election authorities of bowing to pressure from Mr Erdogan. This video can not be played Protests have erupted across Istanbul over the decision to re-run the election An AKP representative on the electoral board, Recep Ozel, said the re-run was called because some electoral officials were not civil servants and some result papers had not been signed. But CHP deputy chair Onursal Adiguzel said the re-run showed it was ""illegal to win against the AK Party"". Mr Adiguzel said on Twitter that the decision was ""plain dictatorship"". ""This system that overrules the will of the people and disregards the law is neither democratic, nor legitimate,"" he wrote. Ekrem Imamoglu was confirmed as the mayor of Istanbul in April In a speech broadcast on social media, Mr Imamoglu condemned the electoral board and said they were influenced by the ruling party. ""We will never compromise on our principles,"" he told the crowd. ""This country is filled with 82 million patriots who will fight... until the last moment for democracy."" A supporters' group for Mr Imamoglu urged restraint, saying: ""Let's stand together, let's be calm... We will win, we will win again."" Protests have erupted across Istanbul over the decision to re-run the election Speaking at a parliamentary meeting of the AKP, Mr Erdogan said that re-running the vote was the ""best step"" for the country. ""We see this decision as the best step that will strengthen our will to solve problems within the framework of democracy and law,"" he said. He claimed that there was ""illegality"" in the vote and said a re-run would represent ""an important step to strengthen our democracy"". But the re-run decision is said to have split the AKP, alienating some of its leading lights. Abdullah Gul, Mr Erdogan' predecessor and one of the founding party members, is reportedly preparing to form a new party. Municipal elections took place across Turkey on 31 March and were seen as a referendum on Mr Erdogan's leadership amid a sharp economic downturn. Although an AKP Party-led alliance won 51% of the vote nationwide, the secularist CHP claimed victory in the capital Ankara, Izmir, and in Istanbul - where Mr Erdogan had once been mayor. In Istanbul, more than 8 million votes were cast and Mr Imamoglu was eventually declared the winner by a margin of less than 14,000. The ruling party has since challenged the results in Ankara and Istanbul. âWe will never give upâ Video, 00:01:33âWe will never give upâ Istanbul re-run a risky strategy for Erdogan Anger at Turkey re-running local election Turkey election blow for Erdogan in big cities Erdogan disputes Turkey poll results in big cities Why is Turkey fighting the markets?

Why the European elections couldn't be avoided Pollwatch: European elections If you are a citizen of an EU country and are resident in the UK, you can vote either in the UK or in your home country. In either case, you must have registered before the deadline. Voters will choose 73 MEPs in 12 multi-member regional constituencies. Each region has a different number of MEPs based on its population. MEPs are elected in order as listed by their party, based on the parties' total share of the vote in each region. In the nine English regions, Wales and Scotland, the number of MEPs is calculated using a form of proportional representation known as the D'Hondt formula, a complex system devised by Belgian mathematician and lawyer Victor D'Hondt in the late 19th Century. The process is slightly different in Northern Ireland, where the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system is used.Here is a guide to how the two work. We havea guide hereon what we know so far about how the main parties are preparing for the 23 May polls. The UK will go to the polls on Thursday 23 May, between 07:00 and 22:00 BST. The Netherlands also votes that day, but voting in other EU nations will take place at varying times over the following three days, with the whole process completed by 22:00 BST on Sunday 26 May. At the polling station, you will be given a long ballot paper listing all the parties putting up candidates in your region and candidates' names, as well as any independents standing. To vote for a party or individual, put a cross inside the box next to their name. If you live in England, Wales and Scotland, you are only allowed to choose one party or individual to vote for. In Northern Ireland - which uses a different electoral system - voters are able to rank the parties in order of preference. For instance, if there are five parties standing, voters can rank them from one to five, putting a one next to their first choice. Here is the European Parliament's own explainer,externalof how it all works. Change, in terms of both MEPs and vote share, is compared to the results of the last election in 2014. It doesn't take account of any changes between elections caused by defections or internal party re-organisation. National parties don't have to declare which European group they're affiliated with until they have been elected and start sitting with that group. Any people elected for national parties that we don't know the European allegiance of will go in to an 'Others' category at first, which will slowly reduce down to zero as MEPs either announce which European group they'll sit with or declare themselves as non-attached members or independents. That process could take several weeks. Any MEPs elected for Emmanuel Macron's En Marche party will fall in to this category at first, as will any for Change UK, as both were formed after the 2014 election and have no sitting MEPs. We know where Nigel Farage's Brexit Party will sit because several former-UKIP MEPs that have defected to the party have already joined the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group. Our vote share figures also only come from national parties where we know which European group they'll sit in. If MEPs from the same national party sit in different European groups, we split the share of the vote their party received in the same proportion. So if a national party gets 300,000 votes and three MEPs, but two sit with the centre-right EPP and one sits in the conservative ECR, we'll give 200,000 votes to the EPP and 100,000 to the ECR. MEPs sit and vote in groups with like-minded politicians from the other member states, not necessarily with people from the same country. For example, from 2014-2019 the 20 UK Labour MEPs sat with an Alliance of Socialists and Democrats. Most UK Conservatives were in a group called the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, and the one serving Liberal Democrat MEP sat with an Alliance of Liberals and Democrats. Members of national parties don't have to sit in the same European grouping as one another, but most do. Under EU rules these groups need to have at least 25 members, made up of MEPs from at least a quarter of EU member states (currently seven out of 28). This means that some groups might not be able to re-form after the election, if they lose members from certain countries or go below 25 overall. It's also possible for MEPs to not belong to any political group. They are known as non-attached members or independents. For our results, we'll be treating the groups as they are before the election and assuming that all MEPs from the same national party will sit in the same European groups until we know otherwise. More about each group on the European Parliament website.,external Counting is also done on a country-by-country basis - but the results are kept secret until all voting is finished.

"This video can not be played 'We will never give up': Ekrem Imamoglu addresses supporters The EU and leading member states have sharply criticised a decision in Turkey to re-run Istanbul's mayoral election, after a shock opposition win. An EU spokesperson called on Turkey's electoral body to explain the controversial decision ""without delay"". Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Mass called the re-run ""incomprehensible"". The move was also criticised by the French government and by leading MEP Guy Verhofstadt, who said Turkey was ""drifting towards dictatorship"". The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last month lost the mayorship of Turkey's biggest city by a narrow margin, but Mr Erdogan refused to accept defeat. The AKP claims that there were irregularities that invalidate the vote. The decision to hold a new poll on 23 June sparked protests across Istanbul on Monday. Hundreds of people gathered in several districts, banging pots and pans and shouting anti-government slogans. Istanbul rerun a risky strategy for Erdogan Turkey's rulers are bad losers, says incumbent Erdogan: Turkey's pugnacious president ""Ensuring a free, fair and transparent election process is essential to any democracy and is at the heart of the European Union's relations with Turkey,"" the EU's diplomatic chief, Federica Mogherini, said in a statement. The French government called on Turkish authorities to show ""respect for democratic principles, pluralism, fairness [and] transparency"". Mr Verhofstadt, the Belgian leader of the liberal group in the European parliament,  said on Twitter that the Istanbul rerun threatened to make continuing EU accession talks ""impossible"". Opposition candidate Ekrem Imamoglu, who won the mayoral election but has now been stripped of his duties, described the move as ""treacherous"". His CHP party has accused election authorities of bowing to pressure from Mr Erdogan. This video can not be played Protests have erupted across Istanbul over the decision to re-run the election An AKP representative on the electoral board, Recep Ozel, said the re-run was called because some electoral officials were not civil servants and some result papers had not been signed. But CHP deputy chair Onursal Adiguzel said the re-run showed it was ""illegal to win against the AK Party"". Mr Adiguzel said on Twitter that the decision was ""plain dictatorship"". ""This system that overrules the will of the people and disregards the law is neither democratic, nor legitimate,"" he wrote. Ekrem Imamoglu was confirmed as the mayor of Istanbul in April In a speech broadcast on social media, Mr Imamoglu condemned the electoral board and said they were influenced by the ruling party. ""We will never compromise on our principles,"" he told the crowd. ""This country is filled with 82 million patriots who will fight... until the last moment for democracy."" A supporters' group for Mr Imamoglu urged restraint, saying: ""Let's stand together, let's be calm... We will win, we will win again."" Protests have erupted across Istanbul over the decision to re-run the election Speaking at a parliamentary meeting of the AKP, Mr Erdogan said that re-running the vote was the ""best step"" for the country. ""We see this decision as the best step that will strengthen our will to solve problems within the framework of democracy and law,"" he said. He claimed that there was ""illegality"" in the vote and said a re-run would represent ""an important step to strengthen our democracy"". But the re-run decision is said to have split the AKP, alienating some of its leading lights. Abdullah Gul, Mr Erdogan' predecessor and one of the founding party members, is reportedly preparing to form a new party. Municipal elections took place across Turkey on 31 March and were seen as a referendum on Mr Erdogan's leadership amid a sharp economic downturn. Although an AKP Party-led alliance won 51% of the vote nationwide, the secularist CHP claimed victory in the capital Ankara, Izmir, and in Istanbul - where Mr Erdogan had once been mayor. In Istanbul, more than 8 million votes were cast and Mr Imamoglu was eventually declared the winner by a margin of less than 14,000. The ruling party has since challenged the results in Ankara and Istanbul. âWe will never give upâ Video, 00:01:33âWe will never give upâ Istanbul re-run a risky strategy for Erdogan Anger at Turkey re-running local election Turkey election blow for Erdogan in big cities Erdogan disputes Turkey poll results in big cities Why is Turkey fighting the markets?

"This video can not be played Protests have erupted across Istanbul over the decision to re-run the election Istanbul's mayoral election was affected by ""organised crime and serious corruption"", Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says. Mr Erdogan was defending the decision to re-run the 31 March vote, which returned a slim win for the opposition. Opposition candidate Ekrem Imamoglu, who has been stripped of his duties, described the move as ""treacherous"". The European Parliament also said the decision would end the credibility of democratic elections in Turkey. The decision to hold a new vote, which will be held on 23 June, sparked protests across the city on Monday.

Istanbul rerun a risky strategy for Erdogan The opposition sees the move by the electoral authorities as bowing to Mr Erdogan's pressure, says the BBC's correspondent Mark Lowen. Istanbul's Governor Ali Yerlikaya has been assigned as the acting mayor of the city until the new vote. Speaking at a parliamentary meeting of his AK Party, Mr Erdogan said that re-doing the vote was the ""best step"" for the country. ""We see this decision as the best step that will strengthen our will to solve problems within the framework of democracy and law,"" he said. He insisted there was ""illegality"" in the vote and said a re-run would represent ""an important step to strengthen our democracy"". President Erdogan said the re-run was the ""best step"" for Turkey The president, who first came to power in 2003, also said ""thieves"" had stolen the ""national will"" at the ballot box, adding that if they were not held to account ""our people will demand an explanation from us"". An AKP representative on the electoral board, Recep Ozel, said the re-run was called because some electoral officials were not civil servants and some result papers had not been signed.

In Istanbul, more than 8 million votes were cast and Mr Imamoglu was eventually declared the winner by a margin of less than 14,000. The ruling party has since challenged the results in Ankara and Istanbul, which has prompted opposition accusations that they are trying to steal the election. President Erdogan was in typically conspiratorial form, slamming what he called ""the dark circles, economic saboteurs and so-called elitists"" who were attacking Turkey and collaborating to ""rob the nation of its will"". He was never going to take the loss of Istanbul lying down. ""Whoever wins Istanbul wins Turkey"", he has often said. He is determined to win back the country's economic powerhouse. But it's a strategy fraught with risk. The Turkish lira - which has lost more than 30% over the past year - has slumped again. An economy in recession can hardly cope with more uncertainty. After all, it was economic woes that lost Istanbul for Mr Erdogan in the first place. What's more, Ekrem Imamoglu, who was formally appointed mayor last month, is gaining popularity, fast. He's reached out beyond his base and has settled into the role with ease. The re-run could widen his win - barring major irregularities against him, which many of his supporters fear. And Mr Erdogan's own party is deeply split on the issue. His diehard loyalists believe victory was stolen. But other wings of the party accept they lost, and that rejecting the result is another nail in the coffin for what's left of Turkish democracy.

"Talks got under way at Stormont on Tuesday The British and Irish governments have set out details of how they intend to proceed with talks to restore Northern Ireland power-sharing. In a joint statement, they said a series of working groups would be set up to deal with key sticking points. Stormont's five main party leaders will also hold weekly meetings with the NI Secretary and Tanaiste (Irish deputy PM) to ""take stock"" and set the agenda. The talks involving the NI parties and governments got under way on Tuesday. Alliance hails 'breakthrough' NI election Revolving council doors usher in new faces Election 2019: Northern Ireland results It is the first fully-fledged talks process since negotiations collapsed in February 2018. Northern Ireland has been without a devolved power-sharing government for more than two and a half years, after the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in split in a bitter row. There have been several failed talks processes since January 2017. Last month, the British and Irish governments agreed to convene a new set of talks from 7 May, that they said should be short and focused. In their statement issued after meeting the Stormont party leaders on Tuesday, they said the prime minister and taoiseach (Irish prime minister) would review progress at the end of May. The working groups will be led by, (from left): David Sterling; Paul Sweeney; Sir Malcolm McKibbin; Hugh Widdis and Sue Gray There will be a weekly round-table meeting involving party leaders and the working groups will deal with several key issues. They will be made up of three representatives from each of the five parties in the talks, and representatives from the British and Irish governments will advise them. The separate working groups will seek agreement on: Programme for government, led by the head of the NI civil service David Sterling, looking at issues around prosperity, industrial and investment strategies in a restored executive - and improving public services Reform of the petition of concern, led by Hugh Widdis, departmental solicitor and former assembly legal counsel Rights, language and identity issues led by former culture department permanent secretary, Paul Sweeney Improving the sustainability, stability and operation of the Good Friday Agreement institutions, led by ex-NI civil service boss Sir Malcolm McKibbin Transparency, accountability and the operation of the Executive led by the permanent secretary of finance, Sue Gray Several parties at Stormont have called for the reform of the petition of concern mechanism - it is effectively a Stormont veto which the DUP used to block same-sex marriage. The talks were announced by the British and Irish governmentsafter the murder of journalist Lyra McKee. At her funeral,politicians came under pressure to solve the Stormont impasse. The talks are beginning just days after council elections which saw a surge of support for smaller parties not aligned to either unionism or nationalism. Most notably, Northern Ireland's fifth largest party, Alliance, saw its number of council seats rise from 32 to 53 - an increase of 65%. The talks were announced after the murder of journalist Lyra McKee Speaking ahead of Tuesday's talks, DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party would go into the talks process to try to find a solution. She said she hoped all parties would engage with a ""willingness to look forward and not backwards"". Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said her party was ready to get down to business. ""People know what the outstanding equality issues are and they need to be resolved and they can be,"" she said. Alliance leader Naomi Long said the new format provided a ""short window of opportunity"" for progress. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: ""We've all committed to power sharing, we've all committed to working together and that'll take compromise, it'll take real effort."" Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann said:  ""If today is simply window dressing, we're wasting our time and we're insulting the people of Northern Ireland."" In the local government election, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in were again returned as the two largest parties in the council elections, but they had mixed fortunes. The DUP lost eight of its 130 seats and, although Sinn FÃ©in's seat count held steady at 105, there was a slight drop (0.8%) in the party's share of first preference votes.

"Chrissy Archibald was visiting the city with her partner Tyler Ferguson A young woman told her fiancÃ© ""I love you"" and kissed him moments before she was killed during the 2017 London Bridge attacks, an inquest into the deaths has been told. Chrissy Archibald, from Canada, was one of eight people killed when three men drove a van into pedestrians and stabbed others in Borough Market. She had been visiting London for the first time with partner Tyler Ferguson. Victims' relatives are giving tributes on the first day of the hearing. Those who were killed were James McMullan, 32, from Hackney in London, French trio Xavier Thomas, 45, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Sebastien Belanger, 36, Ms Archibald, 30, Ignacio Echeverria, 39, from Madrid, and Australians Sara Zelenak, 21, and Kirsty Boden, 28. Victims of the London Bridge attack London Bridge attack: What happened Mr Ferguson, in a statement read to the inquest at London's Old Bailey, said he and Ms Archibald had been ""very much looking forward"" to spending the rest of their lives together. The couple, who lived in Holland, had been out for dinner when Ms Archibald, a social worker, was killed. ""We decided to walk over London Bridge. At one point Chrissy stopped me out of nowhere, gave me a passionate kiss and told me she loved me,"" he said. ""I remember it being a warm summer's evening and the sun had just gone down. And then the attack took place and Chrissy was killed.""

He added: ""The world has many sunshine people in it. Their smiles warm us. ""Chrissy was not the sunshine, Chrissy was the moon. You might not notice the moon on a sunny day but you need the moon when it is dark to find your way."" The partner of Kirsty Boden, from Loxton in south Australia, told how she ran towards the sound of the van crashing to try to help others. Ms Boden, a senior staff nurse at Guy's and St Thomas's Hospital, was on a night out with friends at Boro Bistro when she left the table to help. She was stabbed to death. Her partner James Hodder said: ""She loved people and loved her life helping others. To Kirsty, her actions that night would have been an extension of how she lived her life. ""We are so unspeakably proud of her and not a day goes by that we are not in awe of her bravery that night."" Xavier Thomas: His death left ""a great void"", his father said The inquest also heard from the parents of Frenchman Xavier Thomas, who said ""barbarians, who can in no way be described as humans, took his life and destroyed his family"", adding: ""We all feel lost and are experiencing a great void without Xavier."" Mr Thomas, who had two children from a previous marriage and lived near Paris, had arrived in London on the day of the attack. He was hit by the van as he walked across the bridge, having been on the phone to his teenage son moments before. His body was found three days later in the River Thames. His girlfriend Christine Delcros, who was also struck and seriously injured during the attack, wept as she told the Old Bailey: ""Since Xavier disappeared in such tragic and traumatic circumstances our whole world has fallen apart."" Sara Zelenak, an Australian au pair, was ""the happiest she had ever been"" before being stabbed to death at Borough Market on a night out with a friend, her family said. Her mother Julie Wallace said Sara - known as Sarz - had arrived in the UK that March and was ""working, travelling, meeting new people, doing all the things a 21-year-old should do"". ""That was until June 3 2017 when our lives changed forever,"" she added. ""On that fatal night, every sliding door slid for Sara to be in harm's way."" Julie Wallace and her husband Mark, Ms Zelenak's stepfather, attended the inquest opening Ms Zelenak had been due to work that night - but got the evening off at the last minute. She and her friend planned to go to a rooftop bar, but couldn't find it, then chose to go to Soho instead - before deciding on Borough Market. Mrs Wallace said she and her husband have since dedicated their lives to setting up a sanctuary to help other families to cope with grief. ""I would love every victim's family to come to Sarz Sanctuary who is here today and I would love to help them from the bottom of my heart,"" she said. BBC reporter Marie Jackson, at the inquest Before a hushed courtroom, the mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters and lovers of the eight deceased took their turn at the stand. Several spoke in their native French. The family of music lover Alexandre Pigeard set his story to pictures with an ambient soundtrack. Canadian Greg Archibald read a beautifully-crafted tribute about his daughter, Chrissy, from small, scrawny twin baby to a gentle, determined social worker with respect for everyone. Two years on and many shades of grief were evident, from tears to anger, pride to stoicism. In the afternoon, the emotional father of Alexandre exchanged hugs and kind words with the father of Kirsty Boden, an Australian nurse killed as she tried to rescue the French man. There were some lighter moments too. After a live link to Australia went down, Kirsty's boyfriend was asked to reread his statement. As he told, for a second time, how the couple's adopted stray cat was soon the fattest cat in north London, the coroner quipped it was funny both times.

I do not forgive what they did to him."" He was head chef at the Coq d'Argent, in the City, and his mother said she was ""so proud"" of him. Mr Belanger, originally from Angers, western France, had been drinking at the Boro Bistro when he was stabbed repeatedly in the chest. Chief coroner Mark Lucraft QC told the court that despite being confronted by three knife-wielding attackers, he had ""bravely fought back"" before he was killed by ""quite horrific injuries"". Mr Belanger ""bravely fought back"" against his attackers Spaniard Ignacio Echeverria also tried to fight back, using his skateboard to hit at least one of the attackers, but was fatally stabbed outside Lobos restaurant.

"Chrissy Archibald was visiting the city with her partner Tyler Ferguson A young woman told her fiancÃ© ""I love you"" and kissed him moments before she was killed during the 2017 London Bridge attacks, an inquest into the deaths has been told. Chrissy Archibald, from Canada, was one of eight people killed when three men drove a van into pedestrians and stabbed others in Borough Market. She had been visiting London for the first time with partner Tyler Ferguson. Victims' relatives are giving tributes on the first day of the hearing.

Victims of the London Bridge attack London Bridge attack: What happened Mr Ferguson, in a statement read to the inquest at London's Old Bailey, said he and Ms Archibald had been ""very much looking forward"" to spending the rest of their lives together. The couple, who lived in Holland, had been out for dinner when Ms Archibald, a social worker, was killed. ""We decided to walk over London Bridge. At one point Chrissy stopped me out of nowhere, gave me a passionate kiss and told me she loved me,"" he said. ""I remember it being a warm summer's evening and the sun had just gone down. And then the attack took place and Chrissy was killed.""

Ms Archibald was like ""the moon"", her father said Her father Greg said that his daughter's work had been her ""calling"", and that she ""believed from the bottom of her soul that each and every person is worthy of respect"". He added: ""The world has many sunshine people in it. Their smiles warm us. ""Chrissy was not the sunshine, Chrissy was the moon. You might not notice the moon on a sunny day but you need the moon when it is dark to find your way.""

"This video can not be played Brexit: European elections will go ahead says senior minister The UK will have to hold European elections, despite hopes from the government a Brexit deal would be done by then, says the PM's de facto deputy. The vote is due on 23 May, but Theresa May said the UK would not have to take part if MPs agreed a Brexit plan first. Now, David Lidington says ""regrettably"" it is ""not going to be possible to finish that process"" before the date the UK legally has to take part. He said the government would try to make the delay ""as short as possible"". The UK was due to leave the EU on 29 March, but as no deal was agreed by Parliament, the EU extended the deadline to 31 October. It can leave the bloc earlier, but if the UK has not left by 23 May, it is legally obliged to take part in the EU-wide poll and to send MEPs to Brussels. Mrs May's spokesman said she ""deeply regrets"" that the UK did not leave as planned in March and recognised many people felt ""great frustration"" that the European elections were going ahead. But she hoped Parliament would agree a Brexit plan before MEPs start their session in July. Thedeadline to register for the EU electionswas Tuesday 7 May. The government has resumed talks with Labour to try to break the deadlock in Parliament over the terms of withdrawing from the EU. It has promised that if no compromise is reached it will offer indicative votes on possible next steps to Parliament. Labour's shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said Tuesday's talks were ""very robust"", but nothing had been agreed, and the government still needed to move on its ""red lines"" in order to reach a compromise. This video can not be played Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey: ""Nothing agreed"" in cross-party Brexit talks A Labour source told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that talks had been ""tense"" with some frustration on the Labour side and said there were still ""fundamental"" problems and divisions between the two sides. The government was being ""disingenuous"" to suggest that ministers were offering a significant new compromise beyond what was already available in the existing agreements with the EU, the source said. Downing Street said the talks had been ""constructive and detailed"" and they would continue on Wednesday afternoon. ""Constructive and detailed"" - that sounds quite positive - Number 10's description of the talks today. ""Robust"" - not quite so chirpy - Labour's use of political speak for what most of us might call a bit tricky. ""Disingenuous"" - oh dear - a different Labour source's description of ministers' claim that what they were putting on the table in the cross-party talks today was something genuinely new on the vexed question of customs arrangements after we leave the EU. As we reported this morning there didn't really seem to be much from the government that was concrete beyond what's already possible under the agreement that's been hammered out with Brussels. The divorce deal and indeed yes, you guessed it, the backstop, both have forms of temporary customs unions in them to make trade between the UK and the EU easier. Of course the precise language and mechanisms matter enormously. But was there some big shiny new offer today? The short answer is: no. Read more from Laura A number of other parties have already announced their candidates and launched their European election campaigns, but the Conservatives have yet to do the same. May meets senior Tory amid calls to resign Brexit: Stepping stone to progress? European elections: What you need to know Cabinet Office Minister Mr Lidington said: ""We very much hoped that we would be able to get our exit sortedâ¦ so that those elections did not have to take place, but legally they do have to take place unless our withdrawal has been given legal effect."" Mr Lidington said the government would be ""redoubling efforts"" in its talks with other parties to find a way forward to ""make sure that the delay after [the elections] is as short as possible"". He added: ""We would like to be in a situationâ¦ certainly to get this done and dusted by the summer recess."" Government sources say if the Brexit process is completed before 30 June, UK MEPs will not take up their seats at all. If it is done and dusted after that date but before Parliament begins its summer recess in July, MEPs will only need to sit for a month, until 1 August. Sources estimate that the cost of holding the European elections will be roughly Â£150m. Analysis:By Chris Morris, BBC Reality Check Even if an unexpected deal were to emerge in the next few days between the Conservatives and Labour, it would only be a very tentative first step towards Brexit, with no guarantee that it would enjoy a parliamentary majority. And a first step isn't enough. The conclusions of last month's EU summit, agreed by all EU leaders including Theresa May, said that if the Brexit withdrawal agreement has not been ratified in parliament by 22 May, the European elections will have to take place in the UK. The ratification process means Parliament would have to pass a meaningful vote on the withdrawal agreement (the deal negotiated between the government and the EU), and then turn it into UK law in the form of a Withdrawal Agreement Bill. And, as Mr Lidington has now conceded formally, time to do all of that has run out. Read more from Chris. Some Brexiteers are angry at Mrs May's efforts to find a compromise with Labour after her deal with the EU was effectively rejected by MPs three times. One leading Eurosceptic, Sir Bill Cash, told the Press Association ""the time has come"" for the PM to resign and she ""needs to be given a date"". But Chancellor Philip Hammond defended the cross-party talks, suggesting the government had no other option. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg saysNo 10 is trying to get Labour over the line by presenting the withdrawal agreement as a stepping stone - i.e. hold your nose for now and you can carve out your own deal if you win the next election. Key to that, she says, is the promise of a ""temporary customs union"", but Labour sources are warning that would not be enough. Labour has previously said it wants a permanent customs union - an arrangement not to carry out checks or put tariffs (extra payments) on goods that move around between the UK and the EU after Brexit. The election in May will see 751 MEPs sent to the European Parliament to make laws and approve budgets for the EU. Each country is allocated a set number of seats, depending on the size of its population. The smallest member, Malta (population: around half a million) has six MEPs, while the largest, Germany (population: 82 million) has 96. The UK is divided into 12 regions, each represented by between three and 10 MEPs depending on population size, ending with a total of 73. Seats in England, Scotland and Wales are awarded to parties according to their share of the vote, then to the candidates on the lists drawn up by the parties. Northern Ireland elects MEPs using asingle transferable vote system, with voters able to rank candidates in order of preference. The European Parliament has agreed that 46 of the UK's 73 seats will be abolished after Brexit, and the remaining 27 will be redistributed among countries that have complained of under-representation. 2019 European elections: List of candidates What are your questions about Brexit?

"The soldiers and rangers try to be as invisible as possible, on patrols that often last for days The Majete Wildlife Reserve sits in a large basin in the south of Malawi, and the roads that lead there are busy at 6am. Not with vehicles, but with endless cyclists as Malawians make the most of the low light and cooler air to start their days. The appearance of two British Army 4x4s turns heads as they leave the sights and smells of the villages, and head into the bush. Lance Corporal Chad Spalding is one of those on board. The 23-year-old is about to spend the next few days with local rangers Boston Phiri, who's pretty new to the job, and Retief Chomali, with ten years' experience. Watch The Poacher Hunters, a Newsbeat documentary. Also availableon YouTube,external ""You don't really have time to think,"" explains Chad. ""Most of the time you're concentrating on the environment itself. ""You're constantly looking, watching dangerous game, anything that might sneak up on you.""

""If we start chopping down trees and killing animals what will be left for future generations? Just a bunch of pictures in a book,"" he reflects. Chad remembers working with lions when he was growing up on a project in Gonarezhou, Zimbabwe. ""After I'd seen the wildlife and what it's actually like out in the bush, I just really really bit into it. As soon as this came across the table, I took it straight away. Allow Twitter content?

Malawi's elephant population has halved from 4,000 in the 1980s to 2,000 in 2015, according to African Parks, which runs the Majete Reserve The illegal wildlife trade is a big business, thought to be worth Â£17bn a year worldwide. A rhino horn ismore expensive than cocaine, heroin or gold. In the last 50 years global black rhino numbers have dropped from 70,000 to 5,500, African Parks says. The organisation runs the Majete Reserve and two others in Malawi. ""Most jobs out here don't pay well, whereas if they get a rhino horn it's a pretty big pay day,"" Chad says. Liwonde National Park ""I know in Zimbabwe, South Africa, Mozambique, Tanzania there's quite a lot of heavy poaching. ""Most of the poaching that goes on is organised by higher syndicates which are funding these operations and equipping the poachers with better weapons to be able to defeat the rangers. ""Which is making it a lot hard for the rangers to keep up with the funding they've got. For now the rangers seem to be winning, let's hope it stays that way."" The military-style approach, along with tougher sentences, seems to be working for now though. No elephants or rhinos have been poached in Majete for 15 years. Lance Corporal Chad Spalding says he doesn't want animals ending up as ""just a bunch of pictures in a book"" Chad knows what he would say to a poacher if he met one though. ""I would ask his reasons for doing it, and what he thinks the consequences will be if he does get caught. ""It's not a matter of if he gets caught it's a matter of when he gets caught.

"Sir Graham Brady has previously urged the PM to lay out a timetable for her departure Theresa May has met the chairman of an influential committee of backbench Tory MPs, Sir Graham Brady, amid calls for her to set a firm resignation date. It followed a request from the 1922 Committee for ""clarity"" on the issue. No 10 insisted the meeting was routine, but pressure is mounting on the PM, with local Tory associations confirming they will hold a vote of confidence in her leadership on 15 June. Meanwhile, cross-party talks to break the Brexit deadlock resumed. In March, Mrs May pledged to stand down if and when Parliament ratified her Brexit withdrawal agreement with the EU - but she has not made it clear how long she intends to stay if no deal is reached. The UK had been due to leave the EU on 29 March, but the deadline was pushed back to 31 October after Parliament was unable to agree a way forward. May must go now, says former Tory leader Watch: What does the 1922 committee do? Brexit: A really simple guide Opinion is split even within the 1922 Committee - an elected body of MPs which represents backbenchers and oversees leadership contests. Treasurer Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown said Mrs May should announce a ""road map"" for her resignation after the European elections, set for 23 May. But vice-chairman Charles Walker told BBC Radio 4's World at One there was a ""blame displacement process"" happening within the Conservative Party, laying it on Mrs May's shoulders. ""We all need to take personal responsibility for the fact that we are still in the EU,"" he said, adding that the idea a new prime minister would be able to sort Brexit out easily was ""for the birds"". No confidence vote of Tory MPs:Theresa May won a leadership ballot by 200 to 117 votes on 12 December 2018. Under current party rules, there can't be another vote for a further year so the PM is technically safe until 12 December this year. Many MPs want to change the rules to allow an earlier contest but this would need to be agreed by the 1922 Committee. No confidence vote in Parliament:The PM would have to resign if she lost a confidence vote in Parliament. Labour tried this manoeuvre in December but Tory MPs and their DUP allies backed the PM. Might some Tories now withhold their support if they think it will usher in a new leader rather than a general election? Grassroots Tory revolt:Local Conservative associations seem to be turning against the PM, with one - Clwyd South - already passing a motion of no confidence in her. The National Conservative Convention's vote on 15 June is non-binding, though, so the PM could ignore it. Cabinet revolt:Margaret Thatcher quit in 1990 after a number of ministers told her it was time to go. Could history repeat itself? There has been no sign of that so far and colleagues who want to succeed her - and there are many - may not want to be seen to be the ones wielding the knife or to risk sacrificing their own careers. Quits of her own accord:The BBC's Norman Smith says there is no way the PM will ""walk away"" right now, but this could change in the aftermath of a ""catastrophic"" result in European elections. Some Brexiteers are angry at Mrs May's efforts to find a compromise with Labour after her deal  with the EU was effectively rejected by MPs three times. One leading Eurosceptic, Sir Bill Cash, told the Press Association ""the time has come"" for Mrs May to resign and she ""needs to be given a date"". But Chancellor Philip Hammond defended the cross-party talks, suggesting the government had no other option. He said the ""most important thing"" was to put in place arrangements to allow low-friction trade between the UK and the EU and ""of course"" the government should talk to Labour about it. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Pressure is building on Mrs May following last week's local election drubbing, in which the Conservatives lost 1,334 councillors in England. In an unprecedented move, the National Conservative Convention - the most senior body within the voluntary party - is to hold a vote of confidence in her leadership next month. It was triggered after 65 local Conservative associations said they had lost trust in the prime minister. The prime minister has blamed the Brexit impasse for her party's terrible performance last week and urged Labour, which itself lost 82 seats, to compromise to agree a deal. Will the cross-party talks get anywhere this week? No 10 is trying to get Labour over the line by presenting the withdrawal agreement as a stepping stone - i.e. hold your nose for now and you can carve out your own deal if you win the next election. Key to that is the promise of a ""temporary customs union"" - but Labour sources warn if that's all it is, that's what's already in the withdrawal agreement anyway (plus a few months) and doesn't add up to anything substantially new. A senior government source says it IS possible, though, to see a way to a deal, but it is unlikely to be resolved this week - and their aim is not to create some kind of May-Corbyn Rose Garden moment (imagine!) but to set out a path to get the Withdrawal Bill to Commons with a fair wind.

"Great Yarmouth's Golden Mile with Scroby Sands wind farm on the horizon In the past decade the UK has emerged as a world leader in offshore wind energy. And some of the biggest winners from the multi-billion pound investment look set to be coastal towns searching for their industries of the future. On a clear day, the tourists walking Great Yarmouth's beachfront Golden Mile can see the turbines of the Scroby Sands wind farm spinning in the distance. Onshore are the attractions and arcades that have sustained this Norfolk seaside resort for the past half-century; far offshore stand the huge structures on which rest its hopes for the next. Twice the height of Big Ben and with blades longer than a jumbo jet wingspan, the new turbines being built many miles into the North Sea will dwarf the 15-year-old wind farm visible from the beach. At full capacity, the planned projects could power the equivalent of 4.5 million homes, but the multi-billion pound investments are already having an energising effect on the local economy. Having seen the decline of its fishing industry and ridden the ups and downs of the oil and gas industry, Great Yarmouth and its neighbouring port Lowestoft find themselves at the centre of the UK's renewables boom. The UK already has offshore wind turbine infrastructure that could provide a capacity of 7.5GW -more than any other country,externalin the world - and more than half of it is off the coast of Norfolk and Suffolk. A combination of shallow waters, consistent wind and good access to the energy-hungry south-east England has already attracted projects costing Â£11bn, with projects worth Â£22bn - and more than 6,000 jobs - planned by developers into the next decade. Next-generation turbines can generate almost five times the power of the Scroby Sands wind farm In March, the government laid out in anindustry sector dealits ambition for 30% of electricity to come from offshore wind by 2030, and the falling cost of renewables has fuelled ambitions of the UKbeing carbon zero by 2050. It all adds up to an unmissable opportunity, says Simon Gray of industry body the East of England Energy Group. 'I can't live in a home like this' 'Our school, the fourth emergency service' 'From benefits to a job earning Â£40k' These stories are part of special coverage across BBC News looking at the challenges and opportunities in Britain's coastal towns. ""The great thing about this is that the wind farms are set to last 20, 30, 40 years. It means two generations of a workforce that will be operating and maintaining these turbines,"" he said. ""We are developing these skills and will be exporting them around the world,"" he says. Tourism is one of Great Yarmouth's biggest industries, but work is seasonal While much of the manufacturing is done further up the east coast or abroad - which hasdrawn criticism- construction and maintenance is creating work for local companies. Great Yarmouth's port is being used as the construction base for ScottishPower Renewables' Â£2.5bn East Anglia One wind farm, due for completion next year. But an even bigger prize is the operations and maintenance deal it has secured for Swedish energy firm Vattenfall's two wind farms, which will be the biggest in the world. They will bring up to 150 jobs for 25 years, and create hundreds more in the supply chain. Wind turbine projects costing an estimated Â£22bn are planned off the east coast in the next decade Yarmouth firm Subsea Protection Systems makes protection for undersea cables, and says it could double its 50-strong workforce if it wins a contract on the projects. And Peel Ports has invested Â£12m in Great Yarmouth port to attract bases for future wind farms. It has been working with local councils and the region's local enterprise partnership. ""This is our opportunity,"" says port director Richard Goffin. ""We've been saying this for two years but the government have now put their flag in the ground and said they want us to do it."" This video can not be played The offshore wind turbines getting people off benefits Former fabrication engineer Gwyn Evans has retrained as an offshore wind technician thanks to a course run by a local engineering firm. Accustomed to the peaks and troughs of seasonal work, he had been out of work for six months and saw the writing on the wall. The opportunity to train for free with Great Yarmouth-based 3Sun was ""manna from heaven"", he says. The company offers the training as a way to recruit new talent into its growing offshore wind work. ""Things are standing a lot better in my favour than they were,"" says Mr Evans, 38. ""Now I have the [qualification] tickets the world is my oyster. I can earn a decent wage and improve my lifestyle. ""Everybody wants a job that's going to last. If you are lucky enough to be in an industry that you are passionate about and love, that's even better."" The opening of a new Â£557m government subsidy round is likely to attract more private-sector investment. But infrastructure projects on such a scale inevitably attract opposition. The huge cables needed to transfer the power from the wind farm to the grid require vast swathes of the countryside to be dug up. For example, Vattenfall's proposed wind farms require 37 miles (60km) of cabling to be laid underground to a substation at Necton in Norfolk, which residents say will blot the landscape and cause huge disruption. The company insists it is working with residents to find the best solution and the project will bring significant environmental and economic benefits. Communities affected by construction want better planning as more projects arise Mid Norfolk MP George Freeman has raised the wider issuein Parliament,external, warning that community voices are not being heard in a planning ""free-for-all"". Critics also ask why infrastructure cannot be better planned and shared - a concern the government has pledged to investigate in its sector deal. That launch has focused attention on the future. At 5,000-student East Coast College, where a new Â£11m energy training centre is being built, they can feel the change in the air. The sector deal ""felt like firing a starting gun"" says chief executive Stuart Rimmer. He believes the prospect of well-paid, long-term jobs on their doorstep is creating real excitement among students. ""Aspiration follows opportunity,"" he says.

"Head teacher Debbie Whiting set up a food bank to support families in poverty It started with a note. A plea for help, handwritten on a scrap of paper by an 11-year-old pupil. Her mother had run out of food. For head teacher Debbie Whiting, it was her first real insight into the levels of poverty among pupils at her primary school. Alarmed by the note, she visited the girl's home and found the cupboards bare. Something had to be done, she decided. And it was. Within a few weeks of that visit Mrs Whiting had set up a food bank at North Denes primary in Great Yarmouth. When this proved invaluable to struggling families, the school offered to run a clothes washing service for those of them living in bed and breakfast accommodation. Now the school's librarian has turned hairdresser, cutting the locks of some pupils and de-licing children when required. The Norfolk school has become, says Mrs Whiting, a ""fourth emergency service"" for the community that surrounds it. ""When people have got nowhere else to turn, they turn to us,"" she says. ""We've uncovered more and more need. The more you ask, the more you find out - there's a level of hidden poverty that you would not be aware of."" Nearly half the pupils qualify for the pupil premium because of their disadvantaged backgrounds That visit to the girl's home was in December 2018. Mrs Whiting wanted to discuss the note with her mother, who insisted her daughter should not have said anything because ""she had a couple of potatoes the neighbour had given her to eat that night"". Shocked at what she found, Mrs Whiting went shopping for the family. But she realised if one family was struggling in silence there were likely to be others, and discussed starting a food collection with staff. The food bank began slowly, filled at first with donations from teachers and parents, supplemented by funding raised from community groups. Parents can request an emergency package to see a family of four through a week's worth of meals. Those who feel embarrassed are able to pick up their supplies from a side door, out of sight from other parents. Mrs Whiting knows the parents struggling to pay their bills, the children fleeing domestic violence, the families at risk of eviction, and those who will today ask her for food to feed their children. She compares them - and the school she leads - to a swan gliding across a lake ""but paddling along really hard underneath"". ""When you see people in the playground, you wouldn't know who's got food in their cupboard at home and who hasn't. They don't go around carrying a banner."" Michael Thrasher says he has gone four days without food so his children can eat Michael Thrasher is a full-time carer for his disabled partner Paula and 10-year-old son Michael, who has ADHD. In the past three years the family's monthly income has dropped from about Â£2,200 a month to Â£1,600, including rent paid directly to his landlord. But a house move in October stretched finances further, forcing him to ask for help from the food bank at North Denes, where his nine-year-old daughter Tina is a pupil. At times, he has gone four days without food so that his children can eat. Since December, the family has received four packages from the food bank, each containing seven pre-planned meals for four, and essential toiletries. ""I would have to go out stealing without this school,"" says Mr Thrasher, 42. ""There's no other way you can do it. I am embarrassed to come to the food bank. I would rather not ask for help. I would rather do it all myself but sometimes you can't. ""They think you can live on the money that they give us. We can't."" Just yards from the dunes of Norfolk's east coast, North Denes is a growing 370-pupil school serving one of the most deprived boroughs in the UK. Nearly half of the school's pupils are eligible for the pupil premium, a financial top-up for those from disadvantaged backgrounds. At its site on the northern fringes of the town, behind a derelict pub and beside a caravan park, the challenges facing modern coastal communities are being played out. Like many seaside towns, Great Yarmouth has suffered from the loss of jobs in traditional industries, which have been replaced with seasonal, insecure work in sectors such as tourism and food production. In the government's most recent Index of Multiple Deprivation, a quarter of Great Yarmouth's 61 neighbourhoods were among the most deprived 10% in the UK. Across the borough, earnings, life expectancy, GCSE results, and major health measures are worse than the national average. This video can not be played Debbie Whiting: ""When people have got nowhere else to turn, they turn to us"" Three years ago, Great Yarmouth was chosen as a pilot site for the introduction of universal credit - a welfare reform which combines six benefits into a monthly payment. But the scheme has been dogged by delayed payments, which take five weeks and are paid in arrears, and many families have seen payments cut. And the school has seen the effects. ""We have had parents who have found it difficult to manage financially and to feed their children because of the introduction of universal credit,"" says Mrs Whiting. ""It's caused huge problems."" When the food bank opened, the Department for Work and Pensions said the reasons for food poverty were ""complex"", pointing out that 100% advances had been available since the programme's introduction. It denied universal credit was linked to food bank use and that ""significant improvements"" had been made so people could be paid sooner. WATCH: 'I can't live in a home like this' How wind power is re-energising Great Yarmouth WATCH: 'From benefits to a job earning Â£40k' These stories are part of special coverage across BBC News looking at the challenges and opportunities in Britain's coastal towns. At the school gates, mother-of-four Sandy Lysaght says the food bank and its staff have been an ""amazing"" support. ""Just chatting to them makes you feel that it's not your fault,"" she says. About half a dozen families a week use the service, but many others donate when they can. Yet the problems of poverty cannot be solved simply by food parcels. One third of children arriving in reception class at North Denes are classed as obese and, by the time they get to year 6, this has risen to half. ""When you have hungry children, how many Mars bars can you get for a Â£1 and how many apples?"" says Mrs Whiting. ""It's not that parents don't love their children or don't want better things for them, but sometimes they don't know how or they haven't got the resources to do it."" Caterer Natalie Creegan runs free cookery classes at the school The school is midway through its second six-week course teaching parents how to cook nutritious food on a budget. Caterer Natalie Creegan's free sessions have proved so popular some parents have asked to stay on to teach others. ""At the first session, only one of the parents had ever chopped an onion, so we are starting fairly basic,"" she says. ""But the skill set now is much better."" The classes also underline the solidarity among parents. On the day the BBC visited, a class whip-round had raised Â£10 for a couple whose electricity meter had run out. If money is hard to come by for the parents, times are equally tough for the school. Its funding per pupil has this year dropped from about Â£3,100 to Â£2,700 per head, according to the head teacher. Its budget for the year starting in April 2019 is based on a snapshot of its pupil roll at the start of October 2018, meaning the 19 pupils who have joined since must be funded from their classmates' pot. Pension contributions have increased by 8%, the minimum wage for the lowest-paid workers has risen and the cost of external services has gone up too. That has left a Â£130,000 gap in the 2019-20 budget, which would have grown to Â£350,000 by 2021-22 without drastic action. The Department for Education would not comment on North Denes' funding situation but said Great Yarmouth schools on average had seen an increase of 2.1% compared to 2017-18 funding levels. Jobs must be cut at the school to balance the books, says the head To balance the books, one teaching and five classroom assistants roles will be cut. Contracts for other specialist and support staff will not be renewed. In total, 13 people will not return to the school when the new term starts in September - about a quarter of the staff. Mrs Whiting says it is ""upsetting"", but she has no choice. Staff have discussed cutting their hours together, so that fewer redundancies are needed, but financial pressures weigh on them too. Debbie Gleeson: school librarian, occasional hairdresser to pupils and one of the staff at risk, is also a single parent. She admits she is scared. ""It means going back on benefits, on universal credit. Am I going to end up being one of those that's going to rely on the food bank?"" Debbie Gleeson works in the school library and cuts the hair of children but has been told her job is at risk The staff at North Denes know they do not have to provide the extra support they do. They know the impact if they don't, however. Children who are not fed, warm or safe do not learn well, can behave badly or miss school. ""All these things, they are all part of enabling children to be in a place where they can learn,"" says Mrs Whiting. She speaks out to draw attention to the reality of life in school, to highlight the struggles in education that she believes should be a higher priority. There is optimism at North Denes - it is rated Good by Ofsted, and by next September a new Â£7m school should be complete behind its current 1930s home. But, says the head teacher, the new buildings would be for nothing without the people and the community inside. ""These are the people who are going to run industry, who are going to work in the health service, in our schools, in our government,"" she says. ""And they only get one go at an education.""

"The local election results are disappointing for both the Conservatives and for Labour, while the Liberal Democrats, Greens and independents prospered, writes Prof Sir John Curtice and colleagues on the BBC's local elections team. ""A plague on both your houses."" That seems to have been the key message to emerge from the ballot boxes. On the basis of the detailed voting figures in 40 local authorities, we estimate that if the pattern of voting in the local council elections were to be replicated across the whole of Great Britain, both the Conservatives and Labour would have won 28% of the vote. This is only the second time that this calculation has put both those parties below 30%. The elections always looked set to be difficult for the Conservatives. The party was defending seats that were mostly last up for grabs four years ago, on the same day David Cameron won the 2015 general election. That, coupled with the party's recent freefall in the polls, clearly pointed to significant Conservative losses. May 2019 local election results in maps and charts Laura Kuenssberg: Two main parties, one key message What happens when councils change hands? And that proved to be the case. The party has suffered net losses of more than 1300 seats. On average the party's share of the vote was down by six points, both compared with 2015 and with last year's local election results. However, despite the government's difficulties, Labour also slipped back - on average, by no less than seven points compared with last year's local election results. As a result, the party has found itself suffering net losses of around 80 seats, when opposition parties are normally expected to post gains. The party's performance would seem to confirm the message of a number of polls that Labour's support has been slipping in the wake of the Brexit impasse, a fall in Jeremy Corbyn's popularity, and a continuing row about anti-Semitism. Compared with last year, the party lost ground more heavily in Leave-voting areas than in Remain-voting ones, a pattern that it shared with the Conservatives (who in previous years have tended to perform better in such areas). This has been seized on by pro-Leave Labour MPs as evidence that the party should reach an agreement with the government which would pave the way for the UK to leave the EU. What the two parties also had in common was a tendency for their support to fall more heavily in their heartlands. Labour's vote fell back most heavily in the north, the Conservatives in the south. Equally, Labour's vote fell more heavily in wards where it was previously strong, while the Conservative vote fell most heavily where they were strongest. It was as though voters vented their frustration with the Brexit process by punishing whichever party represented the political establishment locally. This mood perhaps also helps account for the remarkable success of independent candidates. Those not standing on a party label were on average winning as much as a quarter of the vote where they stood. More than 900 independent councillors have been elected - a net gain of more than 500. Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats, who before they entered into coalition with the Conservatives in 2010 were often a vehicle for protest votes, also appear to have profited from voters' disenchantment with the two largest parties. The party, which has made net gains of more than 600 seats, advanced particularly strongly in Conservative-held wards where it was previously in second place. Double digit swings from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats were common in such seats. The party seemed to be successful in reinvigorating some of the bastions of local strength where its support had been badly eroded in the wake of the coalition government. This pattern added significantly to the tally of Conservative losses. Theresa May insisted the local election results showed voters wanted the main parties to ""get on"" with Brexit. In contrast, and despite the party's pro-Remain stance, there was only limited evidence that the Lib Dems' advance was stronger in areas that voted heavily for Remain in the 2016 referendum. For example, while support for the party rose on average by three points on last year in areas where more than half voted for Remain, it also increased by two points in areas where the Remain vote was less than 45%. Thanks in part to the fact that in 2015 the Liberal Democrats had recorded its worst ever local election performance, the party was able to make so many gains, due to an increase in its vote since then, of eight points. More significant, perhaps, was the fact that its vote was also up by three points on last year's local elections. When the party's performance is projected into a national vote, it is estimated to be worth 19% of the vote. This represents its best local election performance since the party entered into coalition in 2010, but was still well below the party's performance in any round of local votes between 1993 and 2010. Overall, the party's performance is best seen as evidence of a partial recovery from the depths to which the party sank during the coalition years. At the same time, the Greens had one of their best local election results ever. The party made net gains of more than 180 seats. The Greens posted an average of 12% of the vote in the wards they contested, up five points on their performance where they stood four years ago. That equals the party's previous highest average, 12% in 2009, when local elections were held on the same day as European Parliament elections. The party may have been helped by the recent protests about climate change. Fighting just one in six wards, there was little opportunity for UKIP to make much impact on these elections. Where it did stand, the party's vote was down by four  points on its relative high point of 2015, but up eight points on its poor position last year. However, the challenge from the Eurosceptic parties may be more formidable in the European elections in three weeks time, when Nigel Farage's Brexit Party is on the ballot paper.   By-elections can take place in some council wards even if that council is not scheduled for elections this year. Check your council website for details.

"Chrissy Archibald was visiting the city with her partner Tyler Ferguson A young woman told her fiancÃ© ""I love you"" and kissed him moments before she was killed during the 2017 London Bridge attacks, an inquest into the deaths has been told. Chrissy Archibald, from Canada, was one of eight people killed when three men drove a van into pedestrians and stabbed others in Borough Market. She had been visiting London for the first time with partner Tyler Ferguson. Victims' relatives are giving tributes on the first day of the hearing. Those who were killed were James McMullan, 32, from Hackney in London, French trio Xavier Thomas, 45, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Sebastien Belanger, 36, Ms Archibald, 30, Ignacio Echeverria, 39, from Madrid, and Australians Sara Zelenak, 21, and Kirsty Boden, 28. Victims of the London Bridge attack London Bridge attack: What happened Mr Ferguson, in a statement read to the inquest at London's Old Bailey, said he and Ms Archibald had been ""very much looking forward"" to spending the rest of their lives together. The couple, who lived in Holland, had been out for dinner when Ms Archibald, a social worker, was killed. ""We decided to walk over London Bridge. At one point Chrissy stopped me out of nowhere, gave me a passionate kiss and told me she loved me,"" he said. ""I remember it being a warm summer's evening and the sun had just gone down. And then the attack took place and Chrissy was killed."" The victims of the attack clockwise - Chrissy Archibald, Sebastien Belanger, Kirsty Boden, Ignacio Echeverria, Sara Zelenak, Xavier Thomas, Alexandre Pigeard, James McMullan She died in his arms. Her engagement ring was lost in the aftermath but later recovered and Mr Ferguson now wears it on a chain around his neck. ""I love, and still love, Chrissy more than life itself,"" he said. ""She was my angel."" Ms Archibald, who was a twin, had planned to marry Mr Ferguson in the autumn of 2018 in Canada. Ms Archibald was like ""the moon"", her father said Her father Greg said that his daughter's work had been her ""calling"", and that she ""believed from the bottom of her soul that each and every person is worthy of respect"". He added: ""The world has many sunshine people in it. Their smiles warm us. ""Chrissy was not the sunshine, Chrissy was the moon. You might not notice the moon on a sunny day but you need the moon when it is dark to find your way."" The partner of Kirsty Boden, from Loxton in south Australia, told how she ran towards the sound of the van crashing to try to help others. Ms Boden, a senior staff nurse at Guy's and St Thomas's Hospital, was on a night out with friends at Boro Bistro when she left the table to help. She was stabbed to death. Her partner James Hodder said: ""She loved people and loved her life helping others. To Kirsty, her actions that night would have been an extension of how she lived her life. ""We are so unspeakably proud of her and not a day goes by that we are not in awe of her bravery that night."" Xavier Thomas: His death left ""a great void"", his father said The inquest also heard from the parents of Frenchman Xavier Thomas, who said ""barbarians, who can in no way be described as humans, took his life and destroyed his family"", adding: ""We all feel lost and are experiencing a great void without Xavier."" Mr Thomas, who had two children from a previous marriage and lived near Paris, had arrived in London on the day of the attack. He was hit by the van as he walked across the bridge, having been on the phone to his teenage son moments before. His body was found three days later in the River Thames. His girlfriend Christine Delcros, who was also struck and seriously injured during the attack, wept as she told the Old Bailey: ""Since Xavier disappeared in such tragic and traumatic circumstances our whole world has fallen apart."" Sara Zelenak, an Australian au pair, was ""the happiest she had ever been"" before being stabbed to death at Borough Market on a night out with a friend, her family said. Her mother Julie Wallace said Sara - known as Sarz - had arrived in the UK that March and was ""working, travelling, meeting new people, doing all the things a 21-year-old should do"". ""That was until June 3 2017 when our lives changed forever,"" she added. ""On that fatal night, every sliding door slid for Sara to be in harm's way."" Julie Wallace and her husband Mark, Ms Zelenak's stepfather, attended the inquest opening Ms Zelenak had been due to work that night - but got the evening off at the last minute. She and her friend planned to go to a rooftop bar, but couldn't find it, then chose to go to Soho instead - before deciding on Borough Market. Mrs Wallace said she and her husband have since dedicated their lives to setting up a sanctuary to help other families to cope with grief. ""I would love every victim's family to come to Sarz Sanctuary who is here today and I would love to help them from the bottom of my heart,"" she said. BBC reporter Marie Jackson, at the inquest Before a hushed courtroom, the mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters and lovers of the eight deceased took their turn at the stand. Several spoke in their native French. The family of music lover Alexandre Pigeard set his story to pictures with an ambient soundtrack. Canadian Greg Archibald read a beautifully-crafted tribute about his daughter, Chrissy, from small, scrawny twin baby to a gentle, determined social worker with respect for everyone. Two years on and many shades of grief were evident, from tears to anger, pride to stoicism. In the afternoon, the emotional father of Alexandre exchanged hugs and kind words with the father of Kirsty Boden, an Australian nurse killed as she tried to rescue the French man. There were some lighter moments too. After a live link to Australia went down, Kirsty's boyfriend was asked to reread his statement. As he told, for a second time, how the couple's adopted stray cat was soon the fattest cat in north London, the coroner quipped it was funny both times. The mother of Sebastien Belanger, a chef, said she does not forgive those who ""mutilated and killed him"". Josiane Belanger said: ""We miss him so much, his smile, his joie de vivre. I do not forgive what they did to him."" He was head chef at the Coq d'Argent, in the City, and his mother said she was ""so proud"" of him. Mr Belanger, originally from Angers, western France, had been drinking at the Boro Bistro when he was stabbed repeatedly in the chest. Chief coroner Mark Lucraft QC told the court that despite being confronted by three knife-wielding attackers, he had ""bravely fought back"" before he was killed by ""quite horrific injuries"". Mr Belanger ""bravely fought back"" against his attackers Spaniard Ignacio Echeverria also tried to fight back, using his skateboard to hit at least one of the attackers, but was fatally stabbed outside Lobos restaurant. In a statement read to the court, the family of the financial crime analyst said he had spent the whole day on his skateboard. He planned to have dinner at his sister's house, but delayed his visit as he was ""having a really good time"". The coroner praised his ""courageous efforts"". James McMullan was celebrating getting financial backing for his online education company on the night he was killed. He had called his mother to say ""everything was going to be OK, that he was going to be able to look after her"", his sister Melissa said. Alexandre Pigeard, a waiter, was also a member of French musical collective Club 808, and described as a ""charming and sensitive"" man. His father Philippe Pigeard, also a musician, said he was ""inconsolable"", adding: ""I'm not just a father, I'm all the fathers in the world and all the mothers in the world who have been stuck by similar tragedies."" In his opening statement, Mr Lucraft told the court that lives were torn apart in ""10 minutes of high and terrible drama"". He said he hoped the inquest would answer the relatives' ""obvious and understandable questions"". The eight-week hearing into the deaths of the victims will be followed by a separate three-week hearing for the inquests of their killers, in front of a jury. The attackers, Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, were shot dead by police at the scene. The hearings will examine the circumstances of each of the deaths, as well as how the leader of the attack - Butt - was able to plan it, even though he was the target of an MI5 investigation. They will also look into issues including why were there no barriers to protect pedestrians on the bridge, more than 10 weeks after the Westminster Bridge attack.

"Michael Bruce and his brother Kenny founded Purplebricks in 2012 Shares in online estate agent Purplebricks have dropped more than 5%, after founder and chief executive Michael Bruce left the company. Vic Darvey, who had been the firm's chief operating officer, will succeed Mr Bruce as chief executive. Purplebricks also said it was pulling out of Australia and placing its US business under review. Chairman Paul Pindar apologised to shareholders for its recent ""disappointing"" performance. ""With hindsight, our rate of geographic expansion was too rapid,"" he said. The company has operated in Australia for two-and-a-half years, but said the prospective returns from the country were ""not sufficient to justify continued investment"". Purplebricks is also cutting back investment in the US, although its Canadian business continues to flourish. However, the firm is optimistic about its UK performance,saying in a statement,external: ""Whilst the UK property market remains challenging, the company continues to outperform the market and the board remains confident about the future of the business. ""Having established a market-leading position, there remain many opportunities for further profitable growth and this will be a key area of focus going forward."" Shares in the company fell in February after it cut its sales forecast. from between Â£165m and Â£175m to between Â£130m and Â£145m. It confirmed these figures in Tuesday's trading update, adding that cash balances at 30 April 2019 would not be less than Â£62m. Mr Bruce and his brother Kenny, who grew up on a council estate in Larne, County Antrim, founded the online estate agent in 2012. The company charges a flat rate to market a property, with fees differing around the country. For example, homeowners in London and surrounding postcodes are charged Â£1,399 and elsewhere Â£899. Viewings can be booked online at any time and people can arrange visits themselves, or pay the company extra to do it for them. Purplebricks shares dive on sales outlook shock Purplebricks estate agent defends business model Speaking about Mr Bruce's departure, Mr Pindar said: ""Michael's vision in creating the UK's leading hybrid estate agent has been deeply impressive, as has his relentless energy in developing the business both in the UK and internationally."" Mr Darvey said: ""Going forward, we have a very clear understanding of the levers available to us to achieve growth."" Property expert Henry Pryor told the BBC that Mr Bruce's departure was unexpected. ""It's a shock to the industry, although I don't know if Michael was expecting it,"" he said. ""He and his brother have done an extraordinary job commercially driving the company forward and I hope that this is his decision, rather than it coming about as a result of shareholders' frustration."" Online companies' share of the estate agents' market is at about the 7% mark,according to data from analysts TwentyCi.,external Anddata from Zoopla's 2018 State of the Property Nation report,externalindicated that 24% of consumers used an online agent in the previous year. Purplebricks and similar companies have definitely made their mark, Mr Pryor says. ""Their impact has been significant. The estate agents' sector is not prone to innovation, so when Purplebricks came along - although they were not the first online agent - they had a cleverer and more imaginative way of delivering the hybrid model."" Paula Higgins, chief executive at pressure group HomeOwners Alliance, warned that consumers need to be careful that they choose the correct estate agent for them. ""It's so important for people to do their research,"" she told the BBC. ""Not all agents are the same and not all online agents are the same. ""Purplebricks have been a massive innovator in a market, where one-third of agents used to refuse to give ballpark figures for commission and issue non-transparent, dodgy contracts. ""They and others opened up the market and encouraged transparency. ""Purplebricks' fee is charged up front, but other online and High Street agents have up-front or pay-later options, so people do need to shop around to get the right agent. ""Local independent agents who are more professional in their area might be a good option for certain people.""

"More than 5,000 people were the victims of holiday booking fraud last year, with their total losses amounting to Â£7m, research suggests. Travel association ABTA said victims lost an average of Â£1,380 each, having bought bogus airline tickets, accommodation or organised tours. It said fraudsters were using increasingly sophisticated methods to target people looking for good deals. ""This crime causes very real emotional distress,"" boss Mark Tanzer said. Holiday fraud: 'How we were caught out' Holidaymakers warned over fake bookings Crackdown on false holiday illness claims ""As victims often find out just before they travel, or even in resort, that they have been defrauded, it can then be very difficult and expensive to obtain a legitimate replacement booking,"" he added. More than half (53%) of the crimes related to the sale of airline tickets, with scammers particularly targeting people visiting family and friends in Africa and the Indian subcontinent. One in four cases involved accommodation, such as payments to stay in upmarket villas which are either fictitious or are being offered without the owner's knowledge. Spain and France were among the destinations most commonly affected. Check the booking agent's web address is legitimate and has not been altered by slight changes to a domain name - such as going from .co.uk to .org Don't just rely on one review - do a thorough online search to check the company's credentials Check whether the company is a member of a recognised trade body such as ABTA Wherever possible, pay by credit card and be wary about paying directly into a private individual's bank account Study receipts, invoices as well as terms and conditions If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Source: ABTA, Action Fraud and Get Safe Online In one instance,Neil Garnham from Rochester, lost Â£350 out of the Â£1,150 he was going to spend on a villa in Spain. His daughter found the property via Facebook and talked to the owner about what the family wanted - including child-friendly equipment. ""The 'owner' of the place said she didn't normally let out her villa to anyone who wasn't a friend or family member but she liked the sound of us and wanted to help,"" he told the BBC. ""She said there was high demand on the dates we wanted to go but she only wanted to let it out to us. I went ahead and booked for a week."" Neil Garnham lost Â£350 to scammers Neil paid the deposit by bank transfer and was given receipts and a contract. However, when he tried to clarify details for the final payment, the email address and phone numbers no longer worked and the original Facebook posting had been removed. ""We reported this to our bank but understandably they cannot refund our money. We will be going on holiday but we've had to pay a lot more. These people have no compassion."" In another example, Libby from London booked a houseboat in Amsterdam for her birthday through what appeared at first to be a credible website, which asked her to pay via a money transfer service. The price offered was low compared with other sites, and the account Libby transferred the cash to was Polish. After repeated attempts to contact the agent, with no reply, she requested a full refund in line with the company's guarantee, but she ended up losing the cost of the rental plus a Â£500 deposit. Her bank and the money transfer service both said they could not compensate her. Meanwhile, Sue, from Solihull, and her family booked a week's stay at a Spanish villa online. She opted to pay half the cost up front plus a deposit - totalling Â£1,305 - via a bank transfer. But when she emailed the company for more information she got no reply. In the end she lost the money and had to fork out for another villa as she had already paid for six flights. ""There is a startling emotional impact of falling victim to holiday fraud bringing the feeling of embarrassment and disappointment to those we love,"" said Pauline Smith, head of Action Fraud. ""It is important that you do your research when making travel arrangements.""

"Talks got under way at Stormont on Tuesday The British and Irish governments have set out details of how they intend to proceed with talks to restore Northern Ireland power-sharing. In a joint statement, they said a series of working groups would be set up to deal with key sticking points. Stormont's five main party leaders will also hold weekly meetings with the NI Secretary and Tanaiste (Irish deputy PM) to ""take stock"" and set the agenda. The talks involving the NI parties and governments got under way on Tuesday. Alliance hails 'breakthrough' NI election Revolving council doors usher in new faces Election 2019: Northern Ireland results It is the first fully-fledged talks process since negotiations collapsed in February 2018. Northern Ireland has been without a devolved power-sharing government for more than two and a half years, after the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in split in a bitter row. There have been several failed talks processes since January 2017. Last month, the British and Irish governments agreed to convene a new set of talks from 7 May, that they said should be short and focused. In their statement issued after meeting the Stormont party leaders on Tuesday, they said the prime minister and taoiseach (Irish prime minister) would review progress at the end of May. The working groups will be led by, (from left): David Sterling; Paul Sweeney; Sir Malcolm McKibbin; Hugh Widdis and Sue Gray There will be a weekly round-table meeting involving party leaders and the working groups will deal with several key issues. They will be made up of three representatives from each of the five parties in the talks, and representatives from the British and Irish governments will advise them. The separate working groups will seek agreement on: Programme for government, led by the head of the NI civil service David Sterling, looking at issues around prosperity, industrial and investment strategies in a restored executive - and improving public services Reform of the petition of concern, led by Hugh Widdis, departmental solicitor and former assembly legal counsel Rights, language and identity issues led by former culture department permanent secretary, Paul Sweeney Improving the sustainability, stability and operation of the Good Friday Agreement institutions, led by ex-NI civil service boss Sir Malcolm McKibbin Transparency, accountability and the operation of the Executive led by the permanent secretary of finance, Sue Gray Several parties at Stormont have called for the reform of the petition of concern mechanism - it is effectively a Stormont veto which the DUP used to block same-sex marriage. The talks were announced by the British and Irish governmentsafter the murder of journalist Lyra McKee. At her funeral,politicians came under pressure to solve the Stormont impasse. The talks are beginning just days after council elections which saw a surge of support for smaller parties not aligned to either unionism or nationalism. Most notably, Northern Ireland's fifth largest party, Alliance, saw its number of council seats rise from 32 to 53 - an increase of 65%. The talks were announced after the murder of journalist Lyra McKee Speaking ahead of Tuesday's talks, DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party would go into the talks process to try to find a solution. She said she hoped all parties would engage with a ""willingness to look forward and not backwards"". Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said her party was ready to get down to business. ""People know what the outstanding equality issues are and they need to be resolved and they can be,"" she said. Alliance leader Naomi Long said the new format provided a ""short window of opportunity"" for progress. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: ""We've all committed to power sharing, we've all committed to working together and that'll take compromise, it'll take real effort."" Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann said:  ""If today is simply window dressing, we're wasting our time and we're insulting the people of Northern Ireland."" In the local government election, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in were again returned as the two largest parties in the council elections, but they had mixed fortunes. The DUP lost eight of its 130 seats and, although Sinn FÃ©in's seat count held steady at 105, there was a slight drop (0.8%) in the party's share of first preference votes.

"Chrissy Archibald was visiting the city with her partner Tyler Ferguson A young woman told her fiancÃ© ""I love you"" and kissed him moments before she was killed during the 2017 London Bridge attacks, an inquest into the deaths has been told. Chrissy Archibald, from Canada, was one of eight people killed when three men drove a van into pedestrians and stabbed others in Borough Market. She had been visiting London for the first time with partner Tyler Ferguson. Victims' relatives are giving tributes on the first day of the hearing. Those who were killed were James McMullan, 32, from Hackney in London, French trio Xavier Thomas, 45, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Sebastien Belanger, 36, Ms Archibald, 30, Ignacio Echeverria, 39, from Madrid, and Australians Sara Zelenak, 21, and Kirsty Boden, 28. Victims of the London Bridge attack London Bridge attack: What happened Mr Ferguson, in a statement read to the inquest at London's Old Bailey, said he and Ms Archibald had been ""very much looking forward"" to spending the rest of their lives together. The couple, who lived in Holland, had been out for dinner when Ms Archibald, a social worker, was killed. ""We decided to walk over London Bridge. At one point Chrissy stopped me out of nowhere, gave me a passionate kiss and told me she loved me,"" he said. ""I remember it being a warm summer's evening and the sun had just gone down. And then the attack took place and Chrissy was killed."" The victims of the attack clockwise - Chrissy Archibald, Sebastien Belanger, Kirsty Boden, Ignacio Echeverria, Sara Zelenak, Xavier Thomas, Alexandre Pigeard, James McMullan She died in his arms. Her engagement ring was lost in the aftermath but later recovered and Mr Ferguson now wears it on a chain around his neck. ""I love, and still love, Chrissy more than life itself,"" he said. ""She was my angel."" Ms Archibald, who was a twin, had planned to marry Mr Ferguson in the autumn of 2018 in Canada. Ms Archibald was like ""the moon"", her father said Her father Greg said that his daughter's work had been her ""calling"", and that she ""believed from the bottom of her soul that each and every person is worthy of respect"". He added: ""The world has many sunshine people in it. Their smiles warm us. ""Chrissy was not the sunshine, Chrissy was the moon. You might not notice the moon on a sunny day but you need the moon when it is dark to find your way."" The partner of Kirsty Boden, from Loxton in south Australia, told how she ran towards the sound of the van crashing to try to help others. Ms Boden, a senior staff nurse at Guy's and St Thomas's Hospital, was on a night out with friends at Boro Bistro when she left the table to help. She was stabbed to death. Her partner James Hodder said: ""She loved people and loved her life helping others. To Kirsty, her actions that night would have been an extension of how she lived her life. ""We are so unspeakably proud of her and not a day goes by that we are not in awe of her bravery that night."" Xavier Thomas: His death left ""a great void"", his father said The inquest also heard from the parents of Frenchman Xavier Thomas, who said ""barbarians, who can in no way be described as humans, took his life and destroyed his family"", adding: ""We all feel lost and are experiencing a great void without Xavier."" Mr Thomas, who had two children from a previous marriage and lived near Paris, had arrived in London on the day of the attack. He was hit by the van as he walked across the bridge, having been on the phone to his teenage son moments before. His body was found three days later in the River Thames. His girlfriend Christine Delcros, who was also struck and seriously injured during the attack, wept as she told the Old Bailey: ""Since Xavier disappeared in such tragic and traumatic circumstances our whole world has fallen apart."" Sara Zelenak, an Australian au pair, was ""the happiest she had ever been"" before being stabbed to death at Borough Market on a night out with a friend, her family said. Her mother Julie Wallace said Sara - known as Sarz - had arrived in the UK that March and was ""working, travelling, meeting new people, doing all the things a 21-year-old should do"". ""That was until June 3 2017 when our lives changed forever,"" she added. ""On that fatal night, every sliding door slid for Sara to be in harm's way."" Julie Wallace and her husband Mark, Ms Zelenak's stepfather, attended the inquest opening Ms Zelenak had been due to work that night - but got the evening off at the last minute. She and her friend planned to go to a rooftop bar, but couldn't find it, then chose to go to Soho instead - before deciding on Borough Market. Mrs Wallace said she and her husband have since dedicated their lives to setting up a sanctuary to help other families to cope with grief. ""I would love every victim's family to come to Sarz Sanctuary who is here today and I would love to help them from the bottom of my heart,"" she said. BBC reporter Marie Jackson, at the inquest Before a hushed courtroom, the mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters and lovers of the eight deceased took their turn at the stand. Several spoke in their native French. The family of music lover Alexandre Pigeard set his story to pictures with an ambient soundtrack. Canadian Greg Archibald read a beautifully-crafted tribute about his daughter, Chrissy, from small, scrawny twin baby to a gentle, determined social worker with respect for everyone. Two years on and many shades of grief were evident, from tears to anger, pride to stoicism. In the afternoon, the emotional father of Alexandre exchanged hugs and kind words with the father of Kirsty Boden, an Australian nurse killed as she tried to rescue the French man. There were some lighter moments too. After a live link to Australia went down, Kirsty's boyfriend was asked to reread his statement. As he told, for a second time, how the couple's adopted stray cat was soon the fattest cat in north London, the coroner quipped it was funny both times. The mother of Sebastien Belanger, a chef, said she does not forgive those who ""mutilated and killed him"". Josiane Belanger said: ""We miss him so much, his smile, his joie de vivre. I do not forgive what they did to him."" He was head chef at the Coq d'Argent, in the City, and his mother said she was ""so proud"" of him. Mr Belanger, originally from Angers, western France, had been drinking at the Boro Bistro when he was stabbed repeatedly in the chest. Chief coroner Mark Lucraft QC told the court that despite being confronted by three knife-wielding attackers, he had ""bravely fought back"" before he was killed by ""quite horrific injuries"". Mr Belanger ""bravely fought back"" against his attackers Spaniard Ignacio Echeverria also tried to fight back, using his skateboard to hit at least one of the attackers, but was fatally stabbed outside Lobos restaurant. In a statement read to the court, the family of the financial crime analyst said he had spent the whole day on his skateboard. He planned to have dinner at his sister's house, but delayed his visit as he was ""having a really good time"". The coroner praised his ""courageous efforts"". James McMullan was celebrating getting financial backing for his online education company on the night he was killed. He had called his mother to say ""everything was going to be OK, that he was going to be able to look after her"", his sister Melissa said. Alexandre Pigeard, a waiter, was also a member of French musical collective Club 808, and described as a ""charming and sensitive"" man. His father Philippe Pigeard, also a musician, said he was ""inconsolable"", adding: ""I'm not just a father, I'm all the fathers in the world and all the mothers in the world who have been stuck by similar tragedies."" In his opening statement, Mr Lucraft told the court that lives were torn apart in ""10 minutes of high and terrible drama"". He said he hoped the inquest would answer the relatives' ""obvious and understandable questions"". The eight-week hearing into the deaths of the victims will be followed by a separate three-week hearing for the inquests of their killers, in front of a jury. The attackers, Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, were shot dead by police at the scene. The hearings will examine the circumstances of each of the deaths, as well as how the leader of the attack - Butt - was able to plan it, even though he was the target of an MI5 investigation. They will also look into issues including why were there no barriers to protect pedestrians on the bridge, more than 10 weeks after the Westminster Bridge attack.

"More than 5,000 people were the victims of holiday booking fraud last year, with their total losses amounting to Â£7m, research suggests. Travel association ABTA said victims lost an average of Â£1,380 each, having bought bogus airline tickets, accommodation or organised tours. It said fraudsters were using increasingly sophisticated methods to target people looking for good deals. ""This crime causes very real emotional distress,"" boss Mark Tanzer said. Holiday fraud: 'How we were caught out' Holidaymakers warned over fake bookings Crackdown on false holiday illness claims ""As victims often find out just before they travel, or even in resort, that they have been defrauded, it can then be very difficult and expensive to obtain a legitimate replacement booking,"" he added. More than half (53%) of the crimes related to the sale of airline tickets, with scammers particularly targeting people visiting family and friends in Africa and the Indian subcontinent. One in four cases involved accommodation, such as payments to stay in upmarket villas which are either fictitious or are being offered without the owner's knowledge. Spain and France were among the destinations most commonly affected. Check the booking agent's web address is legitimate and has not been altered by slight changes to a domain name - such as going from .co.uk to .org Don't just rely on one review - do a thorough online search to check the company's credentials Check whether the company is a member of a recognised trade body such as ABTA Wherever possible, pay by credit card and be wary about paying directly into a private individual's bank account Study receipts, invoices as well as terms and conditions If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Source: ABTA, Action Fraud and Get Safe Online In one instance,Neil Garnham from Rochester, lost Â£350 out of the Â£1,150 he was going to spend on a villa in Spain. His daughter found the property via Facebook and talked to the owner about what the family wanted - including child-friendly equipment. ""The 'owner' of the place said she didn't normally let out her villa to anyone who wasn't a friend or family member but she liked the sound of us and wanted to help,"" he told the BBC. ""She said there was high demand on the dates we wanted to go but she only wanted to let it out to us. I went ahead and booked for a week."" Neil Garnham lost Â£350 to scammers Neil paid the deposit by bank transfer and was given receipts and a contract. However, when he tried to clarify details for the final payment, the email address and phone numbers no longer worked and the original Facebook posting had been removed. ""We reported this to our bank but understandably they cannot refund our money. We will be going on holiday but we've had to pay a lot more. These people have no compassion."" In another example, Libby from London booked a houseboat in Amsterdam for her birthday through what appeared at first to be a credible website, which asked her to pay via a money transfer service. The price offered was low compared with other sites, and the account Libby transferred the cash to was Polish. After repeated attempts to contact the agent, with no reply, she requested a full refund in line with the company's guarantee, but she ended up losing the cost of the rental plus a Â£500 deposit. Her bank and the money transfer service both said they could not compensate her. Meanwhile, Sue, from Solihull, and her family booked a week's stay at a Spanish villa online. She opted to pay half the cost up front plus a deposit - totalling Â£1,305 - via a bank transfer. But when she emailed the company for more information she got no reply. In the end she lost the money and had to fork out for another villa as she had already paid for six flights. ""There is a startling emotional impact of falling victim to holiday fraud bringing the feeling of embarrassment and disappointment to those we love,"" said Pauline Smith, head of Action Fraud. ""It is important that you do your research when making travel arrangements.""

"This video can not be played Protests have erupted across Istanbul over the decision to re-run the election Istanbul's mayoral election was affected by ""organised crime and serious corruption"", Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says. Mr Erdogan was defending the decision to re-run the 31 March vote, which returned a slim win for the opposition. Opposition candidate Ekrem Imamoglu, who has been stripped of his duties, described the move as ""treacherous"". The European Parliament also said the decision would end the credibility of democratic elections in Turkey. The decision to hold a new vote, which will be held on 23 June, sparked protests across the city on Monday. Hundreds of people gathered in several districts, banging pots and pans and shouting anti-government slogans. Istanbul rerun a risky strategy for Erdogan The opposition sees the move by the electoral authorities as bowing to Mr Erdogan's pressure, says the BBC's correspondent Mark Lowen. Istanbul's Governor Ali Yerlikaya has been assigned as the acting mayor of the city until the new vote. Speaking at a parliamentary meeting of his AK Party, Mr Erdogan said that re-doing the vote was the ""best step"" for the country. ""We see this decision as the best step that will strengthen our will to solve problems within the framework of democracy and law,"" he said. He insisted there was ""illegality"" in the vote and said a re-run would represent ""an important step to strengthen our democracy"". President Erdogan said the re-run was the ""best step"" for Turkey The president, who first came to power in 2003, also said ""thieves"" had stolen the ""national will"" at the ballot box, adding that if they were not held to account ""our people will demand an explanation from us"". An AKP representative on the electoral board, Recep Ozel, said the re-run was called because some electoral officials were not civil servants and some result papers had not been signed. But CHP deputy chair Onursal Adiguzel said the re-run showed it was ""illegal to win against the AK Party"". Mr Adiguzel tweeted that the decision was ""plain dictatorship"". ""This system that overrules the will of the people and disregards the law is neither democratic, nor legitimate,"" he wrote. And in a speech broadcast on social media, CHP's Ekrem Imamoglu, who was confirmed as Istanbul's mayor before being stripped of the title, condemned the electoral board and said they were influenced by the ruling party. Turkey's rulers are bad losers, says vote 'winner' Erdogan: Turkey's pugnacious president ""We will never compromise on our principles,"" he told the crowd. ""This country is filled with 82 million patriots who will fight... until the last moment for democracy."" A supporters' group for Mr Imamoglu urged restraint, saying: ""Let's stand together, let's be calm... We will win, we will win again."" Ekrem Imamoglu was confirmed as the mayor of Istanbul in April The European Union called for Turkey's election body to explain its reasons for the re-run ""without delay"". ""Ensuring a free, fair and transparent election process is essential to any democracy and is at the heart of the European Union's relations with Turkey,"" the EU's diplomatic chief, Federica Mogherini, said in a statement. Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the decision was ""not transparent, and incomprehensible to us"". The French government also said the Turkish authorities needed to show ""respect for democratic principles, pluralism, fairness [and] transparency"" in the new poll. Municipal elections took place across Turkey on 31 March and were seen as a referendum on Mr Erdogan's leadership amid a sharp economic downturn. Although an AKP Party-led alliance won 51% of the vote nationwide, the secularist CHP claimed victory in the capital Ankara, Izmir, and in Istanbul - where Mr Erdogan had once been mayor. In Istanbul, more than 8 million votes were cast and Mr Imamoglu was eventually declared the winner by a margin of less than 14,000. The ruling party has since challenged the results in Ankara and Istanbul, which has prompted opposition accusations that they are trying to steal the election. President Erdogan was in typically conspiratorial form, slamming what he called ""the dark circles, economic saboteurs and so-called elitists"" who were attacking Turkey and collaborating to ""rob the nation of its will"". He was never going to take the loss of Istanbul lying down. ""Whoever wins Istanbul wins Turkey"", he has often said. He is determined to win back the country's economic powerhouse. But it's a strategy fraught with risk. The Turkish lira - which has lost more than 30% over the past year - has slumped again. An economy in recession can hardly cope with more uncertainty. After all, it was economic woes that lost Istanbul for Mr Erdogan in the first place. What's more, Ekrem Imamoglu, who was formally appointed mayor last month, is gaining popularity, fast. He's reached out beyond his base and has settled into the role with ease. The re-run could widen his win - barring major irregularities against him, which many of his supporters fear. And Mr Erdogan's own party is deeply split on the issue. His diehard loyalists believe victory was stolen. But other wings of the party accept they lost, and that rejecting the result is another nail in the coffin for what's left of Turkish democracy.

"Cecil the lion was killed by a trophy hunter in 2015 The UK will not be banning imports from trophy hunting yet, Michael Gove has told BBC Radio 5 Live. The Environment Secretary said it was a ""delicate political balancing act"". He said he had been advised by wildlife charities to ""be cautious"" in following other countries in outlawing imports from the controversial sport. Trophy hunting is the shooting of carefully selected animals, including some endangered species, under strict government controls. Mr Gove was interviewed by former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen as part ofa new BBC Radio 5 Live podcast, Beast of Man, which looks into how the South African rhino can be saved from extinction. Clients, mainly from Europe or the US, often pay thousands of pounds to take part in a hunt, and keep a ""trophy"" - usually the head or skin, or another body part. It's a big business in some African countries. Critics describe it as a blood sport, but proponents say it helps raise vital money for conservation, especially for endangered species. 'I hunt wild animals because I love them' Trophy hunting 'raises extinction risk' Should trophy hunting be banned? This video can not be played Michael Gove tells 5 Live the UK will not be banning imports from trophy hunting yet. Currently, if a trophy hunter wants to bring a body part from their hunt back into the UK, they can do so, with a special permit. One trophy hunter told the podcast the sport was thrilling and helped conservation: ""To shoot an elephant is an awesome thing to do, it is a stunningly, stunningly awesome thing to do, which is why I did it. ""I want to try and preserve those wild places in Africa. But the only way they get preserved is if there's money. If it doesn't pay it doesn't stay. It's as simple as that."" But trophy hunting is controversial. In 2015,the death of Cecil the lionin Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park sparked worldwide revulsion and resulted in a number of countries - including Australia, France and the Netherlands - implementing bans on the import of lion trophies. At the time, the UK government pledged to do the same unless there were improvements to how hunting took place. Kevin Pietersen, who was born in South Africa, visited Hwange National Park after Cecil the lion was killed When asked about why the UK had not yet enforced a ban, Mr Gove said he had been advised by conservationists and charities to proceed with caution. He said they told him: ""Don't come in, you know, with your clod-hopping boots from the UK and necessarily tell people in each of these countries exactly how they should regulate their own wildlife."" ""On an emotional level and on a personal level, I find it difficult to understand,"" Mr Gove said. ""But I also recognise that I've got to respect if there is expertise, which says that [trophy hunting] done in a managed way can help wildlife overall, then let's just test that."" The CEO of charity Save the Rhino, Cathy Dean, says that ""well-regulated trophy hunting has a role,externalin overall rhino conservation strategies"". There were between 50 and 100 Southern white rhinos at the start of the 1900s, but now there are about 18,000, she told the BBC in an emailed statement. The increase is ""partly due to the conservation efforts and involvement of the private sector, who have dedicated land to breeding rhinos, some of which may be trophy hunted, rather than to livestock or agriculture"". This video can not be played Why big game hunting is big business in South Africa In 2018, more than 50 celebrities - including singers Ed Sheeran and Liam Gallagher - signed an open letter in support of the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting, urging the Government to ban trophy hunters from importing animal body parts into Britain. Son of Cecil the lion killed Why Zambia lifted its hunting ban How big game hunting is dividing southern Africa A cross-party Early Day Motion, signed by more than 159 MPs, has also called on the UK government to stop trophy hunting imports of endangered species. ""I think that there is growing momentum for the law to change. But what I don't want to do is to get ahead,"" said Mr Gove. ""I don't want to be in a position where am I running so far in advance of what other charities and other leaders want, that we risk the good relationship that's been built up over time. ""Like so many areas of campaigning, it's partly a process of education and it's partly a process of dialogue. ""If particular communities have got used to driving income from hunting, you don't want to seem as though you're basically saying, we're taking your livelihood away. ""We've got to make sure that there is a clear alternative, that they know that their livelihoods and their lifestyle are going to be respected and not patronised, before they will feel comfortable about moving.""

"Michael Bruce and his brother Kenny founded Purplebricks in 2012 Shares in online estate agent Purplebricks have dropped more than 5%, after founder and chief executive Michael Bruce left the company. Vic Darvey, who had been the firm's chief operating officer, will succeed Mr Bruce as chief executive. Purplebricks also said it was pulling out of Australia and placing its US business under review. Chairman Paul Pindar apologised to shareholders for its recent ""disappointing"" performance. ""With hindsight, our rate of geographic expansion was too rapid,"" he said. The company has operated in Australia for two-and-a-half years, but said the prospective returns from the country were ""not sufficient to justify continued investment"". Purplebricks is also cutting back investment in the US, although its Canadian business continues to flourish. However, the firm is optimistic about its UK performance,saying in a statement,external: ""Whilst the UK property market remains challenging, the company continues to outperform the market and the board remains confident about the future of the business. ""Having established a market-leading position, there remain many opportunities for further profitable growth and this will be a key area of focus going forward."" Shares in the company fell in February after it cut its sales forecast. from between Â£165m and Â£175m to between Â£130m and Â£145m. It confirmed these figures in Tuesday's trading update, adding that cash balances at 30 April 2019 would not be less than Â£62m. Mr Bruce and his brother Kenny, who grew up on a council estate in Larne, County Antrim, founded the online estate agent in 2012. The company charges a flat rate to market a property, with fees differing around the country. For example, homeowners in London and surrounding postcodes are charged Â£1,399 and elsewhere Â£899. Viewings can be booked online at any time and people can arrange visits themselves, or pay the company extra to do it for them. Purplebricks shares dive on sales outlook shock Purplebricks estate agent defends business model Speaking about Mr Bruce's departure, Mr Pindar said: ""Michael's vision in creating the UK's leading hybrid estate agent has been deeply impressive, as has his relentless energy in developing the business both in the UK and internationally."" Mr Darvey said: ""Going forward, we have a very clear understanding of the levers available to us to achieve growth."" Property expert Henry Pryor told the BBC that Mr Bruce's departure was unexpected. ""It's a shock to the industry, although I don't know if Michael was expecting it,"" he said. ""He and his brother have done an extraordinary job commercially driving the company forward and I hope that this is his decision, rather than it coming about as a result of shareholders' frustration."" Online companies' share of the estate agents' market is at about the 7% mark,according to data from analysts TwentyCi.,external Anddata from Zoopla's 2018 State of the Property Nation report,externalindicated that 24% of consumers used an online agent in the previous year. Purplebricks and similar companies have definitely made their mark, Mr Pryor says. ""Their impact has been significant. The estate agents' sector is not prone to innovation, so when Purplebricks came along - although they were not the first online agent - they had a cleverer and more imaginative way of delivering the hybrid model."" Paula Higgins, chief executive at pressure group HomeOwners Alliance, warned that consumers need to be careful that they choose the correct estate agent for them. ""It's so important for people to do their research,"" she told the BBC. ""Not all agents are the same and not all online agents are the same. ""Purplebricks have been a massive innovator in a market, where one-third of agents used to refuse to give ballpark figures for commission and issue non-transparent, dodgy contracts. ""They and others opened up the market and encouraged transparency. ""Purplebricks' fee is charged up front, but other online and High Street agents have up-front or pay-later options, so people do need to shop around to get the right agent. ""Local independent agents who are more professional in their area might be a good option for certain people.""

"Cecil the lion was killed by a trophy hunter in 2015 The UK will not be banning imports from trophy hunting yet, Michael Gove has told BBC Radio 5 Live. The Environment Secretary said it was a ""delicate political balancing act"". He said he had been advised by wildlife charities to ""be cautious"" in following other countries in outlawing imports from the controversial sport. Trophy hunting is the shooting of carefully selected animals, including some endangered species, under strict government controls. Mr Gove was interviewed by former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen as part ofa new BBC Radio 5 Live podcast, Beast of Man, which looks into how the South African rhino can be saved from extinction. Clients, mainly from Europe or the US, often pay thousands of pounds to take part in a hunt, and keep a ""trophy"" - usually the head or skin, or another body part. It's a big business in some African countries. Critics describe it as a blood sport, but proponents say it helps raise vital money for conservation, especially for endangered species. 'I hunt wild animals because I love them' Trophy hunting 'raises extinction risk' Should trophy hunting be banned? This video can not be played Michael Gove tells 5 Live the UK will not be banning imports from trophy hunting yet. Currently, if a trophy hunter wants to bring a body part from their hunt back into the UK, they can do so, with a special permit. One trophy hunter told the podcast the sport was thrilling and helped conservation: ""To shoot an elephant is an awesome thing to do, it is a stunningly, stunningly awesome thing to do, which is why I did it. ""I want to try and preserve those wild places in Africa. But the only way they get preserved is if there's money. If it doesn't pay it doesn't stay. It's as simple as that."" But trophy hunting is controversial. In 2015,the death of Cecil the lionin Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park sparked worldwide revulsion and resulted in a number of countries - including Australia, France and the Netherlands - implementing bans on the import of lion trophies. At the time, the UK government pledged to do the same unless there were improvements to how hunting took place. Kevin Pietersen, who was born in South Africa, visited Hwange National Park after Cecil the lion was killed When asked about why the UK had not yet enforced a ban, Mr Gove said he had been advised by conservationists and charities to proceed with caution. He said they told him: ""Don't come in, you know, with your clod-hopping boots from the UK and necessarily tell people in each of these countries exactly how they should regulate their own wildlife."" ""On an emotional level and on a personal level, I find it difficult to understand,"" Mr Gove said. ""But I also recognise that I've got to respect if there is expertise, which says that [trophy hunting] done in a managed way can help wildlife overall, then let's just test that."" The CEO of charity Save the Rhino, Cathy Dean, says that ""well-regulated trophy hunting has a role,externalin overall rhino conservation strategies"". There were between 50 and 100 Southern white rhinos at the start of the 1900s, but now there are about 18,000, she told the BBC in an emailed statement. The increase is ""partly due to the conservation efforts and involvement of the private sector, who have dedicated land to breeding rhinos, some of which may be trophy hunted, rather than to livestock or agriculture"". This video can not be played Why big game hunting is big business in South Africa In 2018, more than 50 celebrities - including singers Ed Sheeran and Liam Gallagher - signed an open letter in support of the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting, urging the Government to ban trophy hunters from importing animal body parts into Britain. Son of Cecil the lion killed Why Zambia lifted its hunting ban How big game hunting is dividing southern Africa A cross-party Early Day Motion, signed by more than 159 MPs, has also called on the UK government to stop trophy hunting imports of endangered species. ""I think that there is growing momentum for the law to change. But what I don't want to do is to get ahead,"" said Mr Gove. ""I don't want to be in a position where am I running so far in advance of what other charities and other leaders want, that we risk the good relationship that's been built up over time. ""Like so many areas of campaigning, it's partly a process of education and it's partly a process of dialogue. ""If particular communities have got used to driving income from hunting, you don't want to seem as though you're basically saying, we're taking your livelihood away. ""We've got to make sure that there is a clear alternative, that they know that their livelihoods and their lifestyle are going to be respected and not patronised, before they will feel comfortable about moving.""

"Councils with large cuts to youth services were more likely to also have seen an increase in knife crime in the area's police force, research suggests. The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Knife Crime (APPG) studied budgets for youth services from 2014/15 to 2017/18. It also analysed knife crime data. It said the four areas worst-hit by youth spending cuts also saw some of the biggest knife crime rises. But comparison is not like for like as council and policing areas differ. The government said there was a ""range of factors"" driving the increase in knife crime, which it called ""complex"". It said changes to the drugs market is one factor. MP Sarah Jones, who chairs the APPG which is made up of MPs and peers, said youth services cannot just be ""nice to have"". She added:  ""We cannot hope to turn around the knife crime epidemic if we don't invest in our young people. ""Every time I speak to young people they say the same thing: they need more positive activities, safe spaces to spend time with friends and programmes to help them grow and develop."" Knife crime at record levels in 2018 Ten charts on the rise of knife crime London killings: All the victims of 2018 The APPG's research found the average council cut spending on youth services - such as youth clubs - from 1.9m in 2014/15 to 1.2m in 2017/18. In real terms, this marked a decrease of 40%, it said. The City of Wolverhampton and the City of Westminster were the worst hit, with youth services cut by 91% since 2014/15, followed by Cambridgeshire County Council (88%) and Wokingham Borough Council (81%), according to the figures. Although it is not possible to directly compare the geographical areas covered by police forces and local authority boundaries, the APPG analysis suggests forces serving areas with the biggest cuts, such as West Midlands Police, the Metropolitan Police, Cambridgeshire Police, and Thames Valley Police, have also seen some of the highest increases in knife crime. West Midlands Police has seen an 87% increase in knife crime offences since 2013/14, while there has been a 47% rise for the Metropolitan Police, a 95% increase for Cambridgeshire Police, and a 99% increase for Thames Valley.

"Talks got under way at Stormont on Tuesday The British and Irish governments have set out details of how they intend to proceed with talks to restore Northern Ireland power-sharing. In a joint statement, they said a series of working groups would be set up to deal with key sticking points. Stormont's five main party leaders will also hold weekly meetings with the NI Secretary and Tanaiste (Irish deputy PM) to ""take stock"" and set the agenda. The talks involving the NI parties and governments got under way on Tuesday. Alliance hails 'breakthrough' NI election Revolving council doors usher in new faces Election 2019: Northern Ireland results It is the first fully-fledged talks process since negotiations collapsed in February 2018. Northern Ireland has been without a devolved power-sharing government for more than two and a half years, after the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in split in a bitter row. There have been several failed talks processes since January 2017. Last month, the British and Irish governments agreed to convene a new set of talks from 7 May, that they said should be short and focused. In their statement issued after meeting the Stormont party leaders on Tuesday, they said the prime minister and taoiseach (Irish prime minister) would review progress at the end of May. The working groups will be led by, (from left): David Sterling; Paul Sweeney; Sir Malcolm McKibbin; Hugh Widdis and Sue Gray There will be a weekly round-table meeting involving party leaders and the working groups will deal with several key issues. They will be made up of three representatives from each of the five parties in the talks, and representatives from the British and Irish governments will advise them. The separate working groups will seek agreement on: Programme for government, led by the head of the NI civil service David Sterling, looking at issues around prosperity, industrial and investment strategies in a restored executive - and improving public services Reform of the petition of concern, led by Hugh Widdis, departmental solicitor and former assembly legal counsel Rights, language and identity issues led by former culture department permanent secretary, Paul Sweeney Improving the sustainability, stability and operation of the Good Friday Agreement institutions, led by ex-NI civil service boss Sir Malcolm McKibbin Transparency, accountability and the operation of the Executive led by the permanent secretary of finance, Sue Gray Several parties at Stormont have called for the reform of the petition of concern mechanism - it is effectively a Stormont veto which the DUP used to block same-sex marriage. The talks were announced by the British and Irish governmentsafter the murder of journalist Lyra McKee. At her funeral,politicians came under pressure to solve the Stormont impasse. The talks are beginning just days after council elections which saw a surge of support for smaller parties not aligned to either unionism or nationalism. Most notably, Northern Ireland's fifth largest party, Alliance, saw its number of council seats rise from 32 to 53 - an increase of 65%. The talks were announced after the murder of journalist Lyra McKee Speaking ahead of Tuesday's talks, DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party would go into the talks process to try to find a solution. She said she hoped all parties would engage with a ""willingness to look forward and not backwards"". Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said her party was ready to get down to business. ""People know what the outstanding equality issues are and they need to be resolved and they can be,"" she said. Alliance leader Naomi Long said the new format provided a ""short window of opportunity"" for progress. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: ""We've all committed to power sharing, we've all committed to working together and that'll take compromise, it'll take real effort."" Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann said:  ""If today is simply window dressing, we're wasting our time and we're insulting the people of Northern Ireland."" In the local government election, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in were again returned as the two largest parties in the council elections, but they had mixed fortunes. The DUP lost eight of its 130 seats and, although Sinn FÃ©in's seat count held steady at 105, there was a slight drop (0.8%) in the party's share of first preference votes.

"Protests have erupted across Istanbul over the decision to re-run the election Turkey's electoral body has been condemned for ordering Istanbul's local elections to be re-held after an opposition victory in March. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party had claimed there were ""irregularities and corruption"" behind the opposition CHP's slim win. But CHP's Ekrem Imamoglu, who was confirmed as Istanbul's mayor in April, called the decision ""treacherous"". The vote, which will be held on 23 June, has sparked protests in the city. Hundreds of residents gathered in several districts of Istanbul on Monday, banging pots and pans and shouting anti-government slogans. The European Parliament also said the decision to re-run the election would end the credibility of democratic elections in Turkey. An AKP representative on the electoral board, Recep Ozel, said the re-run was called because some electoral officials were not civil servants and some result papers had not been signed. But CHP deputy chair Onursal Adiguzel said the re-run showed it was ""illegal to win against the AK Party"". Ekrem Imamoglu was confirmed as the mayor of Istanbul in April Mr Adiguzel tweeted that the decision was ""plain dictatorship"". ""This system that overrules the will of the people and disregards the law is neither democratic, nor legitimate,"" he wrote. And in a speech broadcast on social media, Mr Imamoglu condemned the electoral board, saying they were influenced by the ruling party. Turkey's rulers are bad losers, says vote 'winner' Erdogan: Turkey's pugnacious president ""We will never compromise on our principles,"" he told the crowd. ""This country is filled with 82 million patriots who will fight... until the last moment for democracy."" A supporters' group for Mr Imamoglu urged restraint, saying: ""Let's stand together, let's be calm... We will win, we will win again."" President Erdogan was once mayor of Istanbul Municipal elections took place across Turkey on 31 March and were seen as a referendum on Mr Erdogan's leadership amid a sharp economic downturn. Although an AKP Party-led alliance won 51% of the vote nationwide, the secularist CHP claimed victory in the capital Ankara, Izmir, and in Istanbul - where Mr Erdogan had once been mayor. In Istanbul, more than 8 million votes were cast and Mr Imamoglu was eventually declared the winner by a margin of less than 14,000. The ruling party has since challenged the results in Ankara and Istanbul, which has prompted opposition accusations that they are trying to steal the election. President Erdogan was never going to take the loss of Istanbul lying down. ""Whoever wins Istanbul wins Turkey"", he has often said. He is determined to win back the country's economic powerhouse. But it's a strategy fraught with risk. The Turkish lira - which has lost more than 30% over the past year - has slumped again. An economy in recession can hardly cope with more uncertainty. After all, it was economic woes that lost Istanbul for Mr Erdogan in the first place. What's more, Ekrem Imamoglu, who was formally appointed mayor last month, is gaining popularity, fast. He's reached out beyond his base and has settled into the role with ease. The re-run could widen his win - barring major irregularities against him, which many of his supporters fear. And Mr Erdogan's own party is deeply split on the issue. His diehard loyalists believe victory was stolen. But other wings of the party accept they lost, and that rejecting the result is another nail in the coffin for what's left of Turkish democracy.

"The government has signed a round of new Brexit contracts with outside consultants worth almost Â£160m. Many of them are due to run until April 2020, six months after the UK's new scheduled departure date from the European Union. Since the EU referendum, Whitehall has hired companies to carry out consultancy work to prepare for Brexit. The government said it would continue to ""draw on the expert advice"" of a range of specialists. In February, an analysis for the BBC found the government had agreed contracts worth Â£104m for outside help on Brexit.

He also said it was ""no surprise following almost a decade of austerity that has seen the civil service shrink by almost a quarter"". The Cabinet Office has now published a new round of contracts with consultants. These could be worth up to a further Â£159m, according to the data provider Tussell. Nine companies that were awarded contracts last year - including Deloitte and Ernst & Young - have had those extended by a year. Another 11 firms, including smaller suppliers, have been given brand new contracts. Redacted documents published by the government state they're being paid between Â£3m and Â£6m each for IT, accounting and auditing work and management services, all related to Brexit. Tamzen Isacsson from the Management Consultancies Association says companies are supporting the government at a critical time. ""What they have brought to the government at this unprecedented period of huge workload is capacity, insight and skills. ""This has enabled the government to set up and plan new systems to cope with a whole range of changes from border control to trade, border policy, immigration and other areas."" A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ""As a responsible government we have, and will continue to, draw on the expert advice of a range of specialists to deliver a successful and orderly exit from the EU.""
