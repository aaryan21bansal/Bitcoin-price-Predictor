"US scientists have partially revived pig brains four hours after the animals were slaughtered. The findings could fuel debate about the barrier between life and death, and provide a new way of researching diseases like Alzheimer's. The study showed the death of brain cells could be halted and that some connections in the brain were restored. However, there were no signals from the brain that would indicate awareness or consciousness. The surprise findings challenge the idea that the brain goes into irreversible decline within minutes of the blood supply being cut off. Thirty-two pig brains were collected from an abattoir. Four hours later the organs were connected to a system made by the team at Yale University. It rhythmically pumped (to mimic the pulse) a specially designed liquid round the brain, which contained a synthetic blood to carry oxygen and drugs to slow or reverse the death of brain cells. The pig brains were given the restorative cocktail for six hours. The researchers found synapses - the connections between brains - were working The study,published in the journal Nature,external, showed a reduction in brain cell death, the restoration of blood vessels and some brain activity. The researchers found working synapses - the connections between brain cells that allow them to communicate. The brains also showed a normal response to medication and used up the same amount of oxygen as a normal brain. This was all 10 hours after the pigs were decapitated. Crucially there was no sign of the brain-wide electrical activity in an electroencephalogram (EEG brain scan) that would signal awareness or perception. Fundamentally they were still dead brains. The research transforms ideas about how the brain dies, which many thought happened quickly and irreversibly without a supply of oxygen. Prof Nenad Sestan, a professor of neuroscience at Yale University, said: ""Cell death in the brain occurs across a longer time window that we previously thought. ""What we are showing is the process of cell death is a gradual, stepwise process. ""And that some of those processes can be either postponed, preserved or even reversed."" Five ways to spot if someone has Alzheimerâs The breakthroughs that could save our lives New brain cells made throughout life The pig brains came from the pork industry; the animals were not raised in a lab for this experiment. But the Yale scientists were so concerned the pigs might become conscious that they gave drugs to the disembodied brains to reduce any brain activity. And the team were constantly monitoring the brains to see if there was any sign of higher brain functions. In that case they would have used anaesthetic and ended the experiment. Ethicists, writing in Nature, say new guidelines are needed for this field because animals used for research could end up in a ""grey area - not alive, but not completely dead"". The immediate benefit of this work will be for scientists studying the brain in diseases like Alzheimer's. The organ is the most complex structure in the known universe, but techniques such as freezing slices of the brain or growing colonies of brain cells in a dish do not let researchers explore the full 3D wiring of the brain. In the long term, scientists hope to find better ways of protecting the brain after traumas such as a stroke or being starved of oxygen at birth. Dr Andrea Beckel-Mitchener, from the Brain Initiative at the US National Institute of Mental Health, said: ""This line of research could lead to a whole new way of studying the post-mortem brain. ""It also could stimulate research to develop interventions that promote brain recovery after loss of brain blood flow."" However, the researchers say it is still far too early for the field to make a difference to patients after injury. Prof Sestan said: ""We don't yet have knowledge whether we would be able to restore normal brain function."" At the moment no, but some ethicists say we should have the debate now as people who are ""brain dead"" are a major source of organs for transplant. Prof Dominic Wilkinson, a professor of medical ethics and a consultant neonatologist in Oxford, said: ""Once someone has been diagnosed as 'brain dead' there is currently no way for that person to ever recover. ""The human person that they were has gone forever. ""If, in the future, it were possible to restore the function of the brain after death, to bring back someone's mind and personality, that would, of course, have important implications for our definitions of death."" But that is not currently the case. Prof Tara Spires-Jones, deputy director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""This study is a long way from preserving human brain function after death as portrayed in the cartoon Futurama where heads were kept alive in a jar. ""It is instead a temporary preservation of some of the more basic cell functions in the pig brain, not the preservation of thought and personality."" In this experiment the answer is a clear no. The brains were effectively silent. But the research does ask as many questions as it answers: How long can the researchers keep brains going? Would the results be even better if the researchers did not wait four hours before starting? Also, the team used drugs to suppress brain activity - would the decapitated brains have been aware if they hadn't?

"This video can not be played Kezia Dugdale says the ruling is ""good news for a healthy and free press"" Former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has won a legal case brought by a pro-independence blogger who accused her of defamation. Wings Over Scotland blogger Stuart Campbell took Ms Dugdale to court after she claimed in a newspaper column that he had sent ""homophobic tweets"". In a written judgment, Sheriff Nigel Ross said Ms Dugdale was incorrect to imply that Mr Campbell is homophobic. But he said her article was protected under the principle of fair comment. As a result, the sheriff ruled that Ms Dugdale was not liable to pay any damages to Mr Campbell, who had been seeking Â£25,000. Read the full judgement,external The case centred on a tweet posted by Mr Campbell during the Conservative Party conference in 2017, which said that Conservative MSP Oliver Mundell ""is the sort of public speaker that makes you wish his dad had embraced his homosexuality sooner."" In a subsequent column in the Daily Record newspaper, Ms Dugdale referenced his ""homophobic tweets"" and accused him of spouting ""hatred and homophobia towards others"" from his Twitter account. She later raised the tweets in the Scottish Parliament, and called on SNP politicians to ""shun"" Mr Campbell. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Campbell, from Bath in Somerset, strongly denied his tweet was a homophobic reference to David Mundell being gay, and insisted it was ""satirical criticism"" of Oliver Mundell's public speaking skills. A three-day hearing took place at Edinburgh Sheriff Court last month, during which Mr Campbell described himself as a ""firm advocate of equal rights for gay people"" and said it was ""absurd"" to describe his tweet as homophobic. In his judgement, Sheriff Ross agreed that Mr Campbell ""does not hold homophobic beliefs or feelings"" and had ""demonstrated by his conduct over many years that he supports equality for homosexual people"". This video can not be played Wings Over Scotland blogger on sheriff's judgement: 'He's basically let Kezia off' The sheriff also said Mr Campbell's tweet about Mr Mundell ""was not motivated by homophobia and did not contain homophobic comments"", and that Ms Dugdale had therefore been ""incorrect"" to describe it as homophobic. But the sheriff said: ""Ms Dugdale's article contained the necessary elements for a defence of fair comment. It was based on true facts; the statements complained about were honest; it concerned a matter of public interest, and the comments were fair. ""Her comments were fair, even though incorrect"". Blogger 'distressed' by homophobia claim Dugdale stands by 'homophobic' tweet claim Kezia Dugdale's homophobia claim 'absurd' Sheriff Ross added that the defamation laws recognise there is ""significant public interest in allowing people to freely express opinions without fear of legal penalty"". He went on to describe Mr Campbell as someone who has ""chosen insult and condemnation as his style"", and said the blogger cannot ""hold others to a higher standard of respect than he is willing himself to adopt. ""I do not accept that he can dismiss the feelings or reputations of his opponents cheaply, but receive a high valuation of his own. ""Had I been awarding damages, those damages would have been assessed at Â£100"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Responding to the ruling, Ms Dugdale said she was ""delighted and hugely relieved"" to have won the case, and described it as an ""important judgement for the right to free speech and a healthy press."" The Labour MSP added: ""This ruling clearly demonstrates that every citizen is entitled to make comments as long as they are fair and reflect honestly held views"". Speaking to BBC Scotland, Mr Campbell said: ""It is completely perplexing that the sheriff could find that Kezia Dugdale's remarks were defamatory yet that she was not guilty of defamation."" He called on Ms Dugdale to apologise to him, and said he was taking legal advice on whether or not to appeal against the ruling. In a written statement, he added: ""I sought to defend my reputation against a false accusation of homophobia, to establish that I'm not a homophobe, and to prevent anyone from being able to make such claims in future. ""All of those aims have been upheld, in explicit terms, by this judgement.""

"This video can not be played There were gasps from the crowd at the moment Notre-Dameâs spire fell France is to invite architects from around the world to submit their designs for a new spire to sit atop a renovated Notre-Dame cathedral. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told reporters they hoped for ""a new spire that is adapted to the techniques and the challenges of our era"". The spire of the 850-year-old building was completely destroyed in the blaze. Meanwhile, cathedral bells across France rang out in solidarity with Notre-Dame on Wednesday. They sounded at 16:50 GMT to mark the exact moment when the blaze started on Monday. The entire cathedral was only minutes away from total destruction, officials have said. However, much of the Parisian building - including its famed towers - survived, and thoughts have now turned to how to reconstruct what has been lost. Could Assassin's Creed help rebuild Notre-Dame? Notre-Dame inspires help for US black churches Notre-Dame booksellers urge donations President Emmanuel Macron vowed it would be rebuilt ""even more beautifully"", adding that he wanted the work done within five years - although experts warn its reconstruction could take decades. The spire destroyed in the blaze was added to the cathedral during a 19th Century restoration project led by French architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc. But Mr Philippe questioned ""whether we should even recreate the spire as it was conceived by Viollet-le-Duc... or if, as is often the case in the evolution of heritage, we should endow Notre-Dame with a new spire"". Meanwhile, a copper statue of a cockerel - a symbol of France - that topped the spire has been recovered from the rubble ""battered but apparently restorable"", the culture ministry said. The cockerel contains holy relics, but it is not yet clear if these are still intact. Jacques Chanut, president of the French Building Federation, tweeted a picture of the statue being carried by Philippe Villeneuve, the architect in charge of the repair project.

So far, â¬800m ($902m; Â£692m) has already been pledged by a number of companies and business tycoons to help rebuild the Unesco World Heritage site. Mr Philippe promised ""every euro paid for the construction of Notre-Dame will serve this purpose and nothing else"", while also announcing a tax reduction for those donating towards the reconstruction. The story of the fire in graphics Why blaze was difficult to tackle How will cathedral be restored? On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump said he had spoken to Pope Francis and offered ""the help of our great experts on renovation and construction"" to rebuild the Roman Catholic cathedral. Correspondents say it is not yet clear if the Vatican will play any role in repairing the building. The cause of the fire is unknown but an investigation is under way. The blaze, which began on Monday evening and was not fully extinguished until almost 15 hours later, destroyed most of the cathedral's roof and led to the collapse of its famous spire. Firefighters have used a drone to survey the scale of the destruction. The cathedral's spire before and during the fire, then after it had collapsed Photos appear to show that at least one of the famed rose windows has survived but there are concerns for some of the other stained-glass windows. The 18th Century organ has not been burned but it is not clear if it is damaged. It was still too early to estimate the cost of the damage, said the Fondation du Patrimoine, an independent non-profit heritage group. The treasures of Notre-Dame The grief that comes from lost buildings Images show damage to cathedral's interior Deputy Interior Minister Laurent NuÃ±ez said the structure was in good condition ""overall"" but that ""some vulnerabilities"" had been found in the stone vaults and the remainder of the ceiling. The main structure, including the two bell towers, was saved in a time window of 15 to 30 minutes by a team of 400 firefighters, he said. In his speech Mr Macron heaped praise on the fire services, saying they took ""extreme risks"" to tackle the blaze. Investigators trying to establish the cause of the fire have begun questioning workers from five companies involved in the renovations that were under way at the cathedral. Officials believe the works could have accidentally led to the disaster. Offers of help to rebuild the cathedral have come from several world leaders, groups and individuals, including: Billionaire FranÃ§ois-Henri Pinault, chairman and CEO of the Kering group that owns the Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent fashion brands, who pledged â¬100m Bernard Arnault's family and their company LVMH, a business empire which includes Louis Vuitton and Sephora, who pledged â¬200m French cosmetics giant L'Oreal and its founding Bettencourt family promised to give â¬200m while oil giant Total pledged â¬100m Culture Minister Franck Riester said some of the artwork and religious items rescued would be sent to the Louvre museum where they would be kept and eventually restored.

"An age-check scheme designed to stop under-18s viewing pornographic websites will come into force on 15 July. From that date, affected sites will have to verify the age of UK visitors. If they fail to comply they will face being blocked by internet service providers. But critics say teens may find it relatively easy to bypass the restriction or could simply turn to porn-hosting platforms not covered by the law. Twitter, Reddit and image-sharing community Imgur, for example, will not be required to administer the scheme because they fall under an exceptionwhere more than a third of a site or app's content,externalmust be pornographic to qualify. Likewise, any platform that hosts pornography but does not do so on a commercial basis - meaning it does not charge a fee or make money from adverts or other activity - will not be affected. Government in email privacy blunder Furthermore, it will remain legal to use virtual private networks (VPNs), which can make it seem like a UK-based computer is located elsewhere, to evade the age checks. The authorities have, however, acknowledged that age-verification is ""not a silver bullet"" solution, but rather a means to make it less likely that children stumble across unsuitable material online. ""The introduction of mandatory age-verification is a world-first, and we've taken the time to balance privacy concerns with the need to protect children from inappropriate content,"" said the Minister for Digital Margot James. ""We want the UK to be the safest place in the world to be online, and these new laws will help us achieve this."" This video can not be played Past moves to police pornography in the UK It had originally been proposed that pornographic services thatrefused to carry out age checks could be fined up to Â£250,000,external. However, this power will not be enforced because ministers believe the threat toblock defiant sites will be sufficient,externaland that trying to chase overseas-based entities for payment would have been difficult. However, the government has said that other measures could follow. ""We know that pornography is available on some social media platforms and we expect those platforms to do a lot more to create a safer environment for children,"" a spokesman for the Department of Digital Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) told the BBC. ""If we do not see action then we do not rule out legislating in the future to force companies to take responsibility for protecting vulnerable users from the potentially harmful content that they host."" The age checks wereoriginally proposed by the now defunct regulator Atvod in 2014and were enacted into law as part of the the Digital Economy Act 2017. But their rollout had been repeatedly delayed. UK-hosted pornographic video services already have to verify visitors' ages, as do online gambling platforms. The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) - which gives movies their UK age certificates - will be responsible for regulating the effort. It will instruct internet providers which sites and apps to block for non-compliance. In addition, it can call on payment service providers to pull support, and ask search engines and advertisers to shun an offending business. Websites to be fined over 'online harms' Under-18s face 'like' and 'streaks' limits on social media Dating apps 'must not risk child safety' The pornographic platforms themselves will have freedom to choose how to verify UK visitors' ages. But the BBFC has said that it will award solutions that adopt ""robust"" data-protection standards with a certificate, allowing them to display a green AV (age verification) symbol on their marketing materials to help consumers make an informed choice. One digital rights campaign group questioned the sense of this scheme being voluntary. ""Having some age verification that is good and other systems that are bad is unfair and a scammer's paradise - of the government's own making,"" said Jim Killock from the Open Rights Group. ""Data leaks could be disastrous. And they will be the government's own fault."" Mindgeek, one of the adult industry's biggest players, has developed an online system of its own called AgeID, which it hopes will be widely adopted. It involves adults having to upload scans of their passports or driving licences, which are then verified by a third-party. It has said that all the information will be encrypted and that the AgeID system will not keep track of how each users' accounts are used. Mindgeek intends to launch its AgeID system soon in the UK High street stores and newsagentswill also sell separate age-verification cards to adults after carrying out face-to-face checks,external, according to the government. Dubbed ""porn passes"" by the media, the idea is that users would type in a code imprinted on the cards into pornographic websites to gain access to their content. The BBFC has said it will alsocreate an online form for members of the public to flag,externalnon-compliant sites once the new regulations come into effect. ""We want to make sure that when these new rules are implemented they are as effective as possible,"" commented the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC). ""To accomplish this, it is crucial the rules keep pace with the different ways that children are exposed to porn online."" The age checks form part of a wider effort by the UK's authorities to make the internet safer to use for young people. Most recently, DCMS proposed the creation of anew regulator to tackle apps that contain content promoting self-harm and suicide,external, among other problems. In addition, the Information Commissioner's Office hasproposed services stop using tools that encourage under-18s to share more personal data,externalabout themselves than they would do otherwise. The idea of the government keeping a database of verified porn viewers had sounded like a privacy and ethical nightmare. Luckily it has dodged that bullet. While ministers have ordered porn sites to age-verify users, they have not told them how they must do so. That means different sites will have different systems Those ""porn passes"" that your friendly local newsagent may soon dish out are a theoretical solution, but there is no obligation for any porn site to accept them. So, you may potentially have to verify yourself several times for several porn sites. Despite the introduction of a new kitemark-like badge to identify cyber-security conscious systems, there's still a concern that some will suffer data breaches causing people's adult interests to be exposed.

"Comlongon Castle is attached to a 14 bedroom hotel One of the south of Scotland's most popular wedding venues has closed, as the owners apply for bankruptcy. Comlongon Castle in Dumfries and Galloway ceased trading last week after ""encountering liquidity problems"" over the last year. The move came as a shock to couples with weddings booked at the venue, with one telling BBC Scotland of fears they could be left Â£6,000 out-of-pocket. A small number of staff have also been made redundant. Accountants Johnston Carmichael said it was set to be appointed as trustee to the partnership that owned, operated and managed Comlongon Castle. People who have bookings with the hotel at Clarencefield have been asked to contact the accountancy firm. Its restructuring partner Donald McNaught said: ""We will be dealing with creditors' claims after the partnership business behind Comlongon Castle encountered liquidity problems during the past year and ceased trading just over a week ago. ""We are aware that the time between Christmas and Easter is widely recognised within the hotel industry as a difficult trading period - and the business arrived at a point where it could no longer continue to operate. ""I would encourage anyone who had a booking with the hotel to get in contact with Johnston Carmichael immediately."" Suzanne Campbell and William Wakefield were due to hold their wedding at Colmongon on 6 July Childhood sweethearts Suzanne Campbell and William Wakefield have spent two years planning their dream wedding. The 23-year-olds who met at school were counting down the last 12 weeks to their big day at Colmongon Castle on 6 July. Their decision to select the restored 15th Century castle was an easy one, Ms Campbell, a nursery practitioner, told the BBC Scotland website. ""We had a few venues in mind and when we went to Comlongon, we fell in love with the grounds,"" she said. ""We thought it would be nice for pictures, everybody seemed really friendly, it seemed like the perfect place really."" With a deposit paid, they ordered flowers, decorations, a cake, a DJ and a photographer. Mr Wakefield, a chef, had spent time meticulously going through the menu and their 70 guests had replied with their food choices. The couple met at school and have been planning their wedding for two years At the end of the March, the couple from Dumfries paid a visit to the hotel to add to their deposit - bringing it to a total of Â£6,000. ""Everything seemed fine, and everyone there was happy enough,"" she said. But on Friday Mr Wakefield's father heard a rumour from a friend at work that the hotel was closed. When Ms Campbell sent an email to find out more details, she received an automatic reply confirming its closure and adding details of the administrator. ""We were devastated really, and angry that no one had contacted us from Comlongon,"" she said. Now they are frantically searching for a new venue for their wedding - and hoping to get their Â£6,000 back. Ms Campbell said: ""I'd like an apology from Comlongon, our wedding to go ahead, and to get our money back."" The castle is set in 140 acres of grounds Couples who planned to marry at Colmongon Castle were promised a memorable wedding in the ""romantic medieval great hall"". It was popular with couples keen for a traditional wedding in a Scottish castle - particularly with people from outside Scotland. Set in 140 acres of gardens and woodlands, the castle is attached to a 14-room hotel. On its website,external, the owners claim to have had more than three decades of experience at successfully organising weddings. It was also marketed as a country house hotel ""specialising in quiet getaways"". Owner Phillip Ptolomey said his parents bought the hotel in 1984, after it was up for sale for many years. It was suffering from neglect, but he said the building has since been extensively renovated. After taking it over in 1995, he said he continued to upgrade the castle and the hotel - but it came at a cost. Writing on the hotel website, he said: ""Every penny generated goes to the restoration of the castle and estate. ""This work will probably never be finished as constant upgrades require a budget far in excess of that generated by being run as a hotel. ""However, this castle deserves to be saved, restored and to survive.""

"This video can not be played Specialist police teams were used to remove the group from the DLR train Climate change activists glued themselves to a train and others chained themselves to Jeremy Corbyn's home in a third day of protests. Extinction Rebellion protesters have been blocking traffic at Marble Arch, Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Oxford Circus since Monday. Earlier, three activists were glued to a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) train at Canary Wharf, causing minor delays. Four people also glued themselves together at the Labour leader's home. Four people glued themselves together at Jeremy Corbyn's home in north London The activists, who also used a bike lock to attach themselves to Mr Corbyn's north London house, said they supported him but wanted the Labour Party to go further than declaring a ""climate emergency"". After ending their protest Tracee Williams, one of the group, said she did not think the action was a ""misstep but whether we'd do it again, I'm not so sure"". Mr Corbyn left his home but declined to meet or speak to any of the protesters. Easter eggs and flowers from the group, which had been taken into Mr Corbyn's home earlier, were later returned to the street by the Labour leader's wife Laura Alvarez. Ms Williams added the group ""really felt we had to bring it to his front door"" but ""feel absolutely terrible about upsetting his wife"". As of 17:00 BST, 340 people have been arrested since Monday over the protests, the Met Police said. Jeremy Corbyn declined to speak to any of the protesters when he left his home The campaigner who glued himself to a train window was removed about an hour after the start of the DLR protest, at about 10:50. The man and a woman who unfurled a banner and glued themselves to the top of the train's carriage were also later removed and carried off by officers. BTP said three people had been arrested for obstructing the railway. Extinction Rebellion: Can the plan work? Climate protest arrests close to 300 'Our objective is to cause disruption' Extinction Rebellion targeted the DLR after members changed their minds about disrupting the Tube network. It came after BTP ordered Transport for London (TfL) to switch off wifi at Tube stations to deter protests. Two activists climbed on to a train at Canary Wharf while another glued his hand to the window Supt Matt Allingham said extra officers would be on duty throughout the day, adding: ""We will not tolerate any activity which disrupts the millions of passengers who rely on using the rail network in London."" Campaigners at Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Oxford Circus have been ordered to restrict their protests to Marble Arch. The Met said protesters were being removed from both areas and those who did not comply would be arrested. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Police have been sent in to clear protesters from Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Oxford Circus The Metropolitan Police says it uses a ""fluid de-bonding agent"" - but refuses to specify what that contains for operational reasons. Dr Mark Elliott, a senior lecturer in organic chemistry at Cardiff University, said warm, soapy water or the compound acetone would be the most suitable method - but warned any removal was likely to be painful. ""Anyone who has inadvertently stuck their fingers together with superglue will know how difficult and painful it can be to separate then - and the fingertips are relatively tough,"" he says. ""It is even more painful when other, softer, areas of skin become bonded."" According to Dr Elliott, the general advice is to use warm, soapy water, then to apply gentle pressure - for example by inserting a spatula. ""This will inevitably take time and be rather painful,"" he warned. Alternatively, acetone - normally found in nail-varnish remover - can make it easier to remove the glue - but ""easier"", he adds, ""is very much a relative term"". How do you un-glue a protester?

It has three core demands: for the government to ""tell the truth about climate change"", reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025, and create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible. But critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched. The government said it shared ""people's passion"" to combat climate change and ""protect our planet for future generations"". The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the UK had cut its emissions by 44% since 1990.

"Alan GarcÃ­a had been accused of taking bribes from Brazilian firm Odebrecht Former Peruvian President Alan GarcÃ­a has died after shooting himself as police arrived at his home to arrest him over bribery allegations. Mr GarcÃ­a was rushed to hospital in the capital, Lima. His death was confirmed by current President MartÃ­n Vizcarra. A crowd of supporters gathered outside the hospital building, and were held back by a line of police officers. Mr GarcÃ­a was accused of taking bribes from Brazilian construction company Odebrecht - claims he denied. Huge corruption scandal shows no sign of waning Mr GarcÃ­a served as president from 1985 to 1990 and again from 2006 to 2011. Officers had been sent to arrest him at his home in the affluent Miraflores neighbourhood in connection with the allegations. Interior Minister Carlos MorÃ¡n told reporters that when police arrived, Mr GarcÃ­a asked to make a phone call and went into a room and closed the door. Minutes later, a shot rang out, Mr MorÃ¡n said. Police forced the door open and found Mr GarcÃ­a sitting on a chair with a bullet wound to his head. A hearse arrived at the hospital as it was announced that Mr GarcÃ­a had died Ricardo Pinedo, Mr GarcÃ­a's secretary, said the former president had four or five weapons in his home, gifts he had received from the military, and that he had used one of these to shoot himself. He underwent emergency surgery in the Casimiro Ulloa hospital in Lima. Health Minister Zulema TomÃ¡s said Mr GarcÃ­a had to be resuscitated three times after suffering cardiac arrests before finally succumbing to his injuries. In a post on Twitter, Mr Vizcarra said he was ""shocked"" by the former president's death and sent his condolences to his family. Allow Twitter content?

Omar Quesada, the general secretary of Mr GarcÃ­a's American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA) party, told reporters: ""Alan GarcÃ­a has died, long live APRA."" Supporters gathered outside the hospital to grieve Investigators say he took bribes from Odebrecht during his second term in office, linked to a metro line building project in the capital. Odebrecht has admitted paying almost $30m (Â£23m) in bribes in Peru since 2004. But Mr GarcÃ­a maintained he was the victim of political persecution, writing in a tweet on Tuesday that there was ""no clue or evidence"" against him. In November last year he unsuccessfully applied for political asylum in Uruguay. Born on 23 May 1949 in Lima Studied law and sociology Elected to Peru's Chamber of Deputies for the Aprista Party of Peru (APRA) Became Peru's youngest ever president in 1985 at the age of 36 A gifted orator, he was described by some as ""Latin America's Kennedy"" Served two terms as president, first from 1985-1990, then from 2006-2011 Source: BBC Monitoring Odebrecht is a Brazilian construction giant behind major infrastructure projects around the world, including venues for the 2016 Olympics and 2014 World Cup in its home country. But under the glare of anti-corruption investigators the company admitted paying bribes in more than half of the countries in Latin America, as well as in Angola and Mozambique in Africa. Investigators say Odebrecht bribed officials or electoral candidates in exchange for lucrative building contracts. BBC South America business correspondent Daniel Gallas says the scandal shows no sign of abating almost four years since it was uncovered. No other company in Latin America has had such an ability to sustain so many high-level connections across so many different parties and countries for such a long period of time, he says. Brazil's Odebrecht corruption scandal explained Four of Peru's most recent presidents are all being investigated for alleged corruption, with a fifth - Alberto Fujimori - serving a prison sentence for corruption and human rights abuses. Ex-leader Pedro Pablo Kuczynski was taken to hospital with high blood pressure on Wednesday just days after his own arrest in connection with Odebrecht charges. Reports said he was in intensive care. The current leader of the opposition, Keiko Fujimori, is also in pre-trial detention on charges of taking $1.2m (Â£940,000) in bribes from Odebrecht. In October, an opinion poll by Datum showed 94% of Peruvians believed the level of corruption in their country was either high or very high.

"Eric Butts is a 40-year-old YouTuber from Lexington, Kentucky ""I intentionally put crying trailers on the internet. I have to have a thick skin."" Eric Butts is what you might call a ""reaction YouTuber"". He makes videos where he watches trailers and reacts, whether that's with laughter, bemusement or even tears. So as far as he was concerned, a recent video where he cried while watching the new Star Wars Episode IX teaser trailer was not unusual. The internet disagreed. ""It started blowing up in a very negative way,"" Eric told the BBC. ""I was getting very horrible stuff sent to me."" As social media became saturated with hate-filled tweets and his video was viewed more than 6.8 million times on Twitter - at the time of writing - it seemed there would be no end to people mocking him for his reaction. That is until his video caught the eye of Mark Hamill, the actor who played Luke Skywalker, who tweeted his support. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Eric told the BBC that ""with a name like Eric Butts"" he was used to getting insulted online. ""It wasn't really getting to me,"" he said. ""When it all started, before Mark Hamill got involved, I was on holiday for my 40th birthday with my fiancee. ""It's hard to get upset with an ocean front and a private pool."" On return from his holiday, Eric was still receiving negative comments, but was happy that he was getting money from the ad revenue on YouTube. ""So I was thinking, hey, I'm making a few extra bucks and I can buy a video game,"" he told the BBC. A prominent Twitter commenter suggested it made them want to ""cringe to death"". Another called Eric part of ""a whole new population of undateable men"". This was when things took another turn for the worse. ""There was some really horrible stuff,"" Eric said. ""They took my reaction video and changed it so they had me react to other things. ""Some of it was funny but there was some horrible stuff, anti-Semitism like Holocaust footage, racial stuff, people really trying to bully."" These aren't the spoilers you're looking for The gamer who became a meme overnight George Lucas still loves Jar Jar Binks Eric said this was the lowest point, but also what sparked the highest point - a second reaction from Hamill. ""The next day things legitimately got to me,"" he said, ""but in the best of ways. ""Mark Hamill was defending what I was doing."" Allow Twitter content?

Eric explained that the Star Wars actor's involvement started a shockwave of positive feedback. ""I was getting this outpouring of support,"" he said, ""far outweighing the trolls."" The support came from all angles online, whether it beStar Wars fans,external,fellow YouTubers,externalor self-proclaimed ""proud geekazoids,external"". And game designer Cory Barlog tweeted his support, even changing his Twitter name to #undateable in reference to a critical tweet. Suddenly Eric was receiving support from film-makers themselves, withZootopia and Moana writer Jared Bush,externalsaying that his enthusiasm for films ""means the world"". It culminated in Star Wars Rogue One writer Gary Whitta revealing that he was a closet fan of the YouTuber - even slyly starting the tongue-in-cheek hashtag #ILoveButts. Gary Whitta's tweet minus a slightly sweary turn of phrase But it was the tweet from Hamill that meant the most to Eric. ""When Mark Hamill tweeted me,"" he said, ""my hands started shaking. ""Star Wars has been such a huge deal in my life from my childhood onwards. ""I joked that I started crying again, but I did. The character he portrayed was such an influence on me.""

"This video can not be played Taking the last flight of India's stricken Jet Airways Troubled Indian airline Jet Airways has temporarily suspended all its domestic and international flights after failing to find fresh funding. The airline said its last flight would operate on Wednesday as it was not able to pay for fuel and other critical services. Jet Airways said it had no choice but to suspend the flights, but hopes to start flying again. It has $1.2bn (Â£900m) debt and has been in talks with lenders for weeks. Jet Airways, which has 123 planes, was once India's biggest private airline, but reports say that just five planes have been in use. In a statement,externalthe airline said it had been forced to ground all its flights because ""prolonged and sustained efforts with lenders and authorities did not yield the desired results"". The Indian government had asked state-run banks to step in with a bailout plan for the airline - which employs 23,000 people and was founded by Naresh Goyal more than 25 years ago. He stepped down as chairman last month. India's aviation boom runs into turbulence Jet Airways fails to secure emergency funding The riches to rags story of India's oldest private airline Pilots, engineers, and ground staff have not been paid for months, and passengers have been left stranded around the world as a result of cancellations. ""Late last night, Jet Airways was informed by the State Bank of India (SBI), on behalf of the consortium of Indian lenders, that they are unable to consider its request for critical interim funding,"" the airline said. ""Since no emergency funding from the lenders or any other source is forthcoming, the airline will not be able to pay for fuel or other critical services to keep the operations going. Consequently, with immediate effect, Jet Airways is compelled to cancel all its international and domestic flights. The last flight will operate today,"" it added. Ravinder Singh Robin, BBC Punjabi Jet's last flight before the suspension departed from Amritsar and as the flight took off the brightness of the iconic Golden Temple was visible through the night sky. It was an emotional last journey for the crew and even for the ground staff. ""The sun will rise again,"" the pilot told me before he took charge. He had worked for the airline for 17 years and was hopeful of reprieve. Many people didn't even bother turning up for the flight, mistakenly believing this would be cancelled too but for those who did make it on board there was a palpable sense of community and concern for the staff of Jet Airways. Ground staff prepare for Jet Airways last flight, departing from Amritsar to Mumbai and Delhi. Passengers asked cabin crew what was to happen to their jobs, where they would go from here. There have been no clear answers for Jet staff - and many felt a deal would come through, but worry was nevertheless etched on their faces. Many were asking questions about their onward journeys and felt frustration at the state of India's airline industry, remembering the fate of Kingfisher Airlines. Yet others booked tickets on this particular flight just to make history. Before the flight touched down, the pilot spoke a few optimistic words to the passengers telling them this may be the last flight for now, but he very much hoped they would fly Jet once again. The banks have been seeking a bidder for the airline, which said it would continue to support them in their efforts. Etihad Airways already owns 24% of Jet Airways and is reported to have expressed an interest in taking more control. ""Jet Airways is hopeful that it will be able to bring the joy of flying back to its guests as soon as possible,"" the airline said. Naresh Goyal founded Jet more than 25 years ago The carrier operated 600 domestic and 380 international routes, including out of London, Amsterdam and Paris, and had grown rapidly before it started to lose market share after the entry of low-cost airlines like IndiGo & SpiceJet. The UK's Civil Aviation Authority tweeted advice to customers, outlining different approaches for seeking refunds depending on how the flight was booked. Allow Twitter content?

"Naomi Long has spoken to UUP leader Robin Swann about the leaflet The Alliance Party has condemned an election leaflet that claimed its Belfast councillors had a record of ""voting with the Provisional IRA's political wing"". The leaflet was issued by Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) council candidates Peter Johnston and Jim Rodgers. It said Alliance councillors on Belfast City Council were ""closely aligned to Sinn FÃ©in"". The UUP said it was ""not a central UUP message"". Mr Johnston and Mr Rodgers are standing for election to Belfast City Council in the Ormiston ward. Alliance leader Naomi Long said: ""This is a deliberate attempt by the UUP to link Alliance members to the IRA, in an area where our offices have been attacked, representatives have received death threats and some have been forced to leave their homes due to previous raising of tensions by the UUP and others. ""While I wish I could say I was surprised by their latest actions, giventhe UUP's involvement in producing 40,000 inflammatory leaflets several years ago, I sadly am not."" Speaking on theBBC's Evening Extra programme, the Alliance leader called for the leaflet to be withdrawn and for an apology to be issued to its councillors who sit on Belfast City Council. ""Alliance, throughout it's history, has been unequivocal when it came to violence and upholding the rule of law, and therefore of course it offends me,"" she said. ""But I think also, potentially, places our councillors and our workers in danger when people try to falsely align us with any paramilitary organisation."" She added that there was no need to ""smear"" rival candidates in order to get elected. BBC News NI has seen correspondence from Mrs Long to UUP leader Robin Swann, sent on Friday, where she asked for ""assistance in getting this nonsense stopped"". She said the leaflet was not factually correct and that language of that type could ""enable"" threats from members of the public. It is understood Mr Swann contacted Mrs Long in relation to her concerns on Wednesday. A UUP spokesperson said the matter had been referred to party officers. They said: ""This was not a central Ulster Unionist Party message. It is included in a leaflet distributed in the Ormiston District Electoral Area (DEA). ""Naomi Long advised Robin Swann that she had also referred the leaflet to the Local Government Ombudsman."" On Twitter, the UUP MLA Doug Beattie said the message in the leaflet was ""not my view"".

"Dr Susan Connolly said the levels of obesity in Northern Ireland are ""frightening"" Northern Ireland's obesity levels are shocking, according to a cardiologist working in the Western Health Trust. Dr Susan Connolly was speaking ahead of a new programme at the South West Acute Hospital in Enniskillen. Our Hearts, Our Minds aims to help people reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes by becoming more active, stopping smoking and eating better. Dr Connolly said people here had much more unhealthy lifestyles than in some other parts of the UK. Obesity had become a ""social norm"", she added. BMI and obesity: Where are you on the UK fat scale? Obesity-related deaths rise in Northern Ireland Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall on why Britain is losing the fat fight ""One in five of the population smokes, which is much higher than in England, the majority of us are overweight or obese, our diets are poor and we don't know how many calories we are eating,"" said Dr Connolly.

Where a user's data is entered in imperial units, we first convert to metric and then carry out the BMI calculation. The BMI result is assigned to a standard category: Less than 18.5 - underweight 18.5 to 24.9 - healthy weight 25 to 29.9 - overweight 30 to 39.9 - obese 40 and over - very obese (also known as morbidly obese) Dr Connolly's views were borne out by a Department of Health survey for 2017-18, which found that 37% of people in Northern Ireland were overweight, and 27% were obese. People were making an effort to lose weight - but not always successfully - 40% of men  and 47% of women had changed their eating habits to try to lose weight. The survey found that lack of willpower was the main obstacle to successful weight loss. About a quarter of children were also found to be overweight. The Enniskillen programme is being delivered as part of the transformation agenda and is for patients living with vascular disease, and for people identified as ""at risk"" of developing heart disease. It is the first of its kind in the UK and is based on research carried out in Imperial College, London. During its 12 weeks, a multi-disciplinary team including a nurse specialist, physiotherapist, dietician and psychologist supported by a consultant cardiologist will work alongside the patient and their partner or relative. Lack of will power is one of the main obstacles to achieving weight loss At the end of the programme, both the patient and their partner will get feedback on how successfully they have changed their lifestyle and other risk factors such as their blood pressure and cholesterol. Dr Connolly said the research was very clear - that getting a sedentary person to move even a little can make a huge difference to their health. ""The patient has to find something they enjoy doing, whether it is dancing, walking, swimming,"" she said. ""If they enjoy doing it, they'll keep doing it.""

"This video can not be played There were gasps from the crowd at the moment Notre-Dameâs spire fell France is to invite architects from around the world to submit their designs for a new spire to sit atop a renovated Notre-Dame cathedral. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told reporters they hoped for ""a new spire that is adapted to the techniques and the challenges of our era"". The spire of the 850-year-old building was completely destroyed in the blaze. Meanwhile, cathedral bells across France rang out in solidarity with Notre-Dame on Wednesday. They sounded at 16:50 GMT to mark the exact moment when the blaze started on Monday. The entire cathedral was only minutes away from total destruction, officials have said. However, much of the Parisian building - including its famed towers - survived, and thoughts have now turned to how to reconstruct what has been lost. Could Assassin's Creed help rebuild Notre-Dame? Notre-Dame inspires help for US black churches Notre-Dame booksellers urge donations President Emmanuel Macron vowed it would be rebuilt ""even more beautifully"", adding that he wanted the work done within five years - although experts warn its reconstruction could take decades. The spire destroyed in the blaze was added to the cathedral during a 19th Century restoration project led by French architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc. But Mr Philippe questioned ""whether we should even recreate the spire as it was conceived by Viollet-le-Duc... or if, as is often the case in the evolution of heritage, we should endow Notre-Dame with a new spire"". Meanwhile, a copper statue of a cockerel - a symbol of France - that topped the spire has been recovered from the rubble ""battered but apparently restorable"", the culture ministry said. The cockerel contains holy relics, but it is not yet clear if these are still intact. Jacques Chanut, president of the French Building Federation, tweeted a picture of the statue being carried by Philippe Villeneuve, the architect in charge of the repair project.

So far, â¬800m ($902m; Â£692m) has already been pledged by a number of companies and business tycoons to help rebuild the Unesco World Heritage site. Mr Philippe promised ""every euro paid for the construction of Notre-Dame will serve this purpose and nothing else"", while also announcing a tax reduction for those donating towards the reconstruction. The story of the fire in graphics Why blaze was difficult to tackle How will cathedral be restored? On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump said he had spoken to Pope Francis and offered ""the help of our great experts on renovation and construction"" to rebuild the Roman Catholic cathedral. Correspondents say it is not yet clear if the Vatican will play any role in repairing the building. The cause of the fire is unknown but an investigation is under way. The blaze, which began on Monday evening and was not fully extinguished until almost 15 hours later, destroyed most of the cathedral's roof and led to the collapse of its famous spire. Firefighters have used a drone to survey the scale of the destruction. The cathedral's spire before and during the fire, then after it had collapsed Photos appear to show that at least one of the famed rose windows has survived but there are concerns for some of the other stained-glass windows. The 18th Century organ has not been burned but it is not clear if it is damaged. It was still too early to estimate the cost of the damage, said the Fondation du Patrimoine, an independent non-profit heritage group. The treasures of Notre-Dame The grief that comes from lost buildings Images show damage to cathedral's interior Deputy Interior Minister Laurent NuÃ±ez said the structure was in good condition ""overall"" but that ""some vulnerabilities"" had been found in the stone vaults and the remainder of the ceiling. The main structure, including the two bell towers, was saved in a time window of 15 to 30 minutes by a team of 400 firefighters, he said. In his speech Mr Macron heaped praise on the fire services, saying they took ""extreme risks"" to tackle the blaze. Investigators trying to establish the cause of the fire have begun questioning workers from five companies involved in the renovations that were under way at the cathedral. Officials believe the works could have accidentally led to the disaster. Offers of help to rebuild the cathedral have come from several world leaders, groups and individuals, including: Billionaire FranÃ§ois-Henri Pinault, chairman and CEO of the Kering group that owns the Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent fashion brands, who pledged â¬100m Bernard Arnault's family and their company LVMH, a business empire which includes Louis Vuitton and Sephora, who pledged â¬200m French cosmetics giant L'Oreal and its founding Bettencourt family promised to give â¬200m while oil giant Total pledged â¬100m Culture Minister Franck Riester said some of the artwork and religious items rescued would be sent to the Louvre museum where they would be kept and eventually restored.

Huge corruption scandal shows no sign of waning Mr GarcÃ­a served as president from 1985 to 1990 and again from 2006 to 2011. Officers had been sent to arrest him at his home in the affluent Miraflores neighbourhood in connection with the allegations. Interior Minister Carlos MorÃ¡n told reporters that when police arrived, Mr GarcÃ­a asked to make a phone call and went into a room and closed the door. Minutes later, a shot rang out, Mr MorÃ¡n said. Police forced the door open and found Mr GarcÃ­a sitting on a chair with a bullet wound to his head. A hearse arrived at the hospital as it was announced that Mr GarcÃ­a had died Ricardo Pinedo, Mr GarcÃ­a's secretary, said the former president had four or five weapons in his home, gifts he had received from the military, and that he had used one of these to shoot himself. He underwent emergency surgery in the Casimiro Ulloa hospital in Lima. Health Minister Zulema TomÃ¡s said Mr GarcÃ­a had to be resuscitated three times after suffering cardiac arrests before finally succumbing to his injuries. In a post on Twitter, Mr Vizcarra said he was ""shocked"" by the former president's death and sent his condolences to his family. Allow Twitter content?

Omar Quesada, the general secretary of Mr GarcÃ­a's American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA) party, told reporters: ""Alan GarcÃ­a has died, long live APRA."" Supporters gathered outside the hospital to grieve Investigators say he took bribes from Odebrecht during his second term in office, linked to a metro line building project in the capital. Odebrecht has admitted paying almost $30m (Â£23m) in bribes in Peru since 2004. But Mr GarcÃ­a maintained he was the victim of political persecution, writing in a tweet on Tuesday that there was ""no clue or evidence"" against him. In November last year he unsuccessfully applied for political asylum in Uruguay. Born on 23 May 1949 in Lima Studied law and sociology Elected to Peru's Chamber of Deputies for the Aprista Party of Peru (APRA) Became Peru's youngest ever president in 1985 at the age of 36 A gifted orator, he was described by some as ""Latin America's Kennedy"" Served two terms as president, first from 1985-1990, then from 2006-2011 Source: BBC Monitoring Odebrecht is a Brazilian construction giant behind major infrastructure projects around the world, including venues for the 2016 Olympics and 2014 World Cup in its home country. But under the glare of anti-corruption investigators the company admitted paying bribes in more than half of the countries in Latin America, as well as in Angola and Mozambique in Africa. Investigators say Odebrecht bribed officials or electoral candidates in exchange for lucrative building contracts. BBC South America business correspondent Daniel Gallas says the scandal shows no sign of abating almost four years since it was uncovered. No other company in Latin America has had such an ability to sustain so many high-level connections across so many different parties and countries for such a long period of time, he says. Brazil's Odebrecht corruption scandal explained Four of Peru's most recent presidents are all being investigated for alleged corruption, with a fifth - Alberto Fujimori - serving a prison sentence for corruption and human rights abuses. Ex-leader Pedro Pablo Kuczynski was taken to hospital with high blood pressure on Wednesday just days after his own arrest in connection with Odebrecht charges. Reports said he was in intensive care. The current leader of the opposition, Keiko Fujimori, is also in pre-trial detention on charges of taking $1.2m (Â£940,000) in bribes from Odebrecht. In October, an opinion poll by Datum showed 94% of Peruvians believed the level of corruption in their country was either high or very high. Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, in office 2016-2018, resigned over a vote-buying scandal and detained last week Ollanta Humala, in office 2011-2016, accused of taking bribes from Odebrecht to bankroll his election campaign, in pre-trial detention in Peru from July 2017 to April 2018, investigation continues Alan GarcÃ­a, in office 2006-2011, suspected of taking kickbacks from Odebrecht, sought asylum in Uruguay's Lima embassy but had his request denied Alejandro Toledo, in office 2001-2006, accused of taking millions of dollars in bribes from Odebrecht, currently a fugitive in the US Peru ex-President GarcÃ­a denied asylum Brazil's Odebrecht corruption scandal explained Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain blazes Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

"Christopher Goldscheider joined the viola section of the ROH orchestra in 2002 The Royal Opera House has lost its appeal over the life-changing hearing damage caused to a viola player at a rehearsal of Wagner's Die Walkure. The Court of Appeal ruled unanimously,externalthat the ROH failed to take reasonable steps to protect Christopher Goldscheider during the 2012 rehearsal. It also failed to act on dangerous noise levels until after Mr Goldscheider's injury, the court ruled. The ROH said it was ""disappointed"" by aspects of the court's ruling. Mr Goldscheiderwon a landmark High Court caselast year, which was challenged by the ROH. In that case, Mr Goldscheider sued the London opera house, claiming damages for acoustic shock - a condition with symptoms including tinnitus, hyperacusis and dizziness - after being exposed to noise levels exceeding 130 decibels. It was the first time acoustic shock had been recognised as a condition which could be compensated by a court. In its appeal, the ROH claimed the artistic value of the music produced by the orchestra meant that some hearing damage to its players was inevitable and justifiable - but that was rejected by the court. Mr Goldscheider said he hoped the Court of Appeal guidance will help others On 1 September 2012, Mr Goldscheider was seated directly in front of the brass section of the orchestra for a rehearsal of Wagner's thunderous opera Die Walkure in the famous orchestra pit of the opera house, in Covent Garden. The bell of a trumpet was immediately behind his right ear during the rehearsal and noise levels reached 132 decibels - roughly equivalent to that of a jet engine. His hearing was irreversibly damaged. Mr Goldscheider, from Bedfordshire, now has to wear ear defenders to carry out everyday household tasks such as preparing food. Speaking after Wednesday's Court of Appeal decision, he said: ""I am grateful to the court for acknowledging that more should have been done to protect me and other musicians from the risk of permanent and life changing hearing problems. ""We all want to find a way to participate and share in the experience of live music in a safe and accessible way and I hope that the guidance which the Court of Appeal has given in my case will help others. I hope that the Royal Opera House will now support me to get on with rebuilding my life."" By Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent In terms of protecting people from hearing damage due to noise, this case effectively brings an orchestra space - or any live music venue for that matter - into line with other working environments such as a factory floor.  An orchestra space or gig venue becomes, if you like, a factory where noise is the end product rather than the by-product of an industrial process. Because no classical musician has sued an orchestra for acoustic shock before Mr Goldscheider, it has become something of a myth that orchestra spaces and live music venues are exempt from noise protection. That myth was fed in part by a defence available to employers under the Compensation Act. It effectively said that as the product (that is, the music) was of high artistic value, some noise damage to those producing it was acceptable. But the Court of Appeal ruling lays that myth to rest. Employers and organisers will now have to put processes in place to assess noise and anticipate sudden rises in noise levels. They will then have to take all reasonably practical steps to prevent injury resulting from the noise. The music won't stop, but it could get a fair bit quieter. Alex Beard, chief executive of the ROH, said he was pleased the court had accepted its argument that it was not ""reasonably practicable for orchestral musicians to wear hearing protection at all times whilst performing and rehearsing"". Such a move, as recommended in the original High Court ruling, would be ""completely impractical with potentially devastating and far-reaching consequences for the entire sector"", he said. He said the ROH would work with its legal team to consider its next move. ""This is an unprecedented and unusually complex case for the live-music and theatre industries and we will continue to work collegiately with other cultural institutions to encourage and implement best practice across the sector,"" added Mr Beard. Mr Goldscheider's solicitor, Chris Fry, said: ""Live music, and quality artistic output can be ruined by turning sound into noise. ""I can choose to turn volume and other settings down if I listen in private, but no such luxury existed for Chris Goldscheider and many other musicians who are required to have someone else dictate the noise they are exposed to at work."" This video can not be played Chris Fry speaks to BBC News He said the hearing protection is ""not always practicable"" and was ""never intended to be the complete solution"". ""The court's emphasis on reducing noise at source will have implications in live music, entertainment and sports across various jurisdictions where there is the potential for sudden and unexpected noise,"" he added. Mr Goldscheider began playing the violin at the age of five and the viola from about 21. He studied in Prague and the UK and played with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and BBC Symphony orchestras. In 2002 he joined the viola section of the ROH orchestra as number eleven viola and was promoted to number six. Career highlights included playing on stage with Kylie Minogue and with the Three Tenors to 100,000 people in Barcelona. He left the ROH in July 2014 as a result of his injuries.

"This video can not be played Taking the last flight of India's stricken Jet Airways Troubled Indian airline Jet Airways has temporarily suspended all its domestic and international flights after failing to find fresh funding. The airline said its last flight would operate on Wednesday as it was not able to pay for fuel and other critical services. Jet Airways said it had no choice but to suspend the flights, but hopes to start flying again. It has $1.2bn (Â£900m) debt and has been in talks with lenders for weeks. Jet Airways, which has 123 planes, was once India's biggest private airline, but reports say that just five planes have been in use. In a statement,externalthe airline said it had been forced to ground all its flights because ""prolonged and sustained efforts with lenders and authorities did not yield the desired results"". The Indian government had asked state-run banks to step in with a bailout plan for the airline - which employs 23,000 people and was founded by Naresh Goyal more than 25 years ago. He stepped down as chairman last month. India's aviation boom runs into turbulence Jet Airways fails to secure emergency funding The riches to rags story of India's oldest private airline Pilots, engineers, and ground staff have not been paid for months, and passengers have been left stranded around the world as a result of cancellations. ""Late last night, Jet Airways was informed by the State Bank of India (SBI), on behalf of the consortium of Indian lenders, that they are unable to consider its request for critical interim funding,"" the airline said. ""Since no emergency funding from the lenders or any other source is forthcoming, the airline will not be able to pay for fuel or other critical services to keep the operations going. Consequently, with immediate effect, Jet Airways is compelled to cancel all its international and domestic flights. The last flight will operate today,"" it added. Ravinder Singh Robin, BBC Punjabi Jet's last flight before the suspension departed from Amritsar and as the flight took off the brightness of the iconic Golden Temple was visible through the night sky. It was an emotional last journey for the crew and even for the ground staff. ""The sun will rise again,"" the pilot told me before he took charge. He had worked for the airline for 17 years and was hopeful of reprieve. Many people didn't even bother turning up for the flight, mistakenly believing this would be cancelled too but for those who did make it on board there was a palpable sense of community and concern for the staff of Jet Airways. Ground staff prepare for Jet Airways last flight, departing from Amritsar to Mumbai and Delhi. Passengers asked cabin crew what was to happen to their jobs, where they would go from here. There have been no clear answers for Jet staff - and many felt a deal would come through, but worry was nevertheless etched on their faces. Many were asking questions about their onward journeys and felt frustration at the state of India's airline industry, remembering the fate of Kingfisher Airlines. Yet others booked tickets on this particular flight just to make history. Before the flight touched down, the pilot spoke a few optimistic words to the passengers telling them this may be the last flight for now, but he very much hoped they would fly Jet once again. The banks have been seeking a bidder for the airline, which said it would continue to support them in their efforts. Etihad Airways already owns 24% of Jet Airways and is reported to have expressed an interest in taking more control. ""Jet Airways is hopeful that it will be able to bring the joy of flying back to its guests as soon as possible,"" the airline said. Naresh Goyal founded Jet more than 25 years ago The carrier operated 600 domestic and 380 international routes, including out of London, Amsterdam and Paris, and had grown rapidly before it started to lose market share after the entry of low-cost airlines like IndiGo & SpiceJet. The UK's Civil Aviation Authority tweeted advice to customers, outlining different approaches for seeking refunds depending on how the flight was booked. Allow Twitter content?

"Portugal, a country with a rich history of seafaring and discovery, looks out from the Iberian peninsula into the Atlantic Ocean. When it handed over its last overseas territory, Macau, to Chinese administration in 1999, it brought to an end a long and sometimes turbulent era as a colonial power. The roots of that era stretch back to the 15th Century when Portuguese explorers such as Vasco da Gama put to sea in search of a passage to India. By the 16th Century these sailors had helped build a huge empire embracing Brazil as well as swathes of Africa and Asia. There are still some 200 million Portuguese speakers around the world today. For almost half of the 20th Century Portugal was a dictatorship in which for decades Antonio de Oliveira Salazar was the key figure. This period was brought to an end in 1974 in a bloodless coup, picturesquely known as the Revolution of the Carnations, which ushered in a new democracy. Read morecountry profiles,external- Profiles byBBC Monitoring,external Capital:Lisbon Area:92,212 sq km Population:10.3 million Languages:Portuguese, also Mirandese Life expectancy:78 years (men) 84 years (women) President: Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa Portugal's President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa A veteran of the centre-right Social Democratic Party, Mr Rebelo de Sousa went on to have a high-profile career in journalism and broadcasting before being elected to the largely-ceremonial post of president in March 2016. He stood as an independent, campaigning to heal the divisions caused by Portugal's 2011-2014 debt crisis and austerity measures. In March 2020, Rebelo de Sousa asked parliament to authorize a state of emergency to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, the first time Portugal had declared a nationwide state of emergency since becoming a democracy in 1974. He was re-elected in January 2021 presidential election. Prime minister: LuÃ­s Montenegro President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa invited centre-right politician LuÃ­s Montenegro to form a minority government following the March 2024 elections that the Democratic Alliance (AD) won, but in which it fell short of winning a majority in parliament. The AD won 80 seats, well short of the 116 needed for a majority. The party will require the support of either the Socialists, who hold 78 seats or the far-right Chega (Enough), which won 50, to pass legislation. The party has rejected working with Chega. Portugal, governed by the Socialists since 2015, now has its most fragmented parliament since the end of its dictatorship half a century ago. Low salaries and soaring rents led to voters becoming increasingly dissatisfied with centre-left rule. Portugal's commercial TVs have a lion's share of the viewing audience, and provide tough competition for the public broadcaster. Public TV is operated by RTP. The main private networks are TVI and SIC. Multichannel TV is available via cable, satellite, digital terrestrial and internet protocol TV (IPTV). Cable is the dominant platform. The switchover to digital TV was completed in 2012. The public radio, RDP, competes with national commercial networks, Roman Catholic station Radio Renascenca and some 300 local and regional outlets.

"This video can not be played The bus plunged off a road and overturned near houses At least 29 people have died after a bus carrying German tourists plunged off a road and overturned on the Portuguese island of Madeira. Another 27 were injured in the accident near the town of CaniÃ§o. The accident happened at 18:30 (17:30 GMT) when the driver lost control of the bus at a junction and went off the road, according to Portuguese news agency Lusa. Pictures show how the vehicle stopped just short of destroying a house. ""I have no words to describe what happened. I cannot face the suffering of these people,"" the mayor of CaniÃ§o, Filipe Sousa, told broadcaster SIC TV. He said all the tourists on the bus were German but some local people could also be among the casualties. Eleven of the fatalities were men and 17 women, Mr Sousa added. The bus was reported to be carrying 55 passengers, as well as the driver and a tour guide. Another woman later died of her injuries in hospital. The vice-president of Madeira's regional government Pedro Calado said the bus met safety standards and so it was ""premature to talk about what caused the crash"". The bus appeared to have rolled down a hillside Ambulances ferried the injured to hospital An investigation into the crash has been launched, with the bus company, Madeira Automobile Society (SAM), saying it has a ""deep commitment"" to finding out exactly what happened, local newspaper Diario de Noticias Madeira reported. According to reports, the vehicle was only five or six years old and the driver was experienced. The scene of the crash has been sealed off and the injured transferred to a hospital in the island's capital, Funchal, Lusa said. Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa is flying to the island to visit the scene, the agency said. Prime Minister Antonio Costa has sent a message of condolence to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Reuters reported. The German government spokesman Steffen Seibert tweeted: ""Our deep sorrow goes to all those who lost their lives in the bus accident, our thoughts are with the injured.""

"People keep making new brain cells throughout their lives (well at least until the age of 97), according to a study on human brains. The idea has been fiercely debated, and it used to be thought we were born with all the brain cells we will ever have. The researchers at the University of Madrid also showed that the number of new brain cells tailed off with age. And it falls dramatically in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease - giving new ideas for treating the dementia. Most of our neurons - brain cells that send electrical signals - are indeed in place by the time we are born. Studies on other mammals have found new brains cells forming later in life, but the extent of ""neurogenesis"" in the human brain is still a source of debate. The study,published in Nature Medicine,,externallooked at the brains of 58 deceased people who were aged between 43 and 97. The focus was on the hippocampus - a part of the brain involved in memory and emotion. It is the part of the brain that you need, to remember where you parked the car. Neurons do not emerge in the brain fully formed, but have to go through a process of growing and maturing. The researchers were able to spot immature or ""new"" neurons in the brains that they examined. Immature (red) and mature (blue) neurons in the hippocampus in a 68 year-old. In healthy brains there was a ""slight decrease"" in the amount of this neurogenesis with age. Researcher Dr Maria Llorens-Martin told BBC News: ""I believe we would be generating new neurons as long as we need to learn new things. ""And that occurs during every single second of our life."" Rules of memory 'beautifully' rewritten Puzzle solving 'won't stop mental decline' But there was a different story in the brains from Alzheimer's patients. The number of new neurons forming fell from 30,000 per millimetre to 20,000 per millimetre in people at the beginning of Alzheimer's. Dr Llorens-Martin said: ""That's a 30% reduction in the very first stage of the disease. ""It's very surprising for us, it's even before the accumulation of amyloid beta [a hallmark of Alzheimer's] and probably before symptoms, it's very early."" Alzheimer's disease remains untreatable, but the main focus of research has been targeting clumps of amyloid beta in the brain. However, even last week more trials using this approach have failed and the latest study suggests there may be something happening even earlier in the course of the disease. Dr Llorens-Martin says understanding why there is a decrease in neurogenesis could lead to new treatments in both Alzheimer's and normal ageing. But she says the next stage of research will probably require looking in the brains of people while they are still alive, to see what is happening over time. Dr Rosa Sancho, the head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""While we start losing nerve cells in early adulthood, this research shows that we can continue to produce new ones even into our 90s. ""Alzheimer's radically accelerates the rate at which we lose nerve cells and this research provides convincing evidence that it also limits the creation of new nerve cells. ""Larger studies will need to confirm these findings and explore whether they could pave the way for an early test to flag those most at risk of the disease.""

"It has been a remarkable year of promise in medical science - from reversing blindness and paralysis to progress in cancer and infertility. A scientist in China caused the biggest stir in science for years when he claimed to have made the world's first gene-edited babies. The twin girls are apparently healthy. Embryos were produced through IVF. Then Prof He Jiankui claims he altered the babies' DNA (the blueprint for building their bodies) to protect them from HIV. But no details of the procedure have been published, so the claims have been treated with a dose of scepticism. And the announcement provoked huge ethical debate about whether the procedure should have been performed. We discussed the claims and the ethics in depth on BBC Radio 4's Inside Science He Jiankui defends 'world's first gene-edited babies' This video can not be played Kelly Thomas learned to walk again after doctors attached an electrical patch to her spinal cord Two groups of scientists have helped paralysed people walk again by stimulating their spinal cords with electricity. A spinal cord injury - such as through a car crash or sporting injury - stops instructions from the brain reaching the muscles, causing paralysis. The implants help those lost signals reach their destination. The techniques remain experimental - but in one case the patient is using the device at home in her day-to-day life. In the other, there is evidence of the damaged nerves in the spinal cord starting to regrow. This video can not be played 'I always dreamed of walking again' Electrical implant helps paralysed people to walk again Spinal implant helps three paralysed men walk again Judy Perkins's life was saved by a pioneering new therapy for her terminal breast cancer. She had tennis-ball-sized tumours in her liver and secondary cancers throughout her body and was given three months to live. Then doctors at the US National Cancer Institute tried an experimental living drug. Judy's tumour was genetically analysed to identify the rare changes that might make it visible to the immune system. Out of the 62 genetic abnormalities found, only four were potential lines of attack. Next, researchers went hunting. A patient's immune system will already be attacking the tumour, it's just losing the fight between white blood cells and cancer. The scientists screened her white blood cells and extracted those capable of attacking the cancer. These were grown in huge quantities in the laboratory and about 90 billion were injected back into her. Other work in the field of cancer immunotherapy won the Nobel Prize for medicine this year. 'Remarkable' therapy beats terminal breast cancer Nobel prize for medicine goes to cancer therapy The medical team hold the baby For the first time, a healthy baby was born using a womb transplanted from a dead person. Previous attempts had failed and some thought it would be impossible. The mother, 32, was born without a womb due to Mayer-Rokitansky-KÃ¼ster-Hauser syndrome. The donor had three children and died from bleeding on the brain. The procedure took place in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. This video can not be played ""Using deceased donor organs is a viable option"", a uterus transplant surgeon tells World at One About six weeks later, she started having periods. After seven months, fertilised eggs were implanted. And, after a normal pregnancy, a 6lb baby girl was delivered by Caesarean section. First baby born after deceased womb transplant Douglas Waters, 86, could not see out of his right eye but ""I can now read the newspaper"" with it, he says. Doctors have taken a major step towards curing the most common form of blindness in the UK - age-related macular degeneration. The macula is the part of the eye that allows you to see straight ahead - whether to recognise faces, watch TV or read a book. The macula is made up of rods and cones that sense light and behind those are a layer of nourishing cells. When this support layer fails, it causes macular degeneration and blindness. Scientists devised a way of building a layer of support cells by growing them into a ""living patch"" just one layer of cells thick. It was then delicately inserted into the back of the eye. Macular degeneration: 'I've been given my sight back' This video can not be played 'It could be of huge benefit to children having cancer treatment' A team at the University of Edinburgh has grown human eggs in the laboratory for the first time. Women are born with immature eggs in their ovaries that can develop fully only after puberty. It has taken decades of work but scientists can now grow eggs to maturity outside of the ovary. It requires carefully controlling laboratory conditions, including oxygen levels, hormones, proteins that simulate growth and the medium in which the eggs are cultured. The technique could lead to new ways of preserving the fertility of children having cancer treatment. It also provides an opportunity to explore how human eggs develop, much of which remains a mystery to science. First human eggs grown in laboratory This video can not be played Cancer blood test shows promise but more research is needed, says Prof Richard Marais Scientists have taken a step towards one of the biggest goals in medicine - a universal blood test for cancer. A team at Johns Hopkins University has trialled a method that detects eight common forms of the disease. Tumours release tiny traces of their mutated DNA and proteins they make into the bloodstream. The CancerSeek test looks for mutations in 16 genes that regularly arise in cancer and eight proteins that are often released. It was tested on 1,005 patients with cancers in the ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, oesophagus, colon, lung or breast that had not yet spread to other tissues. Overall, the test found 70% of the cancers. The vision is an annual test designed to catch cancer early and save lives. Cancer blood test âenormously excitingâ The immense importance of microbes on our health continues to explored. This year, the most common type of cancer in children was pinned on our modern germ-free lives. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia affects one in 2,000 children. Prof Mel Greaves, from the Institute of Cancer Research, amassed 30 years of evidence to show the immune system could become cancerous if it did not ""see"" enough bugs early in life. This study is absolutely not about blaming parents for being too hygienic. Rather, it shows there is a price being paid for the progress we are making in society and medicine in areas such as clean water. The long-term goal is to give children a safe cocktail of bacteria - such as in a yoghurt drink - that will help train their immune system.

Thousands of scans were used to train the machine how to read the scans. Then, artificial intelligence was pitted against humans. Each was asked to give a diagnosis in the cases of 1,000 patients whose clinical outcomes were already known. Doctors hope artificial intelligence could soon play a major role in helping to identify patients who need urgent treatment. They hope it will also reduce delays.

"Dementia often starts by affecting short-term memory Dame Barbara Windsor's husband has revealedthe actress has Alzheimer'sand her condition has worsened in recent weeks. He said they had gone public with her diagnosis - made in 2014 - because it had become ""a lot more difficult for us to hide"". Alzheimer's often develops slowly over several years. And experts say it is not always obvious to begin with because the symptoms can overlap with other illnesses. An estimated 850,000 people in the UK are affected by this most common type of dementia. So how can you spot the signs? Alzheimer's is more than just forgetting things occasionally. Everyone can forget where they left that cup of tea or people's names - sometimes. Forgetting stuff is also part and parcel of normal ageing. But these aren't necessarily signs of Alzheimer's or another form of dementia. Memory loss is much more serious and is often one of the first signs of the disease. Short-term memory is usually affected, making people forget what they've done 10 minutes before or forgetting conversations they have just had. Memory problems can also lead to people repeating themselves, or having problems recalling events that happened recently or struggling with familiar daily tasks, such as following a recipe or using a bank card. 'My husband can no longer remember my name' How diet 'helps with my Alzheimer's disease' Making tea can become a real test for those with dementia Ordinary, everyday activities can become a challenge in the early stages of Alzheimer's. On the face of it, making a cup of tea isn't complicated and doesn't require much thought. However, having Alzheimer's can make it a very difficult task which leaves people struggling to know what to do next. The changes that come with the condition are often small to start with, but they can become severe enough to affect daily life. The person or their family may notice that they now struggle to use the phone or regularly forget to take their medicine, for example. They can also develop problems with speech and language, such as having difficulty finding the right words. Their appearance may change too in time if they start to find the routine of getting washed and dressed in the morning a bit too much. Getting confused about where you are or why you are there is another common sign. People can get lost, especially in unfamiliar places, and they can become disorientated at home too. They might go upstairs or into another room and not recognise it, for example. Confusion can mean not knowing what day or month it is. Dementia is a progressive neurological disease that affects multiple brain functions Someone experiencing all the symptoms listed above is also likely to show signs of mood or behaviour changes. They might become easily upset or annoyed, get frustrated more often or lose confidence. This might extend to losing interest in daily activities or becoming less flexible and more hesitant to try new things. Anxiety and agitation often follow. Kathryn Smith, from the Alzheimer's Society, says dementia ""isn't a normal part of ageing - it's a disease of the brain"". And it doesn't just affect older people. More than 40,000 people under 65 have dementia in the UK. She says everyone's experience is different and no two types of dementia are the same, but most people realise when something is wrong. She says they won't get the support they need unless they go to their GP. ""It is possible to live well with dementia for many years. And a diagnosis doesn't change you instantly,"" Ms Smith says. But she recognises that the stigma of an Alzheimer's diagnosis means many people do feel isolated and misunderstood if they reveal it. If you are worried about a relative,NHS advice,externalis to encourage them to make a GP appointment and perhaps go along with them. The GP can carry out simple checks, take some blood tests and refer to a specialist to help with a diagnosis. The Alzheimer's Society has a helpline - 0300 2221122 - for anyone looking for information, support or advice about dementia.

"This video can not be played There were gasps from the crowd at the moment Notre-Dameâs spire fell France is to invite architects from around the world to submit their designs for a new spire to sit atop a renovated Notre-Dame cathedral. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told reporters they hoped for ""a new spire that is adapted to the techniques and the challenges of our era"". The spire of the 850-year-old building was completely destroyed in the blaze. Meanwhile, cathedral bells across France rang out in solidarity with Notre-Dame on Wednesday. They sounded at 16:50 GMT to mark the exact moment when the blaze started on Monday. The entire cathedral was only minutes away from total destruction, officials have said. However, much of the Parisian building - including its famed towers - survived, and thoughts have now turned to how to reconstruct what has been lost. Could Assassin's Creed help rebuild Notre-Dame? Notre-Dame inspires help for US black churches Notre-Dame booksellers urge donations President Emmanuel Macron vowed it would be rebuilt ""even more beautifully"", adding that he wanted the work done within five years - although experts warn its reconstruction could take decades. The spire destroyed in the blaze was added to the cathedral during a 19th Century restoration project led by French architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc. But Mr Philippe questioned ""whether we should even recreate the spire as it was conceived by Viollet-le-Duc... or if, as is often the case in the evolution of heritage, we should endow Notre-Dame with a new spire"". Meanwhile, a copper statue of a cockerel - a symbol of France - that topped the spire has been recovered from the rubble ""battered but apparently restorable"", the culture ministry said. The cockerel contains holy relics, but it is not yet clear if these are still intact. Jacques Chanut, president of the French Building Federation, tweeted a picture of the statue being carried by Philippe Villeneuve, the architect in charge of the repair project.

So far, â¬800m ($902m; Â£692m) has already been pledged by a number of companies and business tycoons to help rebuild the Unesco World Heritage site. Mr Philippe promised ""every euro paid for the construction of Notre-Dame will serve this purpose and nothing else"", while also announcing a tax reduction for those donating towards the reconstruction. The story of the fire in graphics Why blaze was difficult to tackle How will cathedral be restored? On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump said he had spoken to Pope Francis and offered ""the help of our great experts on renovation and construction"" to rebuild the Roman Catholic cathedral. Correspondents say it is not yet clear if the Vatican will play any role in repairing the building. The cause of the fire is unknown but an investigation is under way. The blaze, which began on Monday evening and was not fully extinguished until almost 15 hours later, destroyed most of the cathedral's roof and led to the collapse of its famous spire. Firefighters have used a drone to survey the scale of the destruction. The cathedral's spire before and during the fire, then after it had collapsed Photos appear to show that at least one of the famed rose windows has survived but there are concerns for some of the other stained-glass windows. The 18th Century organ has not been burned but it is not clear if it is damaged. It was still too early to estimate the cost of the damage, said the Fondation du Patrimoine, an independent non-profit heritage group. The treasures of Notre-Dame The grief that comes from lost buildings Images show damage to cathedral's interior Deputy Interior Minister Laurent NuÃ±ez said the structure was in good condition ""overall"" but that ""some vulnerabilities"" had been found in the stone vaults and the remainder of the ceiling. The main structure, including the two bell towers, was saved in a time window of 15 to 30 minutes by a team of 400 firefighters, he said. In his speech Mr Macron heaped praise on the fire services, saying they took ""extreme risks"" to tackle the blaze. Investigators trying to establish the cause of the fire have begun questioning workers from five companies involved in the renovations that were under way at the cathedral. Officials believe the works could have accidentally led to the disaster. Offers of help to rebuild the cathedral have come from several world leaders, groups and individuals, including: Billionaire FranÃ§ois-Henri Pinault, chairman and CEO of the Kering group that owns the Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent fashion brands, who pledged â¬100m Bernard Arnault's family and their company LVMH, a business empire which includes Louis Vuitton and Sephora, who pledged â¬200m French cosmetics giant L'Oreal and its founding Bettencourt family promised to give â¬200m while oil giant Total pledged â¬100m Culture Minister Franck Riester said some of the artwork and religious items rescued would be sent to the Louvre museum where they would be kept and eventually restored.

"This video can not be played Specialist police teams were used to remove the group from the DLR train Climate change activists glued themselves to a train and others chained themselves to Jeremy Corbyn's home in a third day of protests. Extinction Rebellion protesters have been blocking traffic at Marble Arch, Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Oxford Circus since Monday. Earlier, three activists were glued to a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) train at Canary Wharf, causing minor delays. Four people also glued themselves together at the Labour leader's home. Four people glued themselves together at Jeremy Corbyn's home in north London The activists, who also used a bike lock to attach themselves to Mr Corbyn's north London house, said they supported him but wanted the Labour Party to go further than declaring a ""climate emergency"". After ending their protest Tracee Williams, one of the group, said she did not think the action was a ""misstep but whether we'd do it again, I'm not so sure"". Mr Corbyn left his home but declined to meet or speak to any of the protesters. Easter eggs and flowers from the group, which had been taken into Mr Corbyn's home earlier, were later returned to the street by the Labour leader's wife Laura Alvarez. Ms Williams added the group ""really felt we had to bring it to his front door"" but ""feel absolutely terrible about upsetting his wife"". As of 17:00 BST, 340 people have been arrested since Monday over the protests, the Met Police said. Jeremy Corbyn declined to speak to any of the protesters when he left his home The campaigner who glued himself to a train window was removed about an hour after the start of the DLR protest, at about 10:50. The man and a woman who unfurled a banner and glued themselves to the top of the train's carriage were also later removed and carried off by officers. BTP said three people had been arrested for obstructing the railway. Extinction Rebellion: Can the plan work? Climate protest arrests close to 300 'Our objective is to cause disruption' Extinction Rebellion targeted the DLR after members changed their minds about disrupting the Tube network. It came after BTP ordered Transport for London (TfL) to switch off wifi at Tube stations to deter protests. Two activists climbed on to a train at Canary Wharf while another glued his hand to the window Supt Matt Allingham said extra officers would be on duty throughout the day, adding: ""We will not tolerate any activity which disrupts the millions of passengers who rely on using the rail network in London."" Campaigners at Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Oxford Circus have been ordered to restrict their protests to Marble Arch. The Met said protesters were being removed from both areas and those who did not comply would be arrested. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Police have been sent in to clear protesters from Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Oxford Circus The Metropolitan Police says it uses a ""fluid de-bonding agent"" - but refuses to specify what that contains for operational reasons. Dr Mark Elliott, a senior lecturer in organic chemistry at Cardiff University, said warm, soapy water or the compound acetone would be the most suitable method - but warned any removal was likely to be painful. ""Anyone who has inadvertently stuck their fingers together with superglue will know how difficult and painful it can be to separate then - and the fingertips are relatively tough,"" he says. ""It is even more painful when other, softer, areas of skin become bonded."" According to Dr Elliott, the general advice is to use warm, soapy water, then to apply gentle pressure - for example by inserting a spatula. ""This will inevitably take time and be rather painful,"" he warned. Alternatively, acetone - normally found in nail-varnish remover - can make it easier to remove the glue - but ""easier"", he adds, ""is very much a relative term"". How do you un-glue a protester?

Speaking on the BBC's The One Show, he said some of the protest action had been ""over the top"" but driven by a ""legitimate desire to put climate change and the environment further up the agenda"".

It has three core demands: for the government to ""tell the truth about climate change"", reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025, and create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible. But critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched. The government said it shared ""people's passion"" to combat climate change and ""protect our planet for future generations"". The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the UK had cut its emissions by 44% since 1990.

"Christopher Goldscheider joined the viola section of the ROH orchestra in 2002 The Royal Opera House has lost its appeal over the life-changing hearing damage caused to a viola player at a rehearsal of Wagner's Die Walkure. The Court of Appeal ruled unanimously,externalthat the ROH failed to take reasonable steps to protect Christopher Goldscheider during the 2012 rehearsal. It also failed to act on dangerous noise levels until after Mr Goldscheider's injury, the court ruled. The ROH said it was ""disappointed"" by aspects of the court's ruling. Mr Goldscheiderwon a landmark High Court caselast year, which was challenged by the ROH. In that case, Mr Goldscheider sued the London opera house, claiming damages for acoustic shock - a condition with symptoms including tinnitus, hyperacusis and dizziness - after being exposed to noise levels exceeding 130 decibels. It was the first time acoustic shock had been recognised as a condition which could be compensated by a court. In its appeal, the ROH claimed the artistic value of the music produced by the orchestra meant that some hearing damage to its players was inevitable and justifiable - but that was rejected by the court. Mr Goldscheider said he hoped the Court of Appeal guidance will help others On 1 September 2012, Mr Goldscheider was seated directly in front of the brass section of the orchestra for a rehearsal of Wagner's thunderous opera Die Walkure in the famous orchestra pit of the opera house, in Covent Garden. The bell of a trumpet was immediately behind his right ear during the rehearsal and noise levels reached 132 decibels - roughly equivalent to that of a jet engine. His hearing was irreversibly damaged. Mr Goldscheider, from Bedfordshire, now has to wear ear defenders to carry out everyday household tasks such as preparing food. Speaking after Wednesday's Court of Appeal decision, he said: ""I am grateful to the court for acknowledging that more should have been done to protect me and other musicians from the risk of permanent and life changing hearing problems. ""We all want to find a way to participate and share in the experience of live music in a safe and accessible way and I hope that the guidance which the Court of Appeal has given in my case will help others. I hope that the Royal Opera House will now support me to get on with rebuilding my life."" By Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent In terms of protecting people from hearing damage due to noise, this case effectively brings an orchestra space - or any live music venue for that matter - into line with other working environments such as a factory floor.  An orchestra space or gig venue becomes, if you like, a factory where noise is the end product rather than the by-product of an industrial process. Because no classical musician has sued an orchestra for acoustic shock before Mr Goldscheider, it has become something of a myth that orchestra spaces and live music venues are exempt from noise protection. That myth was fed in part by a defence available to employers under the Compensation Act. It effectively said that as the product (that is, the music) was of high artistic value, some noise damage to those producing it was acceptable. But the Court of Appeal ruling lays that myth to rest. Employers and organisers will now have to put processes in place to assess noise and anticipate sudden rises in noise levels. They will then have to take all reasonably practical steps to prevent injury resulting from the noise. The music won't stop, but it could get a fair bit quieter. Alex Beard, chief executive of the ROH, said he was pleased the court had accepted its argument that it was not ""reasonably practicable for orchestral musicians to wear hearing protection at all times whilst performing and rehearsing"". Such a move, as recommended in the original High Court ruling, would be ""completely impractical with potentially devastating and far-reaching consequences for the entire sector"", he said. He said the ROH would work with its legal team to consider its next move. ""This is an unprecedented and unusually complex case for the live-music and theatre industries and we will continue to work collegiately with other cultural institutions to encourage and implement best practice across the sector,"" added Mr Beard. Mr Goldscheider's solicitor, Chris Fry, said: ""Live music, and quality artistic output can be ruined by turning sound into noise. ""I can choose to turn volume and other settings down if I listen in private, but no such luxury existed for Chris Goldscheider and many other musicians who are required to have someone else dictate the noise they are exposed to at work."" This video can not be played Chris Fry speaks to BBC News He said the hearing protection is ""not always practicable"" and was ""never intended to be the complete solution"". ""The court's emphasis on reducing noise at source will have implications in live music, entertainment and sports across various jurisdictions where there is the potential for sudden and unexpected noise,"" he added. Mr Goldscheider began playing the violin at the age of five and the viola from about 21. He studied in Prague and the UK and played with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and BBC Symphony orchestras. In 2002 he joined the viola section of the ROH orchestra as number eleven viola and was promoted to number six. Career highlights included playing on stage with Kylie Minogue and with the Three Tenors to 100,000 people in Barcelona. He left the ROH in July 2014 as a result of his injuries.

"Eric Butts is a 40-year-old YouTuber from Lexington, Kentucky ""I intentionally put crying trailers on the internet. I have to have a thick skin."" Eric Butts is what you might call a ""reaction YouTuber"". He makes videos where he watches trailers and reacts, whether that's with laughter, bemusement or even tears. So as far as he was concerned, a recent video where he cried while watching the new Star Wars Episode IX teaser trailer was not unusual. The internet disagreed. ""It started blowing up in a very negative way,"" Eric told the BBC. ""I was getting very horrible stuff sent to me."" As social media became saturated with hate-filled tweets and his video was viewed more than 6.8 million times on Twitter - at the time of writing - it seemed there would be no end to people mocking him for his reaction. That is until his video caught the eye of Mark Hamill, the actor who played Luke Skywalker, who tweeted his support. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Eric told the BBC that ""with a name like Eric Butts"" he was used to getting insulted online. ""It wasn't really getting to me,"" he said. ""When it all started, before Mark Hamill got involved, I was on holiday for my 40th birthday with my fiancee. ""It's hard to get upset with an ocean front and a private pool."" On return from his holiday, Eric was still receiving negative comments, but was happy that he was getting money from the ad revenue on YouTube. ""So I was thinking, hey, I'm making a few extra bucks and I can buy a video game,"" he told the BBC. A prominent Twitter commenter suggested it made them want to ""cringe to death"". Another called Eric part of ""a whole new population of undateable men"". This was when things took another turn for the worse. ""There was some really horrible stuff,"" Eric said. ""They took my reaction video and changed it so they had me react to other things. ""Some of it was funny but there was some horrible stuff, anti-Semitism like Holocaust footage, racial stuff, people really trying to bully."" These aren't the spoilers you're looking for The gamer who became a meme overnight George Lucas still loves Jar Jar Binks Eric said this was the lowest point, but also what sparked the highest point - a second reaction from Hamill.

"Helium-filled balloons have been blamed for causing hundreds of train delays for passengers across the UK each year. Network Rail wants to highlight what it says is a growing problem. The rail infrastructure firm has recorded 619 balloon-related incidents - many dangerous - across England, Scotland and Wales in the past year. Many incidents involveballoons getting tangled in high-voltage overhead wires, causing delays while the electricity is switched off and the lines made safe. ""If you're on a railway station platform with a foil balloon filled with helium on a string and it comes in contact with the overhead wires carrying 25,000 volts, that could cause huge injury or death,"" said James Dean, chief operating officer for Network Rail's London North Western route. ""Ideally, we'd ask people not to bring balloons into our stations at all. Alternatively, carry them in bags so the risk of them floating upwards is minimised."" As well as the safety risks and the delays to train passengers, Network Rail says the annual cost of this problem to the British taxpayer is around Â£1m a year. The latest incident took place this week at Smethwick Rolfe Street Station, in the West Midlands, when a float-away helium balloon got wrapped around the overhead wires. Hundreds of train passengers were delayed, and the cost of delays from this incident was Â£5,000. Balloon artists have joined Network Rail's safety campaign. Trade body The National Association of Balloon Artists and Suppliers (Nabas) has launched a campaign to ban the release of foil balloons, sky lanterns or anything with plastic string or ribbons attached. Nabas chief George Oustayiannis said: ""Balloons bring fun and colour and a sense of celebration to any event, but please dispose of them responsibly, and never release balloons into the atmosphere. Respect the environment and prevent unnecessary danger and delays - please don't let go."" Earlier this week Network Rail warned that cable theft from railway equipment had caused 950 hours of delays in 2018, across more than 7,000 journeys in England, Wales and Scotland.

It effectively said that as the product (that is, the music) was of high artistic value, some noise damage to those producing it was acceptable. But the Court of Appeal ruling lays that myth to rest. Employers and organisers will now have to put processes in place to assess noise and anticipate sudden rises in noise levels. They will then have to take all reasonably practical steps to prevent injury resulting from the noise. The music won't stop, but it could get a fair bit quieter. Alex Beard, chief executive of the ROH, said he was pleased the court had accepted its argument that it was not ""reasonably practicable for orchestral musicians to wear hearing protection at all times whilst performing and rehearsing"". Such a move, as recommended in the original High Court ruling, would be ""completely impractical with potentially devastating and far-reaching consequences for the entire sector"", he said. He said the ROH would work with its legal team to consider its next move. ""This is an unprecedented and unusually complex case for the live-music and theatre industries and we will continue to work collegiately with other cultural institutions to encourage and implement best practice across the sector,"" added Mr Beard. Mr Goldscheider's solicitor, Chris Fry, said: ""Live music, and quality artistic output can be ruined by turning sound into noise. ""I can choose to turn volume and other settings down if I listen in private, but no such luxury existed for Chris Goldscheider and many other musicians who are required to have someone else dictate the noise they are exposed to at work."" This video can not be played Chris Fry speaks to BBC News He said the hearing protection is ""not always practicable"" and was ""never intended to be the complete solution"". ""The court's emphasis on reducing noise at source will have implications in live music, entertainment and sports across various jurisdictions where there is the potential for sudden and unexpected noise,"" he added. Mr Goldscheider began playing the violin at the age of five and the viola from about 21. He studied in Prague and the UK and played with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and BBC Symphony orchestras. In 2002 he joined the viola section of the ROH orchestra as number eleven viola and was promoted to number six. Career highlights included playing on stage with Kylie Minogue and with the Three Tenors to 100,000 people in Barcelona. He left the ROH in July 2014 as a result of his injuries.

"Helium-filled balloons have been blamed for causing hundreds of train delays for passengers across the UK each year. Network Rail wants to highlight what it says is a growing problem. The rail infrastructure firm has recorded 619 balloon-related incidents - many dangerous - across England, Scotland and Wales in the past year. Many incidents involveballoons getting tangled in high-voltage overhead wires, causing delays while the electricity is switched off and the lines made safe. ""If you're on a railway station platform with a foil balloon filled with helium on a string and it comes in contact with the overhead wires carrying 25,000 volts, that could cause huge injury or death,"" said James Dean, chief operating officer for Network Rail's London North Western route. ""Ideally, we'd ask people not to bring balloons into our stations at all. Alternatively, carry them in bags so the risk of them floating upwards is minimised."" As well as the safety risks and the delays to train passengers, Network Rail says the annual cost of this problem to the British taxpayer is around Â£1m a year. The latest incident took place this week at Smethwick Rolfe Street Station, in the West Midlands, when a float-away helium balloon got wrapped around the overhead wires. Hundreds of train passengers were delayed, and the cost of delays from this incident was Â£5,000. Balloon artists have joined Network Rail's safety campaign. Trade body The National Association of Balloon Artists and Suppliers (Nabas) has launched a campaign to ban the release of foil balloons, sky lanterns or anything with plastic string or ribbons attached. Nabas chief George Oustayiannis said: ""Balloons bring fun and colour and a sense of celebration to any event, but please dispose of them responsibly, and never release balloons into the atmosphere. Respect the environment and prevent unnecessary danger and delays - please don't let go."" Earlier this week Network Rail warned that cable theft from railway equipment had caused 950 hours of delays in 2018, across more than 7,000 journeys in England, Wales and Scotland.

"Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney contributed to the open letter The heads of two major central banks have written a stark warning about the financial risks of climate change. Bank of England governor Mark Carney and France's FranÃ§ois Villeroy de Galhau set out the dangers to the global economy in an open letter. ""If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,"" they wrote. The letter was co-signed by the chair of the climate-focused Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). The NGFS is a coalition of 34 central banks which was formed in 2017, with the Bank of England as a founding member. It released its first major report into climate-related financial risks on 17 April. In the letter published by the Bank of England on Wednesday,Mr Carney and Mr Villeroy de Galhau describe ""the catastrophic effects of climate change"",externalalready having an impact on the planet, such as ""blistering heatwaves in North America to typhoons in south-east Asia and droughts in Africa and Australia"". They say that ""these events damage infrastructure and private property, negatively affect health, decrease productivity and destroy wealth"". The NGFS elaborates in its ""call to action"" report, saying that climate change will lead to""disruptive events such as mass migration, political instability and conflict"",external. This is why world leaders signed the Paris climate agreement in 2015 and committed to reducing their respective countries' carbon emissions, the letter continues, in order to limit the global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius. ""But this transition brings its own risks,"" they add. The current drought in Hungary may cause farmers to lose hundreds of billions in income The NGFS sets out three climate-related financial risks that companies, banks and governments need to fight against. Physical:These are the immediate problems caused by increasingly frequent climate and weather-related events - such as severe droughts or cyclones that affect crops Transition:For example, when a business moves away from carbon-intensive industries and technologies in a ""sudden or disorderly"" way, their business models and asset valuations can end up taking a hit Liability:When people or businesses claim compensation for losses suffered from either the physical or transition risks, which can have a huge impact on insurers It is the second risk in particular - of switching to a green economy without proper planning - that Mr Carney and Mr Villeroy de Galhau focus on in their letter. ""Carbon emissions have to decline by 45% from 2010 levels over the next decade in order to reach net zero by 2050. This requires a massive reallocation of capital,"" it reads. Climate change in seven charts Talk to our climate change bot The climate protesters who want to get arrested The full NGFS report adds that ""while urgent action is desirable, an abrupt transition could also have an impact on financial stability and the economy more broadly"". ""The speed and timing of the transition is crucial,"" it continues. ""An orderly scenario, with clear policy signalling, would allow adequate time for existing infrastructure to be replaced and for technological progress to keep energy costs at a reasonable level. ""In contrast, a disorderly, sudden, uncoordinated, unanticipated or discontinuous transition would be disruptive and costly, particularly for those sectors and regions that are more vulnerable to structural change."" Companies and industries that do not adjust or properly plan for these changes, Mr Carney and Mr Villeroy de Galhau say, ""will fail to exist"". They suggest that companies ""integrate the monitoring of climate-related financial risks into day-to-day supervisory work, financial stability monitoring and board risk management"". In simpler terms - businesses need to make climate change planning an everyday thing. They also say that central banks should ""lead by example"" by making their own operations more sustainable. But most importantly, they call for more collaboration within the financial sector, with different companies and bodies sharing information about how they are dealing with these climate risks. ""An important element to achieving effective consideration of climate risks across the financial system is to support internal and external collaboration,"" they write. The NGFS has also called for regulators to come up with a classification system that shows exactly ""which economic activities contribute to the transition to a green and low-carbon economy"". ""We need collective leadership and action across countries and we need to be ambitious,"" they add. ""The NGFS is the core of the response of central banks and supervisors. But climate change is a global problem, which requires global solutions, in which the whole financial sector has a crucial role to play.""

"Prof He's university has denied any knowledge of the research, which has not been peer-reviewed A Chinese scientist who claims to have created the world's first genetically edited babies has defended his work. Speaking at a genome summit in Hong Kong, He Jiankui said he was ""proud"" of altering the genes of twin girls so they could not contract HIV. His work, which he announced earlier this week, has not been verified. Many scientists have condemned his announcement. Such gene-editing work is banned in most countries, including China. Professor He's university - the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen - said it was unaware of the research project and would launch an investigation. It said Mr He had been on unpaid leave since February. Prof He confirmed the university was not aware, adding he had funded the experiment by himself. Prof He announced earlier this week that he had altered the DNA of embryos- twin girls - to prevent them from contracting HIV. On Wednesday, he spoke at the Human Genome Editing Summit at the University of Hong Kong for the first time about his work since the uproar. He revealed that the twin girls - known as ""Lulu"" and ""Nana"" - were ""born normal and healthy"", adding that there were plans to monitor the twins over the next 18 years. He explained that eight couples - comprised of HIV-positive fathers and HIV-negative mothers - had signed up voluntarily for the experiment; one couple later dropped out. Prof He has defended his work after widespread condemnation by the scientific community Prof He also said that the study had been submitted to a scientific journal for review, though he did not name the journal. He also said that ""another potential pregnancy"" of a gene-edited embryo was in its early stages. But he apologised that his research ""was leaked unexpectedly"", and added: ""The clinical trial was paused due to the current situation."" By Robin Brant, BBC News, Hong Kong No-one really knew if he was going to show. The auditorium was packed by the time He Jiankui walked on stage. This is the man who says he has given China a world first. The handful of experts I spoke to, after they'd sat and listened to him, said they believed him. They believe this happened. But the big, big problem was that his speech and answers afterwards were scant on detail. At times he was evasive, failing to give anything like the detail about his work - what he did, how he did it, who knew - that is required of any scientific project wishing to be regarded as credible. He talked about the stigma attached to HIV/Aids in China and how important the family is to society, but he didn't give the names of ""some experts"" he claimed had reviewed his work and offered feedback. The Crispr gene editing tool he claims to have used is not new to the scientific world, and was first discovered in 2012. It works by using ""molecular scissors"" to alter a very specific strand of DNA - either cutting it out, replacing it or tweaking it. Gene editing could potentially help avoid heritable diseases by deleting or changing troublesome coding in embryos. What is Crispr? Crispr: Human embryos and ethical concerns But experts worry meddling with the genome of an embryo could cause harm not only to the individual but also future generations that inherit these same changes. Prof He's recent claims were widely criticised by other scientists. Hundreds of Chinese scientists also signed a letter on social media condemning the research,external, saying they were ""resolutely"" opposed to it. ""If true, this experiment is monstrous. Gene editing itself is experimental and is still associated with off-target mutations, capable of causing genetic problems early and later in life, including the development of cancer,"" Prof Julian Savulescu, an ethics expert at the University of Oxford, told the BBC. ""This experiment exposes healthy normal children to risks of gene editing for no real necessary benefit."" Many countries, including the UK, have laws that prevent the use of genome editing in embryos for assisted reproduction in humans. Scientists can do gene editing research on discarded IVF embryos, as long as they are destroyed immediately afterwards and not used to make a baby. Prof He's experiment is prohibited under Chinese laws, Deputy Minister of Science and Technology Xu Nanping told state media. China allows in-vitro human embryonic stem cell research for a maximum period of 14 days, Mr Xu clarified.

"It has been a remarkable year of promise in medical science - from reversing blindness and paralysis to progress in cancer and infertility. A scientist in China caused the biggest stir in science for years when he claimed to have made the world's first gene-edited babies. The twin girls are apparently healthy. Embryos were produced through IVF. Then Prof He Jiankui claims he altered the babies' DNA (the blueprint for building their bodies) to protect them from HIV. But no details of the procedure have been published, so the claims have been treated with a dose of scepticism. And the announcement provoked huge ethical debate about whether the procedure should have been performed. We discussed the claims and the ethics in depth on BBC Radio 4's Inside Science He Jiankui defends 'world's first gene-edited babies' This video can not be played Kelly Thomas learned to walk again after doctors attached an electrical patch to her spinal cord Two groups of scientists have helped paralysed people walk again by stimulating their spinal cords with electricity. A spinal cord injury - such as through a car crash or sporting injury - stops instructions from the brain reaching the muscles, causing paralysis. The implants help those lost signals reach their destination. The techniques remain experimental - but in one case the patient is using the device at home in her day-to-day life. In the other, there is evidence of the damaged nerves in the spinal cord starting to regrow. This video can not be played 'I always dreamed of walking again' Electrical implant helps paralysed people to walk again Spinal implant helps three paralysed men walk again Judy Perkins's life was saved by a pioneering new therapy for her terminal breast cancer. She had tennis-ball-sized tumours in her liver and secondary cancers throughout her body and was given three months to live. Then doctors at the US National Cancer Institute tried an experimental living drug. Judy's tumour was genetically analysed to identify the rare changes that might make it visible to the immune system. Out of the 62 genetic abnormalities found, only four were potential lines of attack. Next, researchers went hunting. A patient's immune system will already be attacking the tumour, it's just losing the fight between white blood cells and cancer. The scientists screened her white blood cells and extracted those capable of attacking the cancer. These were grown in huge quantities in the laboratory and about 90 billion were injected back into her. Other work in the field of cancer immunotherapy won the Nobel Prize for medicine this year. 'Remarkable' therapy beats terminal breast cancer Nobel prize for medicine goes to cancer therapy The medical team hold the baby For the first time, a healthy baby was born using a womb transplanted from a dead person. Previous attempts had failed and some thought it would be impossible. The mother, 32, was born without a womb due to Mayer-Rokitansky-KÃ¼ster-Hauser syndrome. The donor had three children and died from bleeding on the brain. The procedure took place in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. This video can not be played ""Using deceased donor organs is a viable option"", a uterus transplant surgeon tells World at One About six weeks later, she started having periods. After seven months, fertilised eggs were implanted. And, after a normal pregnancy, a 6lb baby girl was delivered by Caesarean section. First baby born after deceased womb transplant Douglas Waters, 86, could not see out of his right eye but ""I can now read the newspaper"" with it, he says. Doctors have taken a major step towards curing the most common form of blindness in the UK - age-related macular degeneration. The macula is the part of the eye that allows you to see straight ahead - whether to recognise faces, watch TV or read a book. The macula is made up of rods and cones that sense light and behind those are a layer of nourishing cells. When this support layer fails, it causes macular degeneration and blindness. Scientists devised a way of building a layer of support cells by growing them into a ""living patch"" just one layer of cells thick. It was then delicately inserted into the back of the eye. Macular degeneration: 'I've been given my sight back' This video can not be played 'It could be of huge benefit to children having cancer treatment' A team at the University of Edinburgh has grown human eggs in the laboratory for the first time. Women are born with immature eggs in their ovaries that can develop fully only after puberty. It has taken decades of work but scientists can now grow eggs to maturity outside of the ovary. It requires carefully controlling laboratory conditions, including oxygen levels, hormones, proteins that simulate growth and the medium in which the eggs are cultured. The technique could lead to new ways of preserving the fertility of children having cancer treatment. It also provides an opportunity to explore how human eggs develop, much of which remains a mystery to science. First human eggs grown in laboratory This video can not be played Cancer blood test shows promise but more research is needed, says Prof Richard Marais Scientists have taken a step towards one of the biggest goals in medicine - a universal blood test for cancer. A team at Johns Hopkins University has trialled a method that detects eight common forms of the disease. Tumours release tiny traces of their mutated DNA and proteins they make into the bloodstream. The CancerSeek test looks for mutations in 16 genes that regularly arise in cancer and eight proteins that are often released. It was tested on 1,005 patients with cancers in the ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, oesophagus, colon, lung or breast that had not yet spread to other tissues. Overall, the test found 70% of the cancers. The vision is an annual test designed to catch cancer early and save lives. Cancer blood test âenormously excitingâ The immense importance of microbes on our health continues to explored. This year, the most common type of cancer in children was pinned on our modern germ-free lives. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia affects one in 2,000 children. Prof Mel Greaves, from the Institute of Cancer Research, amassed 30 years of evidence to show the immune system could become cancerous if it did not ""see"" enough bugs early in life. This study is absolutely not about blaming parents for being too hygienic. Rather, it shows there is a price being paid for the progress we are making in society and medicine in areas such as clean water. The long-term goal is to give children a safe cocktail of bacteria - such as in a yoghurt drink - that will help train their immune system.

"Dementia often starts by affecting short-term memory Dame Barbara Windsor's husband has revealedthe actress has Alzheimer'sand her condition has worsened in recent weeks. He said they had gone public with her diagnosis - made in 2014 - because it had become ""a lot more difficult for us to hide"". Alzheimer's often develops slowly over several years. And experts say it is not always obvious to begin with because the symptoms can overlap with other illnesses. An estimated 850,000 people in the UK are affected by this most common type of dementia. So how can you spot the signs? Alzheimer's is more than just forgetting things occasionally. Everyone can forget where they left that cup of tea or people's names - sometimes. Forgetting stuff is also part and parcel of normal ageing. But these aren't necessarily signs of Alzheimer's or another form of dementia. Memory loss is much more serious and is often one of the first signs of the disease. Short-term memory is usually affected, making people forget what they've done 10 minutes before or forgetting conversations they have just had. Memory problems can also lead to people repeating themselves, or having problems recalling events that happened recently or struggling with familiar daily tasks, such as following a recipe or using a bank card. 'My husband can no longer remember my name' How diet 'helps with my Alzheimer's disease' Making tea can become a real test for those with dementia Ordinary, everyday activities can become a challenge in the early stages of Alzheimer's. On the face of it, making a cup of tea isn't complicated and doesn't require much thought. However, having Alzheimer's can make it a very difficult task which leaves people struggling to know what to do next. The changes that come with the condition are often small to start with, but they can become severe enough to affect daily life. The person or their family may notice that they now struggle to use the phone or regularly forget to take their medicine, for example. They can also develop problems with speech and language, such as having difficulty finding the right words. Their appearance may change too in time if they start to find the routine of getting washed and dressed in the morning a bit too much. Getting confused about where you are or why you are there is another common sign. People can get lost, especially in unfamiliar places, and they can become disorientated at home too. They might go upstairs or into another room and not recognise it, for example. Confusion can mean not knowing what day or month it is. Dementia is a progressive neurological disease that affects multiple brain functions Someone experiencing all the symptoms listed above is also likely to show signs of mood or behaviour changes. They might become easily upset or annoyed, get frustrated more often or lose confidence. This might extend to losing interest in daily activities or becoming less flexible and more hesitant to try new things. Anxiety and agitation often follow. Kathryn Smith, from the Alzheimer's Society, says dementia ""isn't a normal part of ageing - it's a disease of the brain"". And it doesn't just affect older people. More than 40,000 people under 65 have dementia in the UK. She says everyone's experience is different and no two types of dementia are the same, but most people realise when something is wrong. She says they won't get the support they need unless they go to their GP. ""It is possible to live well with dementia for many years. And a diagnosis doesn't change you instantly,"" Ms Smith says. But she recognises that the stigma of an Alzheimer's diagnosis means many people do feel isolated and misunderstood if they reveal it. If you are worried about a relative,NHS advice,externalis to encourage them to make a GP appointment and perhaps go along with them. The GP can carry out simple checks, take some blood tests and refer to a specialist to help with a diagnosis. The Alzheimer's Society has a helpline - 0300 2221122 - for anyone looking for information, support or advice about dementia.

But then it became well-known for another superlative: its involvement in one of the biggest corruption cases in history. In 2016, the Brazilian-based group signed what has been described as the world's largest leniency deal with US and Swiss authorities, in which it confessed to corruption andpaid $2.6bn (Â£2.1bn) in fines. Seventy-seven company executives agreed to plea bargains with Brazilian authorities, and their statements to investigators were made public. Their revelations had strong political and economic repercussions throughout Latin America. It's not a brand many outside Latin America will recognise, but Grupo Odebrecht is the region's largest construction conglomerate. The metro in Venezuela's capital Caracas is just one of Odebrecht's major construction projects It started out as a small family construction group in the 1940s founded by Brazilians of German origin. It grew quickly and at its peak, around 2010, the company had 181,000 employees across 21 countries. Its focus is on building large projects, such as Caracas' metro, a port in Cuba and much of the infrastructure used by Brazil in the 2014 World Cup, including some of the stadiums. The company is also one of the biggest donors to politicians in Brazil. Odebrecht is one of the firms that have been caught in Operacao Lava Jato, Brazil's corruption probe into the state oil giant Petrobras. Dozens of companies acknowledged paying bribes to politicians and officials in exchange for contracts with Petrobras. Lava Jato is the anti-corruption operation investigating Brazils energy giant Petrobras In June 2015, the group's chief executive, Marcelo Odebrecht, the grandson of its founder,was arrested,external. Since then, he and dozens of other company executives have been jailed. In 2016, all of them signed deals with Brazilian investigators, agreeing to confess to crimes and to identify corrupt officials in exchange for shorter prison sentences. Odebrecht executives have confessed to paying bribes in exchange for contracts not only in Brazil, but in various parts of the world. An international taskforce of investigators is looking into bribery in 10 countries, including Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. In December 2016, Odebrecht signed a leniency deal with authorities in the US and Switzerland, agreeing to pay $2.6bn in fines for its past mistakes - the largest sum of its kind in the world. The company also tried to settle cases with other governments so that it would be allowed to tender for future major infrastructure projects. The most explosive statements came from the former boss, Marcelo Odebrecht, who said that part of the $48m he donated to Dilma Rousseff and Michel Temer's campaign in the 2014 Brazilian presidential election was illegal. Marcelo Odebrecht was sentenced to 19 years in jail for his part in the corruption scandal Outside Brazil, revelations made by Odebrecht executive Jorge Barata prompted investigators in Peru to issue an arrest warrant against former President Alejandro Toledo, who is currently considered a fugitive. All those mentioned in the statements have strongly denied any wrongdoing, and have accused Odebrecht executives of lying. Not always. It is hard for investigators to determine whether those arrested are actually confessing to real crimes, or whether they are telling a story that prosecutors want to hear in exchange for shorter prison sentences. Plea bargains can be very rewarding for those who sign them. Some of the Petrobras executives who signed such deals in 2014 are now out of prison and serving their sentences at homes, instead of spending years in jail. Other countries across Latin America are beginning their own investigations into Odebrecht On the other hand, plea bargains have been instrumental in bringing to justice powerful people who would otherwise never have been caught.

"It is the corruption probe that has left politicians around the world looking over their shoulders. Prosecutors in a dozen countries are untangling a massive web of corruption that ran across a continent and further afield. Illegal payments may have sloshed through presidential campaigns, boosted the careers of political top brass in country after country, and oiled the wheels of worldwide construction projects including motorways, gas pipelines and hydroelectric dams. If you have never heard of a company called Odebrecht, you probably do not live in Latin America. It is a Brazilian construction giant behind venues for the 2016 Olympics, infrastructure for the 2014 World Cup and the metro system in Caracas, plus dams and airport terminals further afield. But anti-corruption investigators caught up with the company, and it admitted paying bribes in more than half of the countries in Latin America, as well as in Angola and Mozambique in Africa. Odebrecht played a game of quid pro quo: I will help you pay for your election campaign if you make sure I get that building contract. In country after country, it is alleged that Odebrecht employees made connections with those in power and those who looked like they would be getting into power soon. They did not restrict themselves to those of any particular political hue. Almost a third of Brazil's government ministers who served under former president, Michel Temer, have faced investigation,including his foreign minister and chief of staff. The predecessor of current far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who was arrested and released in a separate corruption case last month, isfacing investigationin relation to Odebrecht. He denied all allegations of corruption and accused the country's judiciary of heeding rumours and destroying reputations. The vice-president ofEcuador,Jorge Glas, became the highest-ranking government official to be convicted in the scandal when he was sentenced in December 2017 to six years in jail. Prosecutors said he took $13.5m (Â£10.2m) in bribes from Odebrecht. One of the biggest corporate corruption cases in history Who's who and what's what in corruption probe Colombiacharged a former vice-minister for transport and a former senator. The man who ran the election campaign of the former president,Juan Manuel Santos, has alleged it was financed with irregular Odebrecht payments. Mr Santos, who is a Nobel Peace Prize winner, said he did not authorise any payments or know about them. Colombia's President Santos, left, who negotiated a peace deal ending 60 years of conflict with Farc rebels, has denied authorising Odebrecht to pay for his presidential campaign Next door inVenezuela, former chief prosecutor Luisa Ortega has fled the country after being sacked. She alleges that President NicolÃ¡s Maduro is implicated and that a top court is blocking an investigation. Odebrecht hasdenied her other allegation,external- that they paid $100m (Â£76.5m) to the socialist party's vice-president, Diosdado Cabello. Venezuela has taken unfinished projects away from Odebrecht and blocked the company's bank accounts. InPeru, four ex-presidents have been placed under investigation. Ollanta Humala and his wife Nadine Herediaare are facing potentially lengthy prison sentences for allegedly receiving payments to fund his presidential campaigns in 2006 and 2011. Alan GarcÃ­a, who served as president from 1985 to 1990 and again from 2006 to 2011, killed himself with a bullet to the head on April 17 as police came to arrest him over claims he took bribes from Odebrecht. Former President Alejandro Toledo, accused of taking $20m in bribes, is thought to be living in the US and the Peruvian government has put up a $30,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. Staying with Peru, opposition leader Keiko Fujimori has come under preliminary investigation. The attorney general says a note found on Marcelo Odebrecht's mobile phone implicates her. She denied receiving money from the company. Keiko Fujimori, who ran for president last year in Peru, denies accusations she took Odebrecht bribery Panamacharged 17 people including government officials, and charged Odebrecht $59m in compensation. A lawyer from Mossack Fonseca - the firm at the centre of thePanama Papersleak - accused President Juan Carlos Varela of receiving Odebrecht donations. Mr Varela denies all wrongdoing. Mexicosummoned a former director of state oil company Pemex and other employees to give evidence over alleged Odebrecht bribes, while theDominican Republicasked Odebrecht for $184m compensation over the next eight years. Chilestarted an investigation and seized documents from the Odebrecht offices, while the firm agreed to pay Guatemala $17.9m in compensation for bribes paid to an official for public work, the attorney general's office said in January. And Brazilian newspaper O Globoreports,external(in Portuguese) that 29 countries, including Sweden, the US, France and the UK asked Brazil for help with their own Odebrecht investigations. Ecuador's vice-president Jorge Glas is serving a six-year term after he was convicted of taking $13.5m (Â£10.2m) in bribes from the firm. Former CEO Marcelo Odebrechtstarted a 19-year jail termin 2016 after being convicted of paying more than $30m (Â£21m) in bribes to officials in Brazil's state oil company in exchange for contracts and influence. Brazil's Supreme Court released a video last year showing Marcelo Odebrecht testifying More than 70 other Odebrecht executives were jailed but have agreed to plea deals, that is they agreed to provide information in exchange for more lenient sentences. Some are already out of jail and serving their sentences at home. The epicentre of the operation had a much more run-of-the-mill name, the Division of Structured Operations, but it was essentially the bribery department. Employees spent their time bribing government officials and political parties at home and abroad, to win business. The companyhas admitted this,externalto US, Brazilian and Swiss prosecutors. Money went through as many as four bank accounts in countries with good banking secrecy laws before getting to a recipient, usually an intermediary to someone with political power. When the department's employees wanted to communicate, they used a system unconnected to the main computer systems, to avoid detection. ""Dracula"" was the nickname given to Senator Humberto Costa And they gave their recipients flippant codenames: Dracula, Sauerkraut, Decrepit, Totally Ugly. One politician, whose wife was 40 years younger than him, got the codename Viagra. Protesters have hit the streets over the Odebrecht case in country after country, and the chain of events has brought corruption to the top of news agendas and prosecutors' agendas. They are ""clamouring for justice"", political analyst Geovanny Vicente Romero told the BBC ""Protesters are demanding people be held responsible for the negligence and corruption that are part and parcel of the historic inequalities in many of the region's countries,"" he said. ""Overall, people hope that the Odebrecht case will set a precedent so that these situations can be avoided in the future."" This protester in the Dominican Republic held a sign calling for corrupt people to go to jail The value of Odebrecht bonds was sliced. The downturn in construction that went alongside this contributed to a downturn in the Brazilian economy and the credit ratings agency Standard and Poor's cut the company to the lowest grading. It has recovered somewhat but is still far from excellent. The investigations have even contributed to economic downturn in Brazil, and Peru shaved almost a point off its growth forecasts for 2017, which the government blamed on ""the Odebrecht effect"". The company's website makes no mention of the scandal, but notes that ""sweeping and profound changes in its transformation process"" were undertaken in 2018, including the replacement of practically the entire Board of Directors to bring ""greater diversity."" And there have been two CEOs since Marcelo Odebrecht was jailed - but tellingly, neither has had the surname Odebrecht.

"The US Department of Justice called it ""the largest foreign bribery case in history"". After Brazilian multinational Odebrecht admitted guilt in a cash-for-contracts corruption scandal in 12 nations, it vowed to change its ways. But Brazil's authorities are still wrestling with an encrypted computer system used to run the firm's illicit payment system. The federal police building in Curitiba, in the southern state of Parana, has hardly been out of the news.  In June 2015, the now-convicted former chief executive, Marcelo Odebrecht, was brought here. More recently, the HQ received former president Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, jailed for corruption on charges related to the wider Lava Jato (Car Wash) investigation based here. Along one of the airy, tiled corridors, opposite a regular computer laboratory, there is a sealed room with a complex entry mechanism.  It is insulated with concrete, like a bunker. ""This room is totally isolated from external communication - internet, phones. And entrance is restricted. Even me, as the manager, I'm not allowed to enter,"" says Fabio Salvador, the technical supervisor. Inside, eight specialised police officers and a technical assistant from Odebrecht have worked since September to crack one of the company's computer systems, Mywebday. In the case brought by the US Department of Justice, with Brazil and Switzerland in December 2016,Odebrecht and its petrochemical subsidiary, Braskem, admitted briberyto the tune of $788m (Â£553m) and agreed a record-breaking fine of at least $3.5bn. The construction giant paid off politicians, political parties, officials of state-owned enterprises, lawyers, bankers and fixers to secure lucrative contracts in Brazil and abroad. Marcelo Odebrecht is serving out his jail term at home Apart from being the largest international bribery case ever, the Odebrecht story has one component that makes it exceptional: this was a corporation that created a bespoke department to manage its crooked deals - something prosecutors in Brazil and the US had never seen before. ""In the Odebrecht case, there are many reasons for you to become speechless,"" says Deltan Dallagnol, lead prosecutor in Curitiba. ""How a company created a whole system only to pay bribes, and how many public agents were involved.  This case implicated almost one-third of Brazil's senators and almost half of all Brazil's governors. ""One sole company paid bribes in favour of 415 politicians and 26 political parties in Brazil.  It makes the Watergate scandal look like a couple of kids playing in a sandbox."" And the web of corruption had tentacles reaching to Africa and across the region. The president of Peru was forced to resign last month in allegations related to Odebrecht. The vice-president of Ecuador is in prison. Politicians and officials from 10 Latin American nations continue to fall under the Odebrecht bus. Odebrecht was not the original focus of prosecutors in Curitiba. Lava Jato, the corruption case that's enveloped Brazil - putting some of the rich and powerful, including ex-president Lula, behind bars - began in 2014 as a money-laundering investigation. Other countries across Latin America have their own investigations into Odebrecht Focus shifted to Petrobras, Brazil's state oil company, where top managers were appointed by political parties in power. Investigators uncovered evidence that a ""cartel"" of engineering corporations - including Odebrecht - was rigging bids and paying bribes to secure contracts at inflated prices. Petrobras had become a colossal piggy bank for its executives, politicians and political parties to raid. It's estimated more than $2bn was paid in kickbacks, while Petrobras lost about $14bn through over-pricing while the scheme existed. So in 2014, prosecutors began to investigate the most influential member of that cartel, Odebrecht. The company's bribery department, known by the rather prosaic name of Division of Structured Operations, managed its own shadow budget. In plea-bargain testimony, Marcelo Odebrecht told prosecutors that everyone at the top of the company knew that 0.5% to 2% of the corporation's income was moved off-the-books. ""We're talking about a company that billed 100bn reais a year.  If we're talking about 2%, that's about 2bn reais,"" he said. In other words, up to about $600m was committed to undeclared payments.  Structured Operations paid bribes through a complex and often multi-layered network of shell companies and offshore finance. In Brazil, cash was delivered by doleiros - black market dealers.  Or by ""mules"", who travelled with shrink-wrapped bricks of banknotes concealed beneath their clothing.  Brazilian politicians were usually paid in cash.  Others had secret bank accounts. This was organised crime - highly organised crime.  All financial activity was systematised using two parallel, bespoke computer systems. Operation Car Wash is fighting corruption in Brazil, the slogan says The first allowed internal communication within Odebrecht and also with outside financial operators.  The second - the one the Federal Police in Curitiba still cannot access completely - was used to make and process payment requests. But none of this was known to the authorities in the early stages of the investigation.  A breakthrough would seal the fate of the well-oiled sleaze machine at Odebrecht. By 2015, there was enough evidence against the company to arrest the unco-operative chief executive, Marcelo Odebrecht.  In early 2016, the Federal Police gained access to the Hotmail account of one of the Structured Operations executives. They found emails related to financial transactions and a spreadsheet created by a secretary in the division, Maria Lucia Tavares.  Her home was raided. Stashed in a wardrobe were printouts from the Mywebday system itemising illicit payments. Tavares had made hard copies for her boss to look at, and then hidden them as the noose tightened at Odebrecht.  Within the division, she was responsible for making payments. ""I didn't know who the recipients were.  We used codenames, but I was never told who those people actually were, and I was never curious to find out,"" Tavares told prosecutors. So Tavares was never interested in knowing the identities of Dracula, Sauerkraut and Viagra. Many of the politicians and officials given a nickname have been identified.  But not all of them, says the police chief of Parana, Mauricio Valeixo. ""We're hoping to identify those we don't know.  And for others we have to get more information, because, for example, it's not enough just to have a nickname,"" he says.  ""We have to understand the reason why somebody might've been given $200,000."" The police chief is anticipating more arrests in the Odebrecht case, especially once technicians have cracked Mywebday.  So why is that so complicated? ""On Marcelo Odebrecht's cellphone, we found information that there were orders to destroy evidence, to clean up devices,"" says prosecutor Deltan Dallagnol. ""It seems the devices that contained the files that could open the system were destroyed.  We tried to rebuild the system in different ways. ""We asked the FBI for help. It turned out we'd need a lot of computers doing only this for more than 100 years in order for us to have a lucky strike."" But Fabio Salvador, the technical manager for the federal police, is optimistic.  His team had a breakthrough in late February. ""This is a great fight for criminal expertise in Brazil,"" he says. ""And we're going to win."" You can hear more onCorruption Incorporated - the Odebrecht Story.

"Sadaf Khadem (R) beat the French boxer Anne Chauvin (L) on Saturday An Iranian who became the first woman from her country to contest an official boxing match says she has cancelled her return home from France after hearing a warrant had been issued for her arrest. Sadaf Khadem beat the French boxer Anne Chauvin in an amateur bout on Saturday. She had planned to fly to Tehran with her French-Iranian trainer this week. Khadem was quoted by a sports newspaper as saying she believed she was accused of violating Iran's compulsory dress code by boxing in a vest and shorts. Iranian officials have not commented, but the head of Iran's boxing federation denied that Khadem would be arrested if she came home. ""Ms Khadem is not a member of [Iran's] organised athletes for boxing, and from the boxing federation's perspective all her activities are personal,"" Hossein Soori was quoted as saying by an Iranian news agency.

""Those moments will be enough to satisfy the overzealous Beyhive and probably more casual fans and admirers, too."" ""While the behind-the-scenes footage is only a fraction of the total film, BeyoncÃ© is refreshingly candid about the hard work that it took to put the shows together,""wrote Brittany Spanos in Rolling Stone,external. ""Some of the film's best scenes include the pop diva sternly but kindly dragging her team, who seem to have a hard time grasping her highly specific vision."" Fans were similarly enthusiastic, with A Wrinkle In Time director Ava DuVernay writing on Twitter: ""Gah! This has been my favourite thing for a whole year now.

"OperationShutdown, made up of bereaved families and anti-knife campaigners, is demanding a meeting of the Government's Cobra emergency committee Bereaved parents and anti knife-crime campaigners shut down Westminster Bridge in protest at the government's response to violent crime. Campaigners from OperationShutdown are demanding urgent action to tackle what they say is a ""national emergency"". Organisers have vowed to cause further disruption across the UK until change takes place. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he had implemented ""a number of approaches"" to reduce serious violence. Marchers initially gathered in Whitehall to call for a meeting of the government's Cobra emergency committee to address the recent surge in violent crime. They held a minute's silence near the Houses of Parliament in memory of PC Keith Palmer, who was murdered by a terrorist while on duty in 2017, before moved to the bridge, where they sat down. Anti-knife crime campaigners shut down Westminster Bridge after marching through Whitehall ""The government had better be listening,"" said Sandi Bogle, a former star of TV show Gogglebox whose nephew was stabbed to death in 2017. She said: ""Brexit has taken up too much time and money, and for what? Nothing has come out of it - but our kids are dying."" One of the organisers, Lucy Martindale, whose cousin was fatally stabbed, said the government held a Cobra meeting ""if there is a terrorist attack and one person is killed"". She continued: ""Several people daily are being killed on our streets, why is this not being treated as the national emergency that it is?"" OperationShutdown members called the government's response to a spike in knife-crime ""non-inclusive"" and ""tokenistic"" Tracey Hanson, whose 21-year-old son Josh was stabbed at a bar in west London in 2015, claimed many protesters were driven to act through ""a sense of desperation"". She said: ""Should we be here doing this? No, we should not, but we are and I hope we are going to make a change."" Another protester, who did not want to be named, said: ""There is only so much disruption and shutdown that the country and government are prepared to take before they realise that this issue is not going to go away."" He said the movement will and needs to spread to other cities because ""it is not a London problem"". Protesters blocked traffic by sitting down on Westminster Bridge In March the government pledged an extraÂ£100m for police in the areas worst affectedby knife violence. OperationShutdown organisers criticised the summit as ""non-inclusive"" and ""tokenistic"". The group is calling for changes to reduce violence including: independent investigation into school exclusions, better rehabilitation of prisoners to stop them going on to kill and for full jail terms to be served for murder and manslaughter. The Met Police has been approached for comment. Thirty-six homicide investigations have been launched in London since the start of the year, including 23 stabbings. The protest comes after extensive disruption was caused by aseparate environmental protest, which has closed several central London locations.

"Comlongon Castle is attached to a 14 bedroom hotel One of the south of Scotland's most popular wedding venues has closed, as the owners apply for bankruptcy. Comlongon Castle in Dumfries and Galloway ceased trading last week after ""encountering liquidity problems"" over the last year. The move came as a shock to couples with weddings booked at the venue, with one telling BBC Scotland of fears they could be left Â£6,000 out-of-pocket. A small number of staff have also been made redundant. Accountants Johnston Carmichael said it was set to be appointed as trustee to the partnership that owned, operated and managed Comlongon Castle. People who have bookings with the hotel at Clarencefield have been asked to contact the accountancy firm. Its restructuring partner Donald McNaught said: ""We will be dealing with creditors' claims after the partnership business behind Comlongon Castle encountered liquidity problems during the past year and ceased trading just over a week ago. ""We are aware that the time between Christmas and Easter is widely recognised within the hotel industry as a difficult trading period - and the business arrived at a point where it could no longer continue to operate. ""I would encourage anyone who had a booking with the hotel to get in contact with Johnston Carmichael immediately."" Suzanne Campbell and William Wakefield were due to hold their wedding at Colmongon on 6 July Childhood sweethearts Suzanne Campbell and William Wakefield have spent two years planning their dream wedding. The 23-year-olds who met at school were counting down the last 12 weeks to their big day at Colmongon Castle on 6 July. Their decision to select the restored 15th Century castle was an easy one, Ms Campbell, a nursery practitioner, told the BBC Scotland website. ""We had a few venues in mind and when we went to Comlongon, we fell in love with the grounds,"" she said. ""We thought it would be nice for pictures, everybody seemed really friendly, it seemed like the perfect place really."" With a deposit paid, they ordered flowers, decorations, a cake, a DJ and a photographer. Mr Wakefield, a chef, had spent time meticulously going through the menu and their 70 guests had replied with their food choices. The couple met at school and have been planning their wedding for two years At the end of the March, the couple from Dumfries paid a visit to the hotel to add to their deposit - bringing it to a total of Â£6,000. ""Everything seemed fine, and everyone there was happy enough,"" she said. But on Friday Mr Wakefield's father heard a rumour from a friend at work that the hotel was closed. When Ms Campbell sent an email to find out more details, she received an automatic reply confirming its closure and adding details of the administrator. ""We were devastated really, and angry that no one had contacted us from Comlongon,"" she said. Now they are frantically searching for a new venue for their wedding - and hoping to get their Â£6,000 back. Ms Campbell said: ""I'd like an apology from Comlongon, our wedding to go ahead, and to get our money back."" The castle is set in 140 acres of grounds Couples who planned to marry at Colmongon Castle were promised a memorable wedding in the ""romantic medieval great hall"". It was popular with couples keen for a traditional wedding in a Scottish castle - particularly with people from outside Scotland. Set in 140 acres of gardens and woodlands, the castle is attached to a 14-room hotel. On its website,external, the owners claim to have had more than three decades of experience at successfully organising weddings. It was also marketed as a country house hotel ""specialising in quiet getaways"". Owner Phillip Ptolomey said his parents bought the hotel in 1984, after it was up for sale for many years. It was suffering from neglect, but he said the building has since been extensively renovated. After taking it over in 1995, he said he continued to upgrade the castle and the hotel - but it came at a cost. Writing on the hotel website, he said: ""Every penny generated goes to the restoration of the castle and estate. ""This work will probably never be finished as constant upgrades require a budget far in excess of that generated by being run as a hotel. ""However, this castle deserves to be saved, restored and to survive.""

"Odebrecht has already agreed to pay $2.6bn in fines For years, Latin America's construction giant, Odebrecht, built some of the region's most crucial infrastructure projects. But then it became well-known for another superlative: its involvement in one of the biggest corruption cases in history. In 2016, the Brazilian-based group signed what has been described as the world's largest leniency deal with US and Swiss authorities, in which it confessed to corruption andpaid $2.6bn (Â£2.1bn) in fines. Seventy-seven company executives agreed to plea bargains with Brazilian authorities, and their statements to investigators were made public. Their revelations had strong political and economic repercussions throughout Latin America. It's not a brand many outside Latin America will recognise, but Grupo Odebrecht is the region's largest construction conglomerate. The metro in Venezuela's capital Caracas is just one of Odebrecht's major construction projects It started out as a small family construction group in the 1940s founded by Brazilians of German origin. It grew quickly and at its peak, around 2010, the company had 181,000 employees across 21 countries. Its focus is on building large projects, such as Caracas' metro, a port in Cuba and much of the infrastructure used by Brazil in the 2014 World Cup, including some of the stadiums. The company is also one of the biggest donors to politicians in Brazil. Odebrecht is one of the firms that have been caught in Operacao Lava Jato, Brazil's corruption probe into the state oil giant Petrobras. Dozens of companies acknowledged paying bribes to politicians and officials in exchange for contracts with Petrobras. Lava Jato is the anti-corruption operation investigating Brazils energy giant Petrobras In June 2015, the group's chief executive, Marcelo Odebrecht, the grandson of its founder,was arrested,external. Since then, he and dozens of other company executives have been jailed. In 2016, all of them signed deals with Brazilian investigators, agreeing to confess to crimes and to identify corrupt officials in exchange for shorter prison sentences. Odebrecht executives have confessed to paying bribes in exchange for contracts not only in Brazil, but in various parts of the world. An international taskforce of investigators is looking into bribery in 10 countries, including Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. In December 2016, Odebrecht signed a leniency deal with authorities in the US and Switzerland, agreeing to pay $2.6bn in fines for its past mistakes - the largest sum of its kind in the world. The company also tried to settle cases with other governments so that it would be allowed to tender for future major infrastructure projects. The most explosive statements came from the former boss, Marcelo Odebrecht, who said that part of the $48m he donated to Dilma Rousseff and Michel Temer's campaign in the 2014 Brazilian presidential election was illegal. Marcelo Odebrecht was sentenced to 19 years in jail for his part in the corruption scandal Outside Brazil, revelations made by Odebrecht executive Jorge Barata prompted investigators in Peru to issue an arrest warrant against former President Alejandro Toledo, who is currently considered a fugitive. All those mentioned in the statements have strongly denied any wrongdoing, and have accused Odebrecht executives of lying. Not always. It is hard for investigators to determine whether those arrested are actually confessing to real crimes, or whether they are telling a story that prosecutors want to hear in exchange for shorter prison sentences. Plea bargains can be very rewarding for those who sign them. Some of the Petrobras executives who signed such deals in 2014 are now out of prison and serving their sentences at homes, instead of spending years in jail. Other countries across Latin America are beginning their own investigations into Odebrecht On the other hand, plea bargains have been instrumental in bringing to justice powerful people who would otherwise never have been caught.

"The US Department of Justice called it ""the largest foreign bribery case in history"". After Brazilian multinational Odebrecht admitted guilt in a cash-for-contracts corruption scandal in 12 nations, it vowed to change its ways. But Brazil's authorities are still wrestling with an encrypted computer system used to run the firm's illicit payment system. The federal police building in Curitiba, in the southern state of Parana, has hardly been out of the news.  In June 2015, the now-convicted former chief executive, Marcelo Odebrecht, was brought here. More recently, the HQ received former president Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, jailed for corruption on charges related to the wider Lava Jato (Car Wash) investigation based here. Along one of the airy, tiled corridors, opposite a regular computer laboratory, there is a sealed room with a complex entry mechanism.  It is insulated with concrete, like a bunker. ""This room is totally isolated from external communication - internet, phones. And entrance is restricted. Even me, as the manager, I'm not allowed to enter,"" says Fabio Salvador, the technical supervisor. Inside, eight specialised police officers and a technical assistant from Odebrecht have worked since September to crack one of the company's computer systems, Mywebday. In the case brought by the US Department of Justice, with Brazil and Switzerland in December 2016,Odebrecht and its petrochemical subsidiary, Braskem, admitted briberyto the tune of $788m (Â£553m) and agreed a record-breaking fine of at least $3.5bn. The construction giant paid off politicians, political parties, officials of state-owned enterprises, lawyers, bankers and fixers to secure lucrative contracts in Brazil and abroad. Marcelo Odebrecht is serving out his jail term at home Apart from being the largest international bribery case ever, the Odebrecht story has one component that makes it exceptional: this was a corporation that created a bespoke department to manage its crooked deals - something prosecutors in Brazil and the US had never seen before. ""In the Odebrecht case, there are many reasons for you to become speechless,"" says Deltan Dallagnol, lead prosecutor in Curitiba. ""How a company created a whole system only to pay bribes, and how many public agents were involved.  This case implicated almost one-third of Brazil's senators and almost half of all Brazil's governors. ""One sole company paid bribes in favour of 415 politicians and 26 political parties in Brazil.  It makes the Watergate scandal look like a couple of kids playing in a sandbox."" And the web of corruption had tentacles reaching to Africa and across the region. The president of Peru was forced to resign last month in allegations related to Odebrecht. The vice-president of Ecuador is in prison. Politicians and officials from 10 Latin American nations continue to fall under the Odebrecht bus. Odebrecht was not the original focus of prosecutors in Curitiba. Lava Jato, the corruption case that's enveloped Brazil - putting some of the rich and powerful, including ex-president Lula, behind bars - began in 2014 as a money-laundering investigation. Other countries across Latin America have their own investigations into Odebrecht Focus shifted to Petrobras, Brazil's state oil company, where top managers were appointed by political parties in power. Investigators uncovered evidence that a ""cartel"" of engineering corporations - including Odebrecht - was rigging bids and paying bribes to secure contracts at inflated prices. Petrobras had become a colossal piggy bank for its executives, politicians and political parties to raid. It's estimated more than $2bn was paid in kickbacks, while Petrobras lost about $14bn through over-pricing while the scheme existed. So in 2014, prosecutors began to investigate the most influential member of that cartel, Odebrecht. The company's bribery department, known by the rather prosaic name of Division of Structured Operations, managed its own shadow budget. In plea-bargain testimony, Marcelo Odebrecht told prosecutors that everyone at the top of the company knew that 0.5% to 2% of the corporation's income was moved off-the-books. ""We're talking about a company that billed 100bn reais a year.  If we're talking about 2%, that's about 2bn reais,"" he said. In other words, up to about $600m was committed to undeclared payments.  Structured Operations paid bribes through a complex and often multi-layered network of shell companies and offshore finance. In Brazil, cash was delivered by doleiros - black market dealers.  Or by ""mules"", who travelled with shrink-wrapped bricks of banknotes concealed beneath their clothing.  Brazilian politicians were usually paid in cash.  Others had secret bank accounts. This was organised crime - highly organised crime.  All financial activity was systematised using two parallel, bespoke computer systems. Operation Car Wash is fighting corruption in Brazil, the slogan says The first allowed internal communication within Odebrecht and also with outside financial operators.  The second - the one the Federal Police in Curitiba still cannot access completely - was used to make and process payment requests. But none of this was known to the authorities in the early stages of the investigation.  A breakthrough would seal the fate of the well-oiled sleaze machine at Odebrecht. By 2015, there was enough evidence against the company to arrest the unco-operative chief executive, Marcelo Odebrecht.  In early 2016, the Federal Police gained access to the Hotmail account of one of the Structured Operations executives. They found emails related to financial transactions and a spreadsheet created by a secretary in the division, Maria Lucia Tavares.  Her home was raided. Stashed in a wardrobe were printouts from the Mywebday system itemising illicit payments. Tavares had made hard copies for her boss to look at, and then hidden them as the noose tightened at Odebrecht.  Within the division, she was responsible for making payments. ""I didn't know who the recipients were.  We used codenames, but I was never told who those people actually were, and I was never curious to find out,"" Tavares told prosecutors. So Tavares was never interested in knowing the identities of Dracula, Sauerkraut and Viagra. Many of the politicians and officials given a nickname have been identified.  But not all of them, says the police chief of Parana, Mauricio Valeixo. ""We're hoping to identify those we don't know.  And for others we have to get more information, because, for example, it's not enough just to have a nickname,"" he says.  ""We have to understand the reason why somebody might've been given $200,000."" The police chief is anticipating more arrests in the Odebrecht case, especially once technicians have cracked Mywebday.  So why is that so complicated? ""On Marcelo Odebrecht's cellphone, we found information that there were orders to destroy evidence, to clean up devices,"" says prosecutor Deltan Dallagnol. ""It seems the devices that contained the files that could open the system were destroyed.  We tried to rebuild the system in different ways. ""We asked the FBI for help. It turned out we'd need a lot of computers doing only this for more than 100 years in order for us to have a lucky strike."" But Fabio Salvador, the technical manager for the federal police, is optimistic.  His team had a breakthrough in late February. ""This is a great fight for criminal expertise in Brazil,"" he says.

"Mr GarcÃ­a denies the allegations against him Peru's former President Alan GarcÃ­a has shot himself as police came to arrest him. Casimiro Ulloa hospital in the capital, Lima, said he was in surgery where he was being treated for ""a bullet wound to his head"". Mr GarcÃ­a is accused of taking bribes from Brazilian construction company Odebrecht - claims he has repeatedly denied. Officers had been sent to arrest him in connection with the allegations. Interior Minister Carlos MorÃ¡n told reporters that when police arrived, Mr Garcia asked to make a phone call and went into a room and closed the door. Minutes later, a shot rang out, Mr MorÃ¡n said. Police forced the door open and found Mr Garcia sitting on a chair with a bullet wound to his head. Brazil's Odebrecht corruption scandal 'The largest foreign bribery case in history' Health minister Zulema TomÃ¡s said Mr GarcÃ­a's condition was ""very serious and critical"", and that he had to be resuscitated after suffering three cardiac arrests. ""Let's pray to God to give him strength,"" the former president's lawyer Erasmo Reyna reportedly told journalists at the hospital. Mr GarcÃ­a served as president from 1985 to 1990 and again from 2006 to 2011. Investigators say he took bribes from Odebrecht during his second term in office, linked to a metro line building project in the capital. Odebrecht has admitted paying almost $30m (Â£23m) in bribes in Peru since 2004. But Mr GarcÃ­a says he is the victim of political persecution, writing in a tweet on Tuesday that there is ""no clue or evidence"" against him. Mr GarcÃ­a was taken to Casimiro Ulloa hospital in Lima after shooting himself Odebrecht is a Brazilian construction giant behind major infrastructure projects around the world, including venues for the 2016 Olympics and 2014 World Cup in its home country. But under the glare of anti-corruption investigators the company admitted paying bribes in more than half of the countries in Latin America, as well as in Angola and Mozambique in Africa. Investigators say Odebrecht bribed officials or electoral candidates in exchange for lucrative building contracts. The corruption scandal has brought down politicians throughout Latin America. Peru's four most recent presidents are all being investigated for alleged corruption, with a fifth - Alberto Fujimori - serving a prison sentence for corruption and human rights abuses. Ex-leader Pedro Pablo Kuczynski was taken to hospital with high blood pressure on Wednesday just days after his own arrest in connection with Odebrecht charges. And the current leader of the opposition, Keiko Fujimori, is also in pre-trial detention on charges of taking $1.2m (Â£940,000) in bribes from Odebrecht. In October, an opinion poll by Datum showed 94% of Peruvians believed the level of corruption was either high or very high in their country. Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, in office 2016-2018, resigned over a vote-buying scandal and detained last week Ollanta Humala, in office 2011-2016, accused of taking bribes from Odebrecht to bankroll his election campaign, in pre-trial detention in Peru Alan GarcÃ­a, in office 2006-2011, suspected of taking kickbacks from Odebrecht, sought asylum in Uruguay's Lima embassy but had his request denied Alejandro Toledo, in office 2001-2006, accused of taking millions of dollars in bribes from Odebrecht, currently a fugitive in the US Peru ex-President GarcÃ­a denied asylum Brazil's Odebrecht corruption scandal explained Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain blazes Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

"This video can not be played Anahid Kassabian felt bullied out of her job after she was diagnosed with cancer UK universities are being accused of using ""gagging orders"" to stop bullying, discrimination and sexual misconduct allegations becoming public. Dozens of academics have told BBC News they were ""harassed"" out of their jobs and made to sign non-disclosure agreements after making complaints. Figures obtained by the BBC show UK universities spent about Â£87m on pay-offs with NDAs since 2017. Universities UK says using NDAs to keep victims quiet should not be tolerated. Non-disclosure agreements were designed to stop staff sharing trade secrets if they changed jobs, but now lawyers say they are being misused to protect serial perpetrators of misconduct, and ministers say they want to tighten the rules. What are non-disclosure agreements? Are NDAs being abused? Anahid Kassabian, a former music professor at the University of Liverpool, said she felt like she was treated as a ""burden"" and ""bullied out"" of her 10-year job after being diagnosed with cancer. She has broken her NDA in the hope that others who have been ""through the same horrors"" will realise they are ""not alone"" and will feel empowered to speak out. ""We all think we're isolated and alone, sobbing over past wrongs, when in fact there are many, many of us, and if we could speak to each other it would feel very different,"" she said. Ms Kassabian, 59, who also has multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia, believes her medical conditions had led to her ability to work being called into question, without the causes of the emotional stress she was under being adequately addressed. But the BBC has seen documents that suggest the university felt it had done all it could to support Ms Kassabian, and it had a responsibility to support the teaching of students and work in the department as well as staff. The University of Liverpool said: ""We refute these allegations in the strongest possible terms. Ms Kassabian was not subject to discrimination or bullying and the university did not fail to make reasonable adjustments. ""Settlement agreements with a standard confidentiality clause are used for a range of cases including conduct, capability and redundancy. As we too are bound by confidentiality, we are unable to provide specifics in relation to her case."" Another academic, Amy, not her real name, says bullying sparked her depression. ""It's crippling my career,"" she told the BBC. Amy says she has been bullied for six years across two universities by the same man. Her NDA, seen by the BBC, explicitly names the senior academic whom she calls a ""serial bully"". It means she is legally required not to reveal details of the allegations or she risks being sued. ""He told me I'd never have a successful career,"" she said. ""He has done nothing but undermine my confidence; it's a complete abuse of power."" After she put in a complaint, Amy says she was advised to sign an NDA and leave. ""I ended up hundreds of miles away at a new university, only for him to follow me and continue his harassment. Because of the NDA I can't tell people what went on in the past. I can't tell them why he's doing this. ""Universities would rather pay off people to leave, than push out the person doing the bullying."" 'Signing a gagging clause set me free' The president and the porn star A source close to the settlement process, who has overseen a number of maternity and disability discrimination cases, said their university had a fund to get rid of staff with ""significant health problems"". Claims of the misuse of NDAs by universities follow high-profile cases in the film and business worlds. Emma Chapman refused to sign an NDA after a two-year challenge for sexual harassment Emma Chapman, an award-winning astrophysicist, says she was sexually harassed by a man at University College London and received a Â£70,000 payout after a two-year legal challenge. She refused to sign an NDA in favour of a confidentiality waiver, believed to be the first of its kind, allowing her to defend herself. But Dr Chapman says the ""trauma of the original incident is still there"" with ""nightmares of [her] house being set on fire"". Shortly after her tribunal, she received several untraceable voicemails of a person laughing down the phone in the middle of the night. She reported it to the police, but there was no concrete evidence it was her harasser. Now a campaigner to end sexual misconduct in higher education with The 1752 Group,,externalDr Chapman wants ""to see this culture of silence banished and confidentiality waivers being given as standard, so that victims can protect their careers and universities are held to account"". UCL says it no longer uses NDAs for cases of bullying, harassment and sexual misconduct, but acknowledges that ""historically"" it has ""not always got the balance right"". ""We hope this sends a clear message that these behaviours will not be tolerated,"" it said. ""#MeToohas made clear that all institutions can, and must do better, in preventing and addressing these behaviours. UCL is no exception."" The BBC sent Freedom of Information requests to 136 UK universities, asking how much they had paid in settlements that included ""gagging clauses"". Analysis of figures from 96 universities responding in full, reveal about Â£87m spent on about 4,000 settlements in the past two years. Many universities said they were unable to disclose why the agreements were signed, so it is unclear how many relate to allegations of bullying, harassment or sexual misconduct. Barrister Georgina Calvert-Lee says universities overuse NDAs to promote a system of discrimination and harassment Some universities attributed the bulk of their multi-million NDA spending to voluntary redundancy packages, but lawyers question whether, if such cases were truly voluntary, gagging clauses would be needed. Georgina Calvert-Lee, a senior barrister at McAllister Olivarius, has told MPs that NDAs are ""overused to promote systemic discrimination and harassment"" at universities. ""The danger is that you may have one complaint put in, it's settled with an NDA, but then the university takes no action to prevent the misconduct happening again, and this exposes others to further misconduct by the same perpetrator,"" she said. Ms Calvert-Lee said that universities have to provide independent legal advice to affected staff, but that this is usually only ""enough time to talk through the agreement and not about the circumstances that have led to it"". Universities UK, which represents 136 institutions, said it was important to note that signing an NDA ""does not prevent staff or students from reporting criminal acts to the police or regulatory bodies,or from making a disclosure under The Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998,external"".

"This video can not be played Taking the last flight of India's stricken Jet Airways Troubled Indian airline Jet Airways has temporarily suspended all its domestic and international flights after failing to find fresh funding. The airline said its last flight would operate on Wednesday as it was not able to pay for fuel and other critical services. Jet Airways said it had no choice but to suspend the flights, but hopes to start flying again. It has $1.2bn (Â£900m) debt and has been in talks with lenders for weeks. Jet Airways, which has 123 planes, was once India's biggest private airline, but reports say that just five planes have been in use. In a statement,externalthe airline said it had been forced to ground all its flights because ""prolonged and sustained efforts with lenders and authorities did not yield the desired results"". The Indian government had asked state-run banks to step in with a bailout plan for the airline - which employs 23,000 people and was founded by Naresh Goyal more than 25 years ago. He stepped down as chairman last month. India's aviation boom runs into turbulence Jet Airways fails to secure emergency funding The riches to rags story of India's oldest private airline Pilots, engineers, and ground staff have not been paid for months, and passengers have been left stranded around the world as a result of cancellations. ""Late last night, Jet Airways was informed by the State Bank of India (SBI), on behalf of the consortium of Indian lenders, that they are unable to consider its request for critical interim funding,"" the airline said. ""Since no emergency funding from the lenders or any other source is forthcoming, the airline will not be able to pay for fuel or other critical services to keep the operations going. Consequently, with immediate effect, Jet Airways is compelled to cancel all its international and domestic flights. The last flight will operate today,"" it added. Ravinder Singh Robin, BBC Punjabi Jet's last flight before the suspension departed from Amritsar and as the flight took off the brightness of the iconic Golden Temple was visible through the night sky. It was an emotional last journey for the crew and even for the ground staff. ""The sun will rise again,"" the pilot told me before he took charge. He had worked for the airline for 17 years and was hopeful of reprieve. Many people didn't even bother turning up for the flight, mistakenly believing this would be cancelled too but for those who did make it on board there was a palpable sense of community and concern for the staff of Jet Airways. Ground staff prepare for Jet Airways last flight, departing from Amritsar to Mumbai and Delhi. Passengers asked cabin crew what was to happen to their jobs, where they would go from here. There have been no clear answers for Jet staff - and many felt a deal would come through, but worry was nevertheless etched on their faces. Many were asking questions about their onward journeys and felt frustration at the state of India's airline industry, remembering the fate of Kingfisher Airlines. Yet others booked tickets on this particular flight just to make history. Before the flight touched down, the pilot spoke a few optimistic words to the passengers telling them this may be the last flight for now, but he very much hoped they would fly Jet once again. The banks have been seeking a bidder for the airline, which said it would continue to support them in their efforts. Etihad Airways already owns 24% of Jet Airways and is reported to have expressed an interest in taking more control. ""Jet Airways is hopeful that it will be able to bring the joy of flying back to its guests as soon as possible,"" the airline said. Naresh Goyal founded Jet more than 25 years ago The carrier operated 600 domestic and 380 international routes, including out of London, Amsterdam and Paris, and had grown rapidly before it started to lose market share after the entry of low-cost airlines like IndiGo & SpiceJet. The UK's Civil Aviation Authority tweeted advice to customers, outlining different approaches for seeking refunds depending on how the flight was booked. Allow Twitter content?

"Amy El-Keria was found hanged in her room in November 2012 The Priory healthcare group has been fined Â£300,000 over the death of a child at one of its hospitals. Amy El-Keria, 14, was found hanged in her room at the Priory in Ticehurst, East Sussex, in November 2012. The private company, which runs mental health services as part of an NHS contract, was sentenced at Lewes Crown Court. In 2016, an inquest found her death may have been prevented if she had received proper care. The Health and Safety Executive pursued a criminal investigation and the company admitted a charge of being an employer failing to discharge its duty to ensure people were not exposed to health and safety risks. In sentencing, Judge Mr Justice James Dingemans said no financial penalty he could impose would ever ""reflect the loss suffered by Amy's family"". Speaking outside court, Amy's mother Tania El-Keria said: ""The public's eye has been firmly opened to what the Priory stand for, profit over safety. ""Today is a historic day in our fight for justice for Amy. ""Our Amy died in what we know to be a criminally unsafe hospital being run by the Priory."" This video can not be played Amy's mother Tania El-Keria said: ""I've been fighting so long to get the justice for her"" Asked about the size of the penalty, Ms El-Keria said: ""It's not about the fine, it's not about the money."" She said the Priory's contract with the NHS should not carry on. ""I don't believe there's any lessons learned,"" she added. A court hearing in January was told Amy, who was deemed high-risk and had a ""known and recent history"" of suicide attempts, was admitted to the hospital on 23 August 2012. She was left with unsupervised access and the means to carry out another suicide attempt. On November 12, she was found with a ligature around her neck and taken to Conquest Hospital in Hastings, where she died the next day. The inquest into her death heard staff at the unit had not been trained in resuscitation and did not call 999 quickly enough. The jury said Amy died of unintended consequences of a deliberate act, contributed to by neglect, and that staffing levels at the Ticehurst centre were inadequate. Priory faces heavy fine over girl's death Hospital 'neglected' girl found hanged Judge Dingemans said: ""It is apparent from the investigations that have been carried out in Amy's death, and the works carried out by Priory Healthcare and the CQC [Care Quality Commission], that there is now a much better understanding of young person suicide, and that vital lessons have been learned."" When imposing the fine, he said he took into account the company's ""good"" health and safety record, guilty plea and steps made to improve the service. Priory Healthcare had a turnover of Â£133m in 2017, with an operating profit of Â£2m, he said. It must also pay the Health and Safety Executive's costs of Â£65,800 and a victim surcharge of Â£120. Amy El-Keria was admitted to the Priory Hospital in Ticehurst a few months before she died In a statement, the charity Inquest, which supported the family, said it was ""a historic moment in terms of accountability following deaths of children in private mental health settings"". Victoria McNally, a senior caseworker at the charity, said: ""Allowing the Priory to investigate their own actions, meant it took six-and-a-half years for their criminally unsafe practises to be exposed. ""If we are serious about child safety and welfare, such a blatant lack of oversight and scrutiny cannot continue."" Trevor Torrington, head of the Priory Group, said: ""The latest CQC report, published in January this year, rated Ticehurst as ""good"" in all areas. ""We remain absolutely focussed on patient safety and will continue to work closely with commissioners and regulators to learn lessons from incidents and inspections quickly and ensure all concerns are addressed in a timely and robust way.

"Sadaf Khadem (R) beat the French boxer Anne Chauvin (L) on Saturday An Iranian who became the first woman from her country to contest an official boxing match says she has cancelled her return home from France after hearing a warrant had been issued for her arrest. Sadaf Khadem beat the French boxer Anne Chauvin in an amateur bout on Saturday. She had planned to fly to Tehran with her French-Iranian trainer this week. Khadem was quoted by a sports newspaper as saying she believed she was accused of violating Iran's compulsory dress code by boxing in a vest and shorts. Iranian officials have not commented, but the head of Iran's boxing federation denied that Khadem would be arrested if she came home. ""Ms Khadem is not a member of [Iran's] organised athletes for boxing, and from the boxing federation's perspective all her activities are personal,"" Hossein Soori was quoted as saying by an Iranian news agency. Iran headscarf protest lawyer jailed 'I wore a hijab and head-banged to Nirvana' The Girls of Revolution Street Khadem fought in a green vest and red shorts with a white waistband - the colours of Iran's national flag - in Saturday's bout in the western French town of Royan. The 24-year-old had to fight abroad as, despite having the blessing of Iranian sporting authorities, it proved too complicated to fulfil their requirement that the bout be refereed and judged by women. Khadem had been expecting a hero's welcome when she returned to Iran. Khadem was trained by Mahyar Monshipour, a French-Iranian former world boxing champion But while she travelled to Paris's Charles de Gaulle airport with her trainer Mahyar Monshipour,external- an Iranian-born former World Boxing Association champion who also serves as an adviser to the French sports minister - she said they were told that warrants had been issued for their arrest. ""I was fighting in a legally approved match, in France. But as I was wearing shorts and a T-shirt, which is completely normal in the eyes of the entire world, I confounded the rules of my country,"" she told the L'Equipe newspaper. ""I wasn't wearing a hijab, I was coached by a man - some people take a dim view of this."" A spokesman for the Iranian embassy in Paris told Reuters news agency on Wednesday that he could not comment on whether Khadem faced arrest in Iran or on her decision not to return to Iran.

This video can not be played Amy's mother Tania El-Keria said: ""I've been fighting so long to get the justice for her"" Asked about the size of the penalty, Ms El-Keria said: ""It's not about the fine, it's not about the money."" She said the Priory's contract with the NHS should not carry on. ""I don't believe there's any lessons learned,"" she added. A court hearing in January was told Amy, who was deemed high-risk and had a ""known and recent history"" of suicide attempts, was admitted to the hospital on 23 August 2012. She was left with unsupervised access and the means to carry out another suicide attempt. On November 12, she was found with a ligature around her neck and taken to Conquest Hospital in Hastings, where she died the next day. The inquest into her death heard staff at the unit had not been trained in resuscitation and did not call 999 quickly enough. The jury said Amy died of unintended consequences of a deliberate act, contributed to by neglect, and that staffing levels at the Ticehurst centre were inadequate. Priory faces heavy fine over girl's death Hospital 'neglected' girl found hanged Judge Dingemans said: ""It is apparent from the investigations that have been carried out in Amy's death, and the works carried out by Priory Healthcare and the CQC [Care Quality Commission], that there is now a much better understanding of young person suicide, and that vital lessons have been learned."" When imposing the fine, he said he took into account the company's ""good"" health and safety record, guilty plea and steps made to improve the service. Priory Healthcare had a turnover of Â£133m in 2017, with an operating profit of Â£2m, he said. It must also pay the Health and Safety Executive's costs of Â£65,800 and a victim surcharge of Â£120. Amy El-Keria was admitted to the Priory Hospital in Ticehurst a few months before she died In a statement, the charity Inquest, which supported the family, said it was ""a historic moment in terms of accountability following deaths of children in private mental health settings"". Victoria McNally, a senior caseworker at the charity, said: ""Allowing the Priory to investigate their own actions, meant it took six-and-a-half years for their criminally unsafe practises to be exposed. ""If we are serious about child safety and welfare, such a blatant lack of oversight and scrutiny cannot continue."" Trevor Torrington, head of the Priory Group, said: ""The latest CQC report, published in January this year, rated Ticehurst as ""good"" in all areas. ""We remain absolutely focussed on patient safety and will continue to work closely with commissioners and regulators to learn lessons from incidents and inspections quickly and ensure all concerns are addressed in a timely and robust way. "" Ms El-Keria is due to meet with mental health minister Jackie Doyle-Price in May.

"Sadaf Khadem (R) beat the French boxer Anne Chauvin (L) on Saturday An Iranian who became the first woman from her country to contest an official boxing match says she has cancelled her return home from France after hearing a warrant had been issued for her arrest. Sadaf Khadem beat the French boxer Anne Chauvin in an amateur bout on Saturday. She had planned to fly to Tehran with her French-Iranian trainer this week. Khadem was quoted by a sports newspaper as saying she believed she was accused of violating Iran's compulsory dress code by boxing in a vest and shorts. Iranian officials have not commented, but the head of Iran's boxing federation denied that Khadem would be arrested if she came home. ""Ms Khadem is not a member of [Iran's] organised athletes for boxing, and from the boxing federation's perspective all her activities are personal,"" Hossein Soori was quoted as saying by an Iranian news agency. Iran headscarf protest lawyer jailed 'I wore a hijab and head-banged to Nirvana' The Girls of Revolution Street Khadem fought in a green vest and red shorts with a white waistband - the colours of Iran's national flag - in Saturday's bout in the western French town of Royan. The 24-year-old had to fight abroad as, despite having the blessing of Iranian sporting authorities, it proved too complicated to fulfil their requirement that the bout be refereed and judged by women. Khadem had been expecting a hero's welcome when she returned to Iran. Khadem was trained by Mahyar Monshipour, a French-Iranian former world boxing champion But while she travelled to Paris's Charles de Gaulle airport with her trainer Mahyar Monshipour,external- an Iranian-born former World Boxing Association champion who also serves as an adviser to the French sports minister - she said they were told that warrants had been issued for their arrest. ""I was fighting in a legally approved match, in France. But as I was wearing shorts and a T-shirt, which is completely normal in the eyes of the entire world, I confounded the rules of my country,"" she told the L'Equipe newspaper. ""I wasn't wearing a hijab, I was coached by a man - some people take a dim view of this."" A spokesman for the Iranian embassy in Paris told Reuters news agency on Wednesday that he could not comment on whether Khadem faced arrest in Iran or on her decision not to return to Iran. This video can not be played BBC 100 Women: Iranian trailblazer who removed her headscarf Under Iranian law, women and girls as young as nine years old who are seen in public without a headscarf can be punished with a prison sentence of between 10 days and two months, or a cash fine. Iranian sportswomen are required to cover their hair, neck, arms and legs when competing. Until recently, Khadem would not have been permitted to take part in an official boxing match wearing a hijab or a full body form fitting uniform for religious regions. Butthe International Boxing Association (AIBA), amateur boxing's governing body, changed its uniform rules,externalat the end of February.

"Paul Linsell with his Spitfire replica, partially dismantled to be moved to a museum An aviation fan has said goodbye to a replica Spitfire fighter plane he spent seven years restoring in his garden. The aircraft in Paul Linsell's front garden in Heacham, Norfolk, became a local attraction, drawing interest from holiday-makers. But it has finally been moved to an aviation museum where its restoration will be completed. Museum chairman Jim Paradine said his ""jaw dropped"" when he saw the replica fighter plane for the first time.

"The sign - which should read ""di-alcohol"" - in fact says ""alcohol am ddim"" which means ""free alcohol"" Before you empty your car boot in preparation - yes, the offer of free booze at a Torfaen supermarket really is too good to be true. A sign in Cwmbran's Asda for the alcohol-free section was incorrectly translated to ""free alcohol"" in Welsh. Guto Aaron, who spotted the sign, wrote on Twitter: ""Get yourself to Asda, according to their dodgy Welsh translations they are giving away free alcohol."" Asda said it was changing the sign. The sign - which should read di-alcohol - in fact says alcohol am ddim, which means free alcohol. An Asda spokesman said: ""Mae'n ddrwg gennym [we are sorry]. We would like to thank our eagle-eyed customers for spotting this mistake. We hold our hands up and will be changing the signs in our Cwmbran store straight away."" The supermarket confirmed there would not be free alcohol in stores this weekend. No free booze here Mr Aaron told BBC Wales: ""To be fair, for a private company, Asda's signs are usually correct so when there is an unfortunate mistake like this, you just have to laugh. ""At least they've turned their self-service checkouts to Welsh. ""I have much more of an issue with the way the sign looks than its content. They have chosen such a dark font for the Welsh to ensure it's practically invisible from afar, it feels deliberate."" Welsh sign gaffe directs shoppers to US Road sign urges drivers to 'follow the entertainment' From wonky bikes to supermarket 'petrel' Mr Aaron said people were quick to blame Google Translate because of ""how bad it used to be"". ""While far from perfect, that has improved a lot, and as it happens Google Translate is able to correctly translate 'alcohol-free', so how on earth Asda has ended up with 'alcohol am ddim', I don't know."" It is not the first time an incorrect Welsh translation has ended up printed on a sign.

"House prices rose in February at the slowest rate since September 2012 while in London house prices fell, the Office for National Statistics said. Average house prices increased by 0.6% in the year to February 2019 but fell by 3.8% in London. The ONS said inflation was stable at 1.9% in March as a rise in fuel prices from February was offset by falls in food prices. The figures ease pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates. The Bank of England targets inflation - the rate of price increases  - at 2% andlast month kept rates unchanged at  0.75%, where they have been since August last year. The ONS said there had been a slowdown in house price growth over the past two years. The average UK house price was Â£226,000 in February, Â£1,000 higher than a year ago. The fall in London house prices was the largest fall since mid-2009, but the city remains the most expensive place to buy property with an average price of Â£460,000. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the fall in London house prices was the largest since the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis. ""This follows efforts by policymakers to cut down on riskier mortgage lending, though clearly uncertainty over Brexit will have played a large part in the capital's faltering housing market,"" he said. Other indicators have pointed to a subdued housing market. Halifax, the UK's biggest lender,said earlier this month that property prices had fallen by 1.6% in Marchcompared with February. At 1.9%, the latest inflation rate, measured by the Consumer Prices Index, was a little lower than the 2% that had been forecast by economists. Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: ""Inflation is stable, with motor fuel prices rising between February and March this year, offset by falls in food prices as well as the cost of computer games growing more slowly than it did at this time last year."" Inflation in the games, toys and hobby sector fell to 1.1% in March from 3.1% in February helping to keep a lid on the overall basket of prices. Average petrol prices were 1.2p per litre higher at 120.3p. Mr Brettell said the inflation number made the Bank of England's job easier ""as there's no pressure to raise rates as it grapples with continued uncertainty over Brexit"". Howard Archer, economic adviser to the EY Item Club of forecasts said it was ""decent news for both consumers and the Bank of England"". It comes after data on Tuesdayhad shown that average weekly earnings, excluding bonuses, rose 3.4% in the three months to February and the unemployment rate lower than at any time since the end of 1975. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee will meet next month to discuss rates. Unemployment across UK shows slight fall Salisbury named best place to live in the UK Mr Archer said: ""Despite a tight labour market, it is difficult to see the Bank of England raising interest rates at their May meeting or any time soon, amid likely MPC concern that prolonged Brexit uncertainties will likely to weigh down on the economy"". However,  Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that the inflation data would not give the MPC ""breathing space"" to keep rates on hold because ""the labour market is still tightening and the economy is coping with Brexit uncertainty"". The Bank of England has said that economic outlook would continue to depend ""significantly on the nature and timing of EU withdrawal"". In the short-term economists say pressure on inflation could come from household energy prices  in April whenenergy regulator Ofgem increases its price cap by 10%. Mr Archer said it was ""questionable""  whether earnings growth can continue as the growth in wages dipped to a five-month low of 3.2% in the month of February.

"Susan DeVere launched a raffle to get rid of the property A woman has been rapped by the advertising watchdog for offering a Scottish castle as a raffle prize - but giving the winner a cash prize instead. Susan DeVere set up the contest after she failed to sell Orchardton Castle, near Auchencairn, Kirkcudbrightshire. However, cash giveaways were offered when ticket sales were too low. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the competition was not ""administered fairly"" - a ruling disputed by Mrs DeVere. She said she made the possibility of a cash prize clear. Tickets costing Â£5 were offered via Facebook and winacastle.co.uk, with the winner promised the opportunity to ""win the whole building freehold"". This video can not be played Susan DeVere tells Victoria Derbyshire her raffle was ""as transparent as possible"". Sums of Â£65,000, Â£7,000 and Â£5,000 were handed out in June last year. One person complained the raffle had been administered unfairly because the prize had been changed to a cash amount. Millionaire raffles Â£3m mansion for Â£10 a ticket Ripped-up lottery ticket wins Â£58m jackpot Built in the 1880s, the 17-bedroom property had been valued at between Â£1.5m and Â£2.5m and comes with five acres of land and views across the Solway Firth. Mrs DeVere told the ASA that all property competitions were run in the same way and the castle could not be awarded if there were not enough entries received to clear the mortgage. She said it was made clear from the beginning that if not enough entries were received, the property would not be awarded and a cash prize would be offered instead. Mrs DeVere added that after the prize draw had taken place the winner was offered a share of the property and a chance to run a business there had they wanted to, which was a goodwill offer unconnected to the competition. The winner chose to accept the cash prize. The ASA said the complainant had entered the promotion in the hope of winning the castle. It said: ""We understood that at the end of the competition three cash prizes were awarded at the value of Â£65,000, Â£7,000 and Â£5,000 instead of the advertised prize, because the minimum number of entries had not been reached, and that the advertiser had offered the winner a share of the property. ""However, we considered that a share of the property or any cash alternative that was less than the value of the property, were not reasonable equivalents to the prize as advertised. ""Because neither the advertised prize nor a reasonable alternative had been awarded, we concluded that the promotion had not been administered fairly and was in breach of the code."" The castle had been valued at between Â£1.5m and Â£2.5m Mrs DeVere told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that she planned to appeal against the ruling because it ""doesn't make any sense"". ""It wasn't unfair. We did absolutely everything to make it as fair and transparent as possible,"" she said. ""Right from the beginning, on our website it said that if enough entries didn't come in then it would be a cash prize. ""We actually gave examples of what the cash prizes would be."" Mrs DeVere said that she had not made any money from the competition. She said the ticket sales raised Â£107,000, of which Â£77,000 was given out in prizes and Â£19,000 was given to charity. The remaining money went on things like advertising, websites and legal costs. ""It never occurred to me that there would not be enough interest, or else I would not have done it,"" she added. ""It's not something that you do for enjoyment."" In a post on the Win Your Castle website, Mrs DeVere blamed the raffle failure on companies such as Eventbrite and Paypal, which she claimed withdrew their support. She also said there were ""many inconsistencies"" in the ASA investigation.

"This video can not be played Specialist police teams were used to remove the group from the DLR train Climate change activists glued themselves to a train and others chained themselves to Jeremy Corbyn's home in a third day of protests. Extinction Rebellion protesters have been blocking traffic at Marble Arch, Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Oxford Circus since Monday. Earlier, three activists were glued to a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) train at Canary Wharf, causing minor delays. Four people also glued themselves together at the Labour leader's home. Four people glued themselves together at Jeremy Corbyn's home in north London The activists, who also used a bike lock to attach themselves to Mr Corbyn's north London house, said they supported him but wanted the Labour Party to go further than declaring a ""climate emergency"". After ending their protest Tracee Williams, one of the group, said she did not think the action was a ""misstep but whether we'd do it again, I'm not so sure"". Mr Corbyn left his home but declined to meet or speak to any of the protesters. Easter eggs and flowers from the group, which had been taken into Mr Corbyn's home earlier, were later returned to the street by the Labour leader's wife Laura Alvarez. Ms Williams added the group ""really felt we had to bring it to his front door"" but ""feel absolutely terrible about upsetting his wife"". As of 17:00 BST, 340 people have been arrested since Monday over the protests, the Met Police said. Jeremy Corbyn declined to speak to any of the protesters when he left his home The campaigner who glued himself to a train window was removed about an hour after the start of the DLR protest, at about 10:50.

Police have been sent in to clear protesters from Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Oxford Circus The Metropolitan Police says it uses a ""fluid de-bonding agent"" - but refuses to specify what that contains for operational reasons. Dr Mark Elliott, a senior lecturer in organic chemistry at Cardiff University, said warm, soapy water or the compound acetone would be the most suitable method - but warned any removal was likely to be painful. ""Anyone who has inadvertently stuck their fingers together with superglue will know how difficult and painful it can be to separate then - and the fingertips are relatively tough,"" he says. ""It is even more painful when other, softer, areas of skin become bonded."" According to Dr Elliott, the general advice is to use warm, soapy water, then to apply gentle pressure - for example by inserting a spatula. ""This will inevitably take time and be rather painful,"" he warned. Alternatively, acetone - normally found in nail-varnish remover - can make it easier to remove the glue - but ""easier"", he adds, ""is very much a relative term"". How do you un-glue a protester?

This video can not be played Extinction Rebellion: The story behind the activist group Since the group was set up last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament. It has three core demands: for the government to ""tell the truth about climate change"", reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025, and create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible. But critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched. The government said it shared ""people's passion"" to combat climate change and ""protect our planet for future generations"". The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the UK had cut its emissions by 44% since 1990.

"Eric Butts is a 40-year-old YouTuber from Lexington, Kentucky ""I intentionally put crying trailers on the internet. I have to have a thick skin."" Eric Butts is what you might call a ""reaction YouTuber"". He makes videos where he watches trailers and reacts, whether that's with laughter, bemusement or even tears. So as far as he was concerned, a recent video where he cried while watching the new Star Wars Episode IX teaser trailer was not unusual. The internet disagreed. ""It started blowing up in a very negative way,"" Eric told the BBC. ""I was getting very horrible stuff sent to me."" As social media became saturated with hate-filled tweets and his video was viewed more than 6.8 million times on Twitter - at the time of writing - it seemed there would be no end to people mocking him for his reaction. That is until his video caught the eye of Mark Hamill, the actor who played Luke Skywalker, who tweeted his support. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Eric told the BBC that ""with a name like Eric Butts"" he was used to getting insulted online. ""It wasn't really getting to me,"" he said. ""When it all started, before Mark Hamill got involved, I was on holiday for my 40th birthday with my fiancee. ""It's hard to get upset with an ocean front and a private pool."" On return from his holiday, Eric was still receiving negative comments, but was happy that he was getting money from the ad revenue on YouTube. ""So I was thinking, hey, I'm making a few extra bucks and I can buy a video game,"" he told the BBC. A prominent Twitter commenter suggested it made them want to ""cringe to death"". Another called Eric part of ""a whole new population of undateable men"". This was when things took another turn for the worse. ""There was some really horrible stuff,"" Eric said. ""They took my reaction video and changed it so they had me react to other things. ""Some of it was funny but there was some horrible stuff, anti-Semitism like Holocaust footage, racial stuff, people really trying to bully."" These aren't the spoilers you're looking for The gamer who became a meme overnight George Lucas still loves Jar Jar Binks Eric said this was the lowest point, but also what sparked the highest point - a second reaction from Hamill.

"House prices rose in February at the slowest rate since September 2012 while in London house prices fell, the Office for National Statistics said. Average house prices increased by 0.6% in the year to February 2019 but fell by 3.8% in London. The ONS said inflation was stable at 1.9% in March as a rise in fuel prices from February was offset by falls in food prices. The figures ease pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates. The Bank of England targets inflation - the rate of price increases  - at 2% andlast month kept rates unchanged at  0.75%, where they have been since August last year. The ONS said there had been a slowdown in house price growth over the past two years. The average UK house price was Â£226,000 in February, Â£1,000 higher than a year ago. The fall in London house prices was the largest fall since mid-2009, but the city remains the most expensive place to buy property with an average price of Â£460,000. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the fall in London house prices was the largest since the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis. ""This follows efforts by policymakers to cut down on riskier mortgage lending, though clearly uncertainty over Brexit will have played a large part in the capital's faltering housing market,"" he said. Other indicators have pointed to a subdued housing market. Halifax, the UK's biggest lender,said earlier this month that property prices had fallen by 1.6% in Marchcompared with February. At 1.9%, the latest inflation rate, measured by the Consumer Prices Index, was a little lower than the 2% that had been forecast by economists. Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: ""Inflation is stable, with motor fuel prices rising between February and March this year, offset by falls in food prices as well as the cost of computer games growing more slowly than it did at this time last year."" Inflation in the games, toys and hobby sector fell to 1.1% in March from 3.1% in February helping to keep a lid on the overall basket of prices. Average petrol prices were 1.2p per litre higher at 120.3p. Mr Brettell said the inflation number made the Bank of England's job easier ""as there's no pressure to raise rates as it grapples with continued uncertainty over Brexit"". Howard Archer, economic adviser to the EY Item Club of forecasts said it was ""decent news for both consumers and the Bank of England"". It comes after data on Tuesdayhad shown that average weekly earnings, excluding bonuses, rose 3.4% in the three months to February and the unemployment rate lower than at any time since the end of 1975. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee will meet next month to discuss rates. Unemployment across UK shows slight fall Salisbury named best place to live in the UK Mr Archer said: ""Despite a tight labour market, it is difficult to see the Bank of England raising interest rates at their May meeting or any time soon, amid likely MPC concern that prolonged Brexit uncertainties will likely to weigh down on the economy"". However,  Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that the inflation data would not give the MPC ""breathing space"" to keep rates on hold because ""the labour market is still tightening and the economy is coping with Brexit uncertainty"". The Bank of England has said that economic outlook would continue to depend ""significantly on the nature and timing of EU withdrawal"". In the short-term economists say pressure on inflation could come from household energy prices  in April whenenergy regulator Ofgem increases its price cap by 10%. Mr Archer said it was ""questionable""  whether earnings growth can continue as the growth in wages dipped to a five-month low of 3.2% in the month of February.

"Even small amounts of red and processed meat - such as a rasher of bacon a day - can increase the risk of bowel cancer, according to research. The latest study led by Oxford University and funded by Cancer Research UK, adds to evidence, including from the World Health Organization, that eating red meat can be harmful. But exactly how big is the risk? And how much is too much? Here's what you need to know. Researchers analysed data from almost half a million people involved in the UK Biobank study. Over the six years of their study they found 2,609 people developed bowel cancer. They estimate: Eating three rashers of bacon a day rather than just one could increase the risk of bowel cancer by 20% For every 10,000 people in the study who ate 21g a day of red and processed meat, 40 were diagnosed with bowel cancer The comparable figure for those who ate 76g a day, was 48 According to the NHS, 76g of cooked red meat is equivalent to about half an 8oz sirloin steak. A slice of ham or rasher of bacon is about 23g of processed meat. It's not clear. Cancer Research UK (CRUK) says 5,400 of the 41,804 cases of bowel cancer seen each year in the UK could be prevented if people did not eat processed meat at all. According to Emma Shields, information manager at CRUK,  ""This study shows the more meat you eat, the higher your risk of getting cancer and obviously the reverse is true - the less you eat the less likely you are to get bowel cancer,"" But she acknowledges smoking poses a much bigger risk, causing 54,300 cases of cancer each year. Public Health England says from its surveys many people eat too much red and processed meat. And experts advise people who eat lots of it to find ways to cut down. The Department of Health advises anyone eating more than 90g a day of red and processed meat should cut down to 70g. NHS guidance says there are some benefits of red meat - iron and protein content, for example - that must be balanced against potential risks. People can still eat meat and be healthy. Processed meat - including bacon, some sausages, hot dogs, salami - is modified to either extend its shelf-life or change the taste - the main methods are smoking, curing, or adding salt or preservatives. It is thought the chemicals involved in the processing could be increasing the risk of cancer. High temperature cooking, such as on a barbecue, can also create carcinogenic chemicals. When it comes to red meat like beef, lamb and pork, there are suggestions that one of the proteins (that gives it its red colour) can damage the gut when it is broken down. But experts are still trying to fully understand the link. Prof Gunter Kuhnle, at the University of Reading, described the study as a very thorough analysis of the link between meat intake and bowel (also known as colorectal) cancer. He said: ""The results confirm previous findings that both, red and processed meat consumption, increase the risk of colorectal cancer. ""The increase in risk of approximately 20% per 50g increase of red and processed meat intake is in line with what has been reported previously, and confirms these findings. ""The study also shows that dietary fibre reduces the risk of colorectal cancer. An increased consumption of fibre, as shown by this study, would be of considerably more benefit."" Carrie Ruxton, of the Meat Advisory Panel, an industry-funded body, said: ""Red meat provides valuable nutrients, such as protein, iron, zinc, vitamin D and B vitamins."" She said it was known that ""a range of lifestyle factors have a significant impact on the risk of bowel cancer, most notably age, genetics, lack of dietary fibre, inactivity and high alcohol consumption"".

"Susan DeVere launched a raffle to get rid of the property A woman has been rapped by the advertising watchdog for offering a Scottish castle as a raffle prize - but giving the winner a cash prize instead. Susan DeVere set up the contest after she failed to sell Orchardton Castle, near Auchencairn, Kirkcudbrightshire. However, cash giveaways were offered when ticket sales were too low. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the competition was not ""administered fairly"" - a ruling disputed by Mrs DeVere. She said she made the possibility of a cash prize clear. Tickets costing Â£5 were offered via Facebook and winacastle.co.uk, with the winner promised the opportunity to ""win the whole building freehold"". This video can not be played Susan DeVere tells Victoria Derbyshire her raffle was ""as transparent as possible"". Sums of Â£65,000, Â£7,000 and Â£5,000 were handed out in June last year. One person complained the raffle had been administered unfairly because the prize had been changed to a cash amount. Millionaire raffles Â£3m mansion for Â£10 a ticket Ripped-up lottery ticket wins Â£58m jackpot Built in the 1880s, the 17-bedroom property had been valued at between Â£1.5m and Â£2.5m and comes with five acres of land and views across the Solway Firth. Mrs DeVere told the ASA that all property competitions were run in the same way and the castle could not be awarded if there were not enough entries received to clear the mortgage. She said it was made clear from the beginning that if not enough entries were received, the property would not be awarded and a cash prize would be offered instead. Mrs DeVere added that after the prize draw had taken place the winner was offered a share of the property and a chance to run a business there had they wanted to, which was a goodwill offer unconnected to the competition. The winner chose to accept the cash prize. The ASA said the complainant had entered the promotion in the hope of winning the castle. It said: ""We understood that at the end of the competition three cash prizes were awarded at the value of Â£65,000, Â£7,000 and Â£5,000 instead of the advertised prize, because the minimum number of entries had not been reached, and that the advertiser had offered the winner a share of the property. ""However, we considered that a share of the property or any cash alternative that was less than the value of the property, were not reasonable equivalents to the prize as advertised. ""Because neither the advertised prize nor a reasonable alternative had been awarded, we concluded that the promotion had not been administered fairly and was in breach of the code."" The castle had been valued at between Â£1.5m and Â£2.5m Mrs DeVere told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that she planned to appeal against the ruling because it ""doesn't make any sense"". ""It wasn't unfair. We did absolutely everything to make it as fair and transparent as possible,"" she said. ""Right from the beginning, on our website it said that if enough entries didn't come in then it would be a cash prize. ""We actually gave examples of what the cash prizes would be."" Mrs DeVere said that she had not made any money from the competition. She said the ticket sales raised Â£107,000, of which Â£77,000 was given out in prizes and Â£19,000 was given to charity. The remaining money went on things like advertising, websites and legal costs. ""It never occurred to me that there would not be enough interest, or else I would not have done it,"" she added. ""It's not something that you do for enjoyment."" In a post on the Win Your Castle website, Mrs DeVere blamed the raffle failure on companies such as Eventbrite and Paypal, which she claimed withdrew their support. She also said there were ""many inconsistencies"" in the ASA investigation.

"This video can not be played Kezia Dugdale says the ruling is ""good news for a healthy and free press"" Former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has won a legal case brought by a pro-independence blogger who accused her of defamation. Wings Over Scotland blogger Stuart Campbell took Ms Dugdale to court after she claimed in a newspaper column that he had sent ""homophobic tweets"". In a written judgment, Sheriff Nigel Ross said Ms Dugdale was incorrect to imply that Mr Campbell is homophobic. But he said her article was protected under the principle of fair comment. As a result, the sheriff ruled that Ms Dugdale was not liable to pay any damages to Mr Campbell, who had been seeking Â£25,000. Read the full judgement,external The case centred on a tweet posted by Mr Campbell during the Conservative Party conference in 2017, which said that Conservative MSP Oliver Mundell ""is the sort of public speaker that makes you wish his dad had embraced his homosexuality sooner."" In a subsequent column in the Daily Record newspaper, Ms Dugdale referenced his ""homophobic tweets"" and accused him of spouting ""hatred and homophobia towards others"" from his Twitter account. She later raised the tweets in the Scottish Parliament, and called on SNP politicians to ""shun"" Mr Campbell. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Campbell, from Bath in Somerset, strongly denied his tweet was a homophobic reference to David Mundell being gay, and insisted it was ""satirical criticism"" of Oliver Mundell's public speaking skills. A three-day hearing took place at Edinburgh Sheriff Court last month, during which Mr Campbell described himself as a ""firm advocate of equal rights for gay people"" and said it was ""absurd"" to describe his tweet as homophobic. In his judgement, Sheriff Ross agreed that Mr Campbell ""does not hold homophobic beliefs or feelings"" and had ""demonstrated by his conduct over many years that he supports equality for homosexual people"". This video can not be played Wings Over Scotland blogger on sheriff's judgement: 'He's basically let Kezia off' The sheriff also said Mr Campbell's tweet about Mr Mundell ""was not motivated by homophobia and did not contain homophobic comments"", and that Ms Dugdale had therefore been ""incorrect"" to describe it as homophobic. But the sheriff said: ""Ms Dugdale's article contained the necessary elements for a defence of fair comment. It was based on true facts; the statements complained about were honest; it concerned a matter of public interest, and the comments were fair. ""Her comments were fair, even though incorrect"". Blogger 'distressed' by homophobia claim Dugdale stands by 'homophobic' tweet claim Kezia Dugdale's homophobia claim 'absurd' Sheriff Ross added that the defamation laws recognise there is ""significant public interest in allowing people to freely express opinions without fear of legal penalty"". He went on to describe Mr Campbell as someone who has ""chosen insult and condemnation as his style"", and said the blogger cannot ""hold others to a higher standard of respect than he is willing himself to adopt. ""I do not accept that he can dismiss the feelings or reputations of his opponents cheaply, but receive a high valuation of his own. ""Had I been awarding damages, those damages would have been assessed at Â£100"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Responding to the ruling, Ms Dugdale said she was ""delighted and hugely relieved"" to have won the case, and described it as an ""important judgement for the right to free speech and a healthy press."" The Labour MSP added: ""This ruling clearly demonstrates that every citizen is entitled to make comments as long as they are fair and reflect honestly held views"". Speaking to BBC Scotland, Mr Campbell said: ""It is completely perplexing that the sheriff could find that Kezia Dugdale's remarks were defamatory yet that she was not guilty of defamation."" He called on Ms Dugdale to apologise to him, and said he was taking legal advice on whether or not to appeal against the ruling. In a written statement, he added: ""I sought to defend my reputation against a false accusation of homophobia, to establish that I'm not a homophobe, and to prevent anyone from being able to make such claims in future. ""All of those aims have been upheld, in explicit terms, by this judgement.""

"The sign - which should read ""di-alcohol"" - in fact says ""alcohol am ddim"" which means ""free alcohol"" Before you empty your car boot in preparation - yes, the offer of free booze at a Torfaen supermarket really is too good to be true. A sign in Cwmbran's Asda for the alcohol-free section was incorrectly translated to ""free alcohol"" in Welsh. Guto Aaron, who spotted the sign, wrote on Twitter: ""Get yourself to Asda, according to their dodgy Welsh translations they are giving away free alcohol."" Asda said it was changing the sign. The sign - which should read di-alcohol - in fact says alcohol am ddim, which means free alcohol. An Asda spokesman said: ""Mae'n ddrwg gennym [we are sorry]. We would like to thank our eagle-eyed customers for spotting this mistake. We hold our hands up and will be changing the signs in our Cwmbran store straight away."" The supermarket confirmed there would not be free alcohol in stores this weekend. No free booze here Mr Aaron told BBC Wales: ""To be fair, for a private company, Asda's signs are usually correct so when there is an unfortunate mistake like this, you just have to laugh. ""At least they've turned their self-service checkouts to Welsh. ""I have much more of an issue with the way the sign looks than its content. They have chosen such a dark font for the Welsh to ensure it's practically invisible from afar, it feels deliberate."" Welsh sign gaffe directs shoppers to US Road sign urges drivers to 'follow the entertainment' From wonky bikes to supermarket 'petrel' Mr Aaron said people were quick to blame Google Translate because of ""how bad it used to be"". ""While far from perfect, that has improved a lot, and as it happens Google Translate is able to correctly translate 'alcohol-free', so how on earth Asda has ended up with 'alcohol am ddim', I don't know.""

"Helium-filled balloons have been blamed for causing hundreds of train delays for passengers across the UK each year. Network Rail wants to highlight what it says is a growing problem. The rail infrastructure firm has recorded 619 balloon-related incidents - many dangerous - across England, Scotland and Wales in the past year. Many incidents involveballoons getting tangled in high-voltage overhead wires, causing delays while the electricity is switched off and the lines made safe. ""If you're on a railway station platform with a foil balloon filled with helium on a string and it comes in contact with the overhead wires carrying 25,000 volts, that could cause huge injury or death,"" said James Dean, chief operating officer for Network Rail's London North Western route. ""Ideally, we'd ask people not to bring balloons into our stations at all. Alternatively, carry them in bags so the risk of them floating upwards is minimised."" As well as the safety risks and the delays to train passengers, Network Rail says the annual cost of this problem to the British taxpayer is around Â£1m a year. The latest incident took place this week at Smethwick Rolfe Street Station, in the West Midlands, when a float-away helium balloon got wrapped around the overhead wires. Hundreds of train passengers were delayed, and the cost of delays from this incident was Â£5,000. Balloon artists have joined Network Rail's safety campaign. Trade body The National Association of Balloon Artists and Suppliers (Nabas) has launched a campaign to ban the release of foil balloons, sky lanterns or anything with plastic string or ribbons attached. Nabas chief George Oustayiannis said: ""Balloons bring fun and colour and a sense of celebration to any event, but please dispose of them responsibly, and never release balloons into the atmosphere. Respect the environment and prevent unnecessary danger and delays - please don't let go."" Earlier this week Network Rail warned that cable theft from railway equipment had caused 950 hours of delays in 2018, across more than 7,000 journeys in England, Wales and Scotland.

"Mahad Egal, his partner and two young children escaped from the fourth floor of Grenfell Tower A family who escaped the Grenfell Tower fire have been told by their local authority they will be moved on to a general council house waiting list. A legal letter sent to Mahad Egal and Jamie Murray, who have two children, said a programme to buy permanent homes for survivors ""has finished"". The couple had previously rejected a permanent home as they say it triggered memories of the fire. Kensington and Chelsea Council says it is ""doing all we can"" for survivors. Grenfell households were ""automatically allocated a place at the top of our general housing register"", it added, saying support for survivors continued through dedicated officers and the Grenfell rehousing programme was ""still ongoing"". Earlier this week,the couple told the BBC they faced removal from their temporary homebecause Kensington and Chelsea Council had said it was ""no longer suitable"" and would not renew it. The council has now said they will be able to remain there. The couple and their two children, aged three and five, escaped from the fourth floor of Grenfell Towerduring the fire in June 2017, in which 72 people died. Mr Egal told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that the council was ""relinquishing its duty"" towards them. ""It's shameful. There's a lack of understanding, lack of communication and lack of humanity,"" he continued. The councilsaid in November 2017,externalit was ""committed"" to rehousing all survivors to permanent homes within 12 months - a promise reiterated by former government housing minister Alok Sharma. Seventy two people died in the Grenfell Tower fire on 14 June 2017 The council's legal letter to the couple's solicitors says that ""taking into account your clients' specific requirements, there are no current permanent rehousing options available for the council to offer at this stage"". It adds that any future rehousing options would be ""either council or Housing Association homes"", made through the waiting list - saying it was ""not possible at this stage to provide a timescale"" for when accommodation might be found. It also said the Acquisition Programme set up to buy permanent homes for survivors ""has now finished"". According to the council's website, there were 3,330 households on its waiting list in December 2018. Last year, 433 properties became available. Of these, 141 had two bedrooms. Mr Egal said there is ""nothing else I can do now but wait"". But, he added: ""I wouldn't want to go ahead of a family [on the list] that have been waiting for years for a home."" Local Labour MP Emma Dent Coad told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme this week that the council saw some Grenfell survivors as ""troublesome"" and wanted to ""clear the decks"" before the second anniversary of the tragedy on 14 June. The couple were previously offered a permanent home by the council, and moved in last month. But within three weeks they had returned to their temporary accommodation. The home had been connected to a building with aluminium decorative casing around the windows. They could see this through the living room window, and said it made them feel unsafe - causing them high levels of anxiety and a worsening of PTSD symptoms - following their experiences of the fire. The council said the material was not flammable and was ""one of the safest forms of rain-screening building material available in the industry"". But the couple said they were ""given similar reassurances when we lived in Grenfell Tower"". Kensington and Chelsea Council said 180 Grenfell households were now in their new homes. It said it had bought 300 homes for 202 families, ""spending over Â£200m"". ""There are a very small number of households that have not yet accepted a permanent home and we are continuing to support them in choosing a suitable property,"" it said in a statement. ""These households are automatically allocated a place at the top of our general housing register and remain part of the Grenfell rehousing process.""

"This video can not be played A look inside fire-ravaged Notre-Dame cathedral French President Emmanuel Macron says Notre-Dame cathedral will be rebuilt ""even more beautifully"" - and that he wants the work done within five years. A massive fire on Monday ravaged the 850-year-old Gothic building, destroying much of its roof and causing its steeple to collapse. The cathedral was minutes away from total destruction, officials say. But despite Mr Macron's pledge experts say its reconstruction could take decades. Fifty people will investigate the cause of the fire. Paris public prosecutor RÃ©my Heitz said there was no obvious indication of arson and that the blaze was being treated as an accident. A combined â¬800m ($902m; Â£692m) has already been pledged by a number of companies and business tycoons to help rebuild the Unesco World Heritage site. In a televised address on Tuesday evening, President Macron suggested he wants it rebuilt by the time Paris hosts the Summer Olympics in 2024. ""We'll rebuild Notre-Dame even more beautifully and I want it to be completed in five years, we can do it,"" said Mr Macron, who had already pledged to launch an international fundraising scheme for the reconstruction. The story of the fire in graphics Why blaze was difficult to tackle How will cathedral be restored? ""It's up to us to convert this disaster into an opportunity to come together... It's up to us to find the thread of our national project."" But Eric Fischer, head of the foundation in charge of restoring the 1,000-year-old Strasbourg cathedral, told AFP the Notre-Dame may take ""decades"" to rebuild. FrÃ©dÃ©ric LÃ©toffÃ©, the head of the group of companies for the Restoration of Historic Monuments, put the timescale at between 10 and 15 years, warning substantial work would be needed to secure the site before restoration can begin. This video can not be played 'I was playing at mass when the fire broke' The blaze - which was discovered at 18:43 (16:43 GMT) on Monday and was fully extinguished almost 15 hours later - destroyed most of the cathedral's roof and led to the collapse of its iconic spire. Experts have not yet been allowed on site to assess the damage and firefighters have sent a drone to survey the scale of the destruction. The cathedral's spire, before, during the fire and after Photos appear to show that at least one of the famed rose windows has survived but there are concerns for some of the other stained-glass windows. The 18th Century organ has not been burned but it is not clear whether it is damaged. It was still too early to estimate the cost of the damage, said the Fondation du Patrimoine, an independent non-profit heritage group. The treasures of Notre-Dame The grief that comes from lost buildings Images show damage to cathedral's interior Deputy Interior Minister Laurent NuÃ±ez said the structure was in good condition ""overall"" but that ""some vulnerabilities"" had been identified in the stone vaults and the remainder of the ceiling. The main structure, including the two bell towers, was saved in a time window of 15 to 30 minutes by a team of 400 firefighters, he said. In his speech Mr Macron heaped praise on the fire services, saying they took ""extreme risks"" to tackle the blaze. By Patrick Jackson, BBC News, Paris They sit or stand in a crowd, many of them young people, spilling over the end of the Boulevard Saint Michel, this first evening after the fire, singing hymns. On a table beneath the towering sculpture of Saint Michael stands a statue of Our Lady - Notre Dame. ""As a French Catholic,"" says Ãloi, 22, ""I felt really bad after the fire so I see this vigil as a way to say that even if the flames destroyed the cathedral, we can rebuild it because the Church is made not of stones but is a living body."" He believes the cathedral should be remade just the way it was, as a ""prayer to God"". ""We are Catholics,"" he adds, ""but all French people - Catholics, Muslims, atheists - are united around this disaster and in the hope it will be rebuilt."" And they are united in pride in the fire brigade. During the concert, an engine hurtles past on the road, and the singing stops as the crowd claps and cheers. Investigators trying to establish the cause of the fire have begun questioning workers from five companies involved in the extensive renovations that were under way at the cathedral. Officials believe the works could be linked to the disaster. ""Nothing indicates this was a deliberate act,"" said public prosecutor RÃ©my Heitz, adding that he expected to be a ""long and complex"" case. Offers of help to rebuild the cathedral have come from several world leaders, groups and individuals, including: Billionaire FranÃ§ois-Henri Pinault, chairman and CEO of the Kering group that owns the Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent fashion brands, who pledged â¬100m Bernard Arnault's family and their company LVMH, a business empire which includes Louis Vuitton and Sephora, who pledged â¬200m French cosmetics giant L'Oreal and its founding Bettencourt family promised to give â¬200m while oil giant Total pledged â¬100m Culture Minister Franck Riester said some of the artwork and religious items rescued would be sent to the Louvre museum where they would be kept and eventually restored. They include what is said to be the crown of thorns worn by Jesus before his crucifixion and a tunic King Louis IX is said to have worn when he brought the crown to Paris. The cathedral's paintings would be removed from Friday, Mr Riester said. How will Notre-Dame cathedral be restored?

"This video can not be played There were gasps from the crowd at the moment Notre-Dameâs spire fell France is to invite architects from around the world to submit their designs for a new spire to sit atop a renovated Notre-Dame cathedral. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told reporters they hoped for ""a new spire that is adapted to the techniques and the challenges of our era"". The spire of the 850-year-old building was completely destroyed in the blaze. Meanwhile, cathedral bells across France rang out in solidarity with Notre-Dame on Wednesday. They sounded at 16:50 GMT to mark the exact moment when the blaze started on Monday. The entire cathedral was only minutes away from total destruction, officials have said. However, much of the Parisian building - including its famed towers - survived, and thoughts have now turned to how to reconstruct what has been lost. Could Assassin's Creed help rebuild Notre-Dame? Notre-Dame inspires help for US black churches Notre-Dame booksellers urge donations President Emmanuel Macron vowed it would be rebuilt ""even more beautifully"", adding that he wanted the work done within five years - although experts warn its reconstruction could take decades. The spire destroyed in the blaze was added to the cathedral during a 19th Century restoration project led by French architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc. But Mr Philippe questioned ""whether we should even recreate the spire as it was conceived by Viollet-le-Duc... or if, as is often the case in the evolution of heritage, we should endow Notre-Dame with a new spire"". Meanwhile, a copper statue of a cockerel - a symbol of France - that topped the spire has been recovered from the rubble ""battered but apparently restorable"", the culture ministry said. The cockerel contains holy relics, but it is not yet clear if these are still intact. Jacques Chanut, president of the French Building Federation, tweeted a picture of the statue being carried by Philippe Villeneuve, the architect in charge of the repair project.

The treasures of Notre-Dame The grief that comes from lost buildings Images show damage to cathedral's interior Deputy Interior Minister Laurent NuÃ±ez said the structure was in good condition ""overall"" but that ""some vulnerabilities"" had been found in the stone vaults and the remainder of the ceiling. The main structure, including the two bell towers, was saved in a time window of 15 to 30 minutes by a team of 400 firefighters, he said. In his speech Mr Macron heaped praise on the fire services, saying they took ""extreme risks"" to tackle the blaze. Investigators trying to establish the cause of the fire have begun questioning workers from five companies involved in the renovations that were under way at the cathedral. Officials believe the works could have accidentally led to the disaster. Offers of help to rebuild the cathedral have come from several world leaders, groups and individuals, including: Billionaire FranÃ§ois-Henri Pinault, chairman and CEO of the Kering group that owns the Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent fashion brands, who pledged â¬100m Bernard Arnault's family and their company LVMH, a business empire which includes Louis Vuitton and Sephora, who pledged â¬200m French cosmetics giant L'Oreal and its founding Bettencourt family promised to give â¬200m while oil giant Total pledged â¬100m Culture Minister Franck Riester said some of the artwork and religious items rescued would be sent to the Louvre museum where they would be kept and eventually restored.

"An age-check scheme designed to stop under-18s viewing pornographic websites will come into force on 15 July. From that date, affected sites will have to verify the age of UK visitors. If they fail to comply they will face being blocked by internet service providers. But critics say teens may find it relatively easy to bypass the restriction or could simply turn to porn-hosting platforms not covered by the law. Twitter, Reddit and image-sharing community Imgur, for example, will not be required to administer the scheme because they fall under an exceptionwhere more than a third of a site or app's content,externalmust be pornographic to qualify. Likewise, any platform that hosts pornography but does not do so on a commercial basis - meaning it does not charge a fee or make money from adverts or other activity - will not be affected. Government in email privacy blunder Furthermore, it will remain legal to use virtual private networks (VPNs), which can make it seem like a UK-based computer is located elsewhere, to evade the age checks. The authorities have, however, acknowledged that age-verification is ""not a silver bullet"" solution, but rather a means to make it less likely that children stumble across unsuitable material online. ""The introduction of mandatory age-verification is a world-first, and we've taken the time to balance privacy concerns with the need to protect children from inappropriate content,"" said the Minister for Digital Margot James. ""We want the UK to be the safest place in the world to be online, and these new laws will help us achieve this."" This video can not be played Past moves to police pornography in the UK It had originally been proposed that pornographic services thatrefused to carry out age checks could be fined up to Â£250,000,external. However, this power will not be enforced because ministers believe the threat toblock defiant sites will be sufficient,externaland that trying to chase overseas-based entities for payment would have been difficult. However, the government has said that other measures could follow. ""We know that pornography is available on some social media platforms and we expect those platforms to do a lot more to create a safer environment for children,"" a spokesman for the Department of Digital Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) told the BBC. ""If we do not see action then we do not rule out legislating in the future to force companies to take responsibility for protecting vulnerable users from the potentially harmful content that they host."" The age checks wereoriginally proposed by the now defunct regulator Atvod in 2014and were enacted into law as part of the the Digital Economy Act 2017. But their rollout had been repeatedly delayed. UK-hosted pornographic video services already have to verify visitors' ages, as do online gambling platforms. The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) - which gives movies their UK age certificates - will be responsible for regulating the effort. It will instruct internet providers which sites and apps to block for non-compliance. In addition, it can call on payment service providers to pull support, and ask search engines and advertisers to shun an offending business. Websites to be fined over 'online harms' Under-18s face 'like' and 'streaks' limits on social media Dating apps 'must not risk child safety' The pornographic platforms themselves will have freedom to choose how to verify UK visitors' ages. But the BBFC has said that it will award solutions that adopt ""robust"" data-protection standards with a certificate, allowing them to display a green AV (age verification) symbol on their marketing materials to help consumers make an informed choice. One digital rights campaign group questioned the sense of this scheme being voluntary. ""Having some age verification that is good and other systems that are bad is unfair and a scammer's paradise - of the government's own making,"" said Jim Killock from the Open Rights Group. ""Data leaks could be disastrous. And they will be the government's own fault."" Mindgeek, one of the adult industry's biggest players, has developed an online system of its own called AgeID, which it hopes will be widely adopted. It involves adults having to upload scans of their passports or driving licences, which are then verified by a third-party. It has said that all the information will be encrypted and that the AgeID system will not keep track of how each users' accounts are used. Mindgeek intends to launch its AgeID system soon in the UK High street stores and newsagentswill also sell separate age-verification cards to adults after carrying out face-to-face checks,external, according to the government. Dubbed ""porn passes"" by the media, the idea is that users would type in a code imprinted on the cards into pornographic websites to gain access to their content. The BBFC has said it will alsocreate an online form for members of the public to flag,externalnon-compliant sites once the new regulations come into effect. ""We want to make sure that when these new rules are implemented they are as effective as possible,"" commented the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC). ""To accomplish this, it is crucial the rules keep pace with the different ways that children are exposed to porn online."" The age checks form part of a wider effort by the UK's authorities to make the internet safer to use for young people. Most recently, DCMS proposed the creation of anew regulator to tackle apps that contain content promoting self-harm and suicide,external, among other problems. In addition, the Information Commissioner's Office hasproposed services stop using tools that encourage under-18s to share more personal data,externalabout themselves than they would do otherwise. The idea of the government keeping a database of verified porn viewers had sounded like a privacy and ethical nightmare. Luckily it has dodged that bullet. While ministers have ordered porn sites to age-verify users, they have not told them how they must do so. That means different sites will have different systems Those ""porn passes"" that your friendly local newsagent may soon dish out are a theoretical solution, but there is no obligation for any porn site to accept them. So, you may potentially have to verify yourself several times for several porn sites. Despite the introduction of a new kitemark-like badge to identify cyber-security conscious systems, there's still a concern that some will suffer data breaches causing people's adult interests to be exposed.

"Mahad Egal, his partner and two young children escaped from the fourth floor of Grenfell Tower A family who escaped the Grenfell Tower fire have been told by their local authority they will be moved on to a general council house waiting list. A legal letter sent to Mahad Egal and Jamie Murray, who have two children, said a programme to buy permanent homes for survivors ""has finished"". The couple had previously rejected a permanent home as they say it triggered memories of the fire. Kensington and Chelsea Council says it is ""doing all we can"" for survivors. Grenfell households were ""automatically allocated a place at the top of our general housing register"", it added, saying support for survivors continued through dedicated officers and the Grenfell rehousing programme was ""still ongoing"". Earlier this week,the couple told the BBC they faced removal from their temporary homebecause Kensington and Chelsea Council had said it was ""no longer suitable"" and would not renew it. The council has now said they will be able to remain there. The couple and their two children, aged three and five, escaped from the fourth floor of Grenfell Towerduring the fire in June 2017, in which 72 people died. Mr Egal told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that the council was ""relinquishing its duty"" towards them. ""It's shameful. There's a lack of understanding, lack of communication and lack of humanity,"" he continued. The councilsaid in November 2017,externalit was ""committed"" to rehousing all survivors to permanent homes within 12 months - a promise reiterated by former government housing minister Alok Sharma. Seventy two people died in the Grenfell Tower fire on 14 June 2017 The council's legal letter to the couple's solicitors says that ""taking into account your clients' specific requirements, there are no current permanent rehousing options available for the council to offer at this stage"". It adds that any future rehousing options would be ""either council or Housing Association homes"", made through the waiting list - saying it was ""not possible at this stage to provide a timescale"" for when accommodation might be found. It also said the Acquisition Programme set up to buy permanent homes for survivors ""has now finished"". According to the council's website, there were 3,330 households on its waiting list in December 2018. Last year, 433 properties became available. Of these, 141 had two bedrooms. Mr Egal said there is ""nothing else I can do now but wait"". But, he added: ""I wouldn't want to go ahead of a family [on the list] that have been waiting for years for a home."" Local Labour MP Emma Dent Coad told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme this week that the council saw some Grenfell survivors as ""troublesome"" and wanted to ""clear the decks"" before the second anniversary of the tragedy on 14 June. The couple were previously offered a permanent home by the council, and moved in last month. But within three weeks they had returned to their temporary accommodation. The home had been connected to a building with aluminium decorative casing around the windows. They could see this through the living room window, and said it made them feel unsafe - causing them high levels of anxiety and a worsening of PTSD symptoms - following their experiences of the fire. The council said the material was not flammable and was ""one of the safest forms of rain-screening building material available in the industry"".

"The BBC Proms will blast into hyperspace this summer, with a series of interstellar concerts marking the 50th anniversary of the Moon landings. Alongside classics like Holst's The Planets, the season will include a Sci-Fi Prom, featuring scores from films such as Gravity and Alien: Covenant. A CBeebies concert will take children on a journey to the Moon, including a close encounter with The Clangers. And the season opens in July with a new piece inspired by thefirst Moon walk,external. Zosha Di Castri's Long Is The Journey, Short Is The Memory will be premiered on Friday 19 July, under the baton of Karina Canellakis - the first female conductor to oversee the First Night of the Proms. Meanwhile, art-rock band Public Service Broadcasting will play their concept album Race For Space in a special late night Prom. The record, which combines sparse electronic beats with archive audio recordings from the US-Soviet space race, will be presented in a new arrangement with the Multi-Story Orchestra. Karina Canellakis is one of seven female conductors appearing at this year's Proms Running from 19 July to 14 September, the 125th Proms season will also see concerts from cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason, West African singer AngÃ©lique Kidjo and American mezzo-soprano Jamie Barton, who will be the featured soloist on the Last Night of the Proms. Although the festival was planned as the Brexit deadline approached, Proms director David Pickard said there were ""almost no"" plans put in place to ensure foreign musicians could play if Britain left the EU without a deal. ""To be fair, there were a couple of orchestras who raised the issue with us at the end of last year,"" he told BBC News, ""but I think the music world is incredibly resilient. ""Most orchestras I've spoken to have said, 'Well, there's probably going to be a lot of extra paperwork and there might be a few more costs, but we'll find a way of doing it somehow.' ""And what was the contingency plan we could have made? We were trying to second-guess the whole time what the implications would be - but not knowing what the future would hold, there was no contingency that would have been foolproof."" BBC Proms - official site 2019 Proms playlist on Spotify,external Last Night of the Proms 2018: Jess Gillam steals the show All of this year's concerts will be broadcast live on BBC Radio 3, and 25 of the shows will be screened on BBC television. Tickets for each of the concerts start at Â£6. Here are five further highlights from the 2019 programme. The Proms will celebrate the 200th anniversary of Queen Victoria's birth by transporting her piano from the drawing room of Buckingham Palace for a one-night-only performance. The gilded instrument, painted with cherubs and monkeys, will deliver music by Victoria's favourite composer, Mendelssohn, as well as several songs composed by her husband, Prince Albert. ""They are really actually very charming,"" said Pickard. ""I guess I would say that, but they definitely are worth hearing."" When he's not pushing Radiohead into disturbing new sonic directions, guitarist Jonny Greenwood has a sideline as an avant-garde composer - most notably on film soundtracks such as There Will Be Blood, Norwegian Wood and the Oscar-nominated Phantom Thread. He makes his Proms debut on 10 September, curating a programme that includes Steve Reich's hypnotic Pulse and Heinrich Biber's Passacaglia in G Minor. The concert culminates with the world premiere of Greenwood's Horror Vacui - which aims to simulate electronic sounds using 68 string instruments played acoustically. After bringing Quincy Jones, Charles Mingus and grime to the Proms, conductor Jules Buckley has turned his attention to soul-jazz legend Nina Simone. Titled Mississippi Goddam, after Simone's powerful civil rights protest song, the night promises to ""explore her background and enduring influence"" as a musician, lyricist and activist. The concert will feature Selma star Ledisi, amongst others, performing tracks like I Put A Spell On You, My Baby Just Cares For Me and Feeling Good. Buckley is also in charge of a hip-hop Prom, which will showcase scratch DJs, beatboxing and even graffiti art. The singers from British musical collectiveSolomon's Knot,externalwill perform four Bach cantatas from memory, without a conductor at a late-night Prom on 14 August. ""They're a young baroque group, who've just sprung up but have quite a big following,"" said Pickard. ""Their concerts are incredibly communicative because they're either looking at you or they're looking at each other. It's hard to explain the dynamic but they're a very interesting group."" But while performing without a conductor adds a frisson of danger, this respected and experienced collective won't put a foot wrong. ""Will it go wrong?""they tweeted on Thursday,external. ""Of course not!"" An illustration from The Lost Words, which inspired one of this year's Proms There's a strong environmental theme to this year's programme, with works such as Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony, inspired by his walks in the Austrian countryside, and Richard Strauss's Alpine Symphony, which depicts a day's climbing in the Bavarian Alps. The season will also feature the European premiere of In The Name Of The Earth, by Pulitzer Prize-winner John Luther Adams. Inspired by the landscapes of America, and humanity's perilous relationship with nature, the work will be performed by eight choirs positioned around the Royal Albert Hall, immersing the audience in the music. Meanwhile, the Lost Words Prom takes its inspiration from Robert McFarlane and Jackie Morris's book, The Lost Words (pictured above), which ""reclaims"" words like acorn, adder and bramble, after they wereexpunged from the Oxford Children's Dictionaryin favour of modern terms such as broadband and celebrity. The family-focused concert will blend jazz, classical, beatboxing and sound effects; while McFarlane will update his lexicon of lost words with a few new entries.

"Susan DeVere launched a raffle to get rid of the property A woman has been rapped by the advertising watchdog for offering a Scottish castle as a raffle prize - but giving the winner a cash prize instead. Susan DeVere set up the contest after she failed to sell Orchardton Castle, near Auchencairn, Kirkcudbrightshire. However, cash giveaways were offered when ticket sales were too low. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the competition was not ""administered fairly"" - a ruling disputed by Mrs DeVere. She said she made the possibility of a cash prize clear. Tickets costing Â£5 were offered via Facebook and winacastle.co.uk, with the winner promised the opportunity to ""win the whole building freehold"". This video can not be played Susan DeVere tells Victoria Derbyshire her raffle was ""as transparent as possible"". Sums of Â£65,000, Â£7,000 and Â£5,000 were handed out in June last year. One person complained the raffle had been administered unfairly because the prize had been changed to a cash amount. Millionaire raffles Â£3m mansion for Â£10 a ticket Ripped-up lottery ticket wins Â£58m jackpot Built in the 1880s, the 17-bedroom property had been valued at between Â£1.5m and Â£2.5m and comes with five acres of land and views across the Solway Firth. Mrs DeVere told the ASA that all property competitions were run in the same way and the castle could not be awarded if there were not enough entries received to clear the mortgage. She said it was made clear from the beginning that if not enough entries were received, the property would not be awarded and a cash prize would be offered instead. Mrs DeVere added that after the prize draw had taken place the winner was offered a share of the property and a chance to run a business there had they wanted to, which was a goodwill offer unconnected to the competition. The winner chose to accept the cash prize. The ASA said the complainant had entered the promotion in the hope of winning the castle. It said: ""We understood that at the end of the competition three cash prizes were awarded at the value of Â£65,000, Â£7,000 and Â£5,000 instead of the advertised prize, because the minimum number of entries had not been reached, and that the advertiser had offered the winner a share of the property. ""However, we considered that a share of the property or any cash alternative that was less than the value of the property, were not reasonable equivalents to the prize as advertised. ""Because neither the advertised prize nor a reasonable alternative had been awarded, we concluded that the promotion had not been administered fairly and was in breach of the code."" The castle had been valued at between Â£1.5m and Â£2.5m Mrs DeVere told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that she planned to appeal against the ruling because it ""doesn't make any sense"". ""It wasn't unfair. We did absolutely everything to make it as fair and transparent as possible,"" she said. ""Right from the beginning, on our website it said that if enough entries didn't come in then it would be a cash prize. ""We actually gave examples of what the cash prizes would be."" Mrs DeVere said that she had not made any money from the competition. She said the ticket sales raised Â£107,000, of which Â£77,000 was given out in prizes and Â£19,000 was given to charity.

"Travel companies have been warned against mistreating unfortunate customers by relying on unenforceable deposit and payment demands. A lack of awareness over how much can be retained when a traveller cancels a booking is widespread, according to the Competition and Markets Authority. A company cannot automatically keep a large deposit if the customer cancels owing to unforeseen circumstances. Such a contract may be unfair, even if written into terms and conditions. For example, somebody may cancel a booking owing to illness or a family bereavement. If the travel company has plenty of time to re-sell the room or holiday, or if it becomes available at a peak time, then the company should refund the payment or a hefty deposit. Any amount it charges should reflect its costs. If the company includes a blanket ""non-refundable deposit"" demand or cancellation fee in its terms and conditions then this could be an unfair contract, not legally binding, and unenforceable - even if the customer has signed it. Wedding venues warned to treat customers fairly Personal travel agents boost holiday bookings Hotel booking sites to end 'misleading' sales Paul Latham, from the CMA - the UK's competition watchdog, said that as many as 50% of travel firms may not be fully aware of the rules. Many smaller firms may copy terms and conditions from others, potentially leading to a proliferation of unfair contracts. The watchdog has no plans to launch an investigation into specific operators, but is working with travel trade bodies to raise awareness of the rules through its ""small print, big difference"" campaign. On average, a family in the UK can spend up to Â£3,000 on holidays and travel each year. The CMA wants customers to know that they do not always have to resort to travel insurance to retrieve deposits if they are forced to change their plans. Anyone who believes they have been treated unfairly should contact the company involved, and can contact theCitizens Advice consumer helpline,externalfor guidance. Ultimately, they might have to take their case to court. It is not the first time the CMA has raised the issue of unfair contracts. In 2016, it gave a general warning to firms, and specifically wrote to wedding venue owners to remind them of their legal obligations.

"This video can not be played Specialist police teams were used to remove the group from the DLR train Climate change activists glued themselves to a train and others chained themselves to Jeremy Corbyn's home in a third day of protests. Extinction Rebellion protesters have been blocking traffic at Marble Arch, Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Oxford Circus since Monday. Earlier, three activists were glued to a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) train at Canary Wharf, causing minor delays. Four people also glued themselves together at the Labour leader's home. Four people glued themselves together at Jeremy Corbyn's home in north London The activists, who also used a bike lock to attach themselves to Mr Corbyn's north London house, said they supported him but wanted the Labour Party to go further than declaring a ""climate emergency"". After ending their protest Tracee Williams, one of the group, said she did not think the action was a ""misstep but whether we'd do it again, I'm not so sure"". Mr Corbyn left his home but declined to meet or speak to any of the protesters. Easter eggs and flowers from the group, which had been taken into Mr Corbyn's home earlier, were later returned to the street by the Labour leader's wife Laura Alvarez. Ms Williams added the group ""really felt we had to bring it to his front door"" but ""feel absolutely terrible about upsetting his wife"". As of 17:00 BST, 340 people have been arrested since Monday over the protests, the Met Police said. Jeremy Corbyn declined to speak to any of the protesters when he left his home The campaigner who glued himself to a train window was removed about an hour after the start of the DLR protest, at about 10:50. The man and a woman who unfurled a banner and glued themselves to the top of the train's carriage were also later removed and carried off by officers. BTP said three people had been arrested for obstructing the railway. Extinction Rebellion: Can the plan work? Climate protest arrests close to 300 'Our objective is to cause disruption' Extinction Rebellion targeted the DLR after members changed their minds about disrupting the Tube network. It came after BTP ordered Transport for London (TfL) to switch off wifi at Tube stations to deter protests. Two activists climbed on to a train at Canary Wharf while another glued his hand to the window Supt Matt Allingham said extra officers would be on duty throughout the day, adding: ""We will not tolerate any activity which disrupts the millions of passengers who rely on using the rail network in London."" Campaigners at Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Oxford Circus have been ordered to restrict their protests to Marble Arch. The Met said protesters were being removed from both areas and those who did not comply would be arrested. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In Edinburgh, dozens of people were arrested earlier this week when hundreds of protesters blocked a main road. Police ordered protesters to retreat to the site of their camp at Marble Arch Organisers said protests had been held in more than 80 cities across 33 countries and action in London was planned until 29 April. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said ""it's appropriate for people to make their feelings known"" but added: ""We've got the message; we understand that action needs to be taken."" Speaking on the BBC's The One Show, he said some of the protest action had been ""over the top"" but driven by a ""legitimate desire to put climate change and the environment further up the agenda"". Mr Gove said the UK had ""played a role in reducing carbon emissions and at the same time growing the economy"", but admitted ""there is more to be done"". This video can not be played Extinction Rebellion: The story behind the activist group Since the group was set up last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament. It has three core demands: for the government to ""tell the truth about climate change"", reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025, and create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible. But critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched. The government said it shared ""people's passion"" to combat climate change and ""protect our planet for future generations"". The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the UK had cut its emissions by 44% since 1990. A spokesman said: ""We've asked our independent climate experts for advice on a net zero emissions target and set out plans to transition to low emission vehicles and significantly reduce pollution.""

"Researchers say Scotland could face a 5.5% loss of output A disorderly Brexit risks a deep recession in Scotland, according to researchers. The Fraser of Allander Institute (FAI), part of the University of Strathclyde, predicts a loss of more than one Â£1 in every Â£20 of output from the economy. It suggests the fall from peak to trough in the economy could be around 5.5% of total output, contracting for two whole years. This is in line with forecasts made by the Bank of England for the UK economy. The FAI modelled several possible Brexit outcomes and the impact in its latest economic commentary. This included scenarios of a no-deal Brexit with and without policy response. Despite the potential for loss, researchers expect the damage to be offset by action taken by governments and the Bank of England. And the FAI has set out a possible growth path for the Scottish economy which could see it outperform current estimates if Brexit is well-managed, business confidence returns and investment picks up. The central forecast for the economy is slightly weaker than the last such report from the economics institute. It predicts only 1.1% growth this year, followed by 1.4% next year and 1.5% the year after. Pelosi warns against weakening peace deal PM 'not pondering poll' on walking break Avoiding European polls a priority - Hunt While much economic attention has been focused on Brexit in recent months, the economists warn that major questions are being ignored or avoided by governments in Edinburgh and London. Reflecting on the difference made by the Scottish parliament 20 years after it was first elected, Wednesday's report says the weakest part of its performance has been ""the lack of evaluation and scrutiny of the effectiveness and value of policy initiatives"". It questions whether there has been any progress on a Whitehall initiative to find ways for governments and their agencies to work better together in the interests of the Scottish economy. It says there should be a renewed focus on sustainable growth, after most targets set by the incoming Scottish government in 2007 have been missed. The report says there is a need to address big structural changes coming to the economy, including demographic change, the scaling back of the oil and gas sector, automation and emerging economies around the world. Nicola Sturgeon will reiterate her concerns about Brexit in a speech to the STUC annual congress in Dundee on Wednesday afternoon At the same time, it says there should be an assumption that government budgets will remain tight, demand for the health service continues to grow, and little discussion takes place of the squeeze on public services that are not protected by having the high priority for the NHS and schools. The report calls for stronger cross-party co-operation in the Scottish Parliament, pointing to the impasse on Brexit in Westminster as the outcome of consensus policy-making breaking down. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will focus on Brexit when she speaks at the STUC conference in Dundee later, where she is expected to say nobody should pretend that the ""damage"" of Brexit can be fully mitigated, She will also warn that Brexit, in any form, will harm living standards and risk jobs. Anextension to Article 50 was granted earlier this month, meaning the UK will not leave the EU until 31 October unless Prime Minister Theresa May can get her withdrawal deal - which has been rejected three times by MPs - agreed in Parliament before then. The UK government has been holding talks with Labour in a bid to break the deadlock, with Mrs May saying she still wants the country to leave before 22 May to avoid European elections being held the next day. Is there time for another Brexit vote? How UK is gearing up for European elections UK MEPs could sit for 'months or longer' Mrs May has pledged to pursue an ""orderly"" Brexit while acknowledging that ""the whole country is intensely frustrated that this process of leaving the European Union has not been completed."" Meanwhile, the government is continuing to make plans for the UK leaving without a deal. Graeme Roy, director of the Fraser of Allander Institute, said that last week's delay in the deadline for Brexit only ""kicked the can down the road"", with little evidence so far of UK policy makers being able to agree a compromise approach. The risks to the economy therefore remain high. He added: ""Brexit should not be the only focus of attention. One consequence of the Brexit debate is that it has left little room for discussion of the emerging structural challenges and opportunities our economy is facing."" John Macintosh, tax partner at Deloitte, the accountancy firm that sponsors the regular Allander economic commentary, said the latest report underlined strong employment figures, but there is a pressing need to encourage investment and to improve productivity"". He called on business to ""think differently, adopting a more ambitious and medium-term outlook by investing in innovative and collaborative strategies as well as talent"".

Oxford Street has been empty of traffic since activists parked a pink boat in Oxford Circus on Monday Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of New West End Company, said the West End lost Â£12m in trade because of the first two days of protests. Hetold BBC Radio London: ""Everyone has a right to peaceful protest. But this is really disruptive."" In Edinburgh, dozens of people were arrested earlier this week when hundreds of protesters blocked a main road. Police ordered protesters to retreat to the site of their camp at Marble Arch Organisers said protests had been held in more than 80 cities across 33 countries and action in London was planned until 29 April. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said ""it's appropriate for people to make their feelings known"" but added: ""We've got the message; we understand that action needs to be taken."" Speaking on the BBC's The One Show, he said some of the protest action had been ""over the top"" but driven by a ""legitimate desire to put climate change and the environment further up the agenda"". Mr Gove said the UK had ""played a role in reducing carbon emissions and at the same time growing the economy"", but admitted ""there is more to be done"". This video can not be played Extinction Rebellion: The story behind the activist group Since the group was set up last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament. It has three core demands: for the government to ""tell the truth about climate change"", reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025, and create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible. But critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched. The government said it shared ""people's passion"" to combat climate change and ""protect our planet for future generations"". The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the UK had cut its emissions by 44% since 1990. A spokesman said: ""We've asked our independent climate experts for advice on a net zero emissions target and set out plans to transition to low emission vehicles and significantly reduce pollution.""

"A surprise court ruling has revived the possibility of a Â£14bn lawsuit against credit card firm Mastercard. The Court of Appeal in London has ruled the Competition Appeal Tribunal must reconsider the class action against the firm which it threw out two years ago. The claim alleges 46 million people paid higher prices in shops than they should have due to high card fees. Mastercard said it continued to ""disagree fundamentally with the basis of the claim"". ""This decision is not a final ruling and the proposed claim is not approved to move forward; rather, the court has simply said a rehearing on certain issues should happen,"" it added. The financial services firm said it was seeking permission to appeal against the ruling to the Supreme Court. Former financial ombudsman Walter Merricks - who is behind the claim - is trying to bring the class action on behalf of all individuals over 16 who were resident in the UK for at least three months between 1992 and 2008 and who bought an item or service from a UK business which accepted Mastercard. He alleges that fees which Mastercard charged businesses for accepting payments from consumers, known as interchange fees, led to UK consumers paying higher prices on purchases from businesses that accepted Mastercard. If the Â£14bn was awarded and divided between the 46 million eligible people the payout would amount to Â£300 each. Mr Merricks' original claim was thrown out by the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) two years ago. But on Tuesday the Court of Appeal said the CAT had applied the wrong legal test in making its decision. Mr Merricks' claim will now go back to the CAT, which will have to reconsider whether to allow it to proceed. He said he was ""very pleased"" by the decision. ""It is nearly 12 years since Mastercard was clearly told that they had broken the law by imposing excessive card transaction charges, damaging consumers over a prolonged period. ""As a result we all had to pay higher prices in the shops than we should have done - while Mastercard have pocketed the profits. Mr Merricks' solicitor Boris Bronfentrinker, from Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, called the decision a ""landmark day for all UK consumers that Mr Merricks seeks to represent"". The proposed claim follows the European Commission's 2007 decision that Mastercard's interchange fees were in breach of competition law.

"Amy El-Keria was found hanged in her room in November 2012 The Priory healthcare group has been fined Â£300,000 over the death of a child at one of its hospitals. Amy El-Keria, 14, was found hanged in her room at the Priory in Ticehurst, East Sussex, in November 2012. The private company, which runs mental health services as part of an NHS contract, was sentenced at Lewes Crown Court. In 2016, an inquest found her death may have been prevented if she had received proper care. The Health and Safety Executive pursued a criminal investigation and the company admitted a charge of being an employer failing to discharge its duty to ensure people were not exposed to health and safety risks. In sentencing, Judge Mr Justice James Dingemans said no financial penalty he could impose would ever ""reflect the loss suffered by Amy's family"". Speaking outside court, Amy's mother Tania El-Keria said: ""The public's eye has been firmly opened to what the Priory stand for, profit over safety. ""Today is a historic day in our fight for justice for Amy. ""Our Amy died in what we know to be a criminally unsafe hospital being run by the Priory."" This video can not be played Amy's mother Tania El-Keria said: ""I've been fighting so long to get the justice for her"" Asked about the size of the penalty, Ms El-Keria said: ""It's not about the fine, it's not about the money."" She said the Priory's contract with the NHS should not carry on. ""I don't believe there's any lessons learned,"" she added. A court hearing in January was told Amy, who was deemed high-risk and had a ""known and recent history"" of suicide attempts, was admitted to the hospital on 23 August 2012. She was left with unsupervised access and the means to carry out another suicide attempt. On November 12, she was found with a ligature around her neck and taken to Conquest Hospital in Hastings, where she died the next day. The inquest into her death heard staff at the unit had not been trained in resuscitation and did not call 999 quickly enough. The jury said Amy died of unintended consequences of a deliberate act, contributed to by neglect, and that staffing levels at the Ticehurst centre were inadequate. Priory faces heavy fine over girl's death Hospital 'neglected' girl found hanged Judge Dingemans said: ""It is apparent from the investigations that have been carried out in Amy's death, and the works carried out by Priory Healthcare and the CQC [Care Quality Commission], that there is now a much better understanding of young person suicide, and that vital lessons have been learned."" When imposing the fine, he said he took into account the company's ""good"" health and safety record, guilty plea and steps made to improve the service. Priory Healthcare had a turnover of Â£133m in 2017, with an operating profit of Â£2m, he said. It must also pay the Health and Safety Executive's costs of Â£65,800 and a victim surcharge of Â£120. Amy El-Keria was admitted to the Priory Hospital in Ticehurst a few months before she died In a statement, the charity Inquest, which supported the family, said it was ""a historic moment in terms of accountability following deaths of children in private mental health settings"". Victoria McNally, a senior caseworker at the charity, said: ""Allowing the Priory to investigate their own actions, meant it took six-and-a-half years for their criminally unsafe practises to be exposed. ""If we are serious about child safety and welfare, such a blatant lack of oversight and scrutiny cannot continue."" Trevor Torrington, head of the Priory Group, said: ""The latest CQC report, published in January this year, rated Ticehurst as ""good"" in all areas. ""We remain absolutely focussed on patient safety and will continue to work closely with commissioners and regulators to learn lessons from incidents and inspections quickly and ensure all concerns are addressed in a timely and robust way. "" Ms El-Keria is due to meet with mental health minister Jackie Doyle-Price in May.

"Activists protest against the arrests at the Saudi embassy in Paris A court in Saudi Arabia has postponed a hearing in the trial of several of the country's most prominent women's rights activists, officials say. Some relatives were told that the judge had delayed the session for ""private reasons"", Reuters news agency said. The women were arrested last May and charged with offences including spying. They had been campaigning for an end to the country's male guardianship system and for the right to drive, before the ban was lifted last June. Since then, horrific details have emerged of their alleged mistreatment at the hands of the Saudi authorities. On Tuesday, Walid al-Hathloul, the brother of one of the best-known activists, Loujain al-Hathloul, told the BBC his sister was so traumatised by what had happened to her that she wanted to remain in jail, afraid of how her reputation had been unfairly smeared in her absence. Loujain al-Hathloul's brother tells the BBC that she was tortured in prison in Jeddah He said that following her arrest Ms Hathloul had been taken to a secret detention facility near the maximum security prison of Dhahban in Jeddah. There, she told her family, she was taken down to a basement and subjected to waterboarding and electrocution. He named Saud al-Qahtani, a close confidant of the Saudi Crown Prince, as the man who oversaw her torture, allegedly laughing as he threatened to have her raped and murdered. In February, a group of British MPs carried out an investigation, supported by a number of international human rights organisations, into the allegations of mistreatment of Ms Hathloul and other female activists. They concluded that the allegations were credible. In March the UN's Human Rights Council called for their release and more than 30 countries, including all 28 EU members, signed a statement condemning their prolonged detention. The Saudi government says the detained women enjoy all the rights afforded to them under Saudi law. But Mr Hathloul said everything about his sister's arrest and detention had been shrouded in secrecy and that the entire judicial process lacked transparency. It was not until November 2018, he said, six months after her arrest, that the family even learned what she was accused of. Saudi Arabia's enduring male guardianship system 'Why I fled Saudi Arabia and sought asylum in the UK' Saudi Arabia puts women's rights activists on trial The accusations, he said, included ""applying for a job at the UN and being in contact with human rights organisations"". He added that the prosecution had not produced any evidence to support its allegation of spying. While Saudi Arabia rejects all criticism of its judicial system, insisting it is based on Sharia (Islamic law), in practice it has always been opaque, with arbitrary judgements often handed down at the whim of a judge. This case has attracted particularly widespread international condemnation and is seen as further damaging the reputation of Saudi Arabia's controversial Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, known as MBS. Mohammed Bin Salman was once hailed as a reformer in the west - but is accused of suppressing dissenters Initially courted in the West as an enlightened reformer who reintroduced cinemas and public entertainment to the conservative kingdom, MBS remains under suspicion for his alleged involvement in last October's murder of the journalist Jamal al-Khashoggi, which his government denies. Commentators have explained the apparent paradox between the accelerated crackdown on human rights and the crown prince's simultaneous liberalisation of Saudi society as being the ruling family's determination to steer reforms at their pace, rather than at the one demanded by peaceful protesters. This, in a country where all political parties are banned, would be seen as a dangerous precedent. The next stage expected in the trial of Loujain al-Hathloul and her co-defendants is the judge's response to their defence, which has already been submitted. Her brother said the family were deeply worried about what would happen next, partly due to the lack of transparency. He said his sister was bearing up despite everything, but that she was disheartened that the Saudi authorities had so far failed to investigate her complaints of torture.

"Mums-to-be could be routinely offered an ultrasound scan at 36 weeks to help spot risky breech deliveries, when a baby's bottom or feet will emerge first, say UK researchers. Breech births can be hazardous and tricky to diagnose. Currently, midwives and doctors tend to rely on the shape and feel of the mother's bump to check. Researchers estimate the scans would avoid 4,000 emergency caesareans and eight baby deaths a year in England. If the scans could be done cheaply enough then it should also save the NHS money in terms of care, says the University of Cambridge team in the journalPLoS Medicine,external. What is it like to have a home birth? Rise in women having induced labours About three to four babies in every 100 are in a breech position near the end of pregnancy. More babies start out breech but will turn to the ideal ""head-first"" position by about 36 weeks' gestation. The researchers offered breech scans to 3,879 pregnant women: 179 (4.6%) were found to be breech In more than half of these cases (96 of the pregnancies or 55%) there had been no suspicion until the scan result Making the diagnosis at 36 weeks meant the women could be offered an attempt at manually encouraging the baby to turn in the womb to the head-first position before labour - a manipulation method called external cephalic version. For the women who declined, or where it did not work, a planned caesarean section was arranged. None of the women opted to attempt a vaginal breech birth, which is possible but carries some risk. Nineteen of the 179 women were able to deliver vaginally, 110 had a planned caesarean and 50 needed an emergency caesarean. Researcher Prof Gordon Smith said it should be feasible to provide the service at a low cost, for example by making it a part of a standard midwife appointment and using inexpensive portable ultrasound machines. ""If it was under Â£20 per patient then it would be cost-effective and if it could be done for under Â£13 then it should save the NHS money in the long run,"" he said. Experts said the cost-effectiveness for the NHS should be explored. Private patients can pay from Â£30 to Â£200 or more,externalfor a pregnancy ultrasound scan. Prof Andrew Shennan, professor of obstetrics at King's College London, said the scans should be rolled out. ""Breech can be difficult to manage in labour if previously unsuspected, as labour can be quick,"" he said. ""Breech deliveries have some risk, and counselling and decision-making in labour can be challenging. Scans are routinely available now, and minimal skills are required to determine breech presentation. This should be implemented."" But Prof Jean Golding, emeritus professor of paediatric and perinatal epidemiology at the University of Bristol, disagrees. She said bigger, randomised trials were needed first. Prof Basky Thilaganathan, from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said more research was needed, but added: ""So far, the evidence for its use looks very promising.""

"Most of the civilian deaths in Yemen have been attributed to air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition US President Donald Trump has vetoed a bill passed by Congress to end support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Mr Trump described the resolution as an ""unnecessary"" and ""dangerous"" attempt to weaken his constitutional powers. It is only the second time Mr Trump has used his presidential veto since he took office in 2017. Opposition in Congress to his policy on Yemen grew last year after Saudi agents killed the journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The resolution passed the House of Representatives in April and the Senate in March, the first time both chambers had supported a War Powers resolution, which limits the president's ability to send troops into action. Why is there a war in Yemen? How my country has changed ""This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future,"" Mr Trump said in the veto message.

"This video can not be played Climate change protesters explain why they glued themselves to a lorry Nearly 300 climate change activists have been arrested after roads were blocked in central London, amid protests aimed at shutting the capital. A second day of disruption took place after Extinction Rebellion campaigners camped overnight at Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Oxford Circus. Up to 500,000 people were affected by the diversion of 55 bus routes. The Met said 290 people had been arrested.During protests in Edinburgh, 29 arrests were made. Organisers said protests had been held in more than 80 cities across 33 countries. In London, motorists face gridlocked traffic on a number of alternative routes, such as Westminster Bridge and Blackfriars Bridge. Transport for London warned bus users that routes would remain on diversion or terminate early. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said although he ""shared the passion"" of the activists, he was ""extremely concerned"" about plans some had to disrupt the Tube on Wednesday. ""Ongoing demonstrations are causing serious disruption to public transport, local businesses and Londoners who wish to go about their daily business,"" Ch Supt Colin Wingrove, of the Met, said. Police have arrested people on Waterloo Bridge Campaigners have been ordered to restrict their protests to Marble Arch after they causedwidespread disruption on Monday. That order will continue until 21:10 on Friday. Three men and two women, in their 40s and 50s, arrested on suspicion of criminal damage at Shell's headquarters in London on Monday, have since been released while inquiries continue. The majority of the other protesters detained have been held on suspicion of public order offences. Protesters formed a human blockade and resisted requests for them to disperse, police said Mr Khan said it was ""absolutely crucial"" to get more people to use public transport to tackle climate change, and urged the protesters not to disrupt the Tube. ""Targeting public transport in this way would only damage the cause of all of us who want to tackle climate change, as well as risking Londoners' safety, and I'd implore anyone considering doing so to think again,"" he said. Climate protesters block roads What is climate change? The protesters who want to get arrested But Extinction Rebellion has said it wanted to ""shut down London"" until 29 April. Itcalled for ""reinforcements"",externalto help maintain the roadblock at Waterloo Bridge. Demonstrators performed on Waterloo Bridge despite police warning that anyone refusing to move on would be arrested Hundreds of protesters tried to hinder the police effort to move them on, including four who glued and chained themselves under a lorry parked on the bridge. Ben Moss, 42, from Islington, north London, said he had glued himself to the bars of the lorry as ""personal action to the moral issue of the climate crisis and ecological collapse"". ""I'm doing this because I want the government to do something. I've got a week off work - if more is necessary I can make my excuses,"" he added. Four people glued and chained themselves to a lorry on Waterloo Bridge An order has restricted protesters to gathering in the area around Marble Arch On Monday, a pink boat was parked in the centre of Oxford Circus where some activists locked their arms together with makeshift devices, while oil company Shell's headquarters on Belvedere Road were vandalised. Since its launch last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament. It has three core demands: for the government to ""tell the truth about climate change"", reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025, and create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible. One of the group's founders, Roger Hallam, believes that mass participation and civil disobedience maximise the chances of social change. But critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched. The second day of action included speeches at Parliament Square about how to tackle climate change. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

By Shamaan Freeman-Powell, BBC News Oxford Street has been empty of traffic since activists parked a pink boat in Oxford Circus on Monday Oxford Circus is usually one of the busiest crossroads in London, but only scores of protesters and bemused onlookers can be found in the middle of the road today. Food stalls offering free porridge, and clothing lines for dirty laundry have been erected. Children as young as six are making use of the freshly-drawn hopscotch, running around the tents and flying colourful banners. One campaigner, who attended the protest with her two children, says she was protesting for the people who are ""the most vulnerable, and least responsible for climate change"". Her nine-year-old daughter says she wishes her school taught her more on the issue. Most protesters say the police have been encouraging - despite the number of arrests - although taxi drivers and shoppers complained of the disruption. The government said it shared ""people's passion"" to combat climate change and ""protect our planet for future generations"". The Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy said the UK had cut its emissions by 44% since 1990. A spokesman said: ""We've asked our independent climate experts for advice on a net zero emissions target and set out plans to transition to low emission vehicles and significantly reduce pollution through ourClean Air Strategy,external.""

"Researchers say Scotland could face a 5.5% loss of output A disorderly Brexit risks a deep recession in Scotland, according to researchers. The Fraser of Allander Institute (FAI), part of the University of Strathclyde, predicts a loss of more than one Â£1 in every Â£20 of output from the economy. It suggests the fall from peak to trough in the economy could be around 5.5% of total output, contracting for two whole years. This is in line with forecasts made by the Bank of England for the UK economy. The FAI modelled several possible Brexit outcomes and the impact in its latest economic commentary. This included scenarios of a no-deal Brexit with and without policy response. Despite the potential for loss, researchers expect the damage to be offset by action taken by governments and the Bank of England. And the FAI has set out a possible growth path for the Scottish economy which could see it outperform current estimates if Brexit is well-managed, business confidence returns and investment picks up. The central forecast for the economy is slightly weaker than the last such report from the economics institute. It predicts only 1.1% growth this year, followed by 1.4% next year and 1.5% the year after. Pelosi warns against weakening peace deal PM 'not pondering poll' on walking break Avoiding European polls a priority - Hunt While much economic attention has been focused on Brexit in recent months, the economists warn that major questions are being ignored or avoided by governments in Edinburgh and London. Reflecting on the difference made by the Scottish parliament 20 years after it was first elected, Wednesday's report says the weakest part of its performance has been ""the lack of evaluation and scrutiny of the effectiveness and value of policy initiatives"". It questions whether there has been any progress on a Whitehall initiative to find ways for governments and their agencies to work better together in the interests of the Scottish economy. It says there should be a renewed focus on sustainable growth, after most targets set by the incoming Scottish government in 2007 have been missed. The report says there is a need to address big structural changes coming to the economy, including demographic change, the scaling back of the oil and gas sector, automation and emerging economies around the world. Nicola Sturgeon will reiterate her concerns about Brexit in a speech to the STUC annual congress in Dundee on Wednesday afternoon At the same time, it says there should be an assumption that government budgets will remain tight, demand for the health service continues to grow, and little discussion takes place of the squeeze on public services that are not protected by having the high priority for the NHS and schools. The report calls for stronger cross-party co-operation in the Scottish Parliament, pointing to the impasse on Brexit in Westminster as the outcome of consensus policy-making breaking down. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will focus on Brexit when she speaks at the STUC conference in Dundee later, where she is expected to say nobody should pretend that the ""damage"" of Brexit can be fully mitigated, She will also warn that Brexit, in any form, will harm living standards and risk jobs. Anextension to Article 50 was granted earlier this month, meaning the UK will not leave the EU until 31 October unless Prime Minister Theresa May can get her withdrawal deal - which has been rejected three times by MPs - agreed in Parliament before then. The UK government has been holding talks with Labour in a bid to break the deadlock, with Mrs May saying she still wants the country to leave before 22 May to avoid European elections being held the next day. Is there time for another Brexit vote? How UK is gearing up for European elections UK MEPs could sit for 'months or longer' Mrs May has pledged to pursue an ""orderly"" Brexit while acknowledging that ""the whole country is intensely frustrated that this process of leaving the European Union has not been completed."" Meanwhile, the government is continuing to make plans for the UK leaving without a deal. Graeme Roy, director of the Fraser of Allander Institute, said that last week's delay in the deadline for Brexit only ""kicked the can down the road"", with little evidence so far of UK policy makers being able to agree a compromise approach. The risks to the economy therefore remain high. He added: ""Brexit should not be the only focus of attention. One consequence of the Brexit debate is that it has left little room for discussion of the emerging structural challenges and opportunities our economy is facing."" John Macintosh, tax partner at Deloitte, the accountancy firm that sponsors the regular Allander economic commentary, said the latest report underlined strong employment figures, but there is a pressing need to encourage investment and to improve productivity"". He called on business to ""think differently, adopting a more ambitious and medium-term outlook by investing in innovative and collaborative strategies as well as talent"".

"This video can not be played The Edinburgh couple who are part of a kidney transplant chain When Mandy Murray found out she needed a new kidney her husband Graham volunteered to be a donor but was told he was not a match. Instead the couple became part of a kidney swap chain, which is allowing more people to find live donors. Mandy first needed a kidney transplant about 19 years ago. Because her husband was not compatible, Mandy had to wait until a suitable donation became available from a deceased donor. She considers herself lucky to have got a phone call in the middle of the night and been rushed to hospital to receive the donor kidney. Many people are not so fortunate. Last year, 26 people in Scotland died while waiting for a kidney transplant. Mandy Graham had a kidney transplant from a deceased donor 19 years ago When a person needs a new kidney they first turn to family and friends to find a living donor. Doctors says patients who have a living kidney transplant tend to live longer and feel better than those who receive kidneys from a deceased donor. Mandy's new kidney allowed her to function for 18 years but it has recently started to decline and she was told she would need another transplant. Her husband Graham was tested again but was still not a match. Mandy's husband Graham was not a potential donor match for his wife However, Mandy's consultant told her about theUK Living Kidney Sharing Scheme,,externalwhich has been running for more than a decade. ""It is where couples like us can be paired up and help each other out,"" says Mandy. ""My brilliant husband didn't hesitate for a moment. ""I tried desperately to talk him out of it but he was having none of it."" The kidney sharing scheme uses an algorithm designed at Glasgow University. It goes through everyone who has volunteered and tries to find better matches and maximise the number of possible transplants. The computer programme is run four times a year and the transplants are then scheduled by a dedicated coordinator. Sarah Lundie is one of the donor scheme coordinators It is a logistical challenge, according to Sarah Lundie, the coordinator at Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary. In order for even the simplest kidney swap to go ahead you need two healthy donors and two recipients who are also not suffering from any illnesses. If any one of them gets so much as a cold, the whole carefully arranged schedule must be cancelled. Ms Lundie must also make sure that there are operating theatres booked at both locations and four surgeons must be available to carry out the procedures, not to mention their extensive back-up teams. There is also a great deal of liaison going on to ensure that the organs are transported from the donors to the recipients at the same time. Graham and Mandy said it was a relief to get to the day of the operation As he sat in Edinburgh waiting to donate his kidney, Graham Murray, 53, was aware that there was someone in Belfast, who must remain anonymous, waiting to give up a kidney so that it could be donated to Mandy. Graham says: ""Getting to this morning with everyone fit and healthy and ready to go is a great relief."" His wife Mandy, 57, says they have felt the ""responsibility"" of keeping well in the weeks before the operations so that the donor sharing chain would not be broken. She says: ""Graham and I decided to sequester ourselves in our house, get our shopping delivered and really try not to catch anything so we could make sure that bond could be maintained."" Graham and his counterpart in Belfast are the first part of the surgical equation. Both donor kidneys are removed simultaneously in the two locations. In Edinburgh, consultant transplant surgeon John Terrace scrubs up for an operation he says usually takes about three hours. Mr John Terrace, consultant transplant surgeon, RIE ""I'm thinking about the donor rather than the recipient,"" he says. ""The focus with donors is operating safely and meticulously. The risk to donors is actually very small."" Mr Terrace says he uses a modified form of keyhole surgery to remove the kidney. Mr Terrace uses a modified form of keyhole surgery He uses laparoscopy to see but also has his hand inside the patient. ""That offers an extra element of control and safety,"" Mr Terrace says. ""The first 80% is moving things out of the way, moving the liver and the bowel and identifying the kidney and the structures that go into it and come out - the vein, the artery and ureter."" He says these are then prepared so the kidney can be removed quickly but still be suitable for ""reimplantation"" into the recipient. Once the kidney is removed it is quickly on its way. In this case, the organs leave Edinburgh and Belfast on chartered flights, arriving in time for the donation surgery to happen in the afternoon. Consultant transplant surgeon Sorina Cornateanu performed Mandy's operation Mandy's kidney surgery is performed by consultant Sorina Cornateanu. She uses blood vessels going to the leg to help attach the new kidney. Then the blood supply is returned and the kidney turns pink and perfused. Often the kidney passes urine on the operating table. Ms Cornateanu said the shared donor scheme had been a big success The surgery takes about three hours and the patient is immediately started on anti-rejection drugs and goes into a high-dependency unit. After successfully operating on Mandy, Ms Cornateanu describes her team as the ""vehicles"" between the donor and the recipient. ""That's our role. It is fulfilling, rewarding, humbling and it is a big relief at this stage."" Ms Cornateanu said the shared donor scheme had been a big success and even in the past year the number of live donor transplants had risen in Edinburgh by half to 14. ""It has been a big team effort from all of us and we need to sustain that. That's the challenge."" Across Scotland, 50 kidney sharing scheme transplants have taken place in the past five years. It is more common for living donor transplants to involve a relative or friend who is a close match but this is not always possible. Another form of living donation is ""altruistic"". Over the past 10 years, 78 people in Scotland have donated a kidney to a stranger. The day after their operations, Mandy and Graham were told the other donor and recipient in the chain were doing well. Graham said: ""That's fantastic. We never expected to know."" ""I'm so pleased,"" said Mandy. The pair hope they will soon be recovered enough to fulfil all the plans they have had to put on hold until now.

"This video can not be played A look inside fire-ravaged Notre-Dame cathedral French President Emmanuel Macron says Notre-Dame cathedral will be rebuilt ""even more beautifully"" - and that he wants the work done within five years. A massive fire on Monday ravaged the 850-year-old Gothic building, destroying much of its roof and causing its steeple to collapse. The cathedral was minutes away from total destruction, officials say. But despite Mr Macron's pledge experts say its reconstruction could take decades. Fifty people will investigate the cause of the fire. Paris public prosecutor RÃ©my Heitz said there was no obvious indication of arson and that the blaze was being treated as an accident. A combined â¬800m ($902m; Â£692m) has already been pledged by a number of companies and business tycoons to help rebuild the Unesco World Heritage site. In a televised address on Tuesday evening, President Macron suggested he wants it rebuilt by the time Paris hosts the Summer Olympics in 2024. ""We'll rebuild Notre-Dame even more beautifully and I want it to be completed in five years, we can do it,"" said Mr Macron, who had already pledged to launch an international fundraising scheme for the reconstruction. The story of the fire in graphics Why blaze was difficult to tackle How will cathedral be restored? ""It's up to us to convert this disaster into an opportunity to come together... It's up to us to find the thread of our national project."" But Eric Fischer, head of the foundation in charge of restoring the 1,000-year-old Strasbourg cathedral, told AFP the Notre-Dame may take ""decades"" to rebuild. FrÃ©dÃ©ric LÃ©toffÃ©, the head of the group of companies for the Restoration of Historic Monuments, put the timescale at between 10 and 15 years, warning substantial work would be needed to secure the site before restoration can begin. This video can not be played 'I was playing at mass when the fire broke' The blaze - which was discovered at 18:43 (16:43 GMT) on Monday and was fully extinguished almost 15 hours later - destroyed most of the cathedral's roof and led to the collapse of its iconic spire. Experts have not yet been allowed on site to assess the damage and firefighters have sent a drone to survey the scale of the destruction. The cathedral's spire, before, during the fire and after Photos appear to show that at least one of the famed rose windows has survived but there are concerns for some of the other stained-glass windows. The 18th Century organ has not been burned but it is not clear whether it is damaged. It was still too early to estimate the cost of the damage, said the Fondation du Patrimoine, an independent non-profit heritage group. The treasures of Notre-Dame The grief that comes from lost buildings Images show damage to cathedral's interior Deputy Interior Minister Laurent NuÃ±ez said the structure was in good condition ""overall"" but that ""some vulnerabilities"" had been identified in the stone vaults and the remainder of the ceiling. The main structure, including the two bell towers, was saved in a time window of 15 to 30 minutes by a team of 400 firefighters, he said. In his speech Mr Macron heaped praise on the fire services, saying they took ""extreme risks"" to tackle the blaze. By Patrick Jackson, BBC News, Paris They sit or stand in a crowd, many of them young people, spilling over the end of the Boulevard Saint Michel, this first evening after the fire, singing hymns. On a table beneath the towering sculpture of Saint Michael stands a statue of Our Lady - Notre Dame. ""As a French Catholic,"" says Ãloi, 22, ""I felt really bad after the fire so I see this vigil as a way to say that even if the flames destroyed the cathedral, we can rebuild it because the Church is made not of stones but is a living body."" He believes the cathedral should be remade just the way it was, as a ""prayer to God"". ""We are Catholics,"" he adds, ""but all French people - Catholics, Muslims, atheists - are united around this disaster and in the hope it will be rebuilt."" And they are united in pride in the fire brigade. During the concert, an engine hurtles past on the road, and the singing stops as the crowd claps and cheers. Investigators trying to establish the cause of the fire have begun questioning workers from five companies involved in the extensive renovations that were under way at the cathedral. Officials believe the works could be linked to the disaster. ""Nothing indicates this was a deliberate act,"" said public prosecutor RÃ©my Heitz, adding that he expected to be a ""long and complex"" case. Offers of help to rebuild the cathedral have come from several world leaders, groups and individuals, including: Billionaire FranÃ§ois-Henri Pinault, chairman and CEO of the Kering group that owns the Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent fashion brands, who pledged â¬100m Bernard Arnault's family and their company LVMH, a business empire which includes Louis Vuitton and Sephora, who pledged â¬200m French cosmetics giant L'Oreal and its founding Bettencourt family promised to give â¬200m while oil giant Total pledged â¬100m Culture Minister Franck Riester said some of the artwork and religious items rescued would be sent to the Louvre museum where they would be kept and eventually restored. They include what is said to be the crown of thorns worn by Jesus before his crucifixion and a tunic King Louis IX is said to have worn when he brought the crown to Paris. The cathedral's paintings would be removed from Friday, Mr Riester said. How will Notre-Dame cathedral be restored?

She admitted that she was unsure whether they were father and daughter, saying it was ""simply the dynamic I observed from them while debating on interrupting this moment"". She called on Twitter users to ""step up"" and help her find them. Flames and smoke are seen billowing from the roof at Notre-Dame ""If it were me, I'd want the memory.

"Extinction Rebellion's attempts to clog the heart of London and other cities across the UK have undoubtedly driven the issue of climate change up the news agenda. But amid the die-ins - where protestors pretend to be dead - bridge swarmings and arrests, there hasn't been too much consideration of the group's actual plans to tackle rising temperatures. As a solution to the ""climate breakdown and ecological collapse that threaten our existence"", Extinction Rebellion is proposing three key steps. The government must, in their words, ""tell the truth"" about the scale of the crisis the world now faces. Secondly, the UK must enact legally binding policies to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2025. The third step is the formation of a Citizens' Assembly to ""oversee the changes"" that will be needed to achieve this goal. This video can not be played Extinction Rebellion's fight against climate change is making headlines Getting to net zero carbon emissions in the UK by 2025 would be an extremely difficult target, given that, right now, thegovernment is mulling a plan to commit to net zero by 2050. Consider the changes that would be needed to get to net zero in just six years. Gas boilers across the UK would have to be replaced with electricity, and you'd need to massively ramp up renewable energy, on a scale not yet seen, to meet this extra demand. Researchers atZero Carbon Britain,externalsuggested that if the UK wanted to get to net zero by 2030, Britain would need to get about 130 gigawatts of electricity from wind, meaning around 13,000 extra wind turbines off shore. This would take up an area twice the size of Wales. The UK would also need about 7 gigwatts of onshore wind, meaning another 3,500 turbines. There would also have to be significant dietary changes, with people cutting back on meat and dairy. Flying would have to be restricted. Severely. ""You could have an air flight every couple of years, but we can't allow the world to continue flying for hen parties in New York every couple of weeks,"" said Paul Allen who co-ordinates the Zero Carbon Britain research project. ""The numbers don't stack up. We can't do this, we have to be honest with ourselves."" Achieving net zero five years earlier than the Zero Carbon Britain plan would be an unprecedented challenge, akin to a wartime situation. It would not be impossible but it would depend on a fierce political commitment. ""The honest answer about whether you can hit net zero by 2025 is that until you go for it, nobody knows if you'll get there,"" said Andrew Simms from the Rapid Transition Alliance, which promotessolutions to climate change that could transform the world over the next 12 years. ""We tend to forget what can be achieved in really compressed periods of time when the whole of industry and the whole of government put their minds to it. ""It's like the speed with which we responded to the financial crisis in 2008. ""If we treated the wellbeing of the biosphere with the same integrity and seriousness with which we treated the integrity of the banking system you would rapidly see the alignment of resources and planning that would achieve these kind of goals."" Those involved with Extinction Rebellion say that the nature of the climate crisis is such that even large-scale carbon cutting plans just won't be enough. ""This is not the time to be realistic, this is the time for humanity to completely change course,"" said Dr Gail Bradbrook, a co-founder of the organisation. ""This is not about fiddling around the edges, and adding a few solar panels to a few roofs; we have left it so late that we have to step up in a semi-miraculous way to deal with this situation."" Extinction Rebellion says that the key elements of their plan to get the UK to net zero will be set by a Citizens Assembly, composed of people representatively selected from across Britain. ""Let's have people decide what matters most to them, is it the health and safety and the ability to feed their own kids or does it matter to them that they carry on having holidays and meat?"" ""We need Joe the bus driver and Frances the hairdresser to get their heads around it,"" said Dr Bradbrook. Supporters of this approach point to Ireland as a country that has embraced theCitizens Assembly,externalidea to tackle difficult societal questions. The Assembly considered the question of Ireland's restrictions on abortion and suggested that a referendum be held to remove the ban. Thesignificant majoritythat supported repeal indicated that Assembly was an accurate barometer of public opinion. On climate change, Ireland's Assembly has also been an advocate of strong action, with big majorities favouring higher taxes on carbon-intensive activities among a number of recommendations. Protestors in the Netherlands pretend to be dead during a climate protest This in turn gave real political impetus to the establishment of a parliamentary committee on climate action. ""This led this committee to issue what is the strongest cross-party political statement of intent on climate action,"" said John Gibbons, an Irish environmental writer and commentator. ""It certainly has its weaknesses, but Ireland is, in the Taoiseach's own words, an international laggard on tackling climate change, so this report is a good deal better than expected."" Mr Gibbons points out that despite the actions of the Citizens Assembly and politicians, the country is way off target when it comes to cutting carbon. ""Huge compliance penalties are due to kick in post-2020, making ongoing inaction expensive as well as embarrassing for Ireland,"" he says. The government has to upholdUK law on climate change,external, that mandates a series of emissions cuts over time. Extinction Rebellion believes that many politicians want to go much further. They say that political forces are happy to see their protestors on the streets, disrupting traffic and transport. It believes the group is creating the space for a joined-up approach among politicians that has been absent until now. ""We've just got to get away from these left-right political fights - this is beyond that. I want to see people sitting in a room and bringing the solutions and being real together and saying how do we get out of this?"" said Gail Bradbrook. ""It'll bring the best out of ourselves through that process.""

"Activists protest against the arrests at the Saudi embassy in Paris A court in Saudi Arabia has postponed a hearing in the trial of several of the country's most prominent women's rights activists, officials say. Some relatives were told that the judge had delayed the session for ""private reasons"", Reuters news agency said. The women were arrested last May and charged with offences including spying. They had been campaigning for an end to the country's male guardianship system and for the right to drive, before the ban was lifted last June. Since then, horrific details have emerged of their alleged mistreatment at the hands of the Saudi authorities. On Tuesday, Walid al-Hathloul, the brother of one of the best-known activists, Loujain al-Hathloul, told the BBC his sister was so traumatised by what had happened to her that she wanted to remain in jail, afraid of how her reputation had been unfairly smeared in her absence. Loujain al-Hathloul's brother tells the BBC that she was tortured in prison in Jeddah He said that following her arrest Ms Hathloul had been taken to a secret detention facility near the maximum security prison of Dhahban in Jeddah. There, she told her family, she was taken down to a basement and subjected to waterboarding and electrocution. He named Saud al-Qahtani, a close confidant of the Saudi Crown Prince, as the man who oversaw her torture, allegedly laughing as he threatened to have her raped and murdered. In February, a group of British MPs carried out an investigation, supported by a number of international human rights organisations, into the allegations of mistreatment of Ms Hathloul and other female activists. They concluded that the allegations were credible. In March the UN's Human Rights Council called for their release and more than 30 countries, including all 28 EU members, signed a statement condemning their prolonged detention. The Saudi government says the detained women enjoy all the rights afforded to them under Saudi law. But Mr Hathloul said everything about his sister's arrest and detention had been shrouded in secrecy and that the entire judicial process lacked transparency. It was not until November 2018, he said, six months after her arrest, that the family even learned what she was accused of. Saudi Arabia's enduring male guardianship system 'Why I fled Saudi Arabia and sought asylum in the UK' Saudi Arabia puts women's rights activists on trial The accusations, he said, included ""applying for a job at the UN and being in contact with human rights organisations"". He added that the prosecution had not produced any evidence to support its allegation of spying. While Saudi Arabia rejects all criticism of its judicial system, insisting it is based on Sharia (Islamic law), in practice it has always been opaque, with arbitrary judgements often handed down at the whim of a judge. This case has attracted particularly widespread international condemnation and is seen as further damaging the reputation of Saudi Arabia's controversial Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, known as MBS. Mohammed Bin Salman was once hailed as a reformer in the west - but is accused of suppressing dissenters Initially courted in the West as an enlightened reformer who reintroduced cinemas and public entertainment to the conservative kingdom, MBS remains under suspicion for his alleged involvement in last October's murder of the journalist Jamal al-Khashoggi, which his government denies. Commentators have explained the apparent paradox between the accelerated crackdown on human rights and the crown prince's simultaneous liberalisation of Saudi society as being the ruling family's determination to steer reforms at their pace, rather than at the one demanded by peaceful protesters. This, in a country where all political parties are banned, would be seen as a dangerous precedent. The next stage expected in the trial of Loujain al-Hathloul and her co-defendants is the judge's response to their defence, which has already been submitted. Her brother said the family were deeply worried about what would happen next, partly due to the lack of transparency. He said his sister was bearing up despite everything, but that she was disheartened that the Saudi authorities had so far failed to investigate her complaints of torture.

"Mums-to-be could be routinely offered an ultrasound scan at 36 weeks to help spot risky breech deliveries, when a baby's bottom or feet will emerge first, say UK researchers. Breech births can be hazardous and tricky to diagnose. Currently, midwives and doctors tend to rely on the shape and feel of the mother's bump to check. Researchers estimate the scans would avoid 4,000 emergency caesareans and eight baby deaths a year in England. If the scans could be done cheaply enough then it should also save the NHS money in terms of care, says the University of Cambridge team in the journalPLoS Medicine,external. What is it like to have a home birth? Rise in women having induced labours About three to four babies in every 100 are in a breech position near the end of pregnancy. More babies start out breech but will turn to the ideal ""head-first"" position by about 36 weeks' gestation. The researchers offered breech scans to 3,879 pregnant women: 179 (4.6%) were found to be breech In more than half of these cases (96 of the pregnancies or 55%) there had been no suspicion until the scan result Making the diagnosis at 36 weeks meant the women could be offered an attempt at manually encouraging the baby to turn in the womb to the head-first position before labour - a manipulation method called external cephalic version. For the women who declined, or where it did not work, a planned caesarean section was arranged. None of the women opted to attempt a vaginal breech birth, which is possible but carries some risk. Nineteen of the 179 women were able to deliver vaginally, 110 had a planned caesarean and 50 needed an emergency caesarean. Researcher Prof Gordon Smith said it should be feasible to provide the service at a low cost, for example by making it a part of a standard midwife appointment and using inexpensive portable ultrasound machines. ""If it was under Â£20 per patient then it would be cost-effective and if it could be done for under Â£13 then it should save the NHS money in the long run,"" he said. Experts said the cost-effectiveness for the NHS should be explored. Private patients can pay from Â£30 to Â£200 or more,externalfor a pregnancy ultrasound scan. Prof Andrew Shennan, professor of obstetrics at King's College London, said the scans should be rolled out. ""Breech can be difficult to manage in labour if previously unsuspected, as labour can be quick,"" he said. ""Breech deliveries have some risk, and counselling and decision-making in labour can be challenging. Scans are routinely available now, and minimal skills are required to determine breech presentation. This should be implemented."" But Prof Jean Golding, emeritus professor of paediatric and perinatal epidemiology at the University of Bristol, disagrees. She said bigger, randomised trials were needed first. Prof Basky Thilaganathan, from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said more research was needed, but added: ""So far, the evidence for its use looks very promising.""

"The judge was told he would have to sit as a juror A senior judge has revealed he was excused from jury service, because he was due to preside over the case in question. Keith Cutler, the resident judge of Winchester and Salisbury, said he was surprised when he got the call up. But his reason for not doing his duty was initially rejected when he contacted the Jury Central Summoning Bureau directly to explain. Judge Cutler said the bureau realised its mistake when he called them back. The judge, who served as the coroner for the inquest of Mark Duggan, said he would have happily served as a juror if it had been appropriate. He told a jury: ""I was selected for jury service here at Salisbury Crown Court for a trial starting 23 April. ""I told the Jury Central Summoning Bureau that I thought I would be inappropriate seeing I happened to be the judge and knew all the papers. ""They wrote back to me, they picked up on the fact I was the judge but said 'your appeal for refusal has been rejected but you could apply to the resident judge' but I told them 'I am the resident judge'. ""I had to phone them up and they realised it was a mistake."" The judge added: ""I would have liked to have done the jury service to see what it was like and whether I would have liked the judge."" A guide to jury summons issued by the Ministry of Justice states: ""The normal expectation is that everyone summoned for jury service will serve at the time for which they are summoned. ""However, it is recognised that there will be occasions when it is not reasonable for a person to serve at the time for which they are summoned.""

"Jack Dorsey answered questions at TED on problems with his platform Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has again admitted there is much work to do to improve Twitter and cut down on the amount of abuse and misinformation on the platform. He said the firm might demote likes and follows, adding that in hindsight he would not have designed the platform to highlight these. He said that Twitter currently incentivised people ""to post outrage"". Instead he said it should invite people to unite around topics and communities. ""It may be best if it becomes an interest-based network,"" he told TED curators Chris Anderson and Whitney Pennington Rodgers. Rather than focus on following individual accounts, users could be encouraged to follow hashtags, trends and communities. Doing so would require a systematic change that represented a ""huge shift"" for Twitter. On the topic of abuse, he admitted that it was happening ""at scale"". Chris Anderson asked Mr Dorsey why he seemed to lack urgency in dealing with the problems on Twitter ""We've seen harassment, manipulation, misinformation which are dynamics we did not expect 13 years ago when we founded the company,"" he told TED curator Chris Anderson. ""What worries me is how we address them in a systematic way."" He has previously discussed the role played by likes and follows, which were designed to be prominent. ""One of the choices we made was to make the number of people that follow you big and bold. If I started Twitter now I would not emphasise follows and I would not create likes. ""We have to look at how we display follows and likes,"" he added. Ms Pennington Rodgers asked him why, according to Amnesty, women of colour on average received abuse in one of 10 tweets they posted. ""It's a pretty terrible situation,"" Mr Dorsey admitted. ""The dynamics of the system makes it super-easy to harass others."" He said that Twitter was increasingly using machine-learning to spot abuse and claimed that 38% of abusive tweets were now identified by algorithms and then highlighted to humans, who decide whether to remove them from the platform. He also said that the firm was working on making it easier to find its policies on abuse and was simplifying them. Asked if he would show urgency in dealing with the issues, he replied simply: ""Yes."" The TED audience were invited to contribute to the conversation via the hashtag #askJackatTED, which received more than 1,000 questions within 10 minutes of the talk starting. One of the questions came from journalist Carole Cadwalladr who spoke at TED on Monday and called on the tech firms, including Twitter, to directly address the issue of misinformation being shared widely on their platforms. But in her question to Mr Dorsey, she turned her attention to abuse she has received on Twitter. ""I'd like to know why a video that showed me being beaten up and threatened with a gun to soundtrack of Russian anthem stayed up for 72 hours despite 1000s of complaints?"" she wrote. Mr Dorsey did not address that question and neither did he answer another one about how to deal with the huge number of malicious bots posting misinformation. He was also shown a graph created by Zignal Labs which showed the number of human tweets versus tweets from suspected bots talking about topics in the recent election campaign in Israel. Bots seemed to dominate when it came to tweets about contender Benny Gantz, who was narrowly defeated by Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr Dorsey was asked about this but did not answer. Instead he said that the company was in the middle of measuring the ""conversational health"" of the platform, using a number of metrics, including how toxic conversations were and how much people are exposed to a variety of opinions. ""We have to create a healthy contribution to the network and a healthy conversation. On Twitter right now you don't necessarily walk away feeling you learned something.""
