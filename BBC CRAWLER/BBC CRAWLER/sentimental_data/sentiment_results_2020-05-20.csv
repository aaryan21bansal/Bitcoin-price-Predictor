"The families of overseas NHS support staff and care workers who have died with coronavirus can stay in the UK permanently. The Home Office bereavement scheme had previously only applied to certain professions, such as nurses. Home Secretary Priti Patel has extended it to cover cleaners, porters and other low-paid roles after pressure from Labour and the unions. But a free visa extension scheme still does not apply to support staff. The offer of indefinite leave to remain for bereaved families of support staff will be effective immediately and retrospectively, the Home Office said. Ms Patel said: ""Every death in this crisis is a tragedy, and sadly some NHS support staff and social care workers have made the ultimate sacrifice in the pursuit of saving the lives of others. ""When I announced the introduction of the bereavement scheme in April, I said we would continue to work across government to look at ways to offer further support. ""Today we are extending the scheme to NHS support staff and social care workers."" The announcement was welcomed as ""very good news"" by Labour's Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee. She said her committee had been ""pushing on this for weeks"",adding on Twitter,externalthat it would be ""unthinkable to ask family who lost a loved one on the UK Covid social care frontline to leave their home & UK"". But she said the government now needed to expand free visa extensions to cover care workers, NHS porters and care workers too. More visa extensions urged for foreign key workers In March, the Home Office brought in a one-year free visa extension for some staff in the NHS and care sectors. The list was initially limited to NHS doctors, nurses and paramedics. For those eligible, the extension covers visas which expire between 31 March and 1 October 2020. Last month, Priti Patel extended the scheme to more NHS staff, including radiographers and social workers, and said some social care staff would also benefit. But the list does not include jobs like porters and cleaners. Prime Minister Boris Johnsonhas also rejected callsfrom Labour and the SNP to scrap the fees overseas health workers have to pay to use the NHS. The health immigration surcharge on non-EU migrants is Â£400 per year and is set to rise to Â£624 in October - but the opposition says health workers should be exempt from it. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said he understood the ""difficulties"" NHS staff faced but the country could not afford to scrap the charges in the current economic climate. This video can not be played Hassan Akkad explains the video which caused a government U-turn Syrian refugee Hassan Akkad is a documentary maker, but he also works for the NHS as a cleaner on a Covid-19 ward. He shareda video on social media on Wednesday,external, directed to the prime minister, saying he felt ""betrayed"" and ""stabbed in the back"" that he and his colleagues weren't included in the bereavement scheme. Speaking to BBC Radio 4, he said: ""I spend my day with cleaners and porters and social care workers. We work together, we go on lunch breaks together, and I see the bravery in their faces and how much they risk to continue doing these jobs, despite being on minimum wage."" He said the change in policy ""tells you where the public is"" with its support for migrant NHS workers of all types. But he now wants the government to look again at other policies that affect him and his colleagues, such asthe health immigration surcharge- which he would have to work 10 days to cover with his wages. ""We're doing these jobs despite the risk of it,"" he said. ""So for us to be charged to access the very same institution, it just doesn't make sense."" Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: ""NHS staff like porters and cleaners, and social care staff, should never have been excluded from the bereavement scheme in the first place. ""Now the government also has to change its stance on charging NHS and care staff from overseas to use our NHS. This hypocrisy must end."" The GMB union said it was ""great"" that its pressure had ""forced the Home Office to back track"" on offering the right to remain to all bereaved families of NHS and care workers. But union organiser Lola McEvoy urged the home secretary to ensure the scheme covered all frontline roles, including part-time workers, in the same way that temporary coronavirus death-in-service benefits launched last month do. ""Not only is it the right thing to do, it's also an acceptance that regardless who you work for, where you were born or how much you're paid - if you have fought frontline during this pandemic - you and your family will be supported and treated the same.""

"The work was set for pupils in Years 7,8 and 9 A head teacher says he is ""sorry"" if homework asking pupils to define types of hardcore pornography led them to undertake inappropriate web searches. The work was given to children, aged 11 to 14, at Archbishop Sentamu Academy in Hull, theHull Daily Mail,externalreported. Principal Chay Bell stressed the assignment did not require internet research as the answers were in the material the pupils were sent. Leon Dagon was ""flabbergasted"" when he saw his 13-year-old sister's homework. The work is part of pupils' Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) learning, the school said. The students were asked to ""define"" topics including hardcore pornography, soft pornography as well as female genital mutilation and breast ironing. Leon Dagon said his 13-year-old sister was too young to be learning about such topics They were also asked questions about alcohol, drugs and smoking, as part of the homework. Mr Dagon, who took to Facebook to share his concerns, said: ""My little sister knows make-up and TikTok at the age of 13. She doesn't know about hardcore porn, and then asking her to define it. ""The majority of children nowadays will now go on the internet to help them with their homework and if you type that kind of thing on the internet, God knows what's going to pop up."" The academy's principal said he would ensure all future material was age-appropriate Mr Bell said: ""I am genuinely sorry if parents or students have unnecessarily researched any of these phrases and for any offence caused by this mistake."" He said students ""were not directed to research these topics themselves on the internet because all the answers to the questions posed are contained in the teacher-produced materials we shared"". The work was in line with government guidance, but he added: ""I have asked that no future PSHE materials contain any potentially sensitive content and will ensure all materials are fully age-appropriate."" A spokesman for the Department for Education said it was a matter for the school and had no further comment to make.

"This video can not be played Aya Hachem, 19, was shot in the chest near a supermarket The father of a woman who was shot dead in the street hoped his family would be safe in the UK after they fled Lebanon. Law student Aya Hachem, 19, wasshot from a passing car in a case of mistaken identity, in the town's King Street on Sunday. Her father Ismail told BBC Asian Network his dreams have been destroyed in the wake of her death. Two more people have been detained in connection with the investigation, bringing the number of arrests to 11. Eight people have been arrested on suspicion of murder while a further three suspects have been held on suspicion of assisting an offender. Police have been given more time to question the first three men who were arrested on Monday. The suspects, who are aged 19 to 39, remain in police custody. Ms Hachem was walking towards Lidl at about 15:00 BST when she was hit by one of several shots fired from a car. Deputy Chief Constable Terry Woods, of Lancashire Police, said the ""completely innocent"" law student had not been the intended target. Mr Hachem said he repeatedly tried to call his eldest daughter - who with her family had been living in the UK for a decade - when she did not return home from the supermarket. His wife later told him ""my heart is saying go check on Aya"", he told the BBC. Her parents said she was the ""most loyal devoted daughter"" who ""dreamed of becoming a solicitor"" During his search to find his daughter, Mr Hachem discovered King Street had been cordoned off. He was unaware that this was the scene of his daughter's death until the police arrived at his home later that day. ""I start crying... cause all my dreams, Aya,"" he said. ""I think I would be safe here... in this small town. No big problems."" Police believe this Toyota Avensis was used The Lebanese-born teenager - a second year student at the University of Salford - was a young trustee for the Children's Society. The charity's chief executive Mark Russell said: ""She was bright, passionate, hard-working, ambitious. ""It's a complete tragedy that her life has been cut short."" Her former head teacher described as a ""wonderful young lady who had so much to offer"". Diane Atkinson, executive head of Blackburn Central High School, said: ""She fled a war-torn zone as a refugee and came to the UK looking for a better life. Ms Hachem arrived at the school as a 12-year-old ""with very little English"" but ""picked it up very quickly"". She was a ""very intelligent young lady"" who had ""great aspirations to help other people"" and ""worked incredibly hard to become the very, very best person she could be"", Ms Atkinson said. A Toyota Avensis, believed to have been used in the shooting, was later found abandoned in Wellington Road.

"This video can not be played Johnson: ""Test, track and trace system in place in the UK by June 1"" The PM says England will have a ""world-beating"" tracing system from June, as he was accused of leaving a ""huge hole"" in the country's coronavirus defences. Boris Johnson said 25,000 contact tracers, able to track 10,000 new cases a day, would be in place by 1 June. BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said it was unlikely to be a ""fully-functioning perfect system"" by then. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer challenged the PM over the absence of a tracing system since March. Contact tracing is a system used to slow the spread of infectious diseases like coronavirus, and is already being used in Hong Kong, Singapore and Germany. One method involves the infected person listing all the people with whom they have had prolonged and recent contact, to be tracked down by phone or email. Another uses a location-tracking mobile app, which identifies people the patient has been in contact with. The NHS contact tracing app - which iscurrently being trialled on the Isle of Wightand was initially meant to be launched across England in mid-May - will be rolled out at a later date, No 10 suggested. Northern Irelandalready has a telephone contact tracing systemin place, whilethe Scottish government is currently triallingone.The Welsh government wants its ""test, trace, protect""programme operational by the end of May. It comes as the number of people who died after testing positive for the virus increased by 363 to 35,704, the government said on Wednesday. How does contact tracing work? Multiple security flaws found in NHS virus app Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir asked why there had been ""no effective"" attempt to trace the contacts of those infected with Covid-19 since 12 March ""when tracing was abandoned"". Mr Johnson replied: ""We have growing confidence that we will have a test, track and trace operation that will be world-beating and yes, it will be in place by June 1."" He added that 24,000 contact tracers had already been recruited. The 1 June deadline will also mark the earliest possible date for the gradual reopening of schools and non-essential shops in England. The government's deputy chief scientific adviser Prof Dame Angela McLean previously said an effective system for tracing new coronavirus cases needed to be in place before lockdown restrictions could be changed. Do not expect a fully-functioning perfect track-and-trace system to be up-and-running by 1 June. What will be launched will effectively be a prototype. The app may not be ready by that point, but the army of contract tracers will be available. Given where we are today (and plenty argue mistakes have been made, which means we are in a weaker position than we should be) this is perhaps understandable. The government does not have the luxury of testing and piloting this behind the scenes for months to come. So, the system will have to evolve as it goes. The question is whether it will be robust enough to provide a track-and-trace service that will work on a basic level and help contain local outbreaks, which of course is vital as we gradually move out of lockdown. The prime minister's assertion that it will be able to deal with 10,000 new cases a day is interesting. It sounds a lot. The daily figures suggest there are only a few thousand positive cases a day. But remember those figures have not been capturing all the infections - until this week when testing was extended to all over-fives eligibility was quite restricted. However, surveillance data provided by the Office for National Statistics suggests we may well be seeing around that number. The work that has been done so far is about to be put to the test. LOUIS THEROUX:The 15 songs getting him through lockdown FAKE-AWAY:The best fast food recipes you can make at home The PM also insisted that the UK was now testing more than ""virtually every country in Europe"", and promised that the system would be stepped up in the next fortnight. Leading scientist Prof Hugh Pennington said the pledge was ""good news"" as it was ""essential if we're going to go anywhere near getting out of lockdown, opening schools"". ""It's taken a long time. As to world-beating, well we've been beaten by quite a few other countries by having such a system running."" He added that contact tracing was ""really very labour-intensive work"". This video can not be played The PM promised 200,000 tests in the UK, after he was challenged by Sir Keir Starmer over care home testing. Also at PMQs, Sir Keir queried whether people were being tested in care homes, after the boss of a body representing care homes in England said on Tuesday thatthere were problems. Mr Johnson said 125,000 care home staff have been tested and that the government was ""absolutely confident"" it would be able to increase testing in care homes and ""across the whole of the community"". He added: ""And thanks to the hard work of [Health Secretary Matt Hancock] and his teams, we will get up to 200,000 tests in the country by the end of this month."" It comes as the prime minister said the deaths of 181 NHS workers and 131 social care workers had reportedly involved Covid-19. In other developments: The UK is setting up a taskforce to help live sports and arts events return to normal safely, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has said.

"Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18.

You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result. Each UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external When peopletest positive,externalfor coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include: people they've spent at least 15 minutes with, at a distance of less than 2m (6ft) sexual partners, people they live with or have had face-to-face conversations with, at a distance of less than 1m (3ft) If you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms. Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible. As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. TheNHS Covid app,externalis available to download in England and Wales. If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland.

Contact tracing is a system used to slow the spread of infectious diseases like coronavirus, and is already being used in Hong Kong, Singapore and Germany. One method involves the infected person listing all the people with whom they have had prolonged and recent contact, to be tracked down by phone or email. Another uses a location-tracking mobile app, which identifies people the patient has been in contact with. The NHS contact tracing app - which iscurrently being trialled on the Isle of Wightand was initially meant to be launched across England in mid-May - will be rolled out at a later date, No 10 suggested. Northern Irelandalready has a telephone contact tracing systemin place, whilethe Scottish government is currently triallingone.The Welsh government wants its ""test, trace, protect""programme operational by the end of May. It comes as the number of people who died after testing positive for the virus increased by 363 to 35,704, the government said on Wednesday. How does contact tracing work? Multiple security flaws found in NHS virus app Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir asked why there had been ""no effective"" attempt to trace the contacts of those infected with Covid-19 since 12 March ""when tracing was abandoned"". Mr Johnson replied: ""We have growing confidence that we will have a test, track and trace operation that will be world-beating and yes, it will be in place by June 1."" He added that 24,000 contact tracers had already been recruited. The 1 June deadline will also mark the earliest possible date for the gradual reopening of schools and non-essential shops in England. The government's deputy chief scientific adviser Prof Dame Angela McLean previously said an effective system for tracing new coronavirus cases needed to be in place before lockdown restrictions could be changed. Do not expect a fully-functioning perfect track-and-trace system to be up-and-running by 1 June. What will be launched will effectively be a prototype. The app may not be ready by that point, but the army of contract tracers will be available. Given where we are today (and plenty argue mistakes have been made, which means we are in a weaker position than we should be) this is perhaps understandable. The government does not have the luxury of testing and piloting this behind the scenes for months to come. So, the system will have to evolve as it goes. The question is whether it will be robust enough to provide a track-and-trace service that will work on a basic level and help contain local outbreaks, which of course is vital as we gradually move out of lockdown. The prime minister's assertion that it will be able to deal with 10,000 new cases a day is interesting. It sounds a lot. The daily figures suggest there are only a few thousand positive cases a day. But remember those figures have not been capturing all the infections - until this week when testing was extended to all over-fives eligibility was quite restricted. However, surveillance data provided by the Office for National Statistics suggests we may well be seeing around that number. The work that has been done so far is about to be put to the test. LOUIS THEROUX:The 15 songs getting him through lockdown FAKE-AWAY:The best fast food recipes you can make at home The PM also insisted that the UK was now testing more than ""virtually every country in Europe"", and promised that the system would be stepped up in the next fortnight. Leading scientist Prof Hugh Pennington said the pledge was ""good news"" as it was ""essential if we're going to go anywhere near getting out of lockdown, opening schools"". ""It's taken a long time. As to world-beating, well we've been beaten by quite a few other countries by having such a system running."" He added that contact tracing was ""really very labour-intensive work"". This video can not be played The PM promised 200,000 tests in the UK, after he was challenged by Sir Keir Starmer over care home testing. Also at PMQs, Sir Keir queried whether people were being tested in care homes, after the boss of a body representing care homes in England said on Tuesday thatthere were problems. Mr Johnson said 125,000 care home staff have been tested and that the government was ""absolutely confident"" it would be able to increase testing in care homes and ""across the whole of the community"". He added: ""And thanks to the hard work of [Health Secretary Matt Hancock] and his teams, we will get up to 200,000 tests in the country by the end of this month."" It comes as the prime minister said the deaths of 181 NHS workers and 131 social care workers had reportedly involved Covid-19.

"The latest figures published by National Records of Scotland (NRS) show that 3,546 people have died with Covid-19 76% of registered coronavirus deaths were people aged 75 and over The number of deaths in care homes fell for a third week, reports the NRS A sheriff says that further inspections should take place at a care home on Skye which has been at the centre of a virus outbreak Some universities are looking to delay the start of term after the summer holidays, a minister tells a Holyrood committee MSPs will debate and pass the second emergency coronavirus bill today BBC Scotland News Thanks for following the latest updates on coronavirus in Scotland. Here is a summary of the main points:  We'll be back with more live updates tomorrow morning and throughout the day. Coronavirus: Scotland's responseBBC Scotland Q:What did you know about the Nike conference outbreak in Edinburgh and what advice did you give the Scottish government at the time? A:I was involved in those discussions and I was very confident in the incident management team that was involved across all the countries. It acted when it found out about the index case, which is a term we will hear a lot more in the next few weeks. I'm confident it was handled well by the infection team who were in charge. Coronavirus: Scotland's responseBBC Scotland Q:When will we be able to see our grandparents again? A:I think I can give some hope for that. Society connections are important everywhere but Scotland has a strong history of deep, deep cultural connection of families. Of course we believe business is important and it's important to get public transport back. But right at the core of what we believe is getting families back together. And I think over the next few weeks we will begin to see some loosening of what that might look like. We know outdoors is safer than indoors, so you would expect us maybe to do that first. We know small groups are safer than larger groupings, so you would expect us to do that first. Prof Leitch says he hopes that grannies will be able to get a hug within a month, but he is not going to guarantee it. Coronavirus: Scotland's responseBBC Scotland Q:When will we be given further advice about shielding? A:It's a very restrictive way of living and we don't like doing it. We did it to protect that group of around 170,000 people who are very high risk. We will have new advice into June and I hope they will get some relief, but it will not go back to normal. Coronavirus: Scotland's responseBBC Scotland Q:I can't work from home and my travel options are bus or care share - which has a lower transmission risk? A:Active travel will be safest, walking and cycling, but that is not always going to be possible. The way we travel will be different. There will perhaps be people with hand sanitiser at bus and train stations, surfaces will be regularly wiped down on trains and buses. Cars are a challenge, particularly if you are mixing households, but there may be ways round that as restrictions ease. Coronavirus: Scotland's responseBBC Scotland Q: What is the evidence to suggest an ongoing lockdown is required? A:The number of cases and the R number is improving, but it is time to start easing some restrictions. We will hear from the first minister on the timing of that tomorrow. I do not wantpeople on Portobello beachor in parks sunbathing. That is not the guidance and that is for good reason. It is for their protection and to protect their friends and family and loved ones. Coronavirus: Scotland's responseBBC Scotland Professor Jason Leitch, the Scottish Government's national clinical director, is answering viewers' questions onCoronavirus: Scotland's Response. Q:What is the most likely way out of the virus? A:The route out is slow, the World Health Organisation has told us there are six steps, the first three are suppress, implement test and trace and control outbreaks in institutions. We are in a much better place than we were a few weeks ago, but let's remember there were 50 deaths registered today, so we have to be very careful. We are protecting the vulnerable and treating the sick. At some point immunity will help us. That may come with a vaccine but research is beginning to suggest people are not getting it twice.

Ten residents have died at Home Farm in Portree ""Substantial improvements"" have been made at a care home on Skye where 10 residents have died in a coronavirus outbreak, a court has heard. The Care Inspectorate had taken legal action to have the owners of Home Farm in Portree removed as the care provider. But it said improvements had since been made after NHS Highland was brought in to effectively run the home last week. A final decision on care provision has been deferred until next month. Read more Scottish football clubs should extend the terms of out-of-contract players rather than make the ""silly decision"" to release them, says Ross County defender Richard Foster. The 34-year-old full-back, among about 90 Premiership players whose deals expire at the end of May, insists utilising the UK government's furlough scheme allows clubs to absorb the cost of contract extensions. Scottish football, suspended since 13 March, has no clear return date. ""I appreciate clubs don't know what's happening,"" he told BBC Scotland. ""But if you extend the contracts and then furlough us, it gives everyone time for the dust to settle."" Read on forthe full story Allow Twitter content?

It was confirmed at today's UK government briefing that the Queen's Birthday Honours List has been delayed until the autumn, so that people who have made a contribution to the coronavirus crisis can be recognised with a mark of ""national gratitude"". Police spoke to people on Portobello beach in Edinburgh after they were alerted to large numbers of people in the area. Families and groups of sunbathers were seen enjoying the sunshine and mainly observing the two-metre distancing guidelines. But the move breaches restrictions on leaving home during the lockdown. Police Scotland said officers did not issue any fines but it urged people to obey lockdown rules to stay at home. Read more here. The number of people dying with coronavirus in Scotland has fallen for the third consecutive week. Figures from theNational Records of Scotland,externalshowed that 332 deaths involving the virus were registered between 11 and 17 May. This was 83 fewer than the previous week, and brings the total number of deaths to 3,546. There has also been a further drop in the number of people dying with Covid-19 in care homes. The statistics showed that 184 care home deaths were recorded - 54 fewer than the previous week. Read more here Until Tam McCue caught coronavirus, he hadn't phoned in sick in 30 years.

"The work was set for pupils in Years 7,8 and 9 A head teacher says he is ""sorry"" if homework asking pupils to define types of hardcore pornography led them to undertake inappropriate web searches. The work was given to children, aged 11 to 14, at Archbishop Sentamu Academy in Hull, theHull Daily Mail,externalreported. Principal Chay Bell stressed the assignment did not require internet research as the answers were in the material the pupils were sent. Leon Dagon was ""flabbergasted"" when he saw his 13-year-old sister's homework. The work is part of pupils' Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) learning, the school said. The students were asked to ""define"" topics including hardcore pornography, soft pornography as well as female genital mutilation and breast ironing. Leon Dagon said his 13-year-old sister was too young to be learning about such topics They were also asked questions about alcohol, drugs and smoking, as part of the homework. Mr Dagon, who took to Facebook to share his concerns, said: ""My little sister knows make-up and TikTok at the age of 13. She doesn't know about hardcore porn, and then asking her to define it. ""The majority of children nowadays will now go on the internet to help them with their homework and if you type that kind of thing on the internet, God knows what's going to pop up."" The academy's principal said he would ensure all future material was age-appropriate Mr Bell said: ""I am genuinely sorry if parents or students have unnecessarily researched any of these phrases and for any offence caused by this mistake."" He said students ""were not directed to research these topics themselves on the internet because all the answers to the questions posed are contained in the teacher-produced materials we shared"". The work was in line with government guidance, but he added: ""I have asked that no future PSHE materials contain any potentially sensitive content and will ensure all materials are fully age-appropriate."" A spokesman for the Department for Education said it was a matter for the school and had no further comment to make.

"The families of overseas NHS support staff and care workers who have died with coronavirus can stay in the UK permanently. The Home Office bereavement scheme had previously only applied to certain professions, such as nurses. Home Secretary Priti Patel has extended it to cover cleaners, porters and other low-paid roles after pressure from Labour and the unions. But a free visa extension scheme still does not apply to support staff. The offer of indefinite leave to remain for bereaved families of support staff will be effective immediately and retrospectively, the Home Office said. Ms Patel said: ""Every death in this crisis is a tragedy, and sadly some NHS support staff and social care workers have made the ultimate sacrifice in the pursuit of saving the lives of others. ""When I announced the introduction of the bereavement scheme in April, I said we would continue to work across government to look at ways to offer further support. ""Today we are extending the scheme to NHS support staff and social care workers."" The announcement was welcomed as ""very good news"" by Labour's Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee. She said her committee had been ""pushing on this for weeks"",adding on Twitter,externalthat it would be ""unthinkable to ask family who lost a loved one on the UK Covid social care frontline to leave their home & UK"". But she said the government now needed to expand free visa extensions to cover care workers, NHS porters and care workers too. More visa extensions urged for foreign key workers In March, the Home Office brought in a one-year free visa extension for some staff in the NHS and care sectors. The list was initially limited to NHS doctors, nurses and paramedics. For those eligible, the extension covers visas which expire between 31 March and 1 October 2020. Last month, Priti Patel extended the scheme to more NHS staff, including radiographers and social workers, and said some social care staff would also benefit. But the list does not include jobs like porters and cleaners. Prime Minister Boris Johnsonhas also rejected callsfrom Labour and the SNP to scrap the fees overseas health workers have to pay to use the NHS. The health immigration surcharge on non-EU migrants is Â£400 per year and is set to rise to Â£624 in October - but the opposition says health workers should be exempt from it. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said he understood the ""difficulties"" NHS staff faced but the country could not afford to scrap the charges in the current economic climate. This video can not be played Hassan Akkad explains the video which caused a government U-turn Syrian refugee Hassan Akkad is a documentary maker, but he also works for the NHS as a cleaner on a Covid-19 ward. He shareda video on social media on Wednesday,external, directed to the prime minister, saying he felt ""betrayed"" and ""stabbed in the back"" that he and his colleagues weren't included in the bereavement scheme. Speaking to BBC Radio 4, he said: ""I spend my day with cleaners and porters and social care workers. We work together, we go on lunch breaks together, and I see the bravery in their faces and how much they risk to continue doing these jobs, despite being on minimum wage."" He said the change in policy ""tells you where the public is"" with its support for migrant NHS workers of all types. But he now wants the government to look again at other policies that affect him and his colleagues, such asthe health immigration surcharge- which he would have to work 10 days to cover with his wages. ""We're doing these jobs despite the risk of it,"" he said. ""So for us to be charged to access the very same institution, it just doesn't make sense."" Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: ""NHS staff like porters and cleaners, and social care staff, should never have been excluded from the bereavement scheme in the first place. ""Now the government also has to change its stance on charging NHS and care staff from overseas to use our NHS. This hypocrisy must end."" The GMB union said it was ""great"" that its pressure had ""forced the Home Office to back track"" on offering the right to remain to all bereaved families of NHS and care workers. But union organiser Lola McEvoy urged the home secretary to ensure the scheme covered all frontline roles, including part-time workers, in the same way that temporary coronavirus death-in-service benefits launched last month do. ""Not only is it the right thing to do, it's also an acceptance that regardless who you work for, where you were born or how much you're paid - if you have fought frontline during this pandemic - you and your family will be supported and treated the same.""

"Rolls-Royce has said it will cut 9,000 jobs and warned it will take ""several years"" for the airline industry to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The Derby-based firm, which makes plane engines, said the reduction of nearly a fifth of its workforce would mainly affect its civil aerospace division. ""This is not a crisis of our making. But it is the crisis that we face and must deal with,"" boss Warren East said. The bulk of the job cuts are expected to be in the UK at its site in Derby. Rolls-Royce employs 52,000 people globally and Mr East told the BBC's Today programme that the company had not yet concluded on ""exactly"" where the job losses would be, due to having to consult with unions. But he said: ""It's fair to say that of our civil aerospace business approximately two-thirds of the total employees are in the UK at the moment and that's probably a good first proxy."" Rolls-Royce's civil aerospace business has a number of sites in the UK, but the largest plant is in Derby. The company said it will also carry out a review of its sites but declined to comment on which ones may close. John, a worker in Rolls-Royce's civil aerospace division who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, said that while he expected there would be job cuts, the eventual 9,000 figure was ""a shock"". ""Since the Covid-19 outbreak we knew that business would shrink,"" he said. But he said the scale of the cuts as well as the potential closure of some sites was a surprise. Unite the union said the decision was ""shameful opportunism"". ""This company has accepted public money to furlough thousands of workers,"" said Unite's assistant general secretary for manufacturing, Steve Turner. ""Unite and Britain's taxpayers deserve a more responsible approach to a national emergency.  We call upon Rolls-Royce to step back from the brink and work with us on a better way through this crisis."" How will airlines get flying again? Rolls-Royce initially furloughed 4,000 workers in the UK last month. Some 3,700 people remain on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme though which the government pays 80% of a worker's wage up to Â£2,500 a month. But Mr East said: ""No government can extend things like furlough schemes for years into the future. We have to look after ourselves and make sure we meet medium term demand."" This morning's job losses are hardly unexpected - airlines have cut their flying hours by 90% or more, and Airbus and Boeing have slashed their production numbers for the next few years - but they are still a heavy blow to one of the UK's few world-class manufacturing companies. While the details of where the cuts will fall have not been finalised, it is likely that two-thirds will go in the UK. The company has already used the government's furlough scheme to help pay the wages of about 4,000 staff, but Warren East, Rolls-Royce's chief executive, said companies could not expect the government to continue such a scheme for several years. There was also a clear hint this morning that some factories may close - the company said it would review its future manufacturing footprint. Some questions remain for Roll-Royce. Investors are scratching their head about when the company's revenues - much of which rely on aircraft to be flying for money to flow - will return. The company has not yet tapped its shareholders for more money - some expect that may eventually come. Air travel has ground to a virtual standstill since the coronavirus began spreading across the world and many airlines have announced steep job cuts. Global air traffic is expected to decline by 45% this year, according to investment bank Baird. It also forecasts that airlines are expected to lose $310bn (Â£253bn) in revenue in 2020. Rolls-Royce said the impact of the pandemic on the company and the whole of the aviation industry ""is unprecedented"". It added that it is ""increasingly clear that activity in the commercial aerospace market will take several years to return to the levels seen just a few months ago"". As well as the job losses, the company said it would cut costs in areas such as its plants and properties. It expects to make cost savings of Â£1.3bn. Paul Everitt, chief executive of ADS, the aerospace industry association, said: ""The crisis is having a major impact on aerospace companies who provide high value, long-term jobs in all regions and nations of the UK, putting thousands more jobs at risk now and in the months ahead.""

"Rolls-Royce has said it will cut 9,000 jobs and warned it will take ""several years"" for the airline industry to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The Derby-based firm, which makes plane engines, said the reduction of nearly a fifth of its workforce would mainly affect its civil aerospace division. ""This is not a crisis of our making. But it is the crisis that we face and must deal with,"" boss Warren East said. The bulk of the job cuts are expected to be in the UK at its site in Derby. Rolls-Royce employs 52,000 people globally and Mr East told the BBC's Today programme that the company had not yet concluded on ""exactly"" where the job losses would be, due to having to consult with unions. But he said: ""It's fair to say that of our civil aerospace business approximately two-thirds of the total employees are in the UK at the moment and that's probably a good first proxy."" Rolls-Royce's civil aerospace business has a number of sites in the UK, but the largest plant is in Derby. The company said it will also carry out a review of its sites but declined to comment on which ones may close. John, a worker in Rolls-Royce's civil aerospace division who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, said that while he expected there would be job cuts, the eventual 9,000 figure was ""a shock"". ""Since the Covid-19 outbreak we knew that business would shrink,"" he said. But he said the scale of the cuts as well as the potential closure of some sites was a surprise. Unite the union said the decision was ""shameful opportunism"". ""This company has accepted public money to furlough thousands of workers,"" said Unite's assistant general secretary for manufacturing, Steve Turner. ""Unite and Britain's taxpayers deserve a more responsible approach to a national emergency.  We call upon Rolls-Royce to step back from the brink and work with us on a better way through this crisis."" How will airlines get flying again? Rolls-Royce initially furloughed 4,000 workers in the UK last month. Some 3,700 people remain on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme though which the government pays 80% of a worker's wage up to Â£2,500 a month. But Mr East said: ""No government can extend things like furlough schemes for years into the future. We have to look after ourselves and make sure we meet medium term demand."" This morning's job losses are hardly unexpected - airlines have cut their flying hours by 90% or more, and Airbus and Boeing have slashed their production numbers for the next few years - but they are still a heavy blow to one of the UK's few world-class manufacturing companies. While the details of where the cuts will fall have not been finalised, it is likely that two-thirds will go in the UK. The company has already used the government's furlough scheme to help pay the wages of about 4,000 staff, but Warren East, Rolls-Royce's chief executive, said companies could not expect the government to continue such a scheme for several years. There was also a clear hint this morning that some factories may close - the company said it would review its future manufacturing footprint. Some questions remain for Roll-Royce. Investors are scratching their head about when the company's revenues - much of which rely on aircraft to be flying for money to flow - will return. The company has not yet tapped its shareholders for more money - some expect that may eventually come. Air travel has ground to a virtual standstill since the coronavirus began spreading across the world and many airlines have announced steep job cuts. Global air traffic is expected to decline by 45% this year, according to investment bank Baird. It also forecasts that airlines are expected to lose $310bn (Â£253bn) in revenue in 2020. Rolls-Royce said the impact of the pandemic on the company and the whole of the aviation industry ""is unprecedented"". It added that it is ""increasingly clear that activity in the commercial aerospace market will take several years to return to the levels seen just a few months ago"". As well as the job losses, the company said it would cut costs in areas such as its plants and properties. It expects to make cost savings of Â£1.3bn. Paul Everitt, chief executive of ADS, the aerospace industry association, said: ""The crisis is having a major impact on aerospace companies who provide high value, long-term jobs in all regions and nations of the UK, putting thousands more jobs at risk now and in the months ahead.""

"England is the only UK nation to set a date for schools to start to return More than 35 councils in England have warned that not all of their primary schools will be ready to reopen on 1 June. Some of them have expressed opposition to opening at all amid safety concerns. The government says it will listen to the concerns of parents and teachers about the plans to reopen schools. At the daily No 10 briefing, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the move would only go ahead if ministers ""can be sure of children's safety"". He also said he wanted schools in England to return at the same time, after his cabinet colleague Justice Secretary Robert Buckland told BBC Breakfast there may not be a ""uniform approach"". Mr Dowden said: ""It is best, and the government has said this repeatedly, that we move as a whole nation, and that would include of course the whole of England in doing so."" But he suggested there could be different measures in ""micro-hotspots"" where there was an outbreak of new coronavirus cases. Earlier, teaching union NASUWT said it remained ""unconvinced"" reopening schools was ""appropriate or practicable"". Do I have to send my children back to school? Schools 'safe' to reopen, Michael Gove insists Coronavirus: How much do children spread it? Reopening schools 'will cause suffering and death' For most pupils, schools have been closed since 20 March. From 1 June, children in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 in England will be able to return to school if infection rates and the government's other tests at the time allow it. England isthe only UK nation to set a return date so far. Schools in Wales will not reopen on 1 June, while those in Scotland and Northern Ireland may not restart before the summer holidays. But on Tuesday, Calderdale Council, in West Yorkshire, followed Bury,Liverpooland Hartlepool in advising its schools against wider reopening. Other local authorities expressed concern: Conservative-led Solihull Council warned some school places may not be ready for the first week of June Manchester Council said its schools will have to ""work at their own pace"" to gradually increase numbers Birmingham City Council said it may not be possible for some schools to safely open to more pupils by 1 June Leeds City Council saidit would not expect all its schools to reopen to all pupils ""from day one"",external Stockport Council said its schools would not open until 10 June Slough Borough Council said schools would not welcome more pupils until 8 June at the earliest Brighton and Hove City Council said it had advised schools only to reopen whenrisk assessments indicated it is ""safe to do so"".,external A number of the 153 English local authorities have acknowledged safety concerns but have not urged all their schools to reject the proposed timeframe. Academies have the freedom to make their own decision, unlike the two thirds of primary schools supported by local authorities. The government's plan to reopen primary schools to some year groups was a key part of the strategy for getting the country to take the next steps out of lockdown. But it's run into fierce opposition. Persuading people that it's safe to begin thinking about the path back towards normality was always going to be a challenge. And Downing Street is stressing that 1 June was only put forward as the earliest possible date for any reopening of schools (and non-essential retail, set for the same day) - conditional on the five tests for controlling the virus being met. But the admission from cabinet minister Robert Buckland that the picture across the country might not be ""uniform"" - is a reminder that the government in Westminster is not ultimately in control of what happens in schools across the country next month. And it's problematic for ministers that a key date for adjustment to restrictions - albeit one that came with caveats - is now in question. There is already variation between the nations on when schools will return - now there's likely to be differences across England too. Emma Knights, the chief executive of the National Governance Association, which advises school governors, told the BBC it would be hard for governors to ignore the position of their local authorities. She said as councils might be legally judged the employers of school staff, governors would need a very strong reason to make a different decision. The decision to begin reopening schools came after the reproduction, or R number - the number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to, on average -came down across every part of the UK. But multiple research groups, including thoseat the University of Cambridge,external, show it varies across the country - it has come down most in London but is higher in the north-east of England. Metro mayors in the north-west of England have made an ""urgent""call for the release of regional Covid-19 reproduction rate figures, saying it would help residents making ""informed decisions about the risk and help decide whether they wish to take a more cautious approach to the relaxation of the lockdown rules"". Meanwhile, a survey of 29,000 members of the teachers' union NASUWT found just one in 20 thought it would be safe for more pupils to return next month. Patrick Roach, the union's general secretary, called for all the scientific evidence from the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to be made available to teachers and schools as soon as possible.

THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? Mother-of-three Amy Hughes says her eldest daughter is eligible to return to school on 1 June, but she will not send her back then. ""We're actually waiting to see if there's a second wave to decide whether to let our other daughter start school in September,"" she adds. She moved her family out of inner city Bristol last year when one of her daughters caught a virus that made her lungs collapse. Ms Hughes, who now lives in Lincolnshire with her children aged six, four and one, says the experience had made her ""hyper sensitive about viruses"". Lincolnshire GP Grace Hurdley, who is currently on maternity leave, says although school life will be ""different"", sending her five-year-old son back on 1 June is ""the best thing"" for him. While home schooling has not been a problem, she told BBC Radio 5 Live her son was ""really struggling"" spending so long at home. Ms Hurdley believes it would be ""better for him to play alongside his friends than to continue being isolated"". She is reassured by plans to split his usual class size of 30 into 15, so that he is in a ""bubble"" with some other children and his teacher, with their own meal and play times. He would also get used to washing his hands more regularly - a habit she says the family are ""very keen on at home"" in light of their new baby and the pandemic. Dr Peter English from the doctors' union, the British Medical Association,said in the Daily Telegraph,externalthat schools should reopen ""as soon as it is safe to do so"", but warned ""a zero-risk approach is not possible"". Last week,the BMA said Covid-19 infection rates were too high for England's schools to reopen. Attendance by primary school pupils will be voluntary and schools are reporting varied levels of interest from the parents. Secondary schools are likely to stay closed until September but the government hopes those facing exams next year - Years 10 and 12 - will get some time in school before the summer holidays. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""We want children back in schools as soon as possible, because being with their teachers and friends is so important for their education and their wellbeing. She insisted plans for the ""cautious"" return of some pupils from 1 June are ""based on the best scientific and medical advice"" and said No 10 had ""engaged closely"" with relevant groups including the unions, and will continue to do so.

"Customers ""may never shop the same way again"" after the coronavirus crisis, Marks and Spencer's boss has said. ""Whilst some customer habits will return to normal, others have changed forever,"" Steve Rowe said. The pandemic has driven several changes, including a shift to online, customers cooking more from scratch and buying more casual clothing. T-shirt bras and bathroom products online sales have risen, while it is barely selling any suits or ties. The retailer has also found that as shoppers are visiting the shops less, they are planning what to eat further in advance, and also buying more herbs and whole vegetables. It said that customers are buying bigger product packs, such as of strawberries or chicken. Sales of frozen items are also up by 75% on the year in the UK. M&S added that online shoppers were now browsing earlier in the day, between 15:00 and 17:00. As more customers work from home, desktop visits were also up 38% in comparison with the same period last year. Marks & Spencer cafes to reopen for takeaway Marks & Spencer extends 30-minute home delivery service But M&S is one of the few big food retailers without its own internet-based delivery service. This has hampered the chain as customers have needed to purchase items online during lockdown if they are self-isolating, for example. However, the retailer's partnership with Ocado starts in September this year, replacing the online grocer's existing deal with Waitrose. In a new announcement, M&S said the delivery service would also include over a thousand non-food items meaning customers will soon be able to buy cushions or underwear alongside their eggs or bread. M&S has signed a food delivery partnership with Ocado Mr Rowe said that Ocado's strong performance during lockdown ""further reinforced"" the value of the deal for delivering groceries. The impact of the virus lockdown has driven ""effects and aftershocks"" in the retail sector that would ""endure for the coming year and beyond,"" Mr Rowe added. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: ""Covid-19 has accelerated lots of consumer trends and it may just be the catalyst required to accelerate Marks and Spencer's transformation into a 21st century retailer. ""In particular it looks as though M&S has learnt just how important online is - so it's making its Ocado venture more central to the business."" M&S was already undergoing a transformation plan led by its chief executive Steve Rowe which included cutting costs and closing some stores. The firm said that due to the pandemic, those measures would be sped up under a programme called ""Never The Same Again"". Those include buying clothing from fewer core suppliers, reducing the clothing and home ranges, as well as ""the replacement of ageing stores"". ""The trauma of the Covid-19 crisis has galvanised our colleagues to secure the future of the business,"" said Mr Rowe. The company has been facing increasing competition from fashion giants such as Primark on the High Street and Asos on the internet in recent years. In the year to March, M&S said its clothing sales fell by 6.2%, whereas its food sales were up 1.9%. To add to its problems, M&S's non-food stores have been forced to shut under the lockdown measures. As a result, it faces a ""mounting backlog of unsold stock"" in its warehouses, it said. Clothing and homeware sales fell by 75% in the six weeks to 9 May. Food sales also fell, by 8.8%, although M&S said many of its Simply Food stores were trading strongly. The firm said that lockdown measures, social distancing and lower consumer demand were ""likely to continue through the year"", adding that the coronavirus pandemic means that its performance over the next year is difficult to predict. It is working on a scenario that assumes a sales hit of Â£2.1bn over the next year across clothing, home, food and international sales. Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Overall, M&S was facing challenges before coronavirus and these have simply been exacerbated. ""Within the difficulties there are real opportunities too, and the group appears to have a lot of the right ideas, but the next chapter really needs to be about execution."" Its comments came as M&S said its profits for the year to March had dropped by more than 20% to Â£403m, from Â£511m in the previous year, as its troubled clothing business continued to struggle.

"This video can not be played The PM said contributions to the NHS from overseas workers raise about Â£900m. Boris Johnson has rejected calls to scrap the fees overseas health workers have to pay to use the NHS. The health immigration surcharge on non-EU migrants is Â£400 per year and set to rise to Â£624 in October. Labour, the SNP and the Royal College of Nursing say health workers should be exempt from the ""unfair"" charge. The prime minister said he understood the ""difficulties"" NHS staff faced but the country could not afford to scrap the charges in the current climate. The government plans to extend the fees to apply to EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway nationals moving to the UK after the Brexit transition period ends in December. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Every Thursday we go out and clap for our carers. Many of them are risking their lives for the sake of all of us. ""Does the prime minister think it's right that care workers coming from abroad and working on our frontline should have to pay a surcharge of hundreds - sometimes thousands of pounds - to use the NHS themselves?"" Bereaved families of NHS staff can stay in UK 'World-beating' virus tracing ready by June - PM The UK health tax hurting foreign nurses He said a care worker on the National Living Wage would have to work for 70 hours ""to pay off the fee"". The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, urged the PM to scrap the ""cruel"" charge, accusing the PM of ""giving with one hand and raking it in with the other"". This video can not be played Ian Blackford accuses the PM of ""giving with one hand and raking it in with the other"" over NHS staff. Mr Johnson said he had ""thought a great deal"" about this issue, given his own experience of beingcared for by nurses from overseaswhen he was in intensive care with coronavirus. He told Sir Keir: ""I do accept and understand the difficulties faced by our amazing NHS staff and, like him, I've been a personal beneficiary of carers who have come from abroad and, frankly, saved my life. ""On the other hand we must look at the realities - this is a great national service, it's a national institution, it needs funding and those contributions actually help us to raise about Â£900m, and it's very difficult in the current circumstances to find alternative sources. ""So with great respect to the point [Sir Keir] makes, I do think that is the right way forward."" Labour is planning to seek an amendment to the Immigration Bill to exempt NHS staff, including cleaners and care professionals, from the surcharge. The party is hoping to recruit support from other opposition parties and Conservative MPs. A Labour source said the Â£900m figure quoted by the PM was for the surcharge as a whole and the government had not given a breakdown of the cost of scrapping the surcharge on different sectors, such as health. This video can not be played The Speaker warns the health secretary for addressing the Labour leader during PMQs Dame Donna Kinnair, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ""The immigration health surcharge is a grossly unfair financial burden on our international workforce and we're pleased to see the issue being taken seriously by politicians. ""The government must drop this charge as a matter of urgency."" Sir Keir Starmer also challenged Mr Johnson on the ""the continued delay in routine testing in our care homes"" at Prime Minister's Questions.

"Rolls-Royce has said it will cut 9,000 jobs and warned it will take ""several years"" for the airline industry to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The Derby-based firm, which makes plane engines, said the reduction of nearly a fifth of its workforce would mainly affect its civil aerospace division. ""This is not a crisis of our making. But it is the crisis that we face and must deal with,"" boss Warren East said. The bulk of the job cuts are expected to be in the UK at its site in Derby. Rolls-Royce employs 52,000 people globally and Mr East told the BBC's Today programme that the company had not yet concluded on ""exactly"" where the job losses would be, due to having to consult with unions. But he said: ""It's fair to say that of our civil aerospace business approximately two-thirds of the total employees are in the UK at the moment and that's probably a good first proxy."" Rolls-Royce's civil aerospace business has a number of sites in the UK, but the largest plant is in Derby. The company said it will also carry out a review of its sites but declined to comment on which ones may close. John, a worker in Rolls-Royce's civil aerospace division who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, said that while he expected there would be job cuts, the eventual 9,000 figure was ""a shock"". ""Since the Covid-19 outbreak we knew that business would shrink,"" he said. But he said the scale of the cuts as well as the potential closure of some sites was a surprise. Unite the union said the decision was ""shameful opportunism"". ""This company has accepted public money to furlough thousands of workers,"" said Unite's assistant general secretary for manufacturing, Steve Turner. ""Unite and Britain's taxpayers deserve a more responsible approach to a national emergency.  We call upon Rolls-Royce to step back from the brink and work with us on a better way through this crisis."" How will airlines get flying again? Rolls-Royce initially furloughed 4,000 workers in the UK last month. Some 3,700 people remain on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme though which the government pays 80% of a worker's wage up to Â£2,500 a month. But Mr East said: ""No government can extend things like furlough schemes for years into the future. We have to look after ourselves and make sure we meet medium term demand."" This morning's job losses are hardly unexpected - airlines have cut their flying hours by 90% or more, and Airbus and Boeing have slashed their production numbers for the next few years - but they are still a heavy blow to one of the UK's few world-class manufacturing companies. While the details of where the cuts will fall have not been finalised, it is likely that two-thirds will go in the UK. The company has already used the government's furlough scheme to help pay the wages of about 4,000 staff, but Warren East, Rolls-Royce's chief executive, said companies could not expect the government to continue such a scheme for several years. There was also a clear hint this morning that some factories may close - the company said it would review its future manufacturing footprint. Some questions remain for Roll-Royce. Investors are scratching their head about when the company's revenues - much of which rely on aircraft to be flying for money to flow - will return. The company has not yet tapped its shareholders for more money - some expect that may eventually come. Air travel has ground to a virtual standstill since the coronavirus began spreading across the world and many airlines have announced steep job cuts. Global air traffic is expected to decline by 45% this year, according to investment bank Baird. It also forecasts that airlines are expected to lose $310bn (Â£253bn) in revenue in 2020. Rolls-Royce said the impact of the pandemic on the company and the whole of the aviation industry ""is unprecedented"". It added that it is ""increasingly clear that activity in the commercial aerospace market will take several years to return to the levels seen just a few months ago"". As well as the job losses, the company said it would cut costs in areas such as its plants and properties. It expects to make cost savings of Â£1.3bn. Paul Everitt, chief executive of ADS, the aerospace industry association, said: ""The crisis is having a major impact on aerospace companies who provide high value, long-term jobs in all regions and nations of the UK, putting thousands more jobs at risk now and in the months ahead.""

"The UK's inflation rate fell in April to its lowest since August 2016 as the economic fallout of the first month of the lockdown hit prices. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) fell to 0.8% from 1.5% in March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Falling petrol and diesel prices, plus lower energy bills, were the main drivers pushing inflation lower. But the prices of games and toys rose, which the ONS said may be due to people spending more time at home. However, there were 92 items in the ONS's basket of goods and services that it could not measure in April because they were mostly unavailable. These ranged from haircut prices, lemonade, manicures, cinema popcorn, and leisure activities involving sport. The ONS said it would monitor the issue for any distortion in the overall picture. But Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS, said: ""While the coronavirus limited the availability of some goods and services, its effect on prices was more muted."" He said that food prices generally rose no more quickly than other goods and services, ""though fresh vegetables did see stronger rises"". Sunak: No guarantee of quick economic bounceback Will coronavirus mean I have to pay more tax? What is the UK's inflation rate? The ONS said average petrol prices dropped by 10.4p a litre between March and April - the biggest fall since unleaded petrol records began in 1990 - amid a slump in global oil prices. Energy prices also pushed inflation lower as regulator Ofgem reduced its default tariff cap. The ONS said clothes retailers, hit during the early days of the lockdown by weaker footfall and then the closure of outlets, resorted to more discount sales than usual to try to shift their stock. Goods seeing upward pressure on prices included video games and consoles, board games and children's toys, the ONS said. And the price of knitting wool rose, another sign of the crafts and hobbies popular with people staying at home. Long-life products - such as cook-in sauces and frozen fish - also saw price hikes last month as consumers stocked up for life in lockdown. Laura Suter, personal finance analyst at investment platform AJ Bell, said it was likely that as shops start re-opening retailers would deeply discount prices, putting further downward pressure on inflation. She also pointed to positive news for savers. ""For the first time in ages [savers] can now get above inflation interest rates on easy-access savings accounts - from more than one account."" CPI is now far below the Bank of England's 2% target, used as general guidance to help businesses set the right prices and for people to plan their spending. But while low inflation reduces the need for rises in interest rates and gives people a feeling the pound in their pocket stretches further, it's possible to have too much of a good thing. Low inflation minimises the erosion of debt over the years. People (and governments) with borrowing, such as mortgages, don't see the benefit. That big loan you have doesn't look so big if wages are keeping up with inflation. So-called deflation actually increases the value the debts. But low inflation discourages employers from raising pay (which hits the Treasury's tax take) and may even encourage them to cut pay in troubled times. And if prices are falling, consumers can put off big ticket purchases in the hope the fall will continue - and this slows economic growth. Savers are also penalised. Low inflation generally means lower official interest rates - and that means banks and building societies keep their savings rates down. It's why, when inflation remains one percentage point below 2%, the governor of the Bank of England writes to the chancellor to explain how the price index can be brought back on target. There's a good reason a little inflation is good for the economy. Most economists had expected April's inflation to fall to 0.9%, and have predicted the rate will fall further as the economic fallout of the pandemic continues. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said inflation had taken a ""big leap towards zero by the summer"" as he said retailers were planning ""further large price cuts"". He predicted inflation would recover next year but was likely to remain below 2% for much of 2021. ""The inflation outlook, then, supports the [Bank of England's] Monetary Policy Committee doing more to stimulate the economy at its next meeting in mid-June - we look for a further Â£100bn of quantitative easing to be announced,"" he added. Core inflation, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, held broadly steady at an annual rate of 1.5%. Inflation as measured by the Retail Prices Index (RPI) - an older measure of inflation which the ONS says is inaccurate, but is widely used in bond markets and for other commercial contracts - dropped to 1.5% from 2.6%.

"Joe Rogan has signed an exclusive deal with Spotify, which will see his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, disappear from all other platforms. The multi-year deal is believed to be worth $100m (Â£82 million), according to theWall Street Journal.,external Rogan's podcast, which is one of the most popular in the world, will arrive on the streaming giant on 1 September. It will then be housed there exclusively by the end of the year, and removed from all other platforms. ""It will remain free, and it will be the exact same show,""said Rogan,external. ""It's just a licensing deal, so Spotify won't have any creative control over the show. ""They want me to just continue doing it the way I'm doing it right now. ""I'm excited to have the support of the largest audio platform in the world and I hope you folks are there when we make the switch!"" Rogan also works as an interviewer and commentator for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Joe Rogan is a US stand-up comedian and TV host-turned-provocateur, who launched his podcast in 2009 - in the early days of the medium. He invites a wide range of guests, including actors, musicians, comedians, politicians and conspiracy theorists on to the show, which has garnered a huge audience. Last year the podcast was downloaded 190 million times per month. Rogan has previously advocated for ""long-form media"" - and his own podcast episodes regularly run to two or three hours. The controversial entertainer also has 8.42 million subscribers to his YouTube channel, which has up until now shown the interviews in video form (this will stop when the new Spotify deal kicks in). But he has also attracted criticism - Rogan has been accused of making sexist, racist and transphobic comments in his podcasts. ""The Joe Rogan Experience has become one of the internet's foremost vectors for anti-wokeness,""wrote Justin Peters in Slate.,external In 2018, Rogan's show hit the headlines when the host shared a cannabis joint with Tesla boss Elon Musk, after which the company's stocks fell by 9%. Sanders faces ire over Joe Rogan 'endorsement' Rogan has been credited as being an ""unlikely political influencer"" by the New York Times, due to his reach. In January, he informed his legions of followers that he would ""probably vote for Bernie"", referring to the then Democratic Party candidate Bernie Sanders, who received increased press coverage as a result. However, since Joe Biden became the party's presumptive nominee, Rogan has said he is more likely to vote for President Trump. The kind of figures involved in the deal are incredibly rare in the podcast world - and Rogan will now likely earn more money than most musicians on Spotify. ""Joe Rogan just got paid the equivalent value of over 26 billion streams for a podcast licence,""wrote Tom Gray,external, director of the royalties, music copyright and licensing society, PRS for Music. ""A musician would need to generate 23 billion streams on Spotify to earn what they're paying Joe Rogan for his podcast rights.""added music writer Ted Gioia.,external Gioia suggested this means ""Spotify values Rogan more than any musician in the history of the world"". TV critic and broadcaster Scott Bryan predicted,externalthe deal could ""lead the way to others"", but noted that the exclusivity clause would leave many fans locked out. ""It might do what Sky did for a lot of shows,"" he tweeted. ""Lift them up, but put them behind a wall that the culture mostly then ignores."" Although Rogan has said the podcast will still be free to access, Spotify will be hoping the increased traffic to its service will lead to a significant increase in subscriber numbers. It is generally difficult to make large amounts of money in the crowded world of podcasts. As most podcasts are free to download, many presenters and producers attempt to make money from endorsements and advertising. A platform-exclusive deal such as this is very rare.

"This video can not be played The PM said contributions to the NHS from overseas workers raise about Â£900m.

"A woman cycles through heavy rain as Cyclone Amphan approaches Kolkata. Cyclone Amphan has made landfall in eastern India and Bangladesh, killing at least 15 people as it lashed coastal areas with ferocious wind and rain. Trees were uprooted and homes toppled in both countries, including in the Indian city of Kolkata in West Bengal. Nearly three million people were evacuated - most of them in Bangladesh - before the severe storm hit. Coronavirus restrictions have been hampering emergency and relief efforts. Covid-19 and social-distancing measures have made mass evacuations more difficult for authorities, with shelters unable to be used to full capacity. The storm is the first super cyclone to form in the Bay of Bengal since 1999. Though its winds have now weakened, it is still classified as a very severe cyclone. People rushed for shelter in Kolkata as the cyclone approached ""Our estimate is that some areas 10-15km from the coast could be inundated,"" said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, the head of India's meteorological department. Amphan began hitting the Sundarbans, a mangrove area around the India-Bangladesh border home to four million people on Wednesday afternoon, before carving north and north-eastwards towards Kolkata, a historic city that was the capital of the British Raj. It was moving with winds gusting up to 185km/h (115mph). Amphan is expected to move further into Bangladesh on Thursday, and later Bhutan. Meteorologists warn there could be up to 300mm more rainfall to come, which could increase the risk of flooding and deadly mudslides. This video can not be played Video filmed by residents there shows extremely strong and dangerous winds in Kolkata Satya Narayan Pradhan, director general of India's National Disaster Response Force, told the BBC the impact had been ""fairly devastating"", especially in poor areas. Although it had been hard to keep people apart during evacuations, social distancing is being enforced at cyclone shelters, along with hygiene protocols, he said. Amitabha Bhattasali, BBC Bengali, Kolkata Kolkata has been facing the full force of Cyclone Amphan since it made landfall several hours ago. My building has lost electricity. The telephone network is gone so I'm here with a candle. The mobile network is running. But the situation just outside my window is terrifying - I went outside to try to record something and was nearly blown away. I'm getting reports from across the city as well as from coastal districts that the situation is pretty bad there. Thousands of trees and electricity poles are down. When the last super cyclone struck in 1999 I was travelling on a train and was stuck for two days. At one point, I thought we'd be blown away. How much devastation this cyclone has caused we'll get to know only in the morning. Kolkata residents said it was the worst storm they had experienced in decades. They spoke of flooded homes, electricity transformers exploding and power cuts. One man told the BBC the boundary walls of his condominium had collapsed. ""I am in my house. I have been prepared for a while. But I've never seen a storm as bad as this,"" said one resident, Pooja Kaur. ""There is no power at the moment."" Earlier, a Bangladesh Red Crescent volunteer helping villagers to evacuate became the first fatality after the boat he was in capsized in strong winds, the organisation said. Bangladesh has reported four other deaths. In India, media reported 10 fatalities, including a child in the state of Orissa (also known as Odisha), who was killed after the mud wall of his family's home collapsed. In the Sundarbans, also a rich habitat for Bengal tigers, houses ""look like they have been run over by a bulldozer"", a villager called Babul Mondal told the FP news agency. Why Bay of Bengal is a hotbed of tropical cyclones When extreme weather and Covid-19 collide India and Bangladesh are using schools and other buildings as temporary shelters - but they need more space than usual in order to house people while maintaining social distancing. Police in West Bengal, which along with Orissa is expected to be the worst-hit part of India, told the BBC that people were unwilling to go to the shelters because they were afraid of contracting Covid-19. Social distancing being enforced in a cyclone shelter in India Officials in Bangladesh fear it will be the most powerful storm since Cyclone Sidr killed about 3,500 people in 2007. Most died as a result of sea water surging in. India's weather department had predicted storm surges as high as 10-16 feet (3-5 metres). The rising of sea levels in this way can send deadly walls of water barrelling far inland, devastating communities. This video can not be played Helen Willetts has the latest update on Cyclone Amphan The cyclone comes as tens of thousands of migrant workers continue to flee cities for their villages during India's lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus. West Bengal and Orissa are among the Indian states seeing large numbers return. Orissa cancelled trains and some district officials asked the state government to accommodate the migrants - many of whom are walking home - elsewhere until the storm passes. How cyclones get their names What is a cyclone? The lost fishermen of India's Cyclone Ockhi Although they are not in the direct path of the storm, there are fears for hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees who fled Myanmar and live in crowded camps in Bangladesh where cases of coronavirus have recently been reported. Officials said they had moved hundreds of Rohingya living on an island in the Bay of Bengal into shelters. The UN and human rights groups are also gravely worried for Rohingya refugees who they believe could be on boats in the Bay of Bengal, and possibly in the storm's path, after trying to flee to Malaysia and Thailand but being blocked by authorities in those countries from landing.

"Serco is one of the companies hiring, training and operating 15,000 contact tracers for the UK government Outsourcing firm Serco has apologised after accidentally sharing the email addresses of almost 300 contact tracers. The company is training staff to trace cases of Covid-19 for the UK government. It made the error when it emailed new trainees to tell them about training. Serco said it had apologised and would review its processes ""to make sure that this does not happen again"". Contact tracing is a system used to slow the spread of infectious diseases like coronavirus. It is already being used in other countries including Singapore and Germany. In the UK, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said 21,000 contact tracers have been hired, some of whom are healthcare professionals. They will gather contacts from Covid-19 patients and trace those people by phone or email to slow the spread of the disease in the community. Serco is one of the companies hiring, training and operating the 15,000 contact tracers who do not have clinical training. But the mistake may leave the firm in breach of data protection rules. It is understood that at least one member of staff has raised the issue with the Information Commissioner. How will the UK's coronavirus app work? Serco fined Â£19m over tagging scandal Two ex-Serco bosses charged with fraud The error did not involve patients' data but will be unhelpful for a contact tracing project that is set to ask many thousands of people who have fallen ill to share the details of their friends and acquaintances. Serco wrote the email to tell new trainees not to contact its help desk looking for training details. But the staff member who sent it put their email addresses in the CC section of the email, rather than the blind CC section - revealing them to every recipient.

"This video can not be played ""People say it's my fault coronavirus spreading"" Young carers are being shouted at and turned away from special shopping hours due to ""not being believed"", a charity fears. Carers Trust Wales said some had been shouted at by shoppers and stopped from going into shops during the pandemic. Fayeth, from Rhyl, cares for her mother who has epilepsy and three younger sisters. But the 13-year-old said she felt like she got ""death stares"" every time she left the house. As many as one in five young people are caring for a family member with disabilities or mental health problems in Wales, according to the charity. As carers they are eligible to shop during special hours set aside at supermarkets and shops for the elderly and vulnerable and for carers. But only some local authorities issue ID cards, which explain the young carers' role, and there are concerns that a large number of shops do not accept them. Young carers in Wales 'hidden' from schools 'I thought every child looked after their mum' Director of the charity, Simon Hatch, said the young carers were worried enough about bringing the virus back home to their family members from the shops, without being turned away at the door. He said staff were probably stopping them due to ""not understanding"" their role in being a key carer and supermarkets and shops needed training. ""We've also had reports of people being shouted at in the streets, when they've been trying to get into local shops,"" he said. ""I'm sure that these are relatively rare occurrences, but it really highlights the massive challenges on top of what is already a very worrying and stressful time for them anyway."" Young carer Fayeth said she felt like she had death stares while going shopping for her family For Fayeth the lockdown has been a worrying time, with her mother Laura having more seizures since the restrictions were introduced. But while she is trying to care for her family, she said whenever she left the house to get shopping she felt like people were staring at her. ""Some people have made comments when I'm out shopping saying that young children shouldn't be out of the house during this time,"" she said. ""There are some shops which won't let young people in and only allowing adults, so it can make it much harder to get any shopping. ""Some people even say you shouldn't be out and the coronavirus is spreading and it's my fault because I'm outside and things like that. ""But I just say I'm a young carer and I'm allowed to be out, then I walk away"". Ronnie Lawson's mother Louise said he could not be ""queuing for three hours"" trying to get shopping for his dad Teenager Ronnie Lawson has cared for his father who has multiple sclerosis since he was nine and also helps his mother who has problems with her spine and hips. He said he was left ""embarrassed"" when he was turned away while trying to buy food for his disabled parents in Abergavenny. Ronnie said he did not have anything to prove he was a carer, and thought staff ""didn't really believe"" him as he ""is a teenager"". Ronnie said he was embarrassed because of how many elderly people were in the queue for the shops He said he had got ""looks off people wondering why I'm out"", but now had a slip from Monmouthshire council and was finding it easier to get in during special hours. Ronnie said he was worried about the impact on younger children who were sole carers for parents, and people needed to be more understanding, as they were already scared of going to the shops. ""It's not their fault, but there's no point for a kid to lie about being a carer, so I think they should be more considerate,"" he said. Rhian Watts said even with ID and proof young carers were still not being let into shops Bridgend Carers Centre has started giving slips to its 1,400 recognised young carers to prove they are shopping for a family member. ""A lot of young carers are getting refused in retail shops, usually because of their age and some supermarkets are saying if they're under the age of 16 they are not allowed in,"" said manager Rhian Watts. ""But even with the letters we've been providing some are still not allowing them in."" Ms Watts said it should not really matter who is doing the shopping for a family, and have more understanding of the risks young carers were taking. ""They are the person that needs to enter the supermarket to do the shopping and denying access will have a major impact on them and their families so it's just about having a bit of understanding,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Johnson: ""Test, track and trace system in place in the UK by June 1"" The PM says England will have a ""world-beating"" tracing system from June, as he was accused of leaving a ""huge hole"" in the country's coronavirus defences. Boris Johnson said 25,000 contact tracers, able to track 10,000 new cases a day, would be in place by 1 June. BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said it was unlikely to be a ""fully-functioning perfect system"" by then. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer challenged the PM over the absence of a tracing system since March. Contact tracing is a system used to slow the spread of infectious diseases like coronavirus, and is already being used in Hong Kong, Singapore and Germany. One method involves the infected person listing all the people with whom they have had prolonged and recent contact, to be tracked down by phone or email. Another uses a location-tracking mobile app, which identifies people the patient has been in contact with. The NHS contact tracing app - which iscurrently being trialled on the Isle of Wightand was initially meant to be launched across England in mid-May - will be rolled out at a later date, No 10 suggested. Northern Irelandalready has a telephone contact tracing systemin place, whilethe Scottish government is currently triallingone.The Welsh government wants its ""test, trace, protect""programme operational by the end of May. It comes as the number of people who died after testing positive for the virus increased by 363 to 35,704, the government said on Wednesday. How does contact tracing work? Multiple security flaws found in NHS virus app Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir asked why there had been ""no effective"" attempt to trace the contacts of those infected with Covid-19 since 12 March ""when tracing was abandoned"". Mr Johnson replied: ""We have growing confidence that we will have a test, track and trace operation that will be world-beating and yes, it will be in place by June 1."" He added that 24,000 contact tracers had already been recruited. The 1 June deadline will also mark the earliest possible date for the gradual reopening of schools and non-essential shops in England. The government's deputy chief scientific adviser Prof Dame Angela McLean previously said an effective system for tracing new coronavirus cases needed to be in place before lockdown restrictions could be changed. Do not expect a fully-functioning perfect track-and-trace system to be up-and-running by 1 June. What will be launched will effectively be a prototype. The app may not be ready by that point, but the army of contract tracers will be available. Given where we are today (and plenty argue mistakes have been made, which means we are in a weaker position than we should be) this is perhaps understandable. The government does not have the luxury of testing and piloting this behind the scenes for months to come. So, the system will have to evolve as it goes. The question is whether it will be robust enough to provide a track-and-trace service that will work on a basic level and help contain local outbreaks, which of course is vital as we gradually move out of lockdown. The prime minister's assertion that it will be able to deal with 10,000 new cases a day is interesting. It sounds a lot. The daily figures suggest there are only a few thousand positive cases a day. But remember those figures have not been capturing all the infections - until this week when testing was extended to all over-fives eligibility was quite restricted.

LOUIS THEROUX:The 15 songs getting him through lockdown FAKE-AWAY:The best fast food recipes you can make at home The PM also insisted that the UK was now testing more than ""virtually every country in Europe"", and promised that the system would be stepped up in the next fortnight. Leading scientist Prof Hugh Pennington said the pledge was ""good news"" as it was ""essential if we're going to go anywhere near getting out of lockdown, opening schools"". ""It's taken a long time.

Also at PMQs, Sir Keir queried whether people were being tested in care homes, after the boss of a body representing care homes in England said on Tuesday thatthere were problems. Mr Johnson said 125,000 care home staff have been tested and that the government was ""absolutely confident"" it would be able to increase testing in care homes and ""across the whole of the community"". He added: ""And thanks to the hard work of [Health Secretary Matt Hancock] and his teams, we will get up to 200,000 tests in the country by the end of this month.""

"Coronavirus and the collapse of oil revenue have increased the pressure on President Maduro Venezuela has launched legal proceedings against the Bank of England to try to force it to release â¬930m ($1bn; Â£820m) worth of Venezuelan gold. The gold is being retained following British and US sanctions on Venezuela. Venezuela says it wants the Bank of England to sell part of the Venezuelan gold reserves to use the funds to fight the spread of coronavirus. It says it has agreed for the money to be sent directly to the UN to ensure it is not used for other purposes. It is calling for the funds to be transferred to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to administer the purchase of supplies like medical equipment to fight Covid-19. Why coronavirus could be catastrophic for Venezuela Venezuela crisis in 300 words US offers Venezuela sanctions relief The legal wrangling comes amid fears about the ability of Venezuela's crumbling healthcare system to handle the outbreak. This video can not be played The Venezuelan hospital where there's barely running water, let alone medicine Legal documents say the bank wants the transfer made ""as a matter of urgency"" and it filed a legal claim to that effect in a London court on 14 May. ""With lives on the line, now is not the time to attempt to score political points,"" Sarosh Zaiwalla, a London-based lawyer representing Venezuela's central bank, said in a statement. The UN told the BBC in an emailed statement only that it had been approached by the Venezuelan bank to explore such mechanisms. The Bank of England declined to comment when asked about the case by Reuters news agency. The Bank of England is the second largest keeper of gold in the world, with approximately 400,000 gold bars - only the New York Federal Reserve has more. It has one of the largest gold vaults in the world and prides itself on never having had any gold stolen in its more than 320-year history. Central banks of a number of nations use it to store their national gold reserves and Venezuela is one of them. Despite the country's oil riches, Venezuela's economy has been in freefall for years due to a combination of government mismanagement and corruption, further exacerbated by international sanctions. As Venezuela produces very little apart from oil, it needs to import goods from abroad, for which it needs access to foreign currency. But with oil production a fraction of what it once was, Venezuela's foreign currency reserves have been dwindling. The government of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro turned to selling off some of the gold reserves kept at the central bank in Venezuela to its allies in Turkey, Russia and the United Arab Emirates. This video can not be played Venezuela's gold diplomacy gamble But the US, which does not recognise Mr Maduro's government, last year warned ""bankers, brokers, traders and facilitators""  not to deal in ""gold, oil, or other Venezuelan commodities stolen from the Venezuelan people by the Maduro mafia"". Venezuela has reportedly continued to sell gold to its ally Iran, which is also under US sanctions, but even so its international reserves reached a 30-year low at the beginning of this year, Venezuelan Central Bank figures revealed. It badly needs hard currency and sees the gold stored in the vaults of the Bank of England as the solution. Venezuela first approached the Bank of England at the end of 2018. Finance Minister SimÃ³n Zerpa and Central Bank President Calixto Ortega travelled to London to demand that Venezuela be allowed to take the gold back to Venezuela. In January 2019, the Bank of England refused the request. All it said publicly was that it did not comment on customer relationships. Venezuela has $1bn worth of gold stored in the Bank of England The decision, however, came just days after Mr Maduro's rival, Juan GuaidÃ³, had declared himself president, arguing that the 2018 election which returned Mr Maduro to power had been fraudulent. Mr GuaidÃ³, who was quickly recognised as the legitimate leader by more than 50 nations - including the UK and the US, asked the Bank of England not to hand the gold over to the Maduro government, arguing that it would be used for corrupt purposes. The British minister of state for the Americas at the time, Alan Duncan, said the decision was a matter for the Bank of England and its governor, but added that ""no doubt when they do so they will take into account there are now a large number of countries across the world questioning the legitimacy of NicolÃ¡s Maduro and recognising that of Juan GuaidÃ³"". At the same time, top US officials - for whom President Maduro has long been a thorn - were also lobbying their British counterparts to cut the Maduro government off from its foreign assets. While the Bank of England never went beyond saying that it did not comment on customer relations it is thought that international sanctions on Venezuela and regulations on preventing money laundering influenced its decision. Venezuela's offer to have the funds transferred to the UN directly are designed to circumvent those regulations.

"Airlines around the world have had to park up their planes Aviation is the most global of global industries. It employs millions of people, underpins the livelihoods of tens of millions more, and acts as part of the central nervous system of international business and leisure. Yet now vast parts of the network have been shut down as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The number of daily flights has fallen by 80% since the start of the year, and in some regions nearly all passenger traffic has been suspended. The industry is in survival mode, with airlines, airports and ground-handling firms all desperate to conserve their cash reserves, while their normal revenue streams have dried up. Widespread job losses are now expected, with British Airways' parent company IAG announcing on Tuesdaythat it is set to cut up to 12,000 positions from the airline's 42,000-strong workforce.IAG said it did not expect BA to see passenger demand return to 2019 levels for ""several years"". Elsewhere, Easyjet has laid off its 4,000 UK-based cabin crew for two months, Qantas has put 20,000 staff on leave, and 700 pilots at American Airlines have agreed to take early retirement. Even so, attention is now gradually turning to the future, and how airlines around the world can hope to slowly return to something approaching normality. It remains to be seen how and when currently empty airports can return to normal There are obvious logistical challenges. Aircraft need to be prepared for flight, and airports made ready to receive them. Schedules need to be drawn up, and staff made available. But there are also less predictable issues to contend with. No-one can be quite sure yet where aircraft will be allowed to fly to, or what conditions might be imposed on staff and passengers by national authorities. There are currently around 17,000 aircraft parked up at airports around the world, according to consultants Ascend by Cirium. That represents about two-thirds of the global fleet. BA, for example, has aeroplanes stored at London Heathrow, at its maintenance base in Cardiff, on taxiways at regional airportssuch as Bournemouth,and at Chateauroux airport in France. Even while parked, these aircraft require regular maintenance. Some will have been kept ready for immediate use. Many airlines have been carrying out repatriation flights, for example, or ad-hoc cargo services. But others will take a week or longer to prepare for flight, according to people within the industry. If all those aircraft were needed at once, getting them ready would be a formidable challenge. However, analysts say in practice this is unlikely to be the case - because most airlines will start off by operating relatively limited schedules, and many aircraft will not actually be needed for months to come. A further significant issue is the raft of human qualifications needed to allow the industry to function. Pilots, for example, need time in the air, or in the simulator, to maintain their ""ratings"", or permits to fly specific aircraft. They also need regular medical checks.  Other critical staff, such as air traffic control personnel and engineers, have time-limited qualifications as well. Some pilots may need to spend some time in a simulator before then can fly again Although many airlines and airports are trying to ensure they still have a core of staff available with up-to-date certificates - those who are involved in dealing with repatriation and cargo flights, for example - others have been unable to continue working. In the UK, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has already taken steps to prevent a backlog of expired credentials from undermining attempts to get planes back in the air as quickly as possible. ""Due to the extraordinary current circumstances, an exemption has been put in place,"" a spokesperson said. ""Where possible, we expect pilots to remain current through normal methods. If the exemption is being deployed, an airline must illustrate to us how this is being done safely."" Similar measures have been put in place for other key staff. Airports rely on passenger shopping for much of their income But while there are clear logistical problems involved with getting thousands of aircraft back into service, and ensuring there are enough pilots and technicians to go around, these are not the main issues keeping aviation executives awake at night. The real problem, executives say, is the number of different countries that have introduced travel restrictions, and the lack of certainty over when those restrictions will be removed. ""What we are trying to do is have a global restart plan,"" explains Alexandre de Juniac, director general of the International Air Transport Association. ""The main challenge is how and when the different states will lift restrictions to travel."" He believes curbs on travel will clearly last beyond the middle of the year, and some may remain at least partially in force until the end of 2020. He thinks domestic routes within individual countries will open up first, followed by short-haul international services. Intercontinental travel would probably follow after that, although he admits ""that is a point we haven't resolved yet"". One area causing a great deal of uncertainty is the extent to which social distancing will be required when regular flying resumes. This video can not be played Will thermal cameras help to end the lockdown? How will people be separated in airport lounges, in security queues, or in the airports themselves? What tests will be required, and how will they be carried out? This is a commercial issue for both airports and airlines. For example, retail outlets and restaurants provide a lucrative source of revenues for airport operators. ""Non-aeronautical revenues are really important to airports,"" says Karen Dee, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association. ""They enable us to keep down the charges we make to airlines, and ultimately that affects the ticket prices they can offer their customers. ""We don't want to reconfigure everything in our airports, only to find out in six months' time there's a vaccine and the new measures aren't needed any more."" IATA's argument is that whatever measures are introduced need to be the same and implemented in a co-ordinated fashion. ""We need to avoid the kind of situation that followed 9/11,"" says Mr de Juniac. ""Back then we saw a piling up of different kinds of security measures, and it took a very long time to put it together again in a more consistent way. And we still have different measures."" Airlines too could be squeezed. Lufthansa is already operating services where middle seats are left unoccupied in order to allow a certain degree of social distancing on board. EasyJet - which has grounded its entire fleet - says it will do the same when it resumes flying. On the Lufthansa flights that are flying, it is trying to keep passengers isolated by not using its middle seats As a short-term measure, this might help passengers fly with a little more confidence. But it comes at a serious cost. In order to make money, airlines need as many seats as possible to be filled on every flight. ""Load factors"" are particularly important for budget carriers, which typically fly with more than 90% of seats occupied. But if middle seats are left unoccupied, aircraft will have to fly just 65% full.  This might be acceptable for a short period, but according to Mr De Juniac, if it went on for long, ""it would certainly change the way in which the industry operates"". Ryanair's CEO Michael O""Leary has put it more succinctly,describing the idea as ""idiotic"",external. In the UK the government is considering forcing all passengers arriving in the country to spend two weeks in quarantine. The industry association Airlines UK says such a plan would ""effectively kill international travel to and from the UK, and cause immeasurable damage to the aviation industry and wider UK economy"". More from theBBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Developing world economies hit hard by coronavirus Seafarers in limbo as coronavirus hits shipping Will we ever take cruise holidays again? Will coronavirus reverse globalisation? How are food supply networks coping with coronavirus? Getting aircraft back in the air may prove to be the easy part. Finding people to fly in them could prove more difficult - and some long-term changes to the aviation market are highly likely. ""It may not be too bad for firms which specialise in holiday travel,"" explains one tourism industry executive. ""People still want to go on holiday, and there's definitely still interest in going to short-haul destinations later in the year."" But analysts say business travel could be a different matter. High-paying business and first class travellers usually account for a little under a third of the revenues for the industry as a whole. For long-haul carriers, it can be as much as 70%. But there are now serious threats to that traffic. How quickly lucrative business class travel gets back to normal could be key The predicted global recession, the cancellation of major trade fairs and other set-piece events - and even the new willingness of businesses to use online tools as a substitute for face-to-face meetings - could all delay the recovery. ""I think we'll see a fusing of business models, and airlines trying different things,"" says analyst John Strickland of JLS Consulting. ""So you could see a sort of business class-lite, where people get a business class seat and meals, but no access to lounges. So at least the seat is occupied. There's room for a lot of creative pricing."" But the biggest problem for the entire industry, as it prepares to get back in the air, is that no-one - at any level - can really be sure what its future looks like.

The considerations necessary are wide-ranging, from managing already strained resources to sourcing extra protective equipment and figuring out the logistics of safely evacuating at-risk populations - even how to cajole evacuees, who might be fearful of catching the virus, from their homes. This week, 10,000 residents were evacuated in Michigan after two dams collapsed following days of heavy rain.

People banged pans in the street in protests against Spain's coronavirus measures Protestors in Spain have continued their nightly banging of pots and pans as the government extended the national state of emergency for the fifth time. Spaniards against the coronavirus restrictions register their dissatisfaction with the country's left-wing minority government every day at 21:00 local time. The state of emergency has been extended for a further two weeks. Shops have begun to open in most of the country apart from Barcelona and Madrid, but travel between provinces remains limited. Spain is one of the hardest-hit countries by coronavirus and had one of the strictest lockdowns, with children kept indoors for six weeks. Nearly 28,000 people have died from Covid-19. On Thursday,new rules about wearing face masks come into force. It will be compulsory for everyone to wear a mask indoors and outdoors where social distancing is not possible - the exemptions are children under six and people with health conditions, including asthma and anxiety. But children aged three to five are still encouraged to wear face coverings.

For much of April, one of its residents, Ghouse Fazaluddin, was consumed by one thought: ""We couldn't just stand back and watch our dead be buried in mass graves."" Using his background as a telecoms project manager, he set to work. A WhatsApp group was created and volunteers from the Jamia mosque in Newham, east London, where Mr Fazaluddin is a trustee, were recruited. The task in hand was essential, but grim. There had been so many deaths that a backlog of bodies had built up and people were required to prepare each person for burial. Mr Fazaluddin says: ""The common goal was, we cannot forget our deceased, we cannot just leave them to be buried without the ritual washing that takes place, and that people's dignity, the dignity of the deceased, was preserved."" Read more on Newham Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Inside Downing Street there is an acute awareness that the gradual move out of the lockdown is going to be much more complicated than slamming the doors in the first place. That's the case both in terms of creating plans and policies that give people enough reassurance to take tiny steps to start to get back to normal, only weeks after the peak of a terrible disease, and trying to do so without taking on too much political water, when the consensus that shaped the start of the crisis has already started to fray. And the ongoing tussle over England's return to schools is perhaps the first big test. Read more from Laura. Brazil currently has the third largest number of cases in the world Two controversial anti-malarial drugs have been approved for use in coronavirus patients by Brazil's health ministry. No conclusive evidence exists that the two drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, are effective in treating Covid-19. Patients will need to sign a waiver recognising the potential side effects. In March Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro claimed on social media that hydroxychloroquine was totally effective in treating the virus -Facebook and Twitter later deleted his postsfor spreading fake news. On Monday US President Donald Trump announced he had beentaking hydroxychloroquine as a preventative measure. But the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says the drug has ""not been shown to be safe and effective"". ""We need larger, high-quality randomised clinical trialsin order to better evaluate their effectiveness,"" says University of Oxford's Kome Gbinigie, author of a report on anti-malarial testing for Covid-19. There are risks of serious side effects from the drugs, affecting the eyes and the heart among other organs.

Police chiefs want fines in Wales to be the same as England Maximum fixed penalty notices in Wales for breaching lockdown will rise to Â£1,920, the Welsh Government has confirmed. First Minister Mark Drakeford has faced calls to raise the penalties to deter breaches. Initial fines will remain at Â£60, but will double for each subsequent offence up to the sixth occurrence. But Plaid Cymru police and crime commissioners say calls to match England's higher fines structure - starting at Â£100 - have been rejected. Individuals who do not pay the notice could be taken to court, with magistrates able to impose unlimited fines. Miners are among the key workers who have been allowed to carry on in South Africa At least40,000 people could die with coronavirus in South Africaby the end of the year, scientists have warned. The projections were made by a modelling consortium set up to help government planning over the outbreak and assume that tough restrictions will be eased from 1 June, as President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced. The curbs - which include a ban on alcohol and tobacco sales - have been credited with slowing the spread of the virus, with 17,200 cases and 312 deathsreported so far,,externalway less than the figures in Spain, which has a smaller population. While President Ramaphosa has said lockdown regulations would be eased from ""level 4"" to ""level 3"" from early June, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize has said that according to the World Health Organization, South Africa is not yet ready for level 3 because infections continue to rise every day. The opposition party is taking the government to court, arguing that the stringent regulations are unwarranted and the ban on alcohol and tobacco sales should be lifted. Bolivia's health minister is being investigated over the purchase of overpriced ventilators for Covid-19 patients. Marcelo Navajas and four other officials are being questioned by police about the purchase of some 170 ventilators from a Spanish firm.

Mr Navajas earlier told leading Bolivian newspaper La Razon the purchase had been ""transparent"". The Latin American country has reported 4,481 cases of coronavirus and 189 deaths. Police in Macau - a special administrative region of China - have rejected a request to hold an annual Tiananmen Square massacre vigil, citing concerns over the coronavirus, local media report. It will the first time in 30 years that the vigil will not take place, according toMacau Business,external. The group that organises the vigil, the Democratic Development Union (DDU), said it would challenge the decision in court. Macau, a former Portuguese colony and a near neighbour of Hong Kong, has not had any new cases of Covid-19 for 41 days, reports say. Vigils are held annually in Macau and Hong Kong to commemorate the victims of Tiananmen Square.  The victims were students and workers who, in 1989, occupied Beijing's Tiananmen Square in a massive pro-democracy protest. Many were killed in a brutal clampdown by the communist authorities. On Tuesday, Hong Kong authorities extended social-distancing measures until at least 4 June, throwing plans for mass gatherings to mark the occasion into doubt.

early or temporarily to help contain the spread of Covid-19 in prisons. Jessica Vicsik, 25, was one of those released temporarily from Womenâs
Huron Valley Correctional Facility in Michigan, US, on 15 April. âItâs a nightmare in there,"" she told BBC OS. ""We canât go in or out. The
guards, doctors and nurses come in and out every day, and thatâs how we were
getting [Covid-19]. They didnât start wearing protective equipment for a couple
of weeks. âWe pregnant women â four of us were trapped inside with no
doors open, no windows, and it was affecting us. I was told itâs so much worse
out here, which it is because thereâs a lot more people and itâs open. But at
the same time, thatâs our family. We know where our people are going â we donât
know where they (the guards) are going.â In response, a representative for the facility said: âThe CDC
(Centre for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines said people did not have
to wear masks at the beginning of this outbreak. When the guidance changed from
the federal government, we provided every prisoner and every prison employee
with three masks and required they wear them every day. ""We have also done mass testing at nearly every prison in
the state and by the end of this week we will have tested every prisoner in the

"British Airways consults unions over proposals to cut hundreds of jobs in south Wales Students and apprentices may keep attending virtual classes online for ""some time"" in a staged return to post-16 education in Wales Some young carers have been shouted at by shoppers and stopped from going into supermarkets during the pandemic, a charity says A health board says it is reviewing cases after mental health patients were discharged and advised to seek new referrals after the crisis eased Nurses in Gwynedd and Denbighshire are using an app to send photos and updates to the parents of premature and ill babies Another 14 deaths of people with coronavirus in Wales were confirmed by Public Health Wales on Wednesday, taking its total to 1,238 Max Evans, Bruce Pope and Andy Roberts That is it for today's live page coverage of the coronavirus crisis in Wales. Here are some of the key points from Wednesday: Thanks for joining us - we will be back with more news and updates in the morning. Economy Minister Ken Skates has told BBC Wales that399 jobs at British Airways sites in south Wales could be made redundantunder company proposals. The firm had indicated earlier on Wednesday that more than 1,000 jobs were at risk. BA maintains its long-haul fleet at Cardiff Airport, and has an interiors factory at Blackwood, and an avionics services site in Llantrisant. Stephen Powis, medical director at NHS England, has told today's UK government press conference that, despite an increase in the rate of daily testing, the number of new cases identified is ""stable, or perhaps even falling"" across the UK. This shows the prevalence of the virus in the population is continuing to fall, he adds. Unveiling the slide below, he says the number of people in hospital after a positive test is below 10,000 for the first time since March. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has backed the principle of
setting up an âindependent public inquiryâ into the handling of the coronavirus
pandemic. Mr Drakeford said he had no doubt âthat an independent
inquiry will be required at the right point in that processâ. In a virtual meeting of the Senedd Plaid Cymru leader Adam
Price pressed Mr Drakeford to give timescales for when it would start. ""Could you make some general commitments today to the principle of setting up an independent public inquiry in due course?"" he asked. Mr Drakeford said: âI'm not able to anticipate when that will be, but the
principle that Mr Price has outlined - I'm very happy to confirm my support for
that principle."" Adam Price said the Welsh Government was now âthe first
government within the UK to agree to such an inquiryâ. âDisappointingly, however, the first minister failed to give
any details on when that inquiry will begin."" A schoolgirl in south Wales has written what a local politician calls a ""very moving"" essay to highlight the work of the many heroes of the pandemic. Freya, from Pontypool, listed heroes including her mother caring for her family, along with couriers, bus drivers and NHS workers who had lost their lives. She said their work should not be forgotten, adding: ""Not all heroes wear capes."" The essay was shared on Twitter by Lynne Neagle, member of the Senedd (MS) for Torfaen. Allow Twitter content?

A further 363 deaths of people with coronavirus have been recorded across the UK in the past 24 hours, the UK secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport has said. Oliver Dowden announced the figure at today's UK government briefing. That takes the number of those testing positive who have died so far, according to Department of Health figures, to 35,704, although it is widely accepted that the overall figure is much higher. The culture secretary also confirms 177,216 tests were carried out in the past 24 hours. Thatâs the biggest daily total to date and a huge increase on yesterdayâs figure of just below 100,000. This, however, does not correspond to the number of people actually tested as some individuals are tested more than once. ""Brave leadership"" from the Welsh and UK governments is needed to ensure at-risk British Airways workers have a job to return to, an MS has said. Former Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said news that1,000 south Wales BA jobs were under threatwas ""devastating"". ""The aviation industry has taken a hammer blow due to coronavirus,"" said Mr Davies, member of the Senedd (MS) for South Wales Central. ""Hardworking people at BA in the region will be horribly hit by this news. ""These are high-skilled jobs which will not be easily replaced in our area and this reinforces the importance of getting the economy up and running once again. ""An economic tsunami is heading our way and this is only the first wave. We need brave leadership at Westminster and Cardiff Bay to ensure people have jobs to return to."" Andrew RT Davies: ""These are high-skilled jobs which will not be easily replaced"" Two of Monmouthshire's four recycling centres will reopen next Tuesday but the council has said people need topre-book before visiting,external. The tips at Llanfoist near Abergavenny and Five Lanes near Caerwent will reopen but for ""essential trips only."" The facilities at Mitchel Troy near Monmouth and Usk remain shut.

He was stopped on the A483 near Wrexham, the force said. The threat to 1,000 jobs at British Airways sites in south Wales is ""unlawful"", a trade union has claimed. The airline hasstarted a 45-day consultationwith workers at its three Welsh sites - including BA's main Â£70m maintenance base at Cardiff Airport. Richard Munn, regional officer for Unite said: ""âThis announcement by BA will have a devastating impact on our members and their families. ""It will also cause enormous hurt to the economy of south east Wales and communities that still bear scars from the de-industrialisation of the 1980s and 1990s."" Mr Munn said the proposed cuts were combined with a ""clear statement of intent to worsen terms and conditions and employment policies"". He said many of those at risk of redundancy had been furloughed under the UK governmentâs Job Retention Scheme, which he said was is ""clearly designed to 'retain' jobs"". ""It also means that meaningful consultation is impossible,"" he added. ""Unite therefore regard the consultation as unlawful and are demanding that BA rescind the notices of redundancy and enter in to meaningful talks with Unite. ""Unite will be doing all it can to support its members in BA at this present timeâ. South Wales Police have warned people to check their local waste and recycling centre is open before heading there to dispose of rubbish. While some tips have now reopened, South Wales Police tweeted to say it was by no means the case with all. ""Each council has different processes in place for allowing entry, so please check beforehand,"" they said.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A worker at the British Airways site in Blackwood has described news that more than 1,000 jobs are at risk at the firm's south Wales sites as ""gutting"". BA has started a 45-day consultation with workers based at Llantrisant, Blackwood and Cardiff Airport. âThese are decent jobs round here and I just donât know what the guys in there will do now,"" said the employee, who did not wish to be named. âItâs a very sombre mood. It really is.â Many people outside Wales ""appear to have woken up from a 20-year sleep"" over the reality of devolution, Wales' first minister has said. Most of the lockdown powers for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland rest with their respective devolved governments rather than UK ministers, who are only entirely responsible for the regulations in England. Mark Drakeford told a virtual Senedd meeting he thought devolution had been ""brought home to people in this crisis in a way that it hasn't been over the last 20 years"". He was answering a question from Mark Reckess, leader of the Brexit Party in the Welsh Parliament, who said a ""significant number of people in Wales are only now recognising the extent"" to which powers had transferred from London to Cardiff. Mr Reckless told Mr Drakeford ""many"" people would ""prefer the British prime minister to take key decisions, rather than you"". Mr Drakeford responded: ""I doubt that it is true [to say] that in Wales people aren't aware of devolution. ""It is certainly true that people outside Wales and in London appear to have woken up from a 20-year sleep on that devolution agenda.""  Mark Drakeford said the Covid-19 crisis had ""brought home"" to many people how much power was now devolved A rainbow with the words ""Cheers, drive"" has been added to the road where bus drivers leave a depot during the Covid-19 pandemic by their bosses.

The plan to begin reopening schools in England from 1 June is ""falling apart in the hands of the government of England"", Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said some primary schools could reopen to some year groups from that date. But the UK government, which oversees education in England, isfacing pressure from councils and unionsover safety and timing. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has said No 10 was taking all concerns ""very seriously"". In today's virtual session of the Welsh Parliament, Mr Drakeford said setting such timescales offered ""no guarantee"" in progress towards exiting the coronavirus lockdown. ""Look how the 1st June timetable for opening schools in England is falling apart in the hands of the government of England, how Downing Street last night had to say that the first of June was an aspiration, not a deadline, not a timescale after all,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""In the end we thought it was more of a distraction than a concentration on the matters that really deserve our attention."" Mr Drakeford was replying to a question from Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Paul Davies, who criticised the Welsh Goverment for not setting out timescales to exit lockdown. ""There is a genuine debate to be had as to whether timescales are a helpful way of setting out the future,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""Timescales are no guarantee, are they, as Mr Davies will well know."" In the earlier daily Welsh Government press conference, Education Minister Kirsty Williams said she would not set an ""arbitrary date"" for when children could return to school in Wales. Consumers""may never shop the same way again"" following the
coronavirus crisis, the boss of Marks and Spencer has said. Steve Rowe's comments came as the retailer said clothing and homeware sales had fallen by 75% in the six weeks to 9 May. Food sales also fell, by 8.8%, although M&S said many of its Simply Food stores were trading strongly. The update came as M&S said its profits for the year to March had dropped by more than 20%. Pre-tax profits fell to Â£403m from Â£511m in the previous year, as M&S's troubled clothing business continued to struggle. A driver has been fined after travelling some 200 miles (320km) from south east England to a Welsh beauty spot, police have said. South Wales Police tweeted an image of the motorist's car, after they allegedly breached Covid-19 lockdown restrictions in the Vale of Glamorgan.

Brian MeechanBBC Wales business correspondent British Airways is consulting with unions onproposals to cut more than 1,000 jobs in south Wales. This is confirmation of terrible news for BA workers. Job losses are expected across the aerospace and defence industry which employs 23,000 people in Wales. The industry has already been badly hit by coronavirus and it's almost certain that it will take years to fully recover. The umbrella body, Aerospace Wales, told MPs last week that up to 8,000 jobs could go here. BA's maintenance facility at Rhoose in the Vale of Glamorgan services the company's long-haul fleet of planes. These flights are the ones that passengers are expected to take longer to return to, so demand for these planes may be reduced for years. The facility is also a user of the Welsh Government-owned Cardiff Airport where the BA planes arrive for service.

BA had said it would cut 12,000 in total from its operations. There have also been warnings of global job losses at Airbus and GE Aviation.

Both companies are major employers in Wales. Wales' chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton has issued this timely reminder of what people in Wales can and cannot do as temperatures soar on Wednesday. He says we still can't gather in groups, visit beauty spots or meet people we don't live with. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Customers ""may never shop the same way again"" after the coronavirus crisis, Marks and Spencer's boss has said. ""Whilst some customer habits will return to normal, others have changed forever,"" Steve Rowe said. The pandemic has driven several changes, including a shift to online, customers cooking more from scratch and buying more casual clothing. T-shirt bras and bathroom products online sales have risen, while it is barely selling any suits or ties. The retailer has also found that as shoppers are visiting the shops less, they are planning what to eat further in advance, and also buying more herbs and whole vegetables. It said that customers are buying bigger product packs, such as of strawberries or chicken. Sales of frozen items are also up by 75% on the year in the UK. M&S added that online shoppers were now browsing earlier in the day, between 15:00 and 17:00. As more customers work from home, desktop visits were also up 38% in comparison with the same period last year. Marks & Spencer cafes to reopen for takeaway Marks & Spencer extends 30-minute home delivery service But M&S is one of the few big food retailers without its own internet-based delivery service. This has hampered the chain as customers have needed to purchase items online during lockdown if they are self-isolating, for example. However, the retailer's partnership with Ocado starts in September this year, replacing the online grocer's existing deal with Waitrose. In a new announcement, M&S said the delivery service would also include over a thousand non-food items meaning customers will soon be able to buy cushions or underwear alongside their eggs or bread. M&S has signed a food delivery partnership with Ocado Mr Rowe said that Ocado's strong performance during lockdown ""further reinforced"" the value of the deal for delivering groceries. The impact of the virus lockdown has driven ""effects and aftershocks"" in the retail sector that would ""endure for the coming year and beyond,"" Mr Rowe added. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: ""Covid-19 has accelerated lots of consumer trends and it may just be the catalyst required to accelerate Marks and Spencer's transformation into a 21st century retailer. ""In particular it looks as though M&S has learnt just how important online is - so it's making its Ocado venture more central to the business."" M&S was already undergoing a transformation plan led by its chief executive Steve Rowe which included cutting costs and closing some stores. The firm said that due to the pandemic, those measures would be sped up under a programme called ""Never The Same Again"". Those include buying clothing from fewer core suppliers, reducing the clothing and home ranges, as well as ""the replacement of ageing stores"". ""The trauma of the Covid-19 crisis has galvanised our colleagues to secure the future of the business,"" said Mr Rowe. The company has been facing increasing competition from fashion giants such as Primark on the High Street and Asos on the internet in recent years. In the year to March, M&S said its clothing sales fell by 6.2%, whereas its food sales were up 1.9%. To add to its problems, M&S's non-food stores have been forced to shut under the lockdown measures. As a result, it faces a ""mounting backlog of unsold stock"" in its warehouses, it said. Clothing and homeware sales fell by 75% in the six weeks to 9 May. Food sales also fell, by 8.8%, although M&S said many of its Simply Food stores were trading strongly. The firm said that lockdown measures, social distancing and lower consumer demand were ""likely to continue through the year"", adding that the coronavirus pandemic means that its performance over the next year is difficult to predict. It is working on a scenario that assumes a sales hit of Â£2.1bn over the next year across clothing, home, food and international sales. Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Overall, M&S was facing challenges before coronavirus and these have simply been exacerbated. ""Within the difficulties there are real opportunities too, and the group appears to have a lot of the right ideas, but the next chapter really needs to be about execution."" Its comments came as M&S said its profits for the year to March had dropped by more than 20% to Â£403m, from Â£511m in the previous year, as its troubled clothing business continued to struggle.

House of CommonsParliament MPs have moved on from their debate about theworkings of parliament during coronavirus. The Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove is now making a statement on the government's post-Brexit proposals for the Northern Ireland border. You can read more about the plans - and what Mr Gove says about them -here. House of CommonsParliament Back to the debate on ending virtual sittings of parliament, Labour's Valerie Vaz also says the proposed return of MPs on 2 June is premature. The shadow Commons leader says the resumption of physical working should be phased-in over a longer period. She questions whether the government is contradicting its own advice, which currently states people should work from home where they can. She says MPs living hundreds of miles away from Westminster will struggle to participate due to reduced train services and flights. ""This is not a battle of the government good and everyone else bad or shirkers versus workers as some ministers have said,"" she says. ""This about Parliament being a good model employer."" Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent Boris Johnson is the kind of politician who feeds off a crowd, and after a bit of a pummelling from the Labour leader last week there were more Conservative MPs around to offer vocal support, during this week's PMQs. Sir Keir Starmer focused his forensic questions on care homes and had plenty of supporting material from those who work in the sector. He extracted another government target from the PM, this time on test and trace. But significantly the emphasis now is on human contact tracers, rather than the app that ministers hoped would be at the centre of a new system. In the early days of this epidemic, as politicians tried to grasp the enormity of what was happening, exchanges in the Commons were all about consensus. Those days have gone. This occasion was more fractious, with Mr Johnson taking on the Labour leader more aggressively. He even urged him to be more positive, suggesting thatâs what the public wanted. House of CommonsParliament Here is a round-up of what came up in this week's PMQs: House of CommonsParliament Mr Rees-Mogg has finished his brief statement and the opposition are now having their say. Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem MP for Orkney and Shetland, suggests the government is acting in haste and is being irresponsible, given the fact that nearly 35,000 people are known to have died during the pandemic and the figure is likely to be much higher. He says if there is a choice between the current somewhat artificial proceedings in Parliament and ""putting the safety of MPs at risk...that is no choice at all"". The current ways of working should only end ""when it is safe to do so"" and when all MPs can safely be present ""not just those who live within driving distance"" of London. Reality Check During prime minister's questions, the Prime Minister said: âWe will get up to 200,000 tests in this country by the end of this month.â However, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock spoke in Parliament earlier this week of: âour new goal of a total capacity of 200,000 tests a dayâ. It is unclear whether the target is to conduct 200,000 tests per day or to have that as capacity in the system. Itâs more than a week since thestatistical regulator the UK Statistics Authority wrote to Mr Hancock,externalto ask for clarification of whether that target is for testing capacity, the number of tests administered, the number of tests completed or the number of people tested. He hasnât yet replied.  House of CommonsParliament Mr Rees-Mogg assures MPs that the Commons will not be returning to business as usual despite his call for the current temporary hybrid proceedings not to be renewed. There will not be a return to the ""crowded, bustling chamber of old"", he says, given that social distancing measures will be in force. When Parliament returns from its Whitsun recess in early June, he says the current limits on the number of MPs able to sit in the Chamber - which is currently capped at 50 - will largely stay in place. He also talks about hygiene and other procedures to ensure the Palace of Westminster will be safe for MPs and their staff. House of CommonsParliament The Commons leader starts by praising the Speaker's efforts in setting up the current hybrid ways of working - in which much of the business is being done remotely - which he said allowed the House to keep going at the height of pandemic in late April and early May. But Mr Rees-Mogg says the current ways of working have not allowed MPs to do their jobs properly, leading to ""stilted, scripted"" debates and a big reduction in the scrutiny of legislation. House of CommonsParliament PMQs has finished. Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg is now making a statement on his proposal to ask MPs to return to largely physical proceedings in the Commons early next month. Reality Check At PMQs, Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer clashed over the guidance on discharging patients from hospitals to care homes in England, during the coronavirus pandemic. In mid-March, hospitals were encouraged to empty hospital beds where they could â to prepare for an expected surge in cases. On 2 April,the rules on discharging patients to care homes were clarified,externalto say patients would not need a negative coronavirus test to be sent to care homes. Those with positive tests could also be discharged, with necessary precautions. It wasnât until 15 April that the government said all patients being discharged from hospitalshould be tested for coronavirus.,external NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, says itâs âuntrueâ that patients with coronavirus were âsystematicallyâ discharged to care homes. However, it says itâs possible âa very small numberâ of patients who were not displaying symptoms - and who hospitals hadnât been able to test before mid-April - were sent there. You can read our full timeline of government advice here. House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Lucy Allan asks about youth unemployment and the impact of coronavirus on young people. ""Will he ensure the recovery strategy will focus on young
people?"" She asks. Mr Johnson says they will be supporting young people with a ""new
national skills fund"" worth Â£2.5bn. House of CommonsParliament Conservative Tom Randall asks if the government will establish a medal for NHS workers and ""those who have gone above and beyond"" in the fight against coronavirus. ""We are thinking about how to recognise health care staff,"" replies Boris Johnson. House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Richard Drax asks about Huawei and 5G, in light of France's review of its defence supply chain. Mr Johnson says he is ""right to be concerned"" about the buying up of UK technology by countries that may have ""ulterior motives"". He says they are bringing forward measures to protect the UK's technological base and they will hear more on this over the next few weeks. Hereâs more onwhat is Huaweiand what
will its role be in the rollout of 5G in the UK. House of CommonsParliament SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford also asks about the surcharge for overseas NHS workers and the government's immigration bill. ""Given their sacrifice is he not embarrassed this is how his government chooses to treat NHS workers,"" he asks. The PM replies that he wants ""an immigration system that will work for the people of this country"". Blackford accuses the PM of being ""hell bent"" on implementing a highly ideological immigration policy. Boris Johnson says the SNP wants an ""border at Berwick"". Allow Twitter content?

House of CommonsParliament MPs have moved on from their debate about theworkings of parliament during coronavirus. The Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove is now making a statement on the government's post-Brexit proposals for the Northern Ireland border. You can read more about the plans - and what Mr Gove says about them -here. House of CommonsParliament Back to the debate on ending virtual sittings of parliament, Labour's Valerie Vaz also says the proposed return of MPs on 2 June is premature. The shadow Commons leader says the resumption of physical working should be phased-in over a longer period. She questions whether the government is contradicting its own advice, which currently states people should work from home where they can. She says MPs living hundreds of miles away from Westminster will struggle to participate due to reduced train services and flights. ""This is not a battle of the government good and everyone else bad or shirkers versus workers as some ministers have said,"" she says. ""This about Parliament being a good model employer."" Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent Boris Johnson is the kind of politician who feeds off a crowd, and after a bit of a pummelling from the Labour leader last week there were more Conservative MPs around to offer vocal support, during this week's PMQs. Sir Keir Starmer focused his forensic questions on care homes and had plenty of supporting material from those who work in the sector. He extracted another government target from the PM, this time on test and trace. But significantly the emphasis now is on human contact tracers, rather than the app that ministers hoped would be at the centre of a new system. In the early days of this epidemic, as politicians tried to grasp the enormity of what was happening, exchanges in the Commons were all about consensus. Those days have gone. This occasion was more fractious, with Mr Johnson taking on the Labour leader more aggressively. He even urged him to be more positive, suggesting thatâs what the public wanted. House of CommonsParliament Here is a round-up of what came up in this week's PMQs: House of CommonsParliament Mr Rees-Mogg has finished his brief statement and the opposition are now having their say. Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem MP for Orkney and Shetland, suggests the government is acting in haste and is being irresponsible, given the fact that nearly 35,000 people are known to have died during the pandemic and the figure is likely to be much higher. He says if there is a choice between the current somewhat artificial proceedings in Parliament and ""putting the safety of MPs at risk...that is no choice at all"". The current ways of working should only end ""when it is safe to do so"" and when all MPs can safely be present ""not just those who live within driving distance"" of London. Reality Check During prime minister's questions, the Prime Minister said: âWe will get up to 200,000 tests in this country by the end of this month.â However, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock spoke in Parliament earlier this week of: âour new goal of a total capacity of 200,000 tests a dayâ. It is unclear whether the target is to conduct 200,000 tests per day or to have that as capacity in the system. Itâs more than a week since thestatistical regulator the UK Statistics Authority wrote to Mr Hancock,externalto ask for clarification of whether that target is for testing capacity, the number of tests administered, the number of tests completed or the number of people tested. He hasnât yet replied.  House of CommonsParliament Mr Rees-Mogg assures MPs that the Commons will not be returning to business as usual despite his call for the current temporary hybrid proceedings not to be renewed. There will not be a return to the ""crowded, bustling chamber of old"", he says, given that social distancing measures will be in force. When Parliament returns from its Whitsun recess in early June, he says the current limits on the number of MPs able to sit in the Chamber - which is currently capped at 50 - will largely stay in place. He also talks about hygiene and other procedures to ensure the Palace of Westminster will be safe for MPs and their staff. House of CommonsParliament The Commons leader starts by praising the Speaker's efforts in setting up the current hybrid ways of working - in which much of the business is being done remotely - which he said allowed the House to keep going at the height of pandemic in late April and early May. But Mr Rees-Mogg says the current ways of working have not allowed MPs to do their jobs properly, leading to ""stilted, scripted"" debates and a big reduction in the scrutiny of legislation. House of CommonsParliament PMQs has finished. Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg is now making a statement on his proposal to ask MPs to return to largely physical proceedings in the Commons early next month. Reality Check At PMQs, Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer clashed over the guidance on discharging patients from hospitals to care homes in England, during the coronavirus pandemic. In mid-March, hospitals were encouraged to empty hospital beds where they could â to prepare for an expected surge in cases. On 2 April,the rules on discharging patients to care homes were clarified,externalto say patients would not need a negative coronavirus test to be sent to care homes. Those with positive tests could also be discharged, with necessary precautions. It wasnât until 15 April that the government said all patients being discharged from hospitalshould be tested for coronavirus.,external NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, says itâs âuntrueâ that patients with coronavirus were âsystematicallyâ discharged to care homes. However, it says itâs possible âa very small numberâ of patients who were not displaying symptoms - and who hospitals hadnât been able to test before mid-April - were sent there. You can read our full timeline of government advice here. House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Lucy Allan asks about youth unemployment and the impact of coronavirus on young people. ""Will he ensure the recovery strategy will focus on young
people?"" She asks. Mr Johnson says they will be supporting young people with a ""new
national skills fund"" worth Â£2.5bn. House of CommonsParliament Conservative Tom Randall asks if the government will establish a medal for NHS workers and ""those who have gone above and beyond"" in the fight against coronavirus. ""We are thinking about how to recognise health care staff,"" replies Boris Johnson. House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Richard Drax asks about Huawei and 5G, in light of France's review of its defence supply chain. Mr Johnson says he is ""right to be concerned"" about the buying up of UK technology by countries that may have ""ulterior motives"". He says they are bringing forward measures to protect the UK's technological base and they will hear more on this over the next few weeks. Hereâs more onwhat is Huaweiand what
will its role be in the rollout of 5G in the UK. House of CommonsParliament SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford also asks about the surcharge for overseas NHS workers and the government's immigration bill. ""Given their sacrifice is he not embarrassed this is how his government chooses to treat NHS workers,"" he asks. The PM replies that he wants ""an immigration system that will work for the people of this country"". Blackford accuses the PM of being ""hell bent"" on implementing a highly ideological immigration policy. Boris Johnson says the SNP wants an ""border at Berwick"". Allow Twitter content?

"Customers ""may never shop the same way again"" after the coronavirus crisis, Marks and Spencer's boss has said. ""Whilst some customer habits will return to normal, others have changed forever,"" Steve Rowe said. The pandemic has driven several changes, including a shift to online, customers cooking more from scratch and buying more casual clothing. T-shirt bras and bathroom products online sales have risen, while it is barely selling any suits or ties. The retailer has also found that as shoppers are visiting the shops less, they are planning what to eat further in advance, and also buying more herbs and whole vegetables. It said that customers are buying bigger product packs, such as of strawberries or chicken. Sales of frozen items are also up by 75% on the year in the UK. M&S added that online shoppers were now browsing earlier in the day, between 15:00 and 17:00. As more customers work from home, desktop visits were also up 38% in comparison with the same period last year. Marks & Spencer cafes to reopen for takeaway Marks & Spencer extends 30-minute home delivery service But M&S is one of the few big food retailers without its own internet-based delivery service. This has hampered the chain as customers have needed to purchase items online during lockdown if they are self-isolating, for example. However, the retailer's partnership with Ocado starts in September this year, replacing the online grocer's existing deal with Waitrose. In a new announcement, M&S said the delivery service would also include over a thousand non-food items meaning customers will soon be able to buy cushions or underwear alongside their eggs or bread. M&S has signed a food delivery partnership with Ocado Mr Rowe said that Ocado's strong performance during lockdown ""further reinforced"" the value of the deal for delivering groceries. The impact of the virus lockdown has driven ""effects and aftershocks"" in the retail sector that would ""endure for the coming year and beyond,"" Mr Rowe added. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: ""Covid-19 has accelerated lots of consumer trends and it may just be the catalyst required to accelerate Marks and Spencer's transformation into a 21st century retailer. ""In particular it looks as though M&S has learnt just how important online is - so it's making its Ocado venture more central to the business."" M&S was already undergoing a transformation plan led by its chief executive Steve Rowe which included cutting costs and closing some stores. The firm said that due to the pandemic, those measures would be sped up under a programme called ""Never The Same Again"". Those include buying clothing from fewer core suppliers, reducing the clothing and home ranges, as well as ""the replacement of ageing stores"". ""The trauma of the Covid-19 crisis has galvanised our colleagues to secure the future of the business,"" said Mr Rowe. The company has been facing increasing competition from fashion giants such as Primark on the High Street and Asos on the internet in recent years. In the year to March, M&S said its clothing sales fell by 6.2%, whereas its food sales were up 1.9%. To add to its problems, M&S's non-food stores have been forced to shut under the lockdown measures. As a result, it faces a ""mounting backlog of unsold stock"" in its warehouses, it said. Clothing and homeware sales fell by 75% in the six weeks to 9 May. Food sales also fell, by 8.8%, although M&S said many of its Simply Food stores were trading strongly. The firm said that lockdown measures, social distancing and lower consumer demand were ""likely to continue through the year"", adding that the coronavirus pandemic means that its performance over the next year is difficult to predict. It is working on a scenario that assumes a sales hit of Â£2.1bn over the next year across clothing, home, food and international sales. Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Overall, M&S was facing challenges before coronavirus and these have simply been exacerbated. ""Within the difficulties there are real opportunities too, and the group appears to have a lot of the right ideas, but the next chapter really needs to be about execution."" Its comments came as M&S said its profits for the year to March had dropped by more than 20% to Â£403m, from Â£511m in the previous year, as its troubled clothing business continued to struggle.

"The UK's inflation rate fell in April to its lowest since August 2016 as the economic fallout of the first month of the lockdown hit prices. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) fell to 0.8% from 1.5% in March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Falling petrol and diesel prices, plus lower energy bills, were the main drivers pushing inflation lower. But the prices of games and toys rose, which the ONS said may be due to people spending more time at home. However, there were 92 items in the ONS's basket of goods and services that it could not measure in April because they were mostly unavailable. These ranged from haircut prices, lemonade, manicures, cinema popcorn, and leisure activities involving sport. The ONS said it would monitor the issue for any distortion in the overall picture. But Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS, said: ""While the coronavirus limited the availability of some goods and services, its effect on prices was more muted."" He said that food prices generally rose no more quickly than other goods and services, ""though fresh vegetables did see stronger rises"". Sunak: No guarantee of quick economic bounceback Will coronavirus mean I have to pay more tax? What is the UK's inflation rate? The ONS said average petrol prices dropped by 10.4p a litre between March and April - the biggest fall since unleaded petrol records began in 1990 - amid a slump in global oil prices. Energy prices also pushed inflation lower as regulator Ofgem reduced its default tariff cap. The ONS said clothes retailers, hit during the early days of the lockdown by weaker footfall and then the closure of outlets, resorted to more discount sales than usual to try to shift their stock. Goods seeing upward pressure on prices included video games and consoles, board games and children's toys, the ONS said. And the price of knitting wool rose, another sign of the crafts and hobbies popular with people staying at home. Long-life products - such as cook-in sauces and frozen fish - also saw price hikes last month as consumers stocked up for life in lockdown. Laura Suter, personal finance analyst at investment platform AJ Bell, said it was likely that as shops start re-opening retailers would deeply discount prices, putting further downward pressure on inflation. She also pointed to positive news for savers. ""For the first time in ages [savers] can now get above inflation interest rates on easy-access savings accounts - from more than one account."" CPI is now far below the Bank of England's 2% target, used as general guidance to help businesses set the right prices and for people to plan their spending. But while low inflation reduces the need for rises in interest rates and gives people a feeling the pound in their pocket stretches further, it's possible to have too much of a good thing. Low inflation minimises the erosion of debt over the years. People (and governments) with borrowing, such as mortgages, don't see the benefit. That big loan you have doesn't look so big if wages are keeping up with inflation. So-called deflation actually increases the value the debts. But low inflation discourages employers from raising pay (which hits the Treasury's tax take) and may even encourage them to cut pay in troubled times. And if prices are falling, consumers can put off big ticket purchases in the hope the fall will continue - and this slows economic growth. Savers are also penalised. Low inflation generally means lower official interest rates - and that means banks and building societies keep their savings rates down. It's why, when inflation remains one percentage point below 2%, the governor of the Bank of England writes to the chancellor to explain how the price index can be brought back on target. There's a good reason a little inflation is good for the economy. Most economists had expected April's inflation to fall to 0.9%, and have predicted the rate will fall further as the economic fallout of the pandemic continues. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said inflation had taken a ""big leap towards zero by the summer"" as he said retailers were planning ""further large price cuts"". He predicted inflation would recover next year but was likely to remain below 2% for much of 2021. ""The inflation outlook, then, supports the [Bank of England's] Monetary Policy Committee doing more to stimulate the economy at its next meeting in mid-June - we look for a further Â£100bn of quantitative easing to be announced,"" he added. Core inflation, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, held broadly steady at an annual rate of 1.5%. Inflation as measured by the Retail Prices Index (RPI) - an older measure of inflation which the ONS says is inaccurate, but is widely used in bond markets and for other commercial contracts - dropped to 1.5% from 2.6%.

Thanks for reading!  Jessica Murphy, BBC News, Toronto Fire fighters will have to adjust how they work amid the pandemic Officials across North America are grappling with planning for floods, wildfires, hurricanes, severe heat waves and other extreme weather events this summer alongside the pandemic. The considerations necessary are wide-ranging, from managing already strained resources to sourcing extra protective equipment and figuring out the logistics of safely evacuating at-risk populations - even how to cajole evacuees, who might be fearful of catching the virus, from their homes. This week, 10,000 residents were evacuated in Michigan after two dams collapsed following days of heavy rain. Governor Gretchen Whitmer, noting the city of Midland in the US state could see historic high water levels, said: ""To go through this in the midst of a global pandemic is almost unthinkable.""

People banged pans in the street in protests against Spain's coronavirus measures Protestors in Spain have continued their nightly banging of pots and pans as the government extended the national state of emergency for the fifth time. Spaniards against the coronavirus restrictions register their dissatisfaction with the country's left-wing minority government every day at 21:00 local time. The state of emergency has been extended for a further two weeks. Shops have begun to open in most of the country apart from Barcelona and Madrid, but travel between provinces remains limited. Spain is one of the hardest-hit countries by coronavirus and had one of the strictest lockdowns, with children kept indoors for six weeks. Nearly 28,000 people have died from Covid-19. On Thursday,new rules about wearing face masks come into force. It will be compulsory for everyone to wear a mask indoors and outdoors where social distancing is not possible - the exemptions are children under six and people with health conditions, including asthma and anxiety. But children aged three to five are still encouraged to wear face coverings. Spain renewed its state of emergency on Wednesday for the fifth time With their studio closed to the public, Daryl Granger and his wife Karen found inspiration for their next project close to home - in their own backyard. The couple own and operate RoseLe Studio in Simcoe, Ontario in Canada. Before coronavirus, RoseLe studio specialized in staged photographs that made its subjects look like characters in a movie. So building an elaborate miniature grocery store for squirrels wasn't too big a stretch. His biggest challenge was keeping the set out of the reach of his two dogs.  Mr Granger told the BBC he got the idea by sitting in his backyard with ""lots of downtime"". ""Wow we have a lot of squirrels here!"" he said. With peanuts acting as both bait and props, it didn't take long for the squirrels to catch on. ""They have all different personalities. You can tell we have a pushy one!"" he said. ""I love the interaction they have with one another... You can totally see the story."" Dr Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, speaking at the White House in April The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released detailed guidelines for establishments beginning to reopen in the United States. The60-page document,externalis the most comprehensive produced by the US government and includes suggestions for specific settings such as schools, restaurants and mass transit systems. President Donald Trump has said that the US needs to move forward with lifting restrictions and the guidelines will aid communities as they look to reopen their economies. As we reported earlier, all 50 states have allowed some businesses to reopen, with some acting before meeting federal guidelines. Michael BuchananSocial Affairs Correspondent, BBC News Anwar Hussain Oli, Dr Louisa Rajakumari and Dr Yusuf Patel are among those who have died Newham in east London has the highest death rate from coronavirus in England and Wales. For much of April, one of its residents, Ghouse Fazaluddin, was consumed by one thought: ""We couldn't just stand back and watch our dead be buried in mass graves."" Using his background as a telecoms project manager, he set to work. A WhatsApp group was created and volunteers from the Jamia mosque in Newham, east London, where Mr Fazaluddin is a trustee, were recruited. The task in hand was essential, but grim. There had been so many deaths that a backlog of bodies had built up and people were required to prepare each person for burial. Mr Fazaluddin says: ""The common goal was, we cannot forget our deceased, we cannot just leave them to be buried without the ritual washing that takes place, and that people's dignity, the dignity of the deceased, was preserved."" Read more on Newham Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Inside Downing Street there is an acute awareness that the gradual move out of the lockdown is going to be much more complicated than slamming the doors in the first place. That's the case both in terms of creating plans and policies that give people enough reassurance to take tiny steps to start to get back to normal, only weeks after the peak of a terrible disease, and trying to do so without taking on too much political water, when the consensus that shaped the start of the crisis has already started to fray. And the ongoing tussle over England's return to schools is perhaps the first big test. Read more from Laura. Brazil currently has the third largest number of cases in the world Two controversial anti-malarial drugs have been approved for use in coronavirus patients by Brazil's health ministry. No conclusive evidence exists that the two drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, are effective in treating Covid-19. Patients will need to sign a waiver recognising the potential side effects. In March Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro claimed on social media that hydroxychloroquine was totally effective in treating the virus -Facebook and Twitter later deleted his postsfor spreading fake news. On Monday US President Donald Trump announced he had beentaking hydroxychloroquine as a preventative measure. But the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says the drug has ""not been shown to be safe and effective"". ""We need larger, high-quality randomised clinical trialsin order to better evaluate their effectiveness,"" says University of Oxford's Kome Gbinigie, author of a report on anti-malarial testing for Covid-19. There are risks of serious side effects from the drugs, affecting the eyes and the heart among other organs. Indian emergency workers in masks cleared fallen trees in Digha Coronavirus restrictions have been hampering emergency and
relief efforts in eastern India and Bangladesh where a super cyclone has made violent
landfall, killing at least 15 people as it lashed coastal communities with ferocious wind and rain. Cyclone Amphan uprooted trees and toppled homes in both
countries, including in the Indian city of Kolkata in West Bengal. Nearly 3m people were evacuated - most of them in Bangladesh - before the storm
hit. Covid-19 and social-distancing measures have made mass
evacuations more difficult for authorities, with shelters unable to be used to
full capacity. The storm is expected to have caused deadly storm surges
although its winds have now weakened. Read more. If you're just joining us, a very warm welcome to our continuing coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.

Police chiefs want fines in Wales to be the same as England Maximum fixed penalty notices in Wales for breaching lockdown will rise to Â£1,920, the Welsh Government has confirmed. First Minister Mark Drakeford has faced calls to raise the penalties to deter breaches. Initial fines will remain at Â£60, but will double for each subsequent offence up to the sixth occurrence. But Plaid Cymru police and crime commissioners say calls to match England's higher fines structure - starting at Â£100 - have been rejected. Individuals who do not pay the notice could be taken to court, with magistrates able to impose unlimited fines. Miners are among the key workers who have been allowed to carry on in South Africa At least40,000 people could die with coronavirus in South Africaby the end of the year, scientists have warned. The projections were made by a modelling consortium set up to help government planning over the outbreak and assume that tough restrictions will be eased from 1 June, as President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced. The curbs - which include a ban on alcohol and tobacco sales - have been credited with slowing the spread of the virus, with 17,200 cases and 312 deathsreported so far,,externalway less than the figures in Spain, which has a smaller population. While President Ramaphosa has said lockdown regulations would be eased from ""level 4"" to ""level 3"" from early June, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize has said that according to the World Health Organization, South Africa is not yet ready for level 3 because infections continue to rise every day. The opposition party is taking the government to court, arguing that the stringent regulations are unwarranted and the ban on alcohol and tobacco sales should be lifted. Bolivia's health minister is being investigated over the purchase of overpriced ventilators for Covid-19 patients. Marcelo Navajas and four other officials are being questioned by police about the purchase of some 170 ventilators from a Spanish firm. The health ministry allegedly paid around $27,000 (Â£22,000; â¬25,000) for each ventilator, when their real price was reportedly $10,000-$12,000. Mr Navajas earlier told leading Bolivian newspaper La Razon the purchase had been ""transparent"". The Latin American country has reported 4,481 cases of coronavirus and 189 deaths. Police in Macau - a special administrative region of China - have rejected a request to hold an annual Tiananmen Square massacre vigil, citing concerns over the coronavirus, local media report. It will the first time in 30 years that the vigil will not take place, according toMacau Business,external. The group that organises the vigil, the Democratic Development Union (DDU), said it would challenge the decision in court. Macau, a former Portuguese colony and a near neighbour of Hong Kong, has not had any new cases of Covid-19 for 41 days, reports say. Vigils are held annually in Macau and Hong Kong to commemorate the victims of Tiananmen Square.  The victims were students and workers who, in 1989, occupied Beijing's Tiananmen Square in a massive pro-democracy protest. Many were killed in a brutal clampdown by the communist authorities. On Tuesday, Hong Kong authorities extended social-distancing measures until at least 4 June, throwing plans for mass gatherings to mark the occasion into doubt. Thousands of people gather annually for mass candlelit vigils in Hong Kong and Macau Many people were pictured basking in the hot weather at Bournemouth beach in Dorset on Wednesday There were plenty outside in the sunshine in Broadway Market, in Hackney, east London People in England are now allowed to play socially distanced sports outdoors People across the UK have been enjoying glorious sunny weather, with the country recording its hottest day of the year so far. Temperatures reached 27.8C (82F) near London's Heathrow Airport, and sunbathers across England enjoyed new-found freedom following the slight easing of virus lockdown restrictions. Cars from ""all over the country"" were reported in traffic gridlock in north Devon on Wednesday,police said. While Northern Ireland has also seen some modest changes to its lockdown, restrictions in Scotland and Wales regarding enjoying the outdoors have not been eased. People have been cautioned against using coronavirus antibody tests being sold by some retailers. NHS England's medical director Prof Stephen Powis said experts were ""evaluating"" antibody tests, which aim to show if someone has already had the virus. Such tests are not yet available through the NHS, but some are being sold commercially. ""I would caution against using any tests... without knowing quite how good those tests are,"" said Prof Powis.

early or temporarily to help contain the spread of Covid-19 in prisons. Jessica Vicsik, 25, was one of those released temporarily from Womenâs
Huron Valley Correctional Facility in Michigan, US, on 15 April. âItâs a nightmare in there,"" she told BBC OS. ""We canât go in or out. The
guards, doctors and nurses come in and out every day, and thatâs how we were
getting [Covid-19]. They didnât start wearing protective equipment for a couple
of weeks. âWe pregnant women â four of us were trapped inside with no
doors open, no windows, and it was affecting us. I was told itâs so much worse
out here, which it is because thereâs a lot more people and itâs open. But at
the same time, thatâs our family. We know where our people are going â we donât
know where they (the guards) are going.â In response, a representative for the facility said: âThe CDC

House of CommonsParliament MPs have moved on from their debate about theworkings of parliament during coronavirus. The Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove is now making a statement on the government's post-Brexit proposals for the Northern Ireland border. You can read more about the plans - and what Mr Gove says about them -here. House of CommonsParliament Back to the debate on ending virtual sittings of parliament, Labour's Valerie Vaz also says the proposed return of MPs on 2 June is premature. The shadow Commons leader says the resumption of physical working should be phased-in over a longer period. She questions whether the government is contradicting its own advice, which currently states people should work from home where they can. She says MPs living hundreds of miles away from Westminster will struggle to participate due to reduced train services and flights. ""This is not a battle of the government good and everyone else bad or shirkers versus workers as some ministers have said,"" she says. ""This about Parliament being a good model employer."" Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent Boris Johnson is the kind of politician who feeds off a crowd, and after a bit of a pummelling from the Labour leader last week there were more Conservative MPs around to offer vocal support, during this week's PMQs. Sir Keir Starmer focused his forensic questions on care homes and had plenty of supporting material from those who work in the sector. He extracted another government target from the PM, this time on test and trace. But significantly the emphasis now is on human contact tracers, rather than the app that ministers hoped would be at the centre of a new system. In the early days of this epidemic, as politicians tried to grasp the enormity of what was happening, exchanges in the Commons were all about consensus. Those days have gone. This occasion was more fractious, with Mr Johnson taking on the Labour leader more aggressively. He even urged him to be more positive, suggesting thatâs what the public wanted. House of CommonsParliament Here is a round-up of what came up in this week's PMQs: House of CommonsParliament Mr Rees-Mogg has finished his brief statement and the opposition are now having their say. Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem MP for Orkney and Shetland, suggests the government is acting in haste and is being irresponsible, given the fact that nearly 35,000 people are known to have died during the pandemic and the figure is likely to be much higher. He says if there is a choice between the current somewhat artificial proceedings in Parliament and ""putting the safety of MPs at risk...that is no choice at all"". The current ways of working should only end ""when it is safe to do so"" and when all MPs can safely be present ""not just those who live within driving distance"" of London. Reality Check During prime minister's questions, the Prime Minister said: âWe will get up to 200,000 tests in this country by the end of this month.â However, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock spoke in Parliament earlier this week of: âour new goal of a total capacity of 200,000 tests a dayâ. It is unclear whether the target is to conduct 200,000 tests per day or to have that as capacity in the system. Itâs more than a week since thestatistical regulator the UK Statistics Authority wrote to Mr Hancock,externalto ask for clarification of whether that target is for testing capacity, the number of tests administered, the number of tests completed or the number of people tested. He hasnât yet replied.  House of CommonsParliament Mr Rees-Mogg assures MPs that the Commons will not be returning to business as usual despite his call for the current temporary hybrid proceedings not to be renewed. There will not be a return to the ""crowded, bustling chamber of old"", he says, given that social distancing measures will be in force. When Parliament returns from its Whitsun recess in early June, he says the current limits on the number of MPs able to sit in the Chamber - which is currently capped at 50 - will largely stay in place. He also talks about hygiene and other procedures to ensure the Palace of Westminster will be safe for MPs and their staff. House of CommonsParliament The Commons leader starts by praising the Speaker's efforts in setting up the current hybrid ways of working - in which much of the business is being done remotely - which he said allowed the House to keep going at the height of pandemic in late April and early May. But Mr Rees-Mogg says the current ways of working have not allowed MPs to do their jobs properly, leading to ""stilted, scripted"" debates and a big reduction in the scrutiny of legislation. House of CommonsParliament PMQs has finished. Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg is now making a statement on his proposal to ask MPs to return to largely physical proceedings in the Commons early next month. Reality Check At PMQs, Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer clashed over the guidance on discharging patients from hospitals to care homes in England, during the coronavirus pandemic. In mid-March, hospitals were encouraged to empty hospital beds where they could â to prepare for an expected surge in cases. On 2 April,the rules on discharging patients to care homes were clarified,externalto say patients would not need a negative coronavirus test to be sent to care homes. Those with positive tests could also be discharged, with necessary precautions. It wasnât until 15 April that the government said all patients being discharged from hospitalshould be tested for coronavirus.,external NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, says itâs âuntrueâ that patients with coronavirus were âsystematicallyâ discharged to care homes. However, it says itâs possible âa very small numberâ of patients who were not displaying symptoms - and who hospitals hadnât been able to test before mid-April - were sent there. You can read our full timeline of government advice here. House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Lucy Allan asks about youth unemployment and the impact of coronavirus on young people. ""Will he ensure the recovery strategy will focus on young
people?"" She asks. Mr Johnson says they will be supporting young people with a ""new
national skills fund"" worth Â£2.5bn. House of CommonsParliament Conservative Tom Randall asks if the government will establish a medal for NHS workers and ""those who have gone above and beyond"" in the fight against coronavirus. ""We are thinking about how to recognise health care staff,"" replies Boris Johnson. House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Richard Drax asks about Huawei and 5G, in light of France's review of its defence supply chain. Mr Johnson says he is ""right to be concerned"" about the buying up of UK technology by countries that may have ""ulterior motives"". He says they are bringing forward measures to protect the UK's technological base and they will hear more on this over the next few weeks. Hereâs more onwhat is Huaweiand what
will its role be in the rollout of 5G in the UK. House of CommonsParliament SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford also asks about the surcharge for overseas NHS workers and the government's immigration bill. ""Given their sacrifice is he not embarrassed this is how his government chooses to treat NHS workers,"" he asks. The PM replies that he wants ""an immigration system that will work for the people of this country"". Blackford accuses the PM of being ""hell bent"" on implementing a highly ideological immigration policy. Boris Johnson says the SNP wants an ""border at Berwick"". Allow Twitter content?

"Coronavirus and the collapse of oil revenue have increased the pressure on President Maduro Venezuela has launched legal proceedings against the Bank of England to try to force it to release â¬930m ($1bn; Â£820m) worth of Venezuelan gold. The gold is being retained following British and US sanctions on Venezuela. Venezuela says it wants the Bank of England to sell part of the Venezuelan gold reserves to use the funds to fight the spread of coronavirus. It says it has agreed for the money to be sent directly to the UN to ensure it is not used for other purposes. It is calling for the funds to be transferred to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to administer the purchase of supplies like medical equipment to fight Covid-19. Why coronavirus could be catastrophic for Venezuela Venezuela crisis in 300 words US offers Venezuela sanctions relief The legal wrangling comes amid fears about the ability of Venezuela's crumbling healthcare system to handle the outbreak. This video can not be played The Venezuelan hospital where there's barely running water, let alone medicine Legal documents say the bank wants the transfer made ""as a matter of urgency"" and it filed a legal claim to that effect in a London court on 14 May. ""With lives on the line, now is not the time to attempt to score political points,"" Sarosh Zaiwalla, a London-based lawyer representing Venezuela's central bank, said in a statement. The UN told the BBC in an emailed statement only that it had been approached by the Venezuelan bank to explore such mechanisms. The Bank of England declined to comment when asked about the case by Reuters news agency. The Bank of England is the second largest keeper of gold in the world, with approximately 400,000 gold bars - only the New York Federal Reserve has more. It has one of the largest gold vaults in the world and prides itself on never having had any gold stolen in its more than 320-year history. Central banks of a number of nations use it to store their national gold reserves and Venezuela is one of them. Despite the country's oil riches, Venezuela's economy has been in freefall for years due to a combination of government mismanagement and corruption, further exacerbated by international sanctions. As Venezuela produces very little apart from oil, it needs to import goods from abroad, for which it needs access to foreign currency. But with oil production a fraction of what it once was, Venezuela's foreign currency reserves have been dwindling. The government of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro turned to selling off some of the gold reserves kept at the central bank in Venezuela to its allies in Turkey, Russia and the United Arab Emirates. This video can not be played Venezuela's gold diplomacy gamble But the US, which does not recognise Mr Maduro's government, last year warned ""bankers, brokers, traders and facilitators""  not to deal in ""gold, oil, or other Venezuelan commodities stolen from the Venezuelan people by the Maduro mafia"". Venezuela has reportedly continued to sell gold to its ally Iran, which is also under US sanctions, but even so its international reserves reached a 30-year low at the beginning of this year, Venezuelan Central Bank figures revealed. It badly needs hard currency and sees the gold stored in the vaults of the Bank of England as the solution. Venezuela first approached the Bank of England at the end of 2018. Finance Minister SimÃ³n Zerpa and Central Bank President Calixto Ortega travelled to London to demand that Venezuela be allowed to take the gold back to Venezuela. In January 2019, the Bank of England refused the request. All it said publicly was that it did not comment on customer relationships. Venezuela has $1bn worth of gold stored in the Bank of England The decision, however, came just days after Mr Maduro's rival, Juan GuaidÃ³, had declared himself president, arguing that the 2018 election which returned Mr Maduro to power had been fraudulent. Mr GuaidÃ³, who was quickly recognised as the legitimate leader by more than 50 nations - including the UK and the US, asked the Bank of England not to hand the gold over to the Maduro government, arguing that it would be used for corrupt purposes. The British minister of state for the Americas at the time, Alan Duncan, said the decision was a matter for the Bank of England and its governor, but added that ""no doubt when they do so they will take into account there are now a large number of countries across the world questioning the legitimacy of NicolÃ¡s Maduro and recognising that of Juan GuaidÃ³"". At the same time, top US officials - for whom President Maduro has long been a thorn - were also lobbying their British counterparts to cut the Maduro government off from its foreign assets. While the Bank of England never went beyond saying that it did not comment on customer relations it is thought that international sanctions on Venezuela and regulations on preventing money laundering influenced its decision. Venezuela's offer to have the funds transferred to the UN directly are designed to circumvent those regulations.

The shadow Commons leader says the resumption of physical working should be phased-in over a longer period. She questions whether the government is contradicting its own advice, which currently states people should work from home where they can.

""This is not a battle of the government good and everyone else bad or shirkers versus workers as some ministers have said,"" she says. ""This about Parliament being a good model employer."" Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent Boris Johnson is the kind of politician who feeds off a crowd, and after a bit of a pummelling from the Labour leader last week there were more Conservative MPs around to offer vocal support, during this week's PMQs. Sir Keir Starmer focused his forensic questions on care homes and had plenty of supporting material from those who work in the sector. He extracted another government target from the PM, this time on test and trace. But significantly the emphasis now is on human contact tracers, rather than the app that ministers hoped would be at the centre of a new system. In the early days of this epidemic, as politicians tried to grasp the enormity of what was happening, exchanges in the Commons were all about consensus. Those days have gone. This occasion was more fractious, with Mr Johnson taking on the Labour leader more aggressively. He even urged him to be more positive, suggesting thatâs what the public wanted. House of CommonsParliament Here is a round-up of what came up in this week's PMQs: House of CommonsParliament Mr Rees-Mogg has finished his brief statement and the opposition are now having their say. Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem MP for Orkney and Shetland, suggests the government is acting in haste and is being irresponsible, given the fact that nearly 35,000 people are known to have died during the pandemic and the figure is likely to be much higher. He says if there is a choice between the current somewhat artificial proceedings in Parliament and ""putting the safety of MPs at risk...that is no choice at all"". The current ways of working should only end ""when it is safe to do so"" and when all MPs can safely be present ""not just those who live within driving distance"" of London. Reality Check During prime minister's questions, the Prime Minister said: âWe will get up to 200,000 tests in this country by the end of this month.â However, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock spoke in Parliament earlier this week of: âour new goal of a total capacity of 200,000 tests a dayâ. It is unclear whether the target is to conduct 200,000 tests per day or to have that as capacity in the system. Itâs more than a week since thestatistical regulator the UK Statistics Authority wrote to Mr Hancock,externalto ask for clarification of whether that target is for testing capacity, the number of tests administered, the number of tests completed or the number of people tested. He hasnât yet replied.  House of CommonsParliament Mr Rees-Mogg assures MPs that the Commons will not be returning to business as usual despite his call for the current temporary hybrid proceedings not to be renewed. There will not be a return to the ""crowded, bustling chamber of old"", he says, given that social distancing measures will be in force. When Parliament returns from its Whitsun recess in early June, he says the current limits on the number of MPs able to sit in the Chamber - which is currently capped at 50 - will largely stay in place. He also talks about hygiene and other procedures to ensure the Palace of Westminster will be safe for MPs and their staff. House of CommonsParliament The Commons leader starts by praising the Speaker's efforts in setting up the current hybrid ways of working - in which much of the business is being done remotely - which he said allowed the House to keep going at the height of pandemic in late April and early May. But Mr Rees-Mogg says the current ways of working have not allowed MPs to do their jobs properly, leading to ""stilted, scripted"" debates and a big reduction in the scrutiny of legislation. House of CommonsParliament PMQs has finished. Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg is now making a statement on his proposal to ask MPs to return to largely physical proceedings in the Commons early next month. Reality Check At PMQs, Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer clashed over the guidance on discharging patients from hospitals to care homes in England, during the coronavirus pandemic. In mid-March, hospitals were encouraged to empty hospital beds where they could â to prepare for an expected surge in cases. On 2 April,the rules on discharging patients to care homes were clarified,externalto say patients would not need a negative coronavirus test to be sent to care homes. Those with positive tests could also be discharged, with necessary precautions. It wasnât until 15 April that the government said all patients being discharged from hospitalshould be tested for coronavirus.,external NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, says itâs âuntrueâ that patients with coronavirus were âsystematicallyâ discharged to care homes. However, it says itâs possible âa very small numberâ of patients who were not displaying symptoms - and who hospitals hadnât been able to test before mid-April - were sent there. You can read our full timeline of government advice here. House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Lucy Allan asks about youth unemployment and the impact of coronavirus on young people. ""Will he ensure the recovery strategy will focus on young
people?"" She asks. Mr Johnson says they will be supporting young people with a ""new
national skills fund"" worth Â£2.5bn. House of CommonsParliament Conservative Tom Randall asks if the government will establish a medal for NHS workers and ""those who have gone above and beyond"" in the fight against coronavirus. ""We are thinking about how to recognise health care staff,"" replies Boris Johnson. House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Richard Drax asks about Huawei and 5G, in light of France's review of its defence supply chain. Mr Johnson says he is ""right to be concerned"" about the buying up of UK technology by countries that may have ""ulterior motives"". He says they are bringing forward measures to protect the UK's technological base and they will hear more on this over the next few weeks. Hereâs more onwhat is Huaweiand what
will its role be in the rollout of 5G in the UK. House of CommonsParliament SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford also asks about the surcharge for overseas NHS workers and the government's immigration bill. ""Given their sacrifice is he not embarrassed this is how his government chooses to treat NHS workers,"" he asks. The PM replies that he wants ""an immigration system that will work for the people of this country"". Blackford accuses the PM of being ""hell bent"" on implementing a highly ideological immigration policy. Boris Johnson says the SNP wants an ""border at Berwick"". Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Aya Hachem, 19, was shot in the chest near a supermarket The father of a woman who was shot dead in the street hoped his family would be safe in the UK after they fled Lebanon. Law student Aya Hachem, 19, wasshot from a passing car in a case of mistaken identity, in the town's King Street on Sunday. Her father Ismail told BBC Asian Network his dreams have been destroyed in the wake of her death. Two more people have been detained in connection with the investigation, bringing the number of arrests to 11. Eight people have been arrested on suspicion of murder while a further three suspects have been held on suspicion of assisting an offender. Police have been given more time to question the first three men who were arrested on Monday. The suspects, who are aged 19 to 39, remain in police custody. Ms Hachem was walking towards Lidl at about 15:00 BST when she was hit by one of several shots fired from a car. Deputy Chief Constable Terry Woods, of Lancashire Police, said the ""completely innocent"" law student had not been the intended target. Mr Hachem said he repeatedly tried to call his eldest daughter - who with her family had been living in the UK for a decade - when she did not return home from the supermarket. His wife later told him ""my heart is saying go check on Aya"", he told the BBC. Her parents said she was the ""most loyal devoted daughter"" who ""dreamed of becoming a solicitor"" During his search to find his daughter, Mr Hachem discovered King Street had been cordoned off. He was unaware that this was the scene of his daughter's death until the police arrived at his home later that day. ""I start crying... cause all my dreams, Aya,"" he said. ""I think I would be safe here... in this small town. No big problems."" Police believe this Toyota Avensis was used The Lebanese-born teenager - a second year student at the University of Salford - was a young trustee for the Children's Society. The charity's chief executive Mark Russell said: ""She was bright, passionate, hard-working, ambitious. ""It's a complete tragedy that her life has been cut short."" Her former head teacher described as a ""wonderful young lady who had so much to offer"". Diane Atkinson, executive head of Blackburn Central High School, said: ""She fled a war-torn zone as a refugee and came to the UK looking for a better life. Ms Hachem arrived at the school as a 12-year-old ""with very little English"" but ""picked it up very quickly"". She was a ""very intelligent young lady"" who had ""great aspirations to help other people"" and ""worked incredibly hard to become the very, very best person she could be"", Ms Atkinson said. A Toyota Avensis, believed to have been used in the shooting, was later found abandoned in Wellington Road. Detectives said the shooting was not being treated as terrorism-related or a racially-motivated attack.

"This video can not be played ""People say it's my fault coronavirus spreading"" Young carers are being shouted at and turned away from special shopping hours due to ""not being believed"", a charity fears. Carers Trust Wales said some had been shouted at by shoppers and stopped from going into shops during the pandemic. Fayeth, from Rhyl, cares for her mother who has epilepsy and three younger sisters. But the 13-year-old said she felt like she got ""death stares"" every time she left the house. As many as one in five young people are caring for a family member with disabilities or mental health problems in Wales, according to the charity. As carers they are eligible to shop during special hours set aside at supermarkets and shops for the elderly and vulnerable and for carers. But only some local authorities issue ID cards, which explain the young carers' role, and there are concerns that a large number of shops do not accept them. Young carers in Wales 'hidden' from schools 'I thought every child looked after their mum' Director of the charity, Simon Hatch, said the young carers were worried enough about bringing the virus back home to their family members from the shops, without being turned away at the door. He said staff were probably stopping them due to ""not understanding"" their role in being a key carer and supermarkets and shops needed training. ""We've also had reports of people being shouted at in the streets, when they've been trying to get into local shops,"" he said. ""I'm sure that these are relatively rare occurrences, but it really highlights the massive challenges on top of what is already a very worrying and stressful time for them anyway."" Young carer Fayeth said she felt like she had death stares while going shopping for her family For Fayeth the lockdown has been a worrying time, with her mother Laura having more seizures since the restrictions were introduced. But while she is trying to care for her family, she said whenever she left the house to get shopping she felt like people were staring at her. ""Some people have made comments when I'm out shopping saying that young children shouldn't be out of the house during this time,"" she said. ""There are some shops which won't let young people in and only allowing adults, so it can make it much harder to get any shopping. ""Some people even say you shouldn't be out and the coronavirus is spreading and it's my fault because I'm outside and things like that. ""But I just say I'm a young carer and I'm allowed to be out, then I walk away"". Ronnie Lawson's mother Louise said he could not be ""queuing for three hours"" trying to get shopping for his dad Teenager Ronnie Lawson has cared for his father who has multiple sclerosis since he was nine and also helps his mother who has problems with her spine and hips. He said he was left ""embarrassed"" when he was turned away while trying to buy food for his disabled parents in Abergavenny. Ronnie said he did not have anything to prove he was a carer, and thought staff ""didn't really believe"" him as he ""is a teenager"". Ronnie said he was embarrassed because of how many elderly people were in the queue for the shops He said he had got ""looks off people wondering why I'm out"", but now had a slip from Monmouthshire council and was finding it easier to get in during special hours. Ronnie said he was worried about the impact on younger children who were sole carers for parents, and people needed to be more understanding, as they were already scared of going to the shops. ""It's not their fault, but there's no point for a kid to lie about being a carer, so I think they should be more considerate,"" he said. Rhian Watts said even with ID and proof young carers were still not being let into shops Bridgend Carers Centre has started giving slips to its 1,400 recognised young carers to prove they are shopping for a family member. ""A lot of young carers are getting refused in retail shops, usually because of their age and some supermarkets are saying if they're under the age of 16 they are not allowed in,"" said manager Rhian Watts. ""But even with the letters we've been providing some are still not allowing them in."" Ms Watts said it should not really matter who is doing the shopping for a family, and have more understanding of the risks young carers were taking. ""They are the person that needs to enter the supermarket to do the shopping and denying access will have a major impact on them and their families so it's just about having a bit of understanding,"" she said. When is it hypocritical to clap for carers?

"A woman cycles through heavy rain as Cyclone Amphan approaches Kolkata. Cyclone Amphan has made landfall in eastern India and Bangladesh, killing at least 15 people as it lashed coastal areas with ferocious wind and rain. Trees were uprooted and homes toppled in both countries, including in the Indian city of Kolkata in West Bengal. Nearly three million people were evacuated - most of them in Bangladesh - before the severe storm hit. Coronavirus restrictions have been hampering emergency and relief efforts. Covid-19 and social-distancing measures have made mass evacuations more difficult for authorities, with shelters unable to be used to full capacity. The storm is the first super cyclone to form in the Bay of Bengal since 1999. Though its winds have now weakened, it is still classified as a very severe cyclone. People rushed for shelter in Kolkata as the cyclone approached ""Our estimate is that some areas 10-15km from the coast could be inundated,"" said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, the head of India's meteorological department. Amphan began hitting the Sundarbans, a mangrove area around the India-Bangladesh border home to four million people on Wednesday afternoon, before carving north and north-eastwards towards Kolkata, a historic city that was the capital of the British Raj. It was moving with winds gusting up to 185km/h (115mph). Amphan is expected to move further into Bangladesh on Thursday, and later Bhutan. Meteorologists warn there could be up to 300mm more rainfall to come, which could increase the risk of flooding and deadly mudslides. This video can not be played Video filmed by residents there shows extremely strong and dangerous winds in Kolkata Satya Narayan Pradhan, director general of India's National Disaster Response Force, told the BBC the impact had been ""fairly devastating"", especially in poor areas. Although it had been hard to keep people apart during evacuations, social distancing is being enforced at cyclone shelters, along with hygiene protocols, he said. Amitabha Bhattasali, BBC Bengali, Kolkata Kolkata has been facing the full force of Cyclone Amphan since it made landfall several hours ago. My building has lost electricity. The telephone network is gone so I'm here with a candle. The mobile network is running. But the situation just outside my window is terrifying - I went outside to try to record something and was nearly blown away. I'm getting reports from across the city as well as from coastal districts that the situation is pretty bad there. Thousands of trees and electricity poles are down. When the last super cyclone struck in 1999 I was travelling on a train and was stuck for two days. At one point, I thought we'd be blown away. How much devastation this cyclone has caused we'll get to know only in the morning. Kolkata residents said it was the worst storm they had experienced in decades. They spoke of flooded homes, electricity transformers exploding and power cuts. One man told the BBC the boundary walls of his condominium had collapsed. ""I am in my house. I have been prepared for a while. But I've never seen a storm as bad as this,"" said one resident, Pooja Kaur. ""There is no power at the moment."" Earlier, a Bangladesh Red Crescent volunteer helping villagers to evacuate became the first fatality after the boat he was in capsized in strong winds, the organisation said.

"A woman cycles through heavy rain as Cyclone Amphan approaches Kolkata. Cyclone Amphan has made landfall in eastern India and Bangladesh, killing at least 15 people as it lashed coastal areas with ferocious wind and rain. Trees were uprooted and homes toppled in both countries, including in the Indian city of Kolkata in West Bengal. Nearly three million people were evacuated - most of them in Bangladesh - before the severe storm hit. Coronavirus restrictions have been hampering emergency and relief efforts. Covid-19 and social-distancing measures have made mass evacuations more difficult for authorities, with shelters unable to be used to full capacity. The storm is the first super cyclone to form in the Bay of Bengal since 1999. Though its winds have now weakened, it is still classified as a very severe cyclone. People rushed for shelter in Kolkata as the cyclone approached ""Our estimate is that some areas 10-15km from the coast could be inundated,"" said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, the head of India's meteorological department. Amphan began hitting the Sundarbans, a mangrove area around the India-Bangladesh border home to four million people on Wednesday afternoon, before carving north and north-eastwards towards Kolkata, a historic city that was the capital of the British Raj. It was moving with winds gusting up to 185km/h (115mph). Amphan is expected to move further into Bangladesh on Thursday, and later Bhutan. Meteorologists warn there could be up to 300mm more rainfall to come, which could increase the risk of flooding and deadly mudslides. This video can not be played Video filmed by residents there shows extremely strong and dangerous winds in Kolkata Satya Narayan Pradhan, director general of India's National Disaster Response Force, told the BBC the impact had been ""fairly devastating"", especially in poor areas. Although it had been hard to keep people apart during evacuations, social distancing is being enforced at cyclone shelters, along with hygiene protocols, he said. Amitabha Bhattasali, BBC Bengali, Kolkata Kolkata has been facing the full force of Cyclone Amphan since it made landfall several hours ago. My building has lost electricity. The telephone network is gone so I'm here with a candle. The mobile network is running. But the situation just outside my window is terrifying - I went outside to try to record something and was nearly blown away. I'm getting reports from across the city as well as from coastal districts that the situation is pretty bad there. Thousands of trees and electricity poles are down. When the last super cyclone struck in 1999 I was travelling on a train and was stuck for two days. At one point, I thought we'd be blown away. How much devastation this cyclone has caused we'll get to know only in the morning. Kolkata residents said it was the worst storm they had experienced in decades. They spoke of flooded homes, electricity transformers exploding and power cuts. One man told the BBC the boundary walls of his condominium had collapsed. ""I am in my house. I have been prepared for a while. But I've never seen a storm as bad as this,"" said one resident, Pooja Kaur. ""There is no power at the moment."" Earlier, a Bangladesh Red Crescent volunteer helping villagers to evacuate became the first fatality after the boat he was in capsized in strong winds, the organisation said. Bangladesh has reported four other deaths. In India, media reported 10 fatalities, including a child in the state of Orissa (also known as Odisha), who was killed after the mud wall of his family's home collapsed.

"Serco is one of the companies hiring, training and operating 15,000 contact tracers for the UK government Outsourcing firm Serco has apologised after accidentally sharing the email addresses of almost 300 contact tracers. The company is training staff to trace cases of Covid-19 for the UK government. It made the error when it emailed new trainees to tell them about training. Serco said it had apologised and would review its processes ""to make sure that this does not happen again"". Contact tracing is a system used to slow the spread of infectious diseases like coronavirus. It is already being used in other countries including Singapore and Germany. In the UK, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said 21,000 contact tracers have been hired, some of whom are healthcare professionals. They will gather contacts from Covid-19 patients and trace those people by phone or email to slow the spread of the disease in the community. Serco is one of the companies hiring, training and operating the 15,000 contact tracers who do not have clinical training. But the mistake may leave the firm in breach of data protection rules. It is understood that at least one member of staff has raised the issue with the Information Commissioner. How will the UK's coronavirus app work? Serco fined Â£19m over tagging scandal Two ex-Serco bosses charged with fraud The error did not involve patients' data but will be unhelpful for a contact tracing project that is set to ask many thousands of people who have fallen ill to share the details of their friends and acquaintances. Serco wrote the email to tell new trainees not to contact its help desk looking for training details. But the staff member who sent it put their email addresses in the CC section of the email, rather than the blind CC section - revealing them to every recipient. LOUIS THEROUX:The 15 songs getting him through lockdown FAKE-AWAY:The best fast food recipes you can make at home When the Home Office made a similar error last year it referred itself to the Information Commissioner, but Serco is not intending to do this.

"This video can not be played Aya Hachem, 19, was shot in the chest near a supermarket The father of a woman who was shot dead in the street hoped his family would be safe in the UK after they fled Lebanon. Law student Aya Hachem, 19, wasshot from a passing car in a case of mistaken identity, in the town's King Street on Sunday. Her father Ismail told BBC Asian Network his dreams have been destroyed in the wake of her death. Two more people have been detained in connection with the investigation, bringing the number of arrests to 11. Eight people have been arrested on suspicion of murder while a further three suspects have been held on suspicion of assisting an offender. Police have been given more time to question the first three men who were arrested on Monday. The suspects, who are aged 19 to 39, remain in police custody. Ms Hachem was walking towards Lidl at about 15:00 BST when she was hit by one of several shots fired from a car. Deputy Chief Constable Terry Woods, of Lancashire Police, said the ""completely innocent"" law student had not been the intended target. Mr Hachem said he repeatedly tried to call his eldest daughter - who with her family had been living in the UK for a decade - when she did not return home from the supermarket. His wife later told him ""my heart is saying go check on Aya"", he told the BBC. Her parents said she was the ""most loyal devoted daughter"" who ""dreamed of becoming a solicitor"" During his search to find his daughter, Mr Hachem discovered King Street had been cordoned off. He was unaware that this was the scene of his daughter's death until the police arrived at his home later that day. ""I start crying... cause all my dreams, Aya,"" he said. ""I think I would be safe here... in this small town. No big problems."" Police believe this Toyota Avensis was used The Lebanese-born teenager - a second year student at the University of Salford - was a young trustee for the Children's Society. The charity's chief executive Mark Russell said: ""She was bright, passionate, hard-working, ambitious. ""It's a complete tragedy that her life has been cut short."" Her former head teacher described as a ""wonderful young lady who had so much to offer"". Diane Atkinson, executive head of Blackburn Central High School, said: ""She fled a war-torn zone as a refugee and came to the UK looking for a better life. Ms Hachem arrived at the school as a 12-year-old ""with very little English"" but ""picked it up very quickly"". She was a ""very intelligent young lady"" who had ""great aspirations to help other people"" and ""worked incredibly hard to become the very, very best person she could be"", Ms Atkinson said. A Toyota Avensis, believed to have been used in the shooting, was later found abandoned in Wellington Road.

"The UK's inflation rate fell in April to its lowest since August 2016 as the economic fallout of the first month of the lockdown hit prices. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) fell to 0.8% from 1.5% in March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Falling petrol and diesel prices, plus lower energy bills, were the main drivers pushing inflation lower. But the prices of games and toys rose, which the ONS said may be due to people spending more time at home. However, there were 92 items in the ONS's basket of goods and services that it could not measure in April because they were mostly unavailable. These ranged from haircut prices, lemonade, manicures, cinema popcorn, and leisure activities involving sport. The ONS said it would monitor the issue for any distortion in the overall picture. But Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS, said: ""While the coronavirus limited the availability of some goods and services, its effect on prices was more muted."" He said that food prices generally rose no more quickly than other goods and services, ""though fresh vegetables did see stronger rises"". Sunak: No guarantee of quick economic bounceback Will coronavirus mean I have to pay more tax? What is the UK's inflation rate? The ONS said average petrol prices dropped by 10.4p a litre between March and April - the biggest fall since unleaded petrol records began in 1990 - amid a slump in global oil prices. Energy prices also pushed inflation lower as regulator Ofgem reduced its default tariff cap. The ONS said clothes retailers, hit during the early days of the lockdown by weaker footfall and then the closure of outlets, resorted to more discount sales than usual to try to shift their stock. Goods seeing upward pressure on prices included video games and consoles, board games and children's toys, the ONS said. And the price of knitting wool rose, another sign of the crafts and hobbies popular with people staying at home. Long-life products - such as cook-in sauces and frozen fish - also saw price hikes last month as consumers stocked up for life in lockdown. Laura Suter, personal finance analyst at investment platform AJ Bell, said it was likely that as shops start re-opening retailers would deeply discount prices, putting further downward pressure on inflation. She also pointed to positive news for savers. ""For the first time in ages [savers] can now get above inflation interest rates on easy-access savings accounts - from more than one account."" CPI is now far below the Bank of England's 2% target, used as general guidance to help businesses set the right prices and for people to plan their spending. But while low inflation reduces the need for rises in interest rates and gives people a feeling the pound in their pocket stretches further, it's possible to have too much of a good thing. Low inflation minimises the erosion of debt over the years. People (and governments) with borrowing, such as mortgages, don't see the benefit. That big loan you have doesn't look so big if wages are keeping up with inflation. So-called deflation actually increases the value the debts. But low inflation discourages employers from raising pay (which hits the Treasury's tax take) and may even encourage them to cut pay in troubled times. And if prices are falling, consumers can put off big ticket purchases in the hope the fall will continue - and this slows economic growth. Savers are also penalised. Low inflation generally means lower official interest rates - and that means banks and building societies keep their savings rates down. It's why, when inflation remains one percentage point below 2%, the governor of the Bank of England writes to the chancellor to explain how the price index can be brought back on target. There's a good reason a little inflation is good for the economy. Most economists had expected April's inflation to fall to 0.9%, and have predicted the rate will fall further as the economic fallout of the pandemic continues. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said inflation had taken a ""big leap towards zero by the summer"" as he said retailers were planning ""further large price cuts"". He predicted inflation would recover next year but was likely to remain below 2% for much of 2021. ""The inflation outlook, then, supports the [Bank of England's] Monetary Policy Committee doing more to stimulate the economy at its next meeting in mid-June - we look for a further Â£100bn of quantitative easing to be announced,"" he added. Core inflation, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, held broadly steady at an annual rate of 1.5%. Inflation as measured by the Retail Prices Index (RPI) - an older measure of inflation which the ONS says is inaccurate, but is widely used in bond markets and for other commercial contracts - dropped to 1.5% from 2.6%.

"The owner of a pizza restaurant in the US has discovered the DoorDash delivery app has been selling his food cheaper than he does - while still paying him full price for orders. A pizza for which he charged $24 (Â£20) was being advertised for $16 on DoorDash - and when he secretly ordered it himself, the app paid his restaurant the full $24 while charging him $16. He had not asked to be put on the app. He later found out it was part of a trial to gauge customer demand. Content strategist Ranjan Royblogged about the anonymous restaurateur,external, who is his friend - he later named the business, which has outlets in Manhattan and Topeka, Kansas, US. Mr Roy said he first heard about the situation in March 2019, when his friend started receiving complaints about deliveries, even though his outlets did not deliver. At that point , he discovered he had been added to DoorDash - and noticed it was charging a lower price for one of his premium pizzas. So he ordered 10 pizzas, paid $160 and had them delivered to a friend's house. The restaurant was then paid $240 for the order by DoorDash. New York City caps fees for food delivery apps Grubhub adds restaurants without permission The next time, the restaurant prepared his friend's order by boxing up the pizza base without any toppings, maximising the ""profit"" from the mismatched prices. ""I was genuinely curious if DoorDash would catch on - but they didn't,"" wrote Mr Roy. DoorDash did not respond to BBC News's request for comment. But Mr Roy said: ""We found out afterward that was all the result of a 'demand test' by DoorDash. ""They have a test period where they scrape the restaurant's website and don't charge any fees to anyone, so they can ideally go to the restaurant with positive order data to then get the restaurant signed on to the platform. ""Third-party delivery platforms, as they've been built, just seem like the wrong model, but instead of testing, failing, and evolving, they've been subsidised into market dominance. ""You have insanely large pools of capital creating an incredibly inefficient money-losing business model."" DoorDash is backed by investment giant Softbank, which this week posted a record-breaking loss of nearly $13bn. Defending the loss, chief executive Masayoshi Son reportedly compared himself to Jesus. The billionaire is said to have stated during a call with investors that Jesus was ""also misunderstood"". He later apologised.

"A woman cycles through heavy rain as Cyclone Amphan approaches Kolkata. Cyclone Amphan has made landfall in eastern India and Bangladesh, killing at least 15 people as it lashed coastal areas with ferocious wind and rain. Trees were uprooted and homes toppled in both countries, including in the Indian city of Kolkata in West Bengal. Nearly three million people were evacuated - most of them in Bangladesh - before the severe storm hit. Coronavirus restrictions have been hampering emergency and relief efforts. Covid-19 and social-distancing measures have made mass evacuations more difficult for authorities, with shelters unable to be used to full capacity. The storm is the first super cyclone to form in the Bay of Bengal since 1999. Though its winds have now weakened, it is still classified as a very severe cyclone. People rushed for shelter in Kolkata as the cyclone approached ""Our estimate is that some areas 10-15km from the coast could be inundated,"" said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, the head of India's meteorological department. Amphan began hitting the Sundarbans, a mangrove area around the India-Bangladesh border home to four million people on Wednesday afternoon, before carving north and north-eastwards towards Kolkata, a historic city that was the capital of the British Raj. It was moving with winds gusting up to 185km/h (115mph). Amphan is expected to move further into Bangladesh on Thursday, and later Bhutan. Meteorologists warn there could be up to 300mm more rainfall to come, which could increase the risk of flooding and deadly mudslides. This video can not be played Video filmed by residents there shows extremely strong and dangerous winds in Kolkata Satya Narayan Pradhan, director general of India's National Disaster Response Force, told the BBC the impact had been ""fairly devastating"", especially in poor areas. Although it had been hard to keep people apart during evacuations, social distancing is being enforced at cyclone shelters, along with hygiene protocols, he said. Amitabha Bhattasali, BBC Bengali, Kolkata Kolkata has been facing the full force of Cyclone Amphan since it made landfall several hours ago. My building has lost electricity. The telephone network is gone so I'm here with a candle. The mobile network is running. But the situation just outside my window is terrifying - I went outside to try to record something and was nearly blown away. I'm getting reports from across the city as well as from coastal districts that the situation is pretty bad there. Thousands of trees and electricity poles are down. When the last super cyclone struck in 1999 I was travelling on a train and was stuck for two days. At one point, I thought we'd be blown away. How much devastation this cyclone has caused we'll get to know only in the morning. Kolkata residents said it was the worst storm they had experienced in decades. They spoke of flooded homes, electricity transformers exploding and power cuts. One man told the BBC the boundary walls of his condominium had collapsed. ""I am in my house. I have been prepared for a while. But I've never seen a storm as bad as this,"" said one resident, Pooja Kaur. ""There is no power at the moment."" Earlier, a Bangladesh Red Crescent volunteer helping villagers to evacuate became the first fatality after the boat he was in capsized in strong winds, the organisation said. Bangladesh has reported four other deaths. In India, media reported 10 fatalities, including a child in the state of Orissa (also known as Odisha), who was killed after the mud wall of his family's home collapsed. In the Sundarbans, also a rich habitat for Bengal tigers, houses ""look like they have been run over by a bulldozer"", a villager called Babul Mondal told the FP news agency. Why Bay of Bengal is a hotbed of tropical cyclones When extreme weather and Covid-19 collide India and Bangladesh are using schools and other buildings as temporary shelters - but they need more space than usual in order to house people while maintaining social distancing. Police in West Bengal, which along with Orissa is expected to be the worst-hit part of India, told the BBC that people were unwilling to go to the shelters because they were afraid of contracting Covid-19. Social distancing being enforced in a cyclone shelter in India Officials in Bangladesh fear it will be the most powerful storm since Cyclone Sidr killed about 3,500 people in 2007. Most died as a result of sea water surging in. India's weather department had predicted storm surges as high as 10-16 feet (3-5 metres). The rising of sea levels in this way can send deadly walls of water barrelling far inland, devastating communities. This video can not be played Helen Willetts has the latest update on Cyclone Amphan The cyclone comes as tens of thousands of migrant workers continue to flee cities for their villages during India's lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus. West Bengal and Orissa are among the Indian states seeing large numbers return. Orissa cancelled trains and some district officials asked the state government to accommodate the migrants - many of whom are walking home - elsewhere until the storm passes. How cyclones get their names What is a cyclone? The lost fishermen of India's Cyclone Ockhi Although they are not in the direct path of the storm, there are fears for hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees who fled Myanmar and live in crowded camps in Bangladesh where cases of coronavirus have recently been reported. Officials said they had moved hundreds of Rohingya living on an island in the Bay of Bengal into shelters. The UN and human rights groups are also gravely worried for Rohingya refugees who they believe could be on boats in the Bay of Bengal, and possibly in the storm's path, after trying to flee to Malaysia and Thailand but being blocked by authorities in those countries from landing.

"Up to 60m people will be pushed into ""extreme poverty"" by the coronavirus warns the president of the World Bank. David Malpass said the bank expects global economic growth to shrink by 5% this year as nations deal with the pandemic. This has already led to millions losing their jobs and businesses failing, with poorer countries feeling the brunt. ""Millions of livelihoods have been destroyed and healthcare systems are under strain worldwide,"" he said. ""Our estimate is that up to 60 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty - that erases all the progress made in poverty alleviation in the past three years,"" Mr Malpass warned on Tuesday. 'Virus means millions will be left in poverty' Global economy will suffer for 'years to come' How virus is threatening Central America's lifeline TheÂ World BankÂ defines ""extreme poverty"" as living on less than $1.90 (Â£1.55) per person per day.Â The Washington-based lender is offering $160bn in grants and low-interest loans to help poor countries tackle the crisis. Mr Malpass said that 100 countries, home to 70% of the world's population, had already been granted emergency finance. ""While the World Bank is providing sizeable resources, it won't be enough,"" he added.Mr Malpass said he was also frustrated with commercial lenders dragging their heels on offering debt relief to poor nations. ""I have been somewhat frustrated by the slow pace. Commercial creditors are still, by and large, taking payments from even the poorest countries and there needs to be faster movement."" The World Bank worked with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a scheme to allow poorer countries to request debt relief on repayments of loans owed to G20 members until the end of this year. At the same time, Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JP Morgan bank, said that the coronavirus pandemic must serve as a ""wake-up call"" to build a fairer society. ""It is my fervent hope that we use this crisis as a catalyst to rebuild an economy that creates and sustains opportunity for dramatically more people, especially those who have been left behind for too long,"" he wrote ahead of the bank's annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday.

"The owner of a pizza restaurant in the US has discovered the DoorDash delivery app has been selling his food cheaper than he does - while still paying him full price for orders. A pizza for which he charged $24 (Â£20) was being advertised for $16 on DoorDash - and when he secretly ordered it himself, the app paid his restaurant the full $24 while charging him $16. He had not asked to be put on the app. He later found out it was part of a trial to gauge customer demand. Content strategist Ranjan Royblogged about the anonymous restaurateur,external, who is his friend - he later named the business, which has outlets in Manhattan and Topeka, Kansas, US. Mr Roy said he first heard about the situation in March 2019, when his friend started receiving complaints about deliveries, even though his outlets did not deliver. At that point , he discovered he had been added to DoorDash - and noticed it was charging a lower price for one of his premium pizzas. So he ordered 10 pizzas, paid $160 and had them delivered to a friend's house. The restaurant was then paid $240 for the order by DoorDash. New York City caps fees for food delivery apps Grubhub adds restaurants without permission The next time, the restaurant prepared his friend's order by boxing up the pizza base without any toppings, maximising the ""profit"" from the mismatched prices. ""I was genuinely curious if DoorDash would catch on - but they didn't,"" wrote Mr Roy. DoorDash did not respond to BBC News's request for comment. But Mr Roy said: ""We found out afterward that was all the result of a 'demand test' by DoorDash. ""They have a test period where they scrape the restaurant's website and don't charge any fees to anyone, so they can ideally go to the restaurant with positive order data to then get the restaurant signed on to the platform. ""Third-party delivery platforms, as they've been built, just seem like the wrong model, but instead of testing, failing, and evolving, they've been subsidised into market dominance. ""You have insanely large pools of capital creating an incredibly inefficient money-losing business model."" DoorDash is backed by investment giant Softbank, which this week posted a record-breaking loss of nearly $13bn. Defending the loss, chief executive Masayoshi Son reportedly compared himself to Jesus. The billionaire is said to have stated during a call with investors that Jesus was ""also misunderstood"". He later apologised.

"Rolls-Royce has said it will cut 9,000 jobs and warned it will take ""several years"" for the airline industry to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The Derby-based firm, which makes plane engines, said the reduction of nearly a fifth of its workforce would mainly affect its civil aerospace division. ""This is not a crisis of our making. But it is the crisis that we face and must deal with,"" boss Warren East said. The bulk of the job cuts are expected to be in the UK at its site in Derby. Rolls-Royce employs 52,000 people globally and Mr East told the BBC's Today programme that the company had not yet concluded on ""exactly"" where the job losses would be, due to having to consult with unions. But he said: ""It's fair to say that of our civil aerospace business approximately two-thirds of the total employees are in the UK at the moment and that's probably a good first proxy."" Rolls-Royce's civil aerospace business has a number of sites in the UK, but the largest plant is in Derby. The company said it will also carry out a review of its sites but declined to comment on which ones may close. John, a worker in Rolls-Royce's civil aerospace division who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, said that while he expected there would be job cuts, the eventual 9,000 figure was ""a shock"". ""Since the Covid-19 outbreak we knew that business would shrink,"" he said. But he said the scale of the cuts as well as the potential closure of some sites was a surprise. Unite the union said the decision was ""shameful opportunism"". ""This company has accepted public money to furlough thousands of workers,"" said Unite's assistant general secretary for manufacturing, Steve Turner. ""Unite and Britain's taxpayers deserve a more responsible approach to a national emergency.  We call upon Rolls-Royce to step back from the brink and work with us on a better way through this crisis."" How will airlines get flying again? Rolls-Royce initially furloughed 4,000 workers in the UK last month. Some 3,700 people remain on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme though which the government pays 80% of a worker's wage up to Â£2,500 a month. But Mr East said: ""No government can extend things like furlough schemes for years into the future. We have to look after ourselves and make sure we meet medium term demand."" This morning's job losses are hardly unexpected - airlines have cut their flying hours by 90% or more, and Airbus and Boeing have slashed their production numbers for the next few years - but they are still a heavy blow to one of the UK's few world-class manufacturing companies. While the details of where the cuts will fall have not been finalised, it is likely that two-thirds will go in the UK. The company has already used the government's furlough scheme to help pay the wages of about 4,000 staff, but Warren East, Rolls-Royce's chief executive, said companies could not expect the government to continue such a scheme for several years. There was also a clear hint this morning that some factories may close - the company said it would review its future manufacturing footprint. Some questions remain for Roll-Royce. Investors are scratching their head about when the company's revenues - much of which rely on aircraft to be flying for money to flow - will return. The company has not yet tapped its shareholders for more money - some expect that may eventually come. Air travel has ground to a virtual standstill since the coronavirus began spreading across the world and many airlines have announced steep job cuts. Global air traffic is expected to decline by 45% this year, according to investment bank Baird. It also forecasts that airlines are expected to lose $310bn (Â£253bn) in revenue in 2020. Rolls-Royce said the impact of the pandemic on the company and the whole of the aviation industry ""is unprecedented"". It added that it is ""increasingly clear that activity in the commercial aerospace market will take several years to return to the levels seen just a few months ago"". As well as the job losses, the company said it would cut costs in areas such as its plants and properties. It expects to make cost savings of Â£1.3bn. Paul Everitt, chief executive of ADS, the aerospace industry association, said: ""The crisis is having a major impact on aerospace companies who provide high value, long-term jobs in all regions and nations of the UK, putting thousands more jobs at risk now and in the months ahead.""

"Healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson says it will continue to sell its talc-based Johnson's Baby Powder in the UK and the rest of the world, despite stopping sales in the US and Canada. It said North American sales had shrunk partly because of a ""constant barrage,external"" of advertising by lawyers seeking clients to claim against the company. J&J has been at the centre of claims for years that its talc causes cancer. It has always strenuously defended the product's safety. Johnson & Johnson has beenordered to pay out billions of dollars in compensation, but has so far always successfully appealed against these verdicts. Almost 20,000 people in the US have so far lodged claims against the company. Talc is mined from the earth and is found in seams close to that of asbestos, a material known to cause cancer. The company said in a statement: ""Johnson & Johnson remains steadfastly confident in the safety of talc-based Johnson's Baby Powder."" It said ""decades"" of study by medical and legal experts around the world supported its view, and all verdicts against the company that had gone against it had been overturned on appeal. It will continue to sell its talc-based products in the US and Canada until stocks have sold out. It also sells a cornstarch-based powder which it will continue to sell in North America. It said both types of Johnson's baby powder, talc-based and cornstarch-based, will continue to be sold in other markets around the world where there is ""significantly higher"" consumer demand for the product. The firm said changes in consumer behaviour had also dampened demand for the powder. The firm added that the move was also part of a reassessment of its consumer products prompted by the coronavirus pandemic. It said in October that its testing had found no asbestos in its baby powder after tests conducted by the US Food and Drug Administrationdiscovered trace amounts. The firm is appealing against a 2018 order to pay $4.7bn (Â£3.6bn) in damages to 22 women who alleged that its talc products caused them to develop ovarian cancer.

"Serco is one of the companies hiring, training and operating 15,000 contact tracers for the UK government Outsourcing firm Serco has apologised after accidentally sharing the email addresses of almost 300 contact tracers. The company is training staff to trace cases of Covid-19 for the UK government. It made the error when it emailed new trainees to tell them about training. Serco said it had apologised and would review its processes ""to make sure that this does not happen again"". Contact tracing is a system used to slow the spread of infectious diseases like coronavirus. It is already being used in other countries including Singapore and Germany. In the UK, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said 21,000 contact tracers have been hired, some of whom are healthcare professionals. They will gather contacts from Covid-19 patients and trace those people by phone or email to slow the spread of the disease in the community. Serco is one of the companies hiring, training and operating the 15,000 contact tracers who do not have clinical training. But the mistake may leave the firm in breach of data protection rules. It is understood that at least one member of staff has raised the issue with the Information Commissioner. How will the UK's coronavirus app work? Serco fined Â£19m over tagging scandal Two ex-Serco bosses charged with fraud The error did not involve patients' data but will be unhelpful for a contact tracing project that is set to ask many thousands of people who have fallen ill to share the details of their friends and acquaintances.

Paul Everitt, chief executive of ADS, the aerospace industry association, said: ""The crisis is having a major impact on aerospace companies who provide high value, long-term jobs in all regions and nations of the UK, putting thousands more jobs at risk now and in the months ahead.""

"British Airways consults unions over proposals to cut hundreds of jobs in south Wales Students and apprentices may keep attending virtual classes online for ""some time"" in a staged return to post-16 education in Wales Some young carers have been shouted at by shoppers and stopped from going into supermarkets during the pandemic, a charity says A health board says it is reviewing cases after mental health patients were discharged and advised to seek new referrals after the crisis eased Nurses in Gwynedd and Denbighshire are using an app to send photos and updates to the parents of premature and ill babies Another 14 deaths of people with coronavirus in Wales were confirmed by Public Health Wales on Wednesday, taking its total to 1,238 Max Evans, Bruce Pope and Andy Roberts That is it for today's live page coverage of the coronavirus crisis in Wales. Here are some of the key points from Wednesday: Thanks for joining us - we will be back with more news and updates in the morning. Economy Minister Ken Skates has told BBC Wales that399 jobs at British Airways sites in south Wales could be made redundantunder company proposals. The firm had indicated earlier on Wednesday that more than 1,000 jobs were at risk. BA maintains its long-haul fleet at Cardiff Airport, and has an interiors factory at Blackwood, and an avionics services site in Llantrisant. Stephen Powis, medical director at NHS England, has told today's UK government press conference that, despite an increase in the rate of daily testing, the number of new cases identified is ""stable, or perhaps even falling"" across the UK. This shows the prevalence of the virus in the population is continuing to fall, he adds. Unveiling the slide below, he says the number of people in hospital after a positive test is below 10,000 for the first time since March. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has backed the principle of
setting up an âindependent public inquiryâ into the handling of the coronavirus
pandemic. Mr Drakeford said he had no doubt âthat an independent
inquiry will be required at the right point in that processâ. In a virtual meeting of the Senedd Plaid Cymru leader Adam
Price pressed Mr Drakeford to give timescales for when it would start. ""Could you make some general commitments today to the principle of setting up an independent public inquiry in due course?"" he asked. Mr Drakeford said: âI'm not able to anticipate when that will be, but the
principle that Mr Price has outlined - I'm very happy to confirm my support for
that principle."" Adam Price said the Welsh Government was now âthe first
government within the UK to agree to such an inquiryâ. âDisappointingly, however, the first minister failed to give
any details on when that inquiry will begin."" A schoolgirl in south Wales has written what a local politician calls a ""very moving"" essay to highlight the work of the many heroes of the pandemic. Freya, from Pontypool, listed heroes including her mother caring for her family, along with couriers, bus drivers and NHS workers who had lost their lives. She said their work should not be forgotten, adding: ""Not all heroes wear capes."" The essay was shared on Twitter by Lynne Neagle, member of the Senedd (MS) for Torfaen. Allow Twitter content?

A further 363 deaths of people with coronavirus have been recorded across the UK in the past 24 hours, the UK secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport has said. Oliver Dowden announced the figure at today's UK government briefing. That takes the number of those testing positive who have died so far, according to Department of Health figures, to 35,704, although it is widely accepted that the overall figure is much higher. The culture secretary also confirms 177,216 tests were carried out in the past 24 hours. Thatâs the biggest daily total to date and a huge increase on yesterdayâs figure of just below 100,000. This, however, does not correspond to the number of people actually tested as some individuals are tested more than once. ""Brave leadership"" from the Welsh and UK governments is needed to ensure at-risk British Airways workers have a job to return to, an MS has said. Former Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said news that1,000 south Wales BA jobs were under threatwas ""devastating"". ""The aviation industry has taken a hammer blow due to coronavirus,"" said Mr Davies, member of the Senedd (MS) for South Wales Central. ""Hardworking people at BA in the region will be horribly hit by this news. ""These are high-skilled jobs which will not be easily replaced in our area and this reinforces the importance of getting the economy up and running once again. ""An economic tsunami is heading our way and this is only the first wave. We need brave leadership at Westminster and Cardiff Bay to ensure people have jobs to return to."" Andrew RT Davies: ""These are high-skilled jobs which will not be easily replaced"" Two of Monmouthshire's four recycling centres will reopen next Tuesday but the council has said people need topre-book before visiting,external. The tips at Llanfoist near Abergavenny and Five Lanes near Caerwent will reopen but for ""essential trips only."" The facilities at Mitchel Troy near Monmouth and Usk remain shut.

He was stopped on the A483 near Wrexham, the force said. The threat to 1,000 jobs at British Airways sites in south Wales is ""unlawful"", a trade union has claimed. The airline hasstarted a 45-day consultationwith workers at its three Welsh sites - including BA's main Â£70m maintenance base at Cardiff Airport. Richard Munn, regional officer for Unite said: ""âThis announcement by BA will have a devastating impact on our members and their families. ""It will also cause enormous hurt to the economy of south east Wales and communities that still bear scars from the de-industrialisation of the 1980s and 1990s."" Mr Munn said the proposed cuts were combined with a ""clear statement of intent to worsen terms and conditions and employment policies"". He said many of those at risk of redundancy had been furloughed under the UK governmentâs Job Retention Scheme, which he said was is ""clearly designed to 'retain' jobs"". ""It also means that meaningful consultation is impossible,"" he added. ""Unite therefore regard the consultation as unlawful and are demanding that BA rescind the notices of redundancy and enter in to meaningful talks with Unite. ""Unite will be doing all it can to support its members in BA at this present timeâ. South Wales Police have warned people to check their local waste and recycling centre is open before heading there to dispose of rubbish. While some tips have now reopened, South Wales Police tweeted to say it was by no means the case with all. ""Each council has different processes in place for allowing entry, so please check beforehand,"" they said.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A worker at the British Airways site in Blackwood has described news that more than 1,000 jobs are at risk at the firm's south Wales sites as ""gutting"". BA has started a 45-day consultation with workers based at Llantrisant, Blackwood and Cardiff Airport. âThese are decent jobs round here and I just donât know what the guys in there will do now,"" said the employee, who did not wish to be named. âItâs a very sombre mood. It really is.â Many people outside Wales ""appear to have woken up from a 20-year sleep"" over the reality of devolution, Wales' first minister has said. Most of the lockdown powers for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland rest with their respective devolved governments rather than UK ministers, who are only entirely responsible for the regulations in England. Mark Drakeford told a virtual Senedd meeting he thought devolution had been ""brought home to people in this crisis in a way that it hasn't been over the last 20 years"". He was answering a question from Mark Reckess, leader of the Brexit Party in the Welsh Parliament, who said a ""significant number of people in Wales are only now recognising the extent"" to which powers had transferred from London to Cardiff. Mr Reckless told Mr Drakeford ""many"" people would ""prefer the British prime minister to take key decisions, rather than you"". Mr Drakeford responded: ""I doubt that it is true [to say] that in Wales people aren't aware of devolution. ""It is certainly true that people outside Wales and in London appear to have woken up from a 20-year sleep on that devolution agenda.""  Mark Drakeford said the Covid-19 crisis had ""brought home"" to many people how much power was now devolved A rainbow with the words ""Cheers, drive"" has been added to the road where bus drivers leave a depot during the Covid-19 pandemic by their bosses. Cardiff Bus tweeted an image showing the words of lockdown solidarity. ""Weâve added a little message for our drivers on the road leading out of the depot,"" they added.  Allow Twitter content?

The plan to begin reopening schools in England from 1 June is ""falling apart in the hands of the government of England"", Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said some primary schools could reopen to some year groups from that date. But the UK government, which oversees education in England, isfacing pressure from councils and unionsover safety and timing. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has said No 10 was taking all concerns ""very seriously"". In today's virtual session of the Welsh Parliament, Mr Drakeford said setting such timescales offered ""no guarantee"" in progress towards exiting the coronavirus lockdown. ""Look how the 1st June timetable for opening schools in England is falling apart in the hands of the government of England, how Downing Street last night had to say that the first of June was an aspiration, not a deadline, not a timescale after all,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""In the end we thought it was more of a distraction than a concentration on the matters that really deserve our attention."" Mr Drakeford was replying to a question from Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Paul Davies, who criticised the Welsh Goverment for not setting out timescales to exit lockdown. ""There is a genuine debate to be had as to whether timescales are a helpful way of setting out the future,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""Timescales are no guarantee, are they, as Mr Davies will well know."" In the earlier daily Welsh Government press conference, Education Minister Kirsty Williams said she would not set an ""arbitrary date"" for when children could return to school in Wales. Consumers""may never shop the same way again"" following the
coronavirus crisis, the boss of Marks and Spencer has said. Steve Rowe's comments came as the retailer said clothing and homeware sales had fallen by 75% in the six weeks to 9 May. Food sales also fell, by 8.8%, although M&S said many of its Simply Food stores were trading strongly. The update came as M&S said its profits for the year to March had dropped by more than 20%. Pre-tax profits fell to Â£403m from Â£511m in the previous year, as M&S's troubled clothing business continued to struggle. A driver has been fined after travelling some 200 miles (320km) from south east England to a Welsh beauty spot, police have said. South Wales Police tweeted an image of the motorist's car, after they allegedly breached Covid-19 lockdown restrictions in the Vale of Glamorgan.

Brian MeechanBBC Wales business correspondent British Airways is consulting with unions onproposals to cut more than 1,000 jobs in south Wales. This is confirmation of terrible news for BA workers. Job losses are expected across the aerospace and defence industry which employs 23,000 people in Wales. The industry has already been badly hit by coronavirus and it's almost certain that it will take years to fully recover. The umbrella body, Aerospace Wales, told MPs last week that up to 8,000 jobs could go here. BA's maintenance facility at Rhoose in the Vale of Glamorgan services the company's long-haul fleet of planes. These flights are the ones that passengers are expected to take longer to return to, so demand for these planes may be reduced for years. The facility is also a user of the Welsh Government-owned Cardiff Airport where the BA planes arrive for service.

BA had said it would cut 12,000 in total from its operations. There have also been warnings of global job losses at Airbus and GE Aviation.

Both companies are major employers in Wales. Wales' chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton has issued this timely reminder of what people in Wales can and cannot do as temperatures soar on Wednesday. He says we still can't gather in groups, visit beauty spots or meet people we don't live with. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Rail passengers have mostly stayed at home Some rail passengers have been waiting eight weeks for a season ticket refund and are not clear on when they will get the money, a lobby group has said. Passengers were promised refunds at the start of the coronavirus lockdown to encourage them to stay at home. Transport Focus said some were still waiting for refunds of several hundreds of pounds. Rail companies said they had processed more season ticket refunds than in the whole of last year. In late March, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the government would ""ensure no-one is unfairly out of pocket for doing the right thing"" when he said refunds would be granted to those staying at home. In a survey of 700 passengers last week, Transport Focus said a third of those asked had not yet received a refund, and six in 10 had not been kept informed over how long it would take. They included one passenger who said he had no idea of the progress of his claim for a Â£3,000 refund, and another who said he had been waiting for eight weeks for Â£720 to be returned. Anthony Smith, chief executive of the watchdog, said: âWhile the majority of passengers have received a refund, six weeks on from applying others are still out of pocket and in the dark.â In normal times, rail companies generally promise to pay within 28 days. Transport Focus said many people would be hit hard financially by the coronavirus outbreak and so needed clarity over when any money would be back in their bank account. Waterloo station is normally full of passengers Jacqueline Starr, chief operating officer for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents the rail industry, said the number of refund claims was âunprecedentedâ. âIn the last two months over 109,000 season tickets have been refunded, which is more than the entirety of last year,"" she said. âWe thank people for their patience as refunds are processed during these exceptional times and we have doubled the number of staff processing refund claims.â In total, train companies had given 2.8 million refunds on all types of rail tickets, worth more than Â£247m, in two months. Customers can apply for 56 days, double the normal period, and season ticket refunds are being backdated. Stations put crowd-control measures in place Is social distancing on trains here to stay?

Rishi Sunak gave evidence to an online session of the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak says ""it will take time"" for people to resume their economic habits ""even once we have reopened"" and there will not therefore be an ""immediate bounce back"" for the economy. He tells a House of Lords committee: ""We're likely to face a severe recession the likes of which we have not seen and, of course, that will have an impact on unemployment."" Mr Sunak also warns that there could be permanent scarring to the economy, with output down on pre-lockdown levels for a prolonged period. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg suggests Mr Sunak's ""tone today is a lot less enthusiastic than early talk about a quick bounce back for the economy"". The Scottish government says a report that criticises its response to the Covid-19 crisis in care homes ""paints a wholly misleading picture"". Earlier, the former head of services for older people in Glasgowtold BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimethe impact of the pandemic on the sector was the single greatest failure of devolved government since its creation. But a government spokeswoman says ""firm action"" was taken from the outset to protect care home staff and residents and that initial guidance for care homes, setting out
the clinical and practical steps to be taken, was updated on 26 March and 15 May. ""Each iteration is a
reflection of our growing understanding of the virus and of the situation on
the ground,"" she says. The spokeswoman also highlights First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's announcement of ""enhanced outbreak investigations"" in care
homes on 1 May. ""We have taken a number of other steps, such as direct delivery
of personal protective equipment (PPE), a stepped increase in testing, with the
introduction from next week of testing for all care home staff, and emergency
legislation to ensure continuity of care in the event of a care home failing,"" it concludes.

With unemployment rising because of the lockdown, the man whose stage name is Loki urges the UK and Scottish governments to intervene to ensure job opportunities for the young. But he tells BBC Radio Scotland: ""Politicians are more interested in investing in sections of the population where they are likely to get some kind of return on that, whether economically or politically. ""Landlords are worthy of support, renters aren't worthy of support. Self-employed people and entrepreneurs are worthy of support, people who are being laid off aren't worthy of support. As a demographic, young people are one of the most easily disposable groups.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland It took the Scottish government two months to react properly to the Covid-19 crisis in care homes, leading to unnecessary deaths from the virus, a report for the Common Weal think tank claims. ""I think it is a whole system failure, but we are not just talking here about unnecessary deaths but we are talking here about how people died,"" Nick Kempe, the former head of services for older people in Glasgow, tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""We know that people haven't necessarily been given the right prescriptions and we have policies about palliative care, about dying well - I don't think they have been implemented. ""But, as well as the deaths from Covid, we obviously have the deaths from other reasons in care homes where people haven't received appropriate medical treatment and we have the impact on the lives of those who are still living."" Mr Kempe says privatisation of the care home sector, the lack of planning for a pandemic despite warnings from the 2016 Cygnus  Exercise and the fact it took eight weeks for the Scottish government to provide ""very good"" guidance to care homes all contributed to the crisis. Scottish fruit farmer James Porter has said he needs to find hundreds of pickers UK Environment Secretary George Eustice says only ""around a third"" of migrant workers normally expected for the harvest are currently in the country.

is the single greatest failure of devolved government since its creation, the former head of services for older people in Glasgow

time when just under half of the country's 3,200 deaths from the coronavirus

20 years or so,"" he tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""That's not a common picture across Scotland - in
some places there are some good providers - but there are a lot of providers
who have just been in it for the money and what has happened is that staffing
standards, staff training on matters like infection control has been totally
run down. ""We now basically have an untrained workforce who were
sitting there at the time when Covid-19 broke totally unprepared for what was

"Many migrants have also taken their families along on their difficult journeys Tens of thousands of daily-wage migrant workers suddenly found themselves without jobs or a source of income when India announced a lockdown on 24 March. Overnight, the cities they had helped build and run seemed to have turned their backs on them, the trains and buses which should have carried them home suspended. So with the looming fear of hunger, men, women and children were forced to begin arduous journeys back to their villages - cycling or hitching rides on tuk-tuks, lorries, water tankers and milk vans. For many, walking was the only option. Some travelled for a few hundred kilometres, while others covered more than a thousand to go home. They weren't always alone - some had young children and others had pregnant wives, and the life they had built for themselves packed into their ragtag bags. Many never made it. Here, the BBC tells the story of just a handful of the hundreds who have lost their lives on the road home. Rajan Yadav, his wife Sanju and their two children wanted to make it big in Mumbai Sanju Yadav and her husband, Rajan, and their two children - Nitin and Nandini - arrived in India's financial capital, Mumbai, a decade ago with their meagre belongings and dreams of a brighter future. Her children, she hoped, would thrive growing up in the city. ""It was not like she didn't like the village life,"" Rajan explained. ""She just knew that Mumbai offered better opportunities for all of us."" Indeed, it was Sanju that encouraged Rajan to push himself. ""I used to do an eight-hour shift in a factory. Sanju motivated me do something more, so we bought a food cart and started selling snacks from 16:00 to 22:00. ""She pushed me to think big, she used to say that having our business was way better than a job. Job had a fixed salary, but business allowed us to grow."" Two years ago, all the hard work seemed to be paying off. Rajan used his savings and a bank loan to buy a tuk-tuk. The vehicle-for-hire brought more money for Sanju and her family. But then came coronavirus. Thousands of people have left the cities The couple first heard Prime Minister Narendra Modi talk about the virus on TV on 19 March. A full, three-week lockdown was announced less than a week later. They used up most of their savings to pay rent, repay the loan and buy groceries in March and April. They were hoping that the city would reopen in May, but then the lockdown was extended again. Out of money and options, they decided to go back to their village in Jaunpur district in Uttar Pradesh state. They applied for tickets on the special trains that were being run for migrants, but had no luck for a week. Desperate and exhausted, they decided to undertake the 1,500-km long journey in their tuk-tuk. The family-of-four left Mumbai on 9 May. Many were travelling with small children Rajan would drive from 05:00 to 11:00. He would then rest during the day, and at 18:00 the family would be back on the road until 23:00. ""We ate whatever dry food we had packed and slept on pavements. The prospect of being in the safety of our village kept us going,"" he says. But in the early hours of 12 May - just 200km from their village - a truck rammed into the tuk-tuk from behind. Sanju and Nandini died on the spot. Rajan and Nitin escaped with minor injuries. ""It all ended so quickly,"" Rajan says. ""We were so close to our village. We were so excited. But I have nothing left now - just a big void."" He says he can't help but keep thinking about the train tickets that never came. ""I wish I had gotten the tickets. I wish I had never started the journeyâ¦ I wish I was not poor."" Lallu Ram Yadav was excited to spend time with his family Lallu Ram Yadav used to meet his cousin Ajay Kumar every Sunday to reminisce about the village he had left for Mumbai a decade earlier, in search of a better life for his wife and six children. For 10 years, the 55-year-old had worked as a security guard, 12 hours a day, six days a week. But his hard work amounted to little once the lockdown began, and the cousins both found their savings quickly ran out. Lallu Ram called his family to say they were coming home - at least, he would now get to spend time with his children, he said. And so Lallu Ram and Ajay Kumar joined the desperate scramble to find a way home to the village in Uttar Pradesh's Allahabad district, some 1,400km away. But the price demanded by lorry drivers proved too much. Instead, inspired by the migrants walking home they saw on the television, they packed small bags and began the journey on foot with four friends. Many migrants say they don't want to come back to cities The covered around 400km in the first 48 hours - hitchhiking in lorries along the way. But  the journey was more difficult than they had imagined. ""It was really hot and we would get tired quickly,"" Ajay Kumar said. ""The leather shoes we were wearing were extremely uncomfortable."" They all had blisters on their feet after walking for a day, but giving up was not an option. One evening, Lallu Ram started complaining about breathing difficulties. They had just entered Madhya Pradesh state - they still had a long way to go, but they decided to rest for a while before starting again. Lallu Ram never woke up. When they took him to a nearby hospital, they were told he had died of a cardiac arrest, triggered by exhaustion and fatigue. Many found it difficult to find food during their journeys They didn't know what to do with the body. An ambulance was going to take five to eight hours to reach them. The group had around 15,000 rupees ($199; Â£163) between them - half the amount needed to hire a lorry. But one driver agreed to take the rest of the payment later. And that's how they took the body back home. Lallu Ram couldn't fulfil the promise of spending more time with his children. ""The family's only breadwinner is gone,"" says Ajay Kumar. ""Nobody helped us. My cousin didn't have to die - but it was a choice between hunger and the long journey. ""We poor people often have to pick the best from several bad choices. It didn't work out for my cousin this time. It seldom works out for poor people like him."" Sagheer Ansari was an expert tailor but had lost his job recently Sagheer and Sahib Ansari were good tailors. They never struggled to find work in Delhi's booming garment factories - until the lockdown. Within days, they lost their jobs. The brothers thought things would go back to normal in a few weeks and stayed put in their tiny one-room house. When their money ran out, they asked family members in the village for help. When the lockdown was further extended in May, their patience ran out. ""We couldn't have asked the family for more money. We were supposed to help them, not take money from them,"" Sahib says. They would wait in queues for food being distributed by the government. But, Sahib says, it was never enough and they always felt hungry. So the brothers discussed the idea of going back to their village in Motihari district in Bihar state, some 1,200km from Delhi. Sagheer has left behind his wife and three young children They and their friends decided to buy used bicycles, but could only afford six for eight people. So they decided that they would all take turns to ride pillion. They left Delhi in the early hours of 5 May. It was a hot day and the group felt tired after every 10km. ""Our knees would hurt, but we kept pedalling. We hardly got a proper meal and that made it more difficult to pedal,"" Sahib says. After riding for five days, the group reached Lucknow - the capital of Uttar Pradesh. It had been two days since they had had a proper meal and they were mostly surviving on puffed rice. ""All of us were very hungry. We sat on a road divider to eat because there was hardly any traffic,"" he says. Many migrants have had to travel in overcrowded lorries But then a car came out of nowhere, hitting the barrier and striking Sagheer. He died in a hospital a few hours later. ""My world came crashing down,"" Sahib says. ""I had no idea what I was going to tell his two children and his wife. ""He used to love home-cooked food and was looking forward to it. He died without having a proper meal for days."" Sahib eventually reached home with his brother's body, brought by an ambulance. But he couldn't mourn with his family for long, as he was put into a quarantine centre right after the burial. ""I don't know who to blame for his death - coronavirus, hunger or poverty. I have understood one thing: I will never leave my village. I will make less money but at least I will stay alive."" Naresh Singh with his wife (standing to his right) and children Jaikrishna Kumar, 17, regrets encouraging his father Balram to come home after the lockdown started. Balram was from a village in Bihar's Khagadia district, but was working in Gujarat - one of the states worst-hit by the coronavirus - when much of India closed down in March. He and his friend Naresh Singh, a maintenance worker for mobile phone towers, were both working hard so their sons back in Bihar could have better futures. Balram wanted Jaikrishna to go to college, Nikram wanted his sons to become government officers. They started their journey on foot, but about 400km into it, policemen helped them and others to hitch a ride in a lorry. The ""ride"" involved them all being precariously perched on top of cargo - a common sight on Indian highways. People have taken extreme risks to get home But this time, the driver lost control in Dausa town in Rajasthan state, ramming the lorry into a tree. Both Naresh and Balram died in the accident. Now Jaikrishna Kumar says he will probably have to quit studying and find a job to support the family. ""The accident took away my father and my dreams of getting an education. I wish there was another way. I don't like the idea of going to a city to work, but what other option do I have? ""My father wanted me to break the cycle of poverty. I don't know how to do it without him.""  A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? UPLIFTING STORY: '' I got a life-changing opportunity in lockdown' POST-COVID WORLD:Will we ever shake hands again?

"Toilet paper was photographed on sale for Â£1 a roll in Denbighshire Some shopkeepers have been profiteering during the coronavirus pandemic, Trading Standards Wales has found. Customers across Wales have reported seeing hand sanitiser being sold at Â£15 for 250ml, toilet rolls for Â£1 each and pasta sold by the handful. The Competition and Markets Authority launched a taskforce to crackdown on the profiteers and called for emergency legislation to prevent price hikes. The Welsh Government said it was working to maintain normal supplies. Trading Standards officers in Swansea have received complaints of Calpol being sold for Â£10, loaves of bread doubling in price to Â£3, packs of toilet roll being sold for Â£8.50, individual toilet rolls being sold from a multi-pack, pasta being sold by the handful andhalal meatmore than trebling in price to Â£11 per kilo (35 ounces). Coronavirus: How do I get a food parcel? Coronavirus: Supermarkets sent list of Welsh people 'shielding' Coronavirus: Tesco tells people to visit stores to get food Swansea council's cabinet member for environment and infrastructure management Councillor Mark Thomas warned the unscrupulous shopkeepers that people had a long memory. He recalled the owner of two shops gratuitously overcharging for bread in the aftermath ofhuge snow storms in 1982: ""When it was over, both shops shut within a few weeks,"" he said. ""People will remember."" Profiteering shopkeepers risk receiving a warning or enforcement action from the Competition and Markets Authority The Competition and Markets Authority, a non-ministerial UK government department, has written to all Welsh MPs and assembly members to highlight the issue. Its chief executive Andrea Coscelli said: ""This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable. ""We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid-19 outbreak. ""But if they do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible."" She said interventions could include warnings, enforcement action or seeking emergency powers. ""We hope that such action will not be necessary, but we will do whatever is required to stop a small minority of businesses that may seek to exploit the present situation,"" she said.

LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Delme Nash, a senior trading standards officer at Torfaen council, said Torfaen Trading Standards had also received complaints about profiteering over the last few weeks. ""Mostly, this is an increase of hand sanitiser, toilet rolls being sold singularly etc,"" he said. ""Current pricing legislation is insufficient to deal with price gouging... effectively they [shops] can charge what they like. ""We can take action when prices are advertised at one price and then sold for a higher price but not when a product is priced correctly. It is clear that current pricing legislation is ineffective in this instance."" Alison Farrar, an investigator for Trading Standards Wales, said it had received about 30 complaints about profiteering in the last two weeks. ""These range from prices doubling to splitting up four-packs of soap and selling at a high price,"" she said. ""The advice is not to pay these inflated prices and report them immediately. ""However, the widespread worry and uncertainty around the current measures mean that people don't know when they can next get to the shops."" The Welsh Government said it ""would never expect"" any individual or business to try and profit from a pandemic.

"Australia was only just emerging from devastating bushfires when the coronavirus struck, and as the BBC's Shaimaa Khalil writes, some tourist-dependent towns are now facing a double disaster. When blazes ravaged the small New South Wales' town of Mogo on New Year's Eve, all Lorena Granados could do was flee. She and her husband Gaspar ran through the flames under red skies as the fire destroyed the leather business they owned for nearly 20 years. All that was left were a few burned and warped sewing machines that they later salvaged from the wreckage. During the bushfire season, almost 500 homes were lost in Eurobodalla Shire Council, where Mogo is located.  In the following weeks, the Business Council of Australia announced it was funding a pop-up mall and erecting 10 temporary buildings in an attempt to give small businesses a chance to start trading again. Lorena was getting ready for the big opening when Covid-19 became a global pandemic. Australia closed its borders and tightened its social distancing rules. All non-essential services were closed, which meant that no customers passed through the pop-up mall for weeks. It was another big blow to the small town which depends mainly on tourism. ""It's heart-breaking and soul destroying,"" Lorena said. ""Our motivation went from a hundred to nothing. We invested money in stock and we had every hope that we were going to have an extremely busy Easter. We weren't expecting to be stopped in our tracks so early in our recovery process."" Gaspar and Lorena escaped the fires but have to rebuild from the ground up The government has recently announced a package of A$650m ($400m; Â£210m) to help communities worst hit by the bushfires. It's the last instalment of a A$2bn recovery fund. But many complain that getting financial support has been a long and complicated process made even more difficult by Covid-19. ""This has slowed everything down and it actually increased the pain,"" said Peter Williams as he stood in the middle of rubble that used to be the pottery and art shop he owned with his wife Vanessa. Only a few metres away was another pile of rubble that used to be their home. Five months after the fires of New Year's Eve, they both still seemed in a daze as they examined the shattered and blackened pieces of artefacts they were hoping to sell during the Christmas and New Year period. The cleaning up process was hampered first by the floods that came soon after the fires and then by Covid-19 restrictions. Eleven people in the shire have tested positive, according to New South Wales Health. ""Everything has been delayed. The workers had to be more careful,"" said Peter. ""We were really looking for a quick clean-up so we could psychologically start afresh and build our lives again."" Seeing the destruction every day as he and his wife drive through town has been a constant reminder of what they've lost. IN AUSTRALIA:How virus helped revive Australian PM's fortunes GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? With no international tourists expected in Australia for many months, it's not just small businesses that are in dire straits. Famous attractions like Mogo's Wildlife Park are also struggling to make ends meet. The zoo became famous during the fires for its dramatic rescue of its animals as fires approached the town. It had been open again for less than a month before the coronavirus forced it to close again. ""The knockout blow was Covid-19,"" said zoo director Chad Staples. ""The fires were tough but they were a shared experience. It was something that brought the community together. Covid19 is the exact opposite. We've been told to separate and be insular."" Mogo Zoo had to move its animals from the path of the bushfires During a busy season the zoo gets at least a thousand visitors a day. Now it's all but deserted except for the animals and the staff. It costs nearly A$15,000 a month just to feed the animals and they've had no money coming in for months. Chad hopes that the eventual return of domestic visitors, albeit in small numbers, will give them some respite. But he admitted that even with a further easing of restrictions, the feel of the zoo will be significantly different. ""We're not going to have those days where the zoo is packed with people. It's going to be almost like private tours, the numbers are going to be that small."" Chad Staples says he doesn't expect to see the zoo full of people anytime soon Australia is in a much better position than many countries when it comes to Covid-19 cases. Restrictions are being eased gradually in bid to reopen the economy. But for people in tourist towns like Mogo who have suffered a double whammy in just a few months, getting government financial support has been a long and draining process How virus helped revive Australian PM's fortunes Virus 'Australia's chance to grasp green energy' Lorena said that with the government focused almost entirely on keeping Covid-19 under control, bushfire-affected communities felt left behind.

"Coronavirus and the collapse of oil revenue have increased the pressure on President Maduro Venezuela has launched legal proceedings against the Bank of England to try to force it to release â¬930m ($1bn; Â£820m) worth of Venezuelan gold. The gold is being retained following British and US sanctions on Venezuela. Venezuela says it wants the Bank of England to sell part of the Venezuelan gold reserves to use the funds to fight the spread of coronavirus. It says it has agreed for the money to be sent directly to the UN to ensure it is not used for other purposes. It is calling for the funds to be transferred to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to administer the purchase of supplies like medical equipment to fight Covid-19. Why coronavirus could be catastrophic for Venezuela Venezuela crisis in 300 words US offers Venezuela sanctions relief The legal wrangling comes amid fears about the ability of Venezuela's crumbling healthcare system to handle the outbreak. This video can not be played The Venezuelan hospital where there's barely running water, let alone medicine Legal documents say the bank wants the transfer made ""as a matter of urgency"" and it filed a legal claim to that effect in a London court on 14 May. ""With lives on the line, now is not the time to attempt to score political points,"" Sarosh Zaiwalla, a London-based lawyer representing Venezuela's central bank, said in a statement. The UN told the BBC in an emailed statement only that it had been approached by the Venezuelan bank to explore such mechanisms. The Bank of England declined to comment when asked about the case by Reuters news agency. The Bank of England is the second largest keeper of gold in the world, with approximately 400,000 gold bars - only the New York Federal Reserve has more. It has one of the largest gold vaults in the world and prides itself on never having had any gold stolen in its more than 320-year history. Central banks of a number of nations use it to store their national gold reserves and Venezuela is one of them. Despite the country's oil riches, Venezuela's economy has been in freefall for years due to a combination of government mismanagement and corruption, further exacerbated by international sanctions. As Venezuela produces very little apart from oil, it needs to import goods from abroad, for which it needs access to foreign currency. But with oil production a fraction of what it once was, Venezuela's foreign currency reserves have been dwindling. The government of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro turned to selling off some of the gold reserves kept at the central bank in Venezuela to its allies in Turkey, Russia and the United Arab Emirates. This video can not be played Venezuela's gold diplomacy gamble But the US, which does not recognise Mr Maduro's government, last year warned ""bankers, brokers, traders and facilitators""  not to deal in ""gold, oil, or other Venezuelan commodities stolen from the Venezuelan people by the Maduro mafia"". Venezuela has reportedly continued to sell gold to its ally Iran, which is also under US sanctions, but even so its international reserves reached a 30-year low at the beginning of this year, Venezuelan Central Bank figures revealed. It badly needs hard currency and sees the gold stored in the vaults of the Bank of England as the solution. Venezuela first approached the Bank of England at the end of 2018. Finance Minister SimÃ³n Zerpa and Central Bank President Calixto Ortega travelled to London to demand that Venezuela be allowed to take the gold back to Venezuela. In January 2019, the Bank of England refused the request. All it said publicly was that it did not comment on customer relationships. Venezuela has $1bn worth of gold stored in the Bank of England The decision, however, came just days after Mr Maduro's rival, Juan GuaidÃ³, had declared himself president, arguing that the 2018 election which returned Mr Maduro to power had been fraudulent. Mr GuaidÃ³, who was quickly recognised as the legitimate leader by more than 50 nations - including the UK and the US, asked the Bank of England not to hand the gold over to the Maduro government, arguing that it would be used for corrupt purposes. The British minister of state for the Americas at the time, Alan Duncan, said the decision was a matter for the Bank of England and its governor, but added that ""no doubt when they do so they will take into account there are now a large number of countries across the world questioning the legitimacy of NicolÃ¡s Maduro and recognising that of Juan GuaidÃ³"". At the same time, top US officials - for whom President Maduro has long been a thorn - were also lobbying their British counterparts to cut the Maduro government off from its foreign assets. While the Bank of England never went beyond saying that it did not comment on customer relations it is thought that international sanctions on Venezuela and regulations on preventing money laundering influenced its decision. Venezuela's offer to have the funds transferred to the UN directly are designed to circumvent those regulations.

Jessica Murphy, BBC News, Toronto Fire fighters will have to adjust how they work amid the pandemic Officials across North America are grappling with planning for floods, wildfires, hurricanes, severe heat waves and other extreme weather events this summer alongside the pandemic. The considerations necessary are wide-ranging, from managing already strained resources to sourcing extra protective equipment and figuring out the logistics of safely evacuating at-risk populations - even how to cajole evacuees, who might be fearful of catching the virus, from their homes. This week, 10,000 residents were evacuated in Michigan after two dams collapsed following days of heavy rain. Governor Gretchen Whitmer, noting the city of Midland in the US state could see historic high water levels, said: ""To go through this in the midst of a global pandemic is almost unthinkable.""

People banged pans in the street in protests against Spain's coronavirus measures Protestors in Spain have continued their nightly banging of pots and pans as the government extended the national state of emergency for the fifth time. Spaniards against the coronavirus restrictions register their dissatisfaction with the country's left-wing minority government every day at 21:00 local time. The state of emergency has been extended for a further two weeks. Shops have begun to open in most of the country apart from Barcelona and Madrid, but travel between provinces remains limited. Spain is one of the hardest-hit countries by coronavirus and had one of the strictest lockdowns, with children kept indoors for six weeks. Nearly 28,000 people have died from Covid-19. On Thursday,new rules about wearing face masks come into force. It will be compulsory for everyone to wear a mask indoors and outdoors where social distancing is not possible - the exemptions are children under six and people with health conditions, including asthma and anxiety. But children aged three to five are still encouraged to wear face coverings. Spain renewed its state of emergency on Wednesday for the fifth time With their studio closed to the public, Daryl Granger and his wife Karen found inspiration for their next project close to home - in their own backyard. The couple own and operate RoseLe Studio in Simcoe, Ontario in Canada. Before coronavirus, RoseLe studio specialized in staged photographs that made its subjects look like characters in a movie. So building an elaborate miniature grocery store for squirrels wasn't too big a stretch. His biggest challenge was keeping the set out of the reach of his two dogs.  Mr Granger told the BBC he got the idea by sitting in his backyard with ""lots of downtime"". ""Wow we have a lot of squirrels here!"" he said. With peanuts acting as both bait and props, it didn't take long for the squirrels to catch on. ""They have all different personalities. You can tell we have a pushy one!"" he said. ""I love the interaction they have with one another... You can totally see the story."" Dr Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, speaking at the White House in April The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released detailed guidelines for establishments beginning to reopen in the United States. The60-page document,externalis the most comprehensive produced by the US government and includes suggestions for specific settings such as schools, restaurants and mass transit systems. President Donald Trump has said that the US needs to move forward with lifting restrictions and the guidelines will aid communities as they look to reopen their economies. As we reported earlier, all 50 states have allowed some businesses to reopen, with some acting before meeting federal guidelines. Michael BuchananSocial Affairs Correspondent, BBC News Anwar Hussain Oli, Dr Louisa Rajakumari and Dr Yusuf Patel are among those who have died Newham in east London has the highest death rate from coronavirus in England and Wales. For much of April, one of its residents, Ghouse Fazaluddin, was consumed by one thought: ""We couldn't just stand back and watch our dead be buried in mass graves."" Using his background as a telecoms project manager, he set to work. A WhatsApp group was created and volunteers from the Jamia mosque in Newham, east London, where Mr Fazaluddin is a trustee, were recruited. The task in hand was essential, but grim. There had been so many deaths that a backlog of bodies had built up and people were required to prepare each person for burial. Mr Fazaluddin says: ""The common goal was, we cannot forget our deceased, we cannot just leave them to be buried without the ritual washing that takes place, and that people's dignity, the dignity of the deceased, was preserved."" Read more on Newham Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Inside Downing Street there is an acute awareness that the gradual move out of the lockdown is going to be much more complicated than slamming the doors in the first place. That's the case both in terms of creating plans and policies that give people enough reassurance to take tiny steps to start to get back to normal, only weeks after the peak of a terrible disease, and trying to do so without taking on too much political water, when the consensus that shaped the start of the crisis has already started to fray. And the ongoing tussle over England's return to schools is perhaps the first big test. Read more from Laura. Brazil currently has the third largest number of cases in the world Two controversial anti-malarial drugs have been approved for use in coronavirus patients by Brazil's health ministry. No conclusive evidence exists that the two drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, are effective in treating Covid-19. Patients will need to sign a waiver recognising the potential side effects. In March Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro claimed on social media that hydroxychloroquine was totally effective in treating the virus -Facebook and Twitter later deleted his postsfor spreading fake news. On Monday US President Donald Trump announced he had beentaking hydroxychloroquine as a preventative measure. But the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says the drug has ""not been shown to be safe and effective"". ""We need larger, high-quality randomised clinical trialsin order to better evaluate their effectiveness,"" says University of Oxford's Kome Gbinigie, author of a report on anti-malarial testing for Covid-19. There are risks of serious side effects from the drugs, affecting the eyes and the heart among other organs. Indian emergency workers in masks cleared fallen trees in Digha Coronavirus restrictions have been hampering emergency and
relief efforts in eastern India and Bangladesh where a super cyclone has made violent
landfall, killing at least 15 people as it lashed coastal communities with ferocious wind and rain. Cyclone Amphan uprooted trees and toppled homes in both
countries, including in the Indian city of Kolkata in West Bengal. Nearly 3m people were evacuated - most of them in Bangladesh - before the storm
hit. Covid-19 and social-distancing measures have made mass
evacuations more difficult for authorities, with shelters unable to be used to
full capacity. The storm is expected to have caused deadly storm surges
although its winds have now weakened. Read more. If you're just joining us, a very warm welcome to our continuing coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.

Police chiefs want fines in Wales to be the same as England Maximum fixed penalty notices in Wales for breaching lockdown will rise to Â£1,920, the Welsh Government has confirmed. First Minister Mark Drakeford has faced calls to raise the penalties to deter breaches. Initial fines will remain at Â£60, but will double for each subsequent offence up to the sixth occurrence. But Plaid Cymru police and crime commissioners say calls to match England's higher fines structure - starting at Â£100 - have been rejected. Individuals who do not pay the notice could be taken to court, with magistrates able to impose unlimited fines. Miners are among the key workers who have been allowed to carry on in South Africa At least40,000 people could die with coronavirus in South Africaby the end of the year, scientists have warned. The projections were made by a modelling consortium set up to help government planning over the outbreak and assume that tough restrictions will be eased from 1 June, as President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced. The curbs - which include a ban on alcohol and tobacco sales - have been credited with slowing the spread of the virus, with 17,200 cases and 312 deathsreported so far,,externalway less than the figures in Spain, which has a smaller population. While President Ramaphosa has said lockdown regulations would be eased from ""level 4"" to ""level 3"" from early June, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize has said that according to the World Health Organization, South Africa is not yet ready for level 3 because infections continue to rise every day. The opposition party is taking the government to court, arguing that the stringent regulations are unwarranted and the ban on alcohol and tobacco sales should be lifted. Bolivia's health minister is being investigated over the purchase of overpriced ventilators for Covid-19 patients. Marcelo Navajas and four other officials are being questioned by police about the purchase of some 170 ventilators from a Spanish firm. The health ministry allegedly paid around $27,000 (Â£22,000; â¬25,000) for each ventilator, when their real price was reportedly $10,000-$12,000. Mr Navajas earlier told leading Bolivian newspaper La Razon the purchase had been ""transparent"". The Latin American country has reported 4,481 cases of coronavirus and 189 deaths. Police in Macau - a special administrative region of China - have rejected a request to hold an annual Tiananmen Square massacre vigil, citing concerns over the coronavirus, local media report. It will the first time in 30 years that the vigil will not take place, according toMacau Business,external. The group that organises the vigil, the Democratic Development Union (DDU), said it would challenge the decision in court. Macau, a former Portuguese colony and a near neighbour of Hong Kong, has not had any new cases of Covid-19 for 41 days, reports say. Vigils are held annually in Macau and Hong Kong to commemorate the victims of Tiananmen Square.  The victims were students and workers who, in 1989, occupied Beijing's Tiananmen Square in a massive pro-democracy protest. Many were killed in a brutal clampdown by the communist authorities. On Tuesday, Hong Kong authorities extended social-distancing measures until at least 4 June, throwing plans for mass gatherings to mark the occasion into doubt. Thousands of people gather annually for mass candlelit vigils in Hong Kong and Macau Many people were pictured basking in the hot weather at Bournemouth beach in Dorset on Wednesday There were plenty outside in the sunshine in Broadway Market, in Hackney, east London People in England are now allowed to play socially distanced sports outdoors People across the UK have been enjoying glorious sunny weather, with the country recording its hottest day of the year so far. Temperatures reached 27.8C (82F) near London's Heathrow Airport, and sunbathers across England enjoyed new-found freedom following the slight easing of virus lockdown restrictions. Cars from ""all over the country"" were reported in traffic gridlock in north Devon on Wednesday,police said. While Northern Ireland has also seen some modest changes to its lockdown, restrictions in Scotland and Wales regarding enjoying the outdoors have not been eased. People have been cautioned against using coronavirus antibody tests being sold by some retailers. NHS England's medical director Prof Stephen Powis said experts were ""evaluating"" antibody tests, which aim to show if someone has already had the virus. Such tests are not yet available through the NHS, but some are being sold commercially. ""I would caution against using any tests... without knowing quite how good those tests are,"" said Prof Powis.

Huron Valley Correctional Facility in Michigan, US, on 15 April. âItâs a nightmare in there,"" she told BBC OS. ""We canât go in or out. The

"England is the only UK nation to set a date for schools to start to return More than 35 councils in England have warned that not all of their primary schools will be ready to reopen on 1 June. Some of them have expressed opposition to opening at all amid safety concerns. The government says it will listen to the concerns of parents and teachers about the plans to reopen schools. At the daily No 10 briefing, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the move would only go ahead if ministers ""can be sure of children's safety"". He also said he wanted schools in England to return at the same time, after his cabinet colleague Justice Secretary Robert Buckland told BBC Breakfast there may not be a ""uniform approach"". Mr Dowden said: ""It is best, and the government has said this repeatedly, that we move as a whole nation, and that would include of course the whole of England in doing so."" But he suggested there could be different measures in ""micro-hotspots"" where there was an outbreak of new coronavirus cases. Earlier, teaching union NASUWT said it remained ""unconvinced"" reopening schools was ""appropriate or practicable"". Do I have to send my children back to school? Schools 'safe' to reopen, Michael Gove insists Coronavirus: How much do children spread it? Reopening schools 'will cause suffering and death' For most pupils, schools have been closed since 20 March. From 1 June, children in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 in England will be able to return to school if infection rates and the government's other tests at the time allow it. England isthe only UK nation to set a return date so far. Schools in Wales will not reopen on 1 June, while those in Scotland and Northern Ireland may not restart before the summer holidays. But on Tuesday, Calderdale Council, in West Yorkshire, followed Bury,Liverpooland Hartlepool in advising its schools against wider reopening. Other local authorities expressed concern: Conservative-led Solihull Council warned some school places may not be ready for the first week of June Manchester Council said its schools will have to ""work at their own pace"" to gradually increase numbers Birmingham City Council said it may not be possible for some schools to safely open to more pupils by 1 June Leeds City Council saidit would not expect all its schools to reopen to all pupils ""from day one"",external Stockport Council said its schools would not open until 10 June Slough Borough Council said schools would not welcome more pupils until 8 June at the earliest Brighton and Hove City Council said it had advised schools only to reopen whenrisk assessments indicated it is ""safe to do so"".,external A number of the 153 English local authorities have acknowledged safety concerns but have not urged all their schools to reject the proposed timeframe. Academies have the freedom to make their own decision, unlike the two thirds of primary schools supported by local authorities. The government's plan to reopen primary schools to some year groups was a key part of the strategy for getting the country to take the next steps out of lockdown. But it's run into fierce opposition. Persuading people that it's safe to begin thinking about the path back towards normality was always going to be a challenge. And Downing Street is stressing that 1 June was only put forward as the earliest possible date for any reopening of schools (and non-essential retail, set for the same day) - conditional on the five tests for controlling the virus being met. But the admission from cabinet minister Robert Buckland that the picture across the country might not be ""uniform"" - is a reminder that the government in Westminster is not ultimately in control of what happens in schools across the country next month. And it's problematic for ministers that a key date for adjustment to restrictions - albeit one that came with caveats - is now in question. There is already variation between the nations on when schools will return - now there's likely to be differences across England too. Emma Knights, the chief executive of the National Governance Association, which advises school governors, told the BBC it would be hard for governors to ignore the position of their local authorities. She said as councils might be legally judged the employers of school staff, governors would need a very strong reason to make a different decision. The decision to begin reopening schools came after the reproduction, or R number - the number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to, on average -came down across every part of the UK. But multiple research groups, including thoseat the University of Cambridge,external, show it varies across the country - it has come down most in London but is higher in the north-east of England. Metro mayors in the north-west of England have made an ""urgent""call for the release of regional Covid-19 reproduction rate figures, saying it would help residents making ""informed decisions about the risk and help decide whether they wish to take a more cautious approach to the relaxation of the lockdown rules"". Meanwhile, a survey of 29,000 members of the teachers' union NASUWT found just one in 20 thought it would be safe for more pupils to return next month. Patrick Roach, the union's general secretary, called for all the scientific evidence from the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to be made available to teachers and schools as soon as possible. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? Mother-of-three Amy Hughes says her eldest daughter is eligible to return to school on 1 June, but she will not send her back then. ""We're actually waiting to see if there's a second wave to decide whether to let our other daughter start school in September,"" she adds. She moved her family out of inner city Bristol last year when one of her daughters caught a virus that made her lungs collapse. Ms Hughes, who now lives in Lincolnshire with her children aged six, four and one, says the experience had made her ""hyper sensitive about viruses"". Lincolnshire GP Grace Hurdley, who is currently on maternity leave, says although school life will be ""different"", sending her five-year-old son back on 1 June is ""the best thing"" for him. While home schooling has not been a problem, she told BBC Radio 5 Live her son was ""really struggling"" spending so long at home. Ms Hurdley believes it would be ""better for him to play alongside his friends than to continue being isolated"". She is reassured by plans to split his usual class size of 30 into 15, so that he is in a ""bubble"" with some other children and his teacher, with their own meal and play times. He would also get used to washing his hands more regularly - a habit she says the family are ""very keen on at home"" in light of their new baby and the pandemic. Dr Peter English from the doctors' union, the British Medical Association,said in the Daily Telegraph,externalthat schools should reopen ""as soon as it is safe to do so"", but warned ""a zero-risk approach is not possible"". Last week,the BMA said Covid-19 infection rates were too high for England's schools to reopen. Attendance by primary school pupils will be voluntary and schools are reporting varied levels of interest from the parents. Secondary schools are likely to stay closed until September but the government hopes those facing exams next year - Years 10 and 12 - will get some time in school before the summer holidays. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""We want children back in schools as soon as possible, because being with their teachers and friends is so important for their education and their wellbeing. She insisted plans for the ""cautious"" return of some pupils from 1 June are ""based on the best scientific and medical advice"" and said No 10 had ""engaged closely"" with relevant groups including the unions, and will continue to do so.

"It is ""not obvious there will be an immediate bounceback"" for the UK economy, once lockdown restrictions are eased, the chancellor has warned. Rishi Sunak said he hoped for a swift recovery, but it could take time for the UK economy to get back to normal. ""It takes time for people to get back to the habits that they had, there are still restrictions in place,"" he said. His warning came as figures showed the number of people claiming unemployment benefit soared to 2.1 million in April. The jump of 856,500 claims in April reflected the impact of the first full month of lockdown, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The government has made some changes to who can claim work-related benefits during the pandemic, but this figure is one of a series that show the stress Covid-19 is putting on the jobs market. Speaking to the Lords Economic Affairs Committee, Mr Sunak said figures from around the world where countries were progressively easing and lifting restrictions, suggested a full recovery could take time. He said the ""question that occupies"" his mind was ""what degree of long-term scarring is there on the economy"" and that once restrictions begin to be lifted there will be the case of ""what do we return to"" and on that the ""jury's out"". But he admitted he felt ""all economic forecasters and economists would agree the longer the recession is, it is likely the degree of that scarring will be greater"". He said that even if the government can reopen retail in England as planned on the 1 June, there will still be restrictions on how people can shop. This will have an impact on how much they spend, and on how many people go out, Mr Sunak said. ""I think in all cases it will take a little bit of time for things to get back to normal, even once we've reopened currently closed sectors,"" Mr Sunak added. Seven charts on the coronavirus jobs market 'Losing my job pushed me to set up a business' When quizzed on unemployment by the committee, Mr Sunak said he did not have a precise estimate for what the numbers would be at the end of the year. However, he said: ""Obviously, the impact [of the coronavirus pandemic] will be severe."" Before the lockdown began, employment had hit a record high. In another indication of the bleak employment landscape, the number of job vacancies fell by nearly a quarter to 637,000 in the three months to April. Meanwhile, claims for universal credit - the benefit for working-age people in the UK - hita record monthly levelin the early weeks of lockdown. Unemployed HR worker Jon Ellis-Fleming, of Keighley in West Yorkshire, had been with an outsourcing company for more than four years when he was made redundant. He left the firm on 8 March, hoping to spend some time at home with his partner Julia Paterson and their eight-month-old daughter Daisy while looking for a new job. ""The week after I officially left the company, Covid hit,"" he told the BBC. That meant that several promising job offers just evaporated as firms put their recruitment plans on hold. Jon applied for universal credit and jobseeker's allowance. He is due to receive his first payment of Â£600 later this month, while his partner receives Â£650 a month on maternity leave. That leaves them with less than half of their former income - and with another mouth to feed as well. ""I've not been out of work in 10 years,"" he said. ""I've never had any intention of being out of work that long. ""I can't help but wonder, if I'd been with the company two weeks longer, would furloughing have been an option?"" The unemployment rate was estimated at 3.9%, slightly down on the previous quarter,the ONS said.,external The jobless figures only cover the first week of the lockdown and they are expected to worsen sharply in the coming months. Jagjit Chadha, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, told the BBC: ""We can reasonably expect unemployment to rise very quickly to something over 10% - something we haven't seen since the early 1990s."" Estimates based on returns for individual weeks suggest that the fall in the unemployment rate was mostly caused by the decrease in hours in the last week of March, with a much smaller decrease in the previous week, the ONS said. In the final week of March, the total number of hours worked was about 25% fewer than in other weeks within the quarter. The government's jobs schemes succeeded in keeping the headline jobs numbers high, and jobless data still quite low up until the end of March. But there is evidence of the pandemic crisis impact starting to hit in the latest ONS jobs market release. The number of job vacancies from February to April tumbled by 170,000 to 637,000 - a record quarterly fall. The claimant count jumped in April, while the average hours worked in a week fell sharply at the end of March. So the signs of a significant downturn in the normal jobs market are there, but as is the impact of the extraordinary government support package. Unemployment would have shot through the roof without this support. However, these numbers will get worse with next month's figures. The vacancy drop shows there are fewer jobs out there for those who do lose work. And there are real concerns as to what happens when the support starts to be phased away in August.

"The Labour government has announced a series of measures to get more people into jobs, arguing that it has inherited a country that ""isn't working"". Its plans, announced by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, include overhauling the health and disability benefits system and improving mental health support. About a quarter of the working age population - those aged 16 to 64 - do not currently have a job. That's about 11 million people. According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS),4.3% of people were unemployed in the period between July and September 2024,external, which is about 1.5 million people. While this figure has risen over the last two years, unemployment remains relatively low by historical standards. However, the unemployed represent only a small part of the nearly 11 million working-age people who don't have a paid job. About 9.3 million of them are not called ""unemployed"". That is because they are not actively looking for work, or available to start a job. Insteadpeople in this group are called ""economically inactive"",external. In fact, more of them say they want a job - 1.9 million people - than are officially unemployed - 1.5 million. That means there are far more people who say they are available to or want to work than there are vacancies - 0.8 million. And thenumber of vacancies,externalhas been falling consistently for the last two years. It varies according to age. ONS figures for 2023 show that most of the 2.7 million ""inactive"" under-25s were students. The majority of them did not want a job. You can see that in the graphic below. Click on the darker border surrounding any age group to see the spilt between men and women. Your device may not support this visualisation Things are different in other age groups. Among 25- to 49-year-olds, 1.1 million people did not work because of caring responsibilities, about a million of whom are women. Nearly one million people in this age group were not working because of illness - more evenly split between men and women. The main reasons that 3.5 million over-50s were out of the job market were illness and early retirement. Almost nobody who retired early said they wanted to return to work. Aroundhalf of people with disabilities,externaldid not have a paid job, a rate that is more than double the rest of the working-age population. Less than a quarter of those who were sick or caring said they wanted a job. Sick people leaving workforce at record highs Many people are not looking for work because they are studying, caring or have retired. Some people want to work but cannot, either becausechildcare is too expensiveor they are not well enough. As the chart below shows, caring responsibilities and ill-health are the most common reasons for inactivity given by those who would like a paid job. Chart on the reason inactive people wanting to work don't The number of people not working has a broader effect. A smaller workforce means the government raises lessincome tax and National Insurance, which it uses to pay for services like the NHS. It may also spend more on benefits. Since people on benefits generally have less money than those in work, it also means less spending on the high street. That in turn is bad for businesses, and can affect how many people they employ, which can mean there are fewer jobs for those who do want to work. During the Covid pandemic, all major countries saw their workforce shrink. But while many other leading economies have since recovered, the UK still has more people out of its workforce than it did in 2019. There is a debate about how much of this is down toproblems with how we work out how many people are inactive,external. Before Covid, the UK's ""inactivity rate"" was the second lowest inthe G7 club of leading economies, behind Japan. The increase in the inactive population since then, if accurate, would now place the UK behind the US, France and Italy. The independentOffice for Budget Responsibility,external- which assesses how well the UK economy is doing - has suggested that ill-health has consistently been a bigger factor in the UK than in other advanced economies. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hasset out a plan to get two million more people into work. The proposals include: overhauling the health and disability benefits system to better support people to get jobs and stay in work rebranding job centres as the National Jobs and Careers Service offering every 18 to 21-year-old in England an apprenticeship, training or education opportunities or help to find a job as part of a new ""Youth Guarantee"" an independent review of what UK employers are doing to promote health and inclusive workplaces providing more money for the North East, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire to stop people leaving work because of ill health expanding mental-health support and efforts to tackle obesity. The prime minister said the reforms would ""put an end to the culture of blaming and shaming people who for too long haven't been getting the support they need to get back to work"". But many details of what they will mean in practice have not been confirmed, and a review of sickness benefits will not begin until 2025. The proposals follow widespread criticism from businesses thatthe increase in National Insurance announced in the Budget, coupled withthe rise in the minimum wage, will make it harder for them to create new jobs. Companies warn this will undermine the government's goal of increasing the working population.

People banged pans in the street in protests against Spain's coronavirus measures Protestors in Spain have continued their nightly banging of pots and pans as the government extended the national state of emergency for the fifth time. Spaniards against the coronavirus restrictions register their dissatisfaction with the country's left-wing minority government every day at 21:00 local time. The state of emergency has been extended for a further two weeks. Shops have begun to open in most of the country apart from Barcelona and Madrid, but travel between provinces remains limited. Spain is one of the hardest-hit countries by coronavirus and had one of the strictest lockdowns, with children kept indoors for six weeks. Nearly 28,000 people have died from Covid-19. On Thursday,new rules about wearing face masks come into force. It will be compulsory for everyone to wear a mask indoors and outdoors where social distancing is not possible - the exemptions are children under six and people with health conditions, including asthma and anxiety. But children aged three to five are still encouraged to wear face coverings. Spain renewed its state of emergency on Wednesday for the fifth time With their studio closed to the public, Daryl Granger and his wife Karen found inspiration for their next project close to home - in their own backyard.

That's the case both in terms of creating plans and policies that give people enough reassurance to take tiny steps to start to get back to normal, only weeks after the peak of a terrible disease, and trying to do so without taking on too much political water, when the consensus that shaped the start of the crisis has already started to fray. And the ongoing tussle over England's return to schools is perhaps the first big test. Read more from Laura. Brazil currently has the third largest number of cases in the world Two controversial anti-malarial drugs have been approved for use in coronavirus patients by Brazil's health ministry. No conclusive evidence exists that the two drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, are effective in treating Covid-19. Patients will need to sign a waiver recognising the potential side effects. In March Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro claimed on social media that hydroxychloroquine was totally effective in treating the virus -Facebook and Twitter later deleted his postsfor spreading fake news. On Monday US President Donald Trump announced he had beentaking hydroxychloroquine as a preventative measure. But the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says the drug has ""not been shown to be safe and effective"". ""We need larger, high-quality randomised clinical trialsin order to better evaluate their effectiveness,"" says University of Oxford's Kome Gbinigie, author of a report on anti-malarial testing for Covid-19. There are risks of serious side effects from the drugs, affecting the eyes and the heart among other organs. Indian emergency workers in masks cleared fallen trees in Digha Coronavirus restrictions have been hampering emergency and
relief efforts in eastern India and Bangladesh where a super cyclone has made violent
landfall, killing at least 15 people as it lashed coastal communities with ferocious wind and rain. Cyclone Amphan uprooted trees and toppled homes in both
countries, including in the Indian city of Kolkata in West Bengal. Nearly 3m people were evacuated - most of them in Bangladesh - before the storm
hit. Covid-19 and social-distancing measures have made mass
evacuations more difficult for authorities, with shelters unable to be used to
full capacity. The storm is expected to have caused deadly storm surges
although its winds have now weakened. Read more. If you're just joining us, a very warm welcome to our continuing coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Here are the latest stories from the UK this evening:  Read the full evening briefing here. Police chiefs want fines in Wales to be the same as England Maximum fixed penalty notices in Wales for breaching lockdown will rise to Â£1,920, the Welsh Government has confirmed. First Minister Mark Drakeford has faced calls to raise the penalties to deter breaches. Initial fines will remain at Â£60, but will double for each subsequent offence up to the sixth occurrence. But Plaid Cymru police and crime commissioners say calls to match England's higher fines structure - starting at Â£100 - have been rejected. Individuals who do not pay the notice could be taken to court, with magistrates able to impose unlimited fines. Miners are among the key workers who have been allowed to carry on in South Africa At least40,000 people could die with coronavirus in South Africaby the end of the year, scientists have warned. The projections were made by a modelling consortium set up to help government planning over the outbreak and assume that tough restrictions will be eased from 1 June, as President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced. The curbs - which include a ban on alcohol and tobacco sales - have been credited with slowing the spread of the virus, with 17,200 cases and 312 deathsreported so far,,externalway less than the figures in Spain, which has a smaller population. While President Ramaphosa has said lockdown regulations would be eased from ""level 4"" to ""level 3"" from early June, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize has said that according to the World Health Organization, South Africa is not yet ready for level 3 because infections continue to rise every day. The opposition party is taking the government to court, arguing that the stringent regulations are unwarranted and the ban on alcohol and tobacco sales should be lifted. Bolivia's health minister is being investigated over the purchase of overpriced ventilators for Covid-19 patients. Marcelo Navajas and four other officials are being questioned by police about the purchase of some 170 ventilators from a Spanish firm. The health ministry allegedly paid around $27,000 (Â£22,000; â¬25,000) for each ventilator, when their real price was reportedly $10,000-$12,000. Mr Navajas earlier told leading Bolivian newspaper La Razon the purchase had been ""transparent"". The Latin American country has reported 4,481 cases of coronavirus and 189 deaths. Police in Macau - a special administrative region of China - have rejected a request to hold an annual Tiananmen Square massacre vigil, citing concerns over the coronavirus, local media report. It will the first time in 30 years that the vigil will not take place, according toMacau Business,external. The group that organises the vigil, the Democratic Development Union (DDU), said it would challenge the decision in court. Macau, a former Portuguese colony and a near neighbour of Hong Kong, has not had any new cases of Covid-19 for 41 days, reports say. Vigils are held annually in Macau and Hong Kong to commemorate the victims of Tiananmen Square.  The victims were students and workers who, in 1989, occupied Beijing's Tiananmen Square in a massive pro-democracy protest. Many were killed in a brutal clampdown by the communist authorities. On Tuesday, Hong Kong authorities extended social-distancing measures until at least 4 June, throwing plans for mass gatherings to mark the occasion into doubt. Thousands of people gather annually for mass candlelit vigils in Hong Kong and Macau Many people were pictured basking in the hot weather at Bournemouth beach in Dorset on Wednesday There were plenty outside in the sunshine in Broadway Market, in Hackney, east London People in England are now allowed to play socially distanced sports outdoors People across the UK have been enjoying glorious sunny weather, with the country recording its hottest day of the year so far. Temperatures reached 27.8C (82F) near London's Heathrow Airport, and sunbathers across England enjoyed new-found freedom following the slight easing of virus lockdown restrictions. Cars from ""all over the country"" were reported in traffic gridlock in north Devon on Wednesday,police said. While Northern Ireland has also seen some modest changes to its lockdown, restrictions in Scotland and Wales regarding enjoying the outdoors have not been eased. People have been cautioned against using coronavirus antibody tests being sold by some retailers. NHS England's medical director Prof Stephen Powis said experts were ""evaluating"" antibody tests, which aim to show if someone has already had the virus. Such tests are not yet available through the NHS, but some are being sold commercially. ""I would caution against using any tests... without knowing quite how good those tests are,"" said Prof Powis.

Rishi Sunak gave evidence to an online session of the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak says ""it will take time"" for people to resume their economic habits ""even once we have reopened"" and there will not therefore be an ""immediate bounce back"" for the economy. He tells a House of Lords committee: ""We're likely to face a severe recession the likes of which we have not seen and, of course, that will have an impact on unemployment."" Mr Sunak also warns that there could be permanent scarring to the economy, with output down on pre-lockdown levels for a prolonged period. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg suggests Mr Sunak's ""tone today is a lot less enthusiastic than early talk about a quick bounce back for the economy"".

Earlier, the former head of services for older people in Glasgowtold BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimethe impact of the pandemic on the sector was the single greatest failure of devolved government since its creation. But a government spokeswoman says ""firm action"" was taken from the outset to protect care home staff and residents and that initial guidance for care homes, setting out
the clinical and practical steps to be taken, was updated on 26 March and 15 May. ""Each iteration is a
reflection of our growing understanding of the virus and of the situation on
the ground,"" she says. The spokeswoman also highlights First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's announcement of ""enhanced outbreak investigations"" in care
homes on 1 May. ""We have taken a number of other steps, such as direct delivery
of personal protective equipment (PPE), a stepped increase in testing, with the
introduction from next week of testing for all care home staff, and emergency
legislation to ensure continuity of care in the event of a care home failing,"" it concludes.

The chairman of the SNP's sustainable growth commission suggests using low cost capital to invest across society, from boosting employment to supporting charities who support the most vulnerable. ""We can invest our way through to a better and more sustainable country,"" he says. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Young people, those with addictions and the homeless are in danger of again becoming ""an afterthought"" as governments look to alleviate the effects of the Covid-19 crisis, writer and hip hop artist Darren McGarvey warns. With unemployment rising because of the lockdown, the man whose stage name is Loki urges the UK and Scottish governments to intervene to ensure job opportunities for the young. But he tells BBC Radio Scotland: ""Politicians are more interested in investing in sections of the population where they are likely to get some kind of return on that, whether economically or politically. ""Landlords are worthy of support, renters aren't worthy of support. Self-employed people and entrepreneurs are worthy of support, people who are being laid off aren't worthy of support. As a demographic, young people are one of the most easily disposable groups. ""They are not that economically active, they are not classed as skilled, by definition they lack experience, they don't tend to own things, they don't have a lot of bargaining power in the wage market."" Holyrood LiveBBC Parliaments The Scottish Greens have secured ministers'  agreement to amend the emergency coronavirus legislation to ensure that companies that are based in tax havens aren't given government bail-outs. Constitutional Relations Secretary Mike Russell told Holyrood's Covid-19 committee that he would work  with Patrick Harvie to draft an amendment to the bill so firms that engage in tax avoidance or evasion are not eligible for public money during the coronavirus crisis.

Scotland has said it hopes to âhit the ground runningâ at its Glentress
site near Peebles in the Borders as soon as lockdown restrictions are lifted. Part of its plans
is a trail restructuring for a ârefreshâ at one of Scotlandâs most popular mountain
biking destinations. Regional manager
Sallie Bailey said FLS appreciated the closure of the trails was âfrustratingâ
for a lot of people. It is hoped
pre-construction work could start on the revamped trails in October with construction
next year. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland It took the Scottish government two months to react properly to the Covid-19 crisis in care homes, leading to unnecessary deaths from the virus, a report for the Common Weal think tank claims. ""I think it is a whole system failure, but we are not just talking here about unnecessary deaths but we are talking here about how people died,"" Nick Kempe, the former head of services for older people in Glasgow, tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""We know that people haven't necessarily been given the right prescriptions and we have policies about palliative care, about dying well - I don't think they have been implemented. ""But, as well as the deaths from Covid, we obviously have the deaths from other reasons in care homes where people haven't received appropriate medical treatment and we have the impact on the lives of those who are still living."" Mr Kempe says privatisation of the care home sector, the lack of planning for a pandemic despite warnings from the 2016 Cygnus  Exercise and the fact it took eight weeks for the Scottish government to provide ""very good"" guidance to care homes all contributed to the crisis. Scottish fruit farmer James Porter has said he needs to find hundreds of pickers UK Environment Secretary George Eustice says only ""around a third"" of migrant workers normally expected for the harvest are currently in the country.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The crisis in Scotland's care homes during the Covid-19 outbreak
is the single greatest failure of devolved government since its creation, the former head of services for older people in Glasgow
claims. Nick Kempe's report for the Common Weal think tank comes at a
time when just under half of the country's 3,200 deaths from the coronavirus
have been in care homes. ""The care sector has basically been run down for the last
20 years or so,"" he tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""That's not a common picture across Scotland - in
some places there are some good providers - but there are a lot of providers
who have just been in it for the money and what has happened is that staffing
standards, staff training on matters like infection control has been totally
run down. ""We now basically have an untrained workforce who were
sitting there at the time when Covid-19 broke totally unprepared for what was
about to come to them. As soon as Covid-19 broke, it was very clear that our
care homes were totally unprepared for the crisis and that this was a crisis
waiting to happen and it has happened.""

Vehicles could be temporarily banned from some Aberdeen streets to help allow for social distancing. The city council has submitted a set of proposals to the Scottish government for funding to roll out a series of measures. They include widening pavements, one-way walking routes, and temporary bike lanes. Traffic could be re-routed around the city centre to free up carriageway space for pedestrians. The council says the area - Union Street in particular - faces challenges because the pavements are not wide enough to accommodate social distancing. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The head of the organisation which represents care homes in England has strongly criticised the government's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Professor Martin Green, of Care England, said people who were most at risk of dying of Covid-19 should have been prioritised from the beginning. He told MPs there were still problems with testing and PPE in care homes. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the care sector had received unprecedented levels of support during the crisis. It comes as an industry body has said care homes in England were planning their response to the coronavirus pandemic""with their hands tied""because data about outbreaks in the sector were not published until the end of April. Meanwhile, the latest figures suggestmore than 11,600 peoplehave died from coronavirus in UK care homes since the start of the pandemic. But for the second week running, the review of death certificates by statisticians showed the number of new deaths in care homes had fallen. The overall UK death toll now stands at 35,341 after the Department of Health recorded another 545 deaths of people in the UK following a positive coronavirus test. How big is the epidemic in care homes? When did care homes go into lockdown? Data delay saw care homes âfighting losing battleâ Giving evidence to the Health and Social Care Committee, Prof Green said pandemic planning had been completely inadequate and the government had focused on the NHS while discharging infected patients into care homes. He told MPs that despite promises from ministers, there were still huge issues with testing, with results lost and staff waiting eight to 10 days to find out if they have coronavirus. Answering an urgent question in the House of Commons, Mr Hancock insisted people were sent to care homes when community transmission rates were low. However, a Public Health England survey of London care homes found that agency workers doing shifts in different homes were a source of transmission. The study, which was carried out over the Easter weekend, looked at tests of staff and residents and the results were passed to the Department of Health and Social Care before the end of the month. PHE said the results suggested there were ""high numbers of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic cases among staff and residents"" and that ""infection may be being imported into the homes by staff"". It added it was possible that the usual staff may be off work self-isolating and the infection was introduced by the ""bank staff"" sent in as cover. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Prof Green told MPs there would need to be a ""forensic examination"" in the future to prevent a crisis in care homes from happening again. ""We should have been focusing on care homes from the start of this pandemic,"" he said. ""What we saw at the start was a focus on the NHS which meant care homes often had their medical support from the NHS withdrawn. ""We also had the disruption of our supply chains for PPE [personal protective equipment]. ""We also saw people being discharged from hospital when we didn't have the testing regime up and running. ""So despite what's been said, there were cases of people who either didn't have a Covid-19 status, or who were symptomatic, who were discharged into care homes."" He added: ""Given that care homes are full of people with underlying health conditions, I think we should've looked at focusing on where the people at most risk were, rather than thinking about a particular organisation."" Prof Green said a lot of care homes had not had the right set-up for isolating patients coming from hospitals, while other countries used separate quarantine facilities for infected patients. And he said some test results for staff or residents in care homes had been lost, while others waited so long that it was unclear if they were still valid. He insisted that PPE across care homes was still inadequate and called for testing ""two or three times a week"" to get on top of the virus. However, he said there were indications of a downward trend in cases, telling MPs: ""I think we are probably at the top of the curve and hopefully heading downwards."" James Bullion from the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services in England also gave evidence, and said both the lack of PPE and testing still remain a problem. ""The care workforce is 1.6 million. We are nowhere near the level of testing that is required,"" he said. Mr Hancock has claimed ministers have done everything they can to protect care homes. He said a ""protective ring"" has been thrown around care homes, adding that nearly two-thirds of care homes had not seen outbreaks. In the Commons on Tuesday, shadow social care minister Liz Kendall accused government ministers of being ""too slow"" to tackle the spread of coronavirus in care homes. She asked Mr Hancock to explain why guidance saying care homes were very unlikely to be infected was not withdrawn until 12 March. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: 'We've been able to protect the majority of care homes' Mr Hancock said the guidance to care homes that was in place until 13 March ""was in place whilst community transmission was low and said it would be updated as soon as transmission went broader and that's exactly what we did"". In early March, the government's chief medical adviser Professor Chris Whitty warned MPs it was ""highly likely"" community transmission of coronavirus in the UK was already happening. On discharging hospital patients to care homes, Mr Hancock said it was ""important to remember that hospital can be a dangerous place for people"". He stood by the principle of discharging patients to care homes, saying it was ""appropriate"" and ""safer"" in many cases. ""What's important is that infection control procedures are in place in that care home, and those infection control procedures were put in place at the start of this crisis and have been strengthened.""
