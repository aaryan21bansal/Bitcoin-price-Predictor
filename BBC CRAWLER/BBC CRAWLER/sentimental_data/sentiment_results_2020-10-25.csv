"""It's a massive amount of pressure. I've sort of kept it to myself. My family don't know about this and I've often thought: 'Is that the right decision?' But I wouldn't want to put them through all this."" John is not his real name but he didn't want to be identified. After all, he has spent more than two years keeping his financial worries hidden from his wife. He is one of an estimated 50,000 people who have been hit by a controversial tax policy known as the loan charge. As a result, he now owes Â£180,000 to HMRC. The pressure of the last two years has been enormous. He told BBC Radio 4's File on 4: ""It's really tough. I can't tell you the last time I slept and it's difficult. It's just relentless, with no real end in sight."" This substantial tax bill stems from how John was paid when he worked as a contractor for a number of years. Taxpayers 'treated unfairly' by HMRC He used a company to manage his admin and also his tax affairs. It promised him he could take home 85% of his earnings and still be compliant with UK tax law. A number of different companies offered these tax schemes. Workers would be paid a small amount of salary as a standard, taxable income. Then they would receive a larger payment as a loan via an offshore trust. Only a very small amount of tax was paid on these loans and there was no expectation they would be repaid. The government has closed this loophole and used the loan charge to demand large sums in backdated taxes from the freelancers and contractors who used them. The policy effectively adds up third-party loans paid since 2010 and taxes them as income. This has meant substantial bills for many workers. ""There's a lot of people who just think I was a tax dodger and that's not the case,"" says John. ""It was more about the ease. If someone had said to me: 'You can take 90% [of earnings] but it's illegal,' would I have done it? Absolutely not. ""I've regretted it for the last two and a half years but I did nothing illegal and we've been made out to be criminals and we're not. We're just normal people earning a living."" A government spokesperson said: ""The loan charge was introduced to ensure those who used disguised remuneration schemes to pay themselves income through loans, often via offshore trusts, contributed their fair share of tax. ""It is right that we continue to tackle these type of schemes."" Now John is now considering bankruptcy and says that will be the moment he tells his wife. ""I guess at that point I've got a plan, I've got a way out, even though it'd be difficult. It's a bitter-sweet one, really. If I get the closure I need, it'll be a relief. ""It'll be a relief because I don't know how much longer I can keep doing what I'm doing and, you know, keep the fight up, I guess."" A number of MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith's constituents have been affected But while he's dealing with the ramifications of his tax bill he's angry that similar action isn't being taken against the firm that signed him up to the scheme. ""The only person getting hit with this is me, there's no liability whatsoever with these promoters. Everybody knows who they are, but it's the small people who are getting destroyed."" ""I think the government and HMRC go after the wrong target, because it's the easy target to go after,"" says MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who has a number of constituents who have been affected by the charge. ""But they're not really going after the promoters."" Mary Aiston, director of the counter avoidance directorate at HMRC, says that it has become harder for tax avoidance promoters to operate and around 20 have left the sector. Meanwhile, the government recently consulted on new laws to strengthen HMRC's ability to tackle promoters sooner, before taxpayers owe such huge sums in backdated tax. In the meantime, taxpayers should make sure they understand any tax or payroll systems they are signed up to. ""The main message is, if it sounds too good to be true, it almost certainly is,"" Ms Aiston says. ""Somebody telling you that part of your income can come as a loan and that you keep it forever but you won't have to pay any tax or pay any tax on it. That is too good to be true."" One additional frustration for John is that loan-based and other potentially risky tax avoidance schemes are still being marketed, meaning growing numbers of people are potentially at risk of a large tax bill in the future. ""It makes me so angry you know. They're out there, you can Google, it's so simple to find where these people are. I'd tell anybody, just please, please, please stay clear. It's just not worth it.""

"Some shops in Kuwait had stripped their shelves of French-made products by Sunday France has urged Middle Eastern countries to end calls for a boycott of its goods in protest at President Emmanuel Macron's defence of the right to show cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. The French foreign ministry said the ""baseless"" calls for a boycott were being ""pushed by a radical minority"". French products have been removed from some shops in Kuwait, Jordan and Qatar. Meanwhile, protests have been seen in Libya, Syria and the Gaza Strip. The backlash stems from comments made by Mr Macron after the gruesome murder of a French teacher who showed cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in class. The president said the teacher, Samuel Paty, ""was killed because Islamists want our future"", but France would ""not give up our cartoons"". Beheading of teacher deepens divisions in France French anger over Turkey's 'rude' Macron comments Depictions of the Prophet Muhammad are widely regarded as taboo in Islam, and are offensive to Muslims. But state secularism - or laÃ¯citÃ© - is central to France's national identity. Curbing freedom of expression to protect the feelings of one particular community, the state says, undermines unity. On Sunday, Mr Macron doubled down on his defence of French values in a tweet that read: ""We will not give in, ever."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Political leaders in Turkey and Pakistan have rounded on Mr Macron, accusing him of not respecting ""freedom of belief"" and marginalising the millions of Muslims in France. On Sunday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan suggested, for a second time, that Mr Macron should seek ""mental checks"" for his views on Islam. Similar comments promptedFrance to recall its ambassador to Turkey for consultationson Saturday. Some supermarket shelves had been stripped of French products in Jordan, Qatar and Kuwait by Sunday. French-made hair and beauty items, for example, were not on display. In Kuwait, a major retail union has ordered a boycott of French goods. The non-governmental Union of Consumer Co-operative Societies said it had issued the directive in response to ""repeated insults"" against the Prophet Muhammad. In a statement, the French foreign ministry acknowledged the moves, writing: ""These calls for boycott are baseless and should stop immediately, as well as all attacks against our country, which are being pushed by a radical minority."" Calls for a boycott on French products have been circulating online in Arab countries Online, calls for similar boycotts in other Arab countries, such as Saudi Arabia, have been circulating. A hashtag calling for the boycott of French supermarket chain Carrefour was the second-most trending topic in Saudi Arabia, the Arab world's largest economy. Meanwhile, small anti-French protests were held in Libya, Gaza and northern Syria, where Turkish-backed militias exert control. Mr Macron's robust defence of French secularism and criticism of radical Islam in the wake of Mr Paty's killing has angered some in the Muslim world. Turkey's Mr Erdogan asked in a speech: ""What's the problem of the individual called Macron with Islam and with the Muslims?"" MeanwhilePakistani leader Imran Khan accused the French leader of ""attacking Islam,external, clearly without having any understanding of it"". ""President Macron has attacked and hurt the sentiments of millions of Muslims in Europe & across the world,"" he tweeted. French Muslims fear state aims to control their faith Earlier this month, before the teacher's killing, Mr Macron had already announced plans for tougher laws to tackle what he called ""Islamist separatism"" in France. He said a minority of France's estimated six million Muslims were in danger of forming a ""counter-society"", describing Islam as a religion ""in crisis"". Cartoons caricaturing the prophet of Islam have a dark and intensely political legacy in France. This video can not be played Rallies have been held in Paris, Toulouse, Lyon and other French cities in support of Samuel Paty In 2015, 12 people were killed in an attack on the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, which had published the cartoons.

"Covid is also taking its toll of German Christmas markets Police in Berlin have broken up a 600-strong party as coronavirus restrictions continue to curb German festivities. Berlin police tweeted that the ""fetish party"" in the capital ""probably ended unsatisfactorily"" for the attendees. The venue was too small for the crowd to socially distance, they said. Like many countries in Europe, Germany is battling a rise in infections. Frankfurt has become the latest city to cancel its famed Christmas market. Germany has fared better than the other heavily populated nations in Europe but Sunday was the fourth day in a row that it registered more than 10,000 new cases. The total is now more than 430,000 since the pandemic began. More than 10,000 people have died with the virus in the country. Frankfurt has now joined Berlin, DÃ¼sseldorf and Cologne in cancelling or scaling back Christmas markets. Munich and Nuremberg still plan to go ahead. Germany has 2,500 of them normally, and Frankfurt usually attracts more than two million visitors. ""Our goal remains to avoid another lockdown,"" Frankfurt mayor Peter Feldmann said in a statement. Tickets for the open-air Berlin party in the Mitte district had to be bought in advance, with a maximum of 250 people allowed. But the event was shut when far more party-goers turned up, many of them not wearing masks. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Madrid is one of the worst hit regions in Spain and has been subject to some of the toughest restrictions Spain has declared a national state of emergency and imposed a night-time curfew in an effort to help control a new spike in Covid-19 infections. Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez said the curfew, which came into force on Sunday night, would be in place between the hours of 23:00 and 06:00 Under the measures, local authorities can also ban travel between regions. Mr SÃ¡nchez said he would ask parliament to extend the new rules, initially in force for 15 days, to six months. Spain was hit hard during the first wave of the pandemic earlier this year and at the time imposed a much more restrictive lockdown - one of the toughest in the world. Like many other European regions, however, it has been hit by a second wave of infections. In Italy, new restrictions were also announced on Sunday. The government said the steady rise in cases there was causing a huge strain on the country's health services. Meanwhile France has reported a record number of new daily infections. A total of 52,010 infections were reported on Sunday, up from just over 45,000 on Saturday. This video can not be played Europe's streets empty Mr SÃ¡nchez said different regions would have up to an hour of flexibility if they wanted to modify the duration of the overnight curfew. Restrictions on movement between districts would be determined by regional leaders and was likely to be dependent on work and medical needs, he added. The new measures announced include a limit on public and private gatherings of different households to a maximum of six people. ""The situation we are going through is extreme,"" Mr SÃ¡nchez said in a televised address on Sunday, adding: ""It is the most serious in the past half century."" Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? Covid symptoms - and how to protect yourself When will we have a Covid vaccine? More than half of Spain's 17 regions had been calling for tighter restrictions, and the latest measures will apply to all regions except the Canary Islands. The same level of emergency was introduced during the first wave of the pandemic in April. Spain has passed one million cases since it began and nearly 35,000 people have died. Italy is shutting cinemas, swimming pools, theatres and gyms from Monday. Bars, restaurants and cafes will have to stop table service by 18:00. But shops and the majority of businesses will remain operating. Italy's measures were agreed between Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and regional leaders. ""We think that we will suffer a bit this month but by gritting our teeth with these restrictions, we'll be able to breathe again in December,"" Mr Conte told a news conference on Sunday. The prime minister has said he does not want to repeat the national lockdown imposed during the first wave in March and April because of the economic damage caused. Under the new measures, the bulk of secondary school teaching will be conducted online instead of in the classroom. The Italian move comes amid demonstrations in Naples, and then Rome, against stricter coronavirus measures, including curfews announced last week. Sunday saw a new daily record of cases in Italy of more than 21,200. The number of deaths was 128. Demonstrations took place in Naples and, seen here, in Rome against Covid measures Covid case numbers, hospital admissions and deaths have been increasing across Europe. According to the latest data from the World Health Organization (WHO), Sunday was the third consecutive day to see a record high in reported infections - with 465,319 cases confirmed. Some of the latest developments: The UKrecorded 19,790 new cases on Sunday. The country's death toll remains the highest in Europe, rising by 151 to 44,896 Bulgaria'sPrime Minister Boiko Borisov confirmed that he had tested positive for Covid-19. He said he was experiencing mild symptoms and was self-isolating In theCzech Republic, where new lockdowns came into force this weekend, 12,472 new Covid cases were reported for Saturday - the country's highest daily tally for a weekend day Marking another record, new confirmed cases in theNetherlandsincreased by 10,203 over the latest 24-hour period. This is despite new measures - including the closure of bars and restaurants - imposed this month Total reported cases inRussiahave now surpassed 1.5 million - but the mayor of the worst-hit city, Moscow, said that while ""there is still growth... it is slower"" InGermany, where case numbers have risen sharply in recent weeks, the building belonging to the country's public health body - the Robert Koch Institute - has been vandalised.

"Danielle (right) and her sister ""I find it hard to remember ever having a cooked meal at home,"" says Danielle, who relied on free school meals as a child. ""I would eat spaghetti hoops cold out of the tin. ""We would have sliced white bread because it was 13p from [discount supermarket] Kwik Save, then put margarine on it and put it under the grill. ""Me and my sister thought we were going to open a cafÃ©."" Danielle, 39, is now a successful senior manager for a charity, living in London, but growing up she lived with food insecurity. She has told the BBC how, as a child, she often had to resort to shoplifting or ""bin-diving"" for essential food at weekends or during the school holidays - once, when she was as young as 10. ""Food poverty in Britain isn't really spoken about because of shame,"" she says. ""When the holidays hit, hunger doesn't go."" Is there really no money for free school meals? Leeds United matches players' Â£25K for free meals Restaurants rally for Rashford's free meal crusade Danielle is calling on the government to ""support young people"" as the row aboutthe decision not to extend free school mealsfor children in England into the half-term holiday continues. The government extended free school meals to eligible children during the Easter holidays earlier this year and, after a campaign by footballer Marcus Rashford, did the same for the summer holiday. Ministers say that providing help through councils is the best way to reach those that need it. ""I was brought up in a household where we didn't have food at home,"" Danielle recalls. Her mother was ill, and couldn't work. A single-parent household, Danielle says she and her two siblings were often left to ""fend for themselves"", in addition to caring for their mum. ""Some days it was hard for her to get out of bed. She really put in a lot of effort but she couldn't cope. I don't hold it against her because she tried,"" Danielle stresses. They would usually receive child benefits payments on a Monday. ""So we would often take a day off school and have lots of food then,"" says Danielle, ""but nothing afterwards."" Packets of jelly were common because they cost 20p and ""would go quite far"", or instant custard - ""things to fill you up"". At the weekend, meals would frequently consist of dry cereal and dry bread. ""I remember going to bed with hunger pains and coming home to an empty fridge,"" she says. ""You learn to shut off the signals from your brain that tell you you're hungry."" This habit stayed with her into adult life. ""I don't realise I'm hungry, and then it gets to 4pm and I realise I've been dissociating and suddenly have to eat. ""As a young adult I didn't know how to cook, so would just eat for survival. Something to take away the hunger."" Danielle could sometimes eat at friends' houses or at Sunday school as a child, but her main source of hot meals was school. She explains that because her mum was on benefits, that qualified her and her siblings for free school meals - which were limited to certain children. ""I have really strong memories of them,"" she says. ""Apple crumble and custard [her favourite pudding to this day], baked potatoes, roast dinners. ""I also have fond memories of sitting at the table with all of my friends."" But beyond that, she was forced to find other ways of sourcing food, when they had run out of essentials and she was ""starving"". This included ""bin-diving"" for surplus food behind supermarkets, paying 10p for scraps from the local fish and chip shops, and shoplifting. ""It wasn't frequent, but when we were desperate,"" she says. Danielle was caught shoplifting a jar of Marmite aged 10 - carefully selected from the shelves because it could ""last weeks"" by only spreading a small bit on each piece of bread. And, while on the earlier occasion she was only told not to return to the shop, at 14-years-old she had her fingerprints taken, was placed in a police cell and later cautioned over shoplifting. ""I think that was for stealing jelly."" Danielle says the incident came up on her record when she was applying for a job in later life, leaving her devastated. ""I feel like I'm quite a moral person. For it to tarnish your career when all you are trying to do is eat,"" she says. ""I'm not proud of it and I would never do it now, but it was survival."" As soon as Danielle was old enough to get various part-time jobs, she stopped shoplifting, and went on to get three ""A"" grade A-Levels and a First-class degree at university. But she says that she could have gone ""either way"". ""I did have a supportive education system and that enabled me to not continue down the wrong path,"" she says. ""Because of the support that we have in the UK it allows people to go from poverty into middle class and be able to earn a living. ""Unless we support young people, give them opportunities, like food and education, then that wouldn't be able to happen."" This video can not be played Marcus Rashford and his mother Melanie helped out at FareShare Greater Manchester Responding to the row over free school meals, Danielle argues that those who are making the decisions are doing so from ""a place of privilege"" without an understanding of ""what it's like to be a child and to be hungry"". She also stresses that there are ""all sorts"" of family dynamics that can lead to financial difficulty, including debt, mental health issues, and addiction. ""It can happen to anyone,"" she says. As Danielle hit her 30s, she developed a new relationship with food - teaching herself to cook from scratch and eventually batch cooking for the week. ""One of my friends set up a supper club and said I was their inspiration,"" she said. ""I just thought it's funny going from no food, to all my friends saying I was such an amazing cook.""

"Wales is under lockdown until 9 November A second Wales-wide lockdown in the new year is looking increasingly likely, according to a cabinet minister. Deputy Economy and Transport Minister, Lee Waters, said the current firebreak was unlikely to be the last in Wales - with England ""expected"" to follow. Previously the Welsh Government had only gone as far as saying it ""could not rule out"" another lockdown. Thecurrent national 17-day lockdownis due to be reviewed when it comes to an end on 9 November. Speaking on BBC Radio Wales'Sunday SupplementMr Waters said previous projections show pandemics have ""more than one peak"". He added: ""This is not the last lockdown we are likely to see. The projections we published in a worst case scenario show it's likely we are going to need another firebreak in January or February."" He added that Wales is now witnessing a second peak, with critical care admissions increasing by 57% this week alone, and that was why the Welsh Government has introduced this ""short, sharp"" intervention. Mr Waters said the UK was ""too late"" with the first lockdown Mr Waters said he expected England to follow Wales with a firebreak ""before too long"" while the Welsh Government was trying to be ""consistent and cautious"" in trying to flatten the curve of cases. ""We are doing our best to flatten the curve. We can't stop the curve, we can't stop the virus spreading. Our best hope is to wait for a vaccine to help us bring it under control."" Economists have warned the lockdown may cost the economy more than Â£500m and the Conservatives have accused ministers of having ""no exit plan"". This video can not be played Mixed views on the firebreak in Wales' first local lockdown area Plaid Cymru said it was vital the test and trace system was improved during this firebreak to break the cycle of ""devastating"" national lockdowns. ""It is concerning to hear talk of plans for future firebreaks at the start of this reset,"" said shadow health minister Rhun ap Iorwerth. ""If the Welsh Government puts effective measures in place over the next fortnight, a new strategy for the months ahead, it should be aiming to avoid having to return to these tight nationwide restrictions."" Lockdown bid to 'save lives not Christmas' How Wales reached a firebreak - in six charts Q&A: What can you do in Wales-wide lockdown? Meanwhile Mr Waters said the Welsh Government will sit down with supermarket companies on Monday to review how the first weekend of restrictions over the sale of 'non-essential' items. Pressure hasmounted on ministers to reverse the decisionwith more than 55,000 people signing the largest-ever Senedd petition to allow the sale of items, such as clothes and kitchen items, during lockdown. The Welsh Conservatives accused the Labour-led government of ""incompetence and mixed messaging"". Mr Waters said: ""We're not reviewing the requirements for supermarkets not to sell non-essential. We are going to review how it's working in practice, because clearly there are some bumps."" Demonstrators in Llandudno want lockdown restrictions lifted More than a hundred protesters gathered in Llandudno, Conwy, on Sunday, to demonstrate against the current lockdown.

The 25-year-oldwon Saturday's stage 20to share the lead with Jai Hindley before the final stage, the first such instance in the race's history. Ineos Grenadiers' Geoghegan Hart finished 39 seconds ahead of Hindley in Sunday's 15.7km time trial. ""Not in my wildest dreams did I imagine this would be possible when we started,"" said Geoghegan Hart. ""It's incredible, really incredible."" From Hackney to Milan - Britain's new cycling star Chris Froome is the only other British man to win the Giro, in 2018.

In only his fourth Grand Tour, Geoghegan Hart began the race as one of Geraint Thomas' domestiques and was in 126th place after the opening stage. Geoghegan Hart described his victory as ""bizarre"", adding: ""All of my career I've dreamed of trying to be top 10 - top five maybe - in a race of this stature, so this is something completely and utterly different to that and it's going to take a long time to sink in.""

"This video can not be played Brandon Lewis MP says Michel Barnier staying in London is ""hopefully a very good sign"" The chief negotiators for the UK and EU will continue post-Brexit trade talks in London until Wednesday. Michel Barnier arrived in the UK on Thursday to restart negotiations with Lord David Frost after they stalled last week - but he was due to return home on Sunday. EU sources told the BBC more talks are also planned in Brussels from Thursday. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said the extended talks were ""a very good sign"" a deal can be done. But he told the BBC's Andrew Marr: ""We have got to make sure it is a deal that works, not just for our partners in Europe... but one that works for the United Kingdom."" The two sides are thought to be working on legal texts, but Whitehall sources have indicated major sticking points - like fishing rights and competition rules - remain unresolved. The UK left the EU on 31 January but has been in a so-called transition period - continuing to follow EU rules and pay into the bloc - while the two sides hammer out a post-Brexit trade agreement. The transition period is due to end on 31 December, but if a deal is not reached, the UK will trade with the EU on World Trade Organisation rules. Some critics fear a no-deal scenario will cause problems for businesses, but the government insists the UK will prosper. Cost of everyday goods 'could rise' without deal Trade talks are back on - but what's changed? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? The EU had said a deal needed to be agreed by the end of October to allow time for it to be ratified by all the relevant parliaments, but UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson had warned of walking away from talks on 15 October. After strong words from both sides and calls for ""fundamental changes"" to the approach to negotiations, a return to the table was agreed and Mr Barnier has been holding talks with UK chief negotiator Lord David Frost since Thursday. On his arrival, Mr Barnier told reporters ""every day counts"" and the two sides shared a ""huge common responsibility"" in the talks. The discussions had been expected to wrap up later on Sunday with the possibility of consequent conversations, but EU sources have told the BBC they will now continue in London for three more days, before moving to Brussels. Mr Lewis said he was ""always an optimist"" around reaching a free trade agreement and he believed there was ""a good chance we can get a deal"". But he told Andrew Marr: ""The EU need to understand it is for them to move as well, so that we can get a deal that works for the UK as well - a proper free trade agreement that recognises us as the UK being a sovereign nation."" In line with a demand made by the UK, the talks resumed on all subjects based on proposed legal texts prepared by officials. They also said that ""nothing is agreed"" until progress has been reached in all areas - which has been a key demand of the EU. The two sides have been at odds over the issue of so-called ""state aid"" rules, which limit government help for industry in the name of ensuring fair economic competition. The UK has rejected an EU demand made earlier in the year for it to continue following the bloc's rules on such subsidies as part of a trade agreement. Lord Frost has suggested the UK could instead agree ""principles"" for how subsidies are spent - something welcomed by Mr Barnier on Wednesday. The two sides are also haggling over how much European fishing boats should be able to catch in British waters from next year. The EU has so far resisted UK demands for annual talks to decide stock limits, as well as a reduction in access for its vessels to British fishing grounds.

"The ban has provoked a fierce debate on what goods are ""essential"" Rules banning shops selling non-essential items during Wales' firebreak lockdown will not be reversed, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. On Sunday afternoon, Mr Drakeford said the implementation of the rules may be tweaked, but the ""basic decision"" behind the ban was the right one. Apetition,externalon the issue has exceeded 60,000 signatures, making it the largest ever submitted to the Senedd. The Welsh Conservatives earlier said the rules were ""mixed-messaging"". Supermarkets have been told they can only sell ""essential"" itemsand must close parts of their stores which sell products such as clothes, shoes, toys and bedding during Wales' 17-day ""firebreak"" lockdown. Policing 'challenging' because of Covid 'fatigue' Five more Covid deaths and 1,104 new cases Mark Drakeford has said he will review the lockdown restrictions on what supermarkets can sell, but the ban will not be reversed In an interview with BBC Wales, Mr Drakeford said: ""The position we face in Wales is really and deeply serious and for these two weeks we are asking people to stay at home and not to mix with other people as much as they can. ""If the rules are not sensible rules, if there are anomalies that are emerging, we will put them right, but the basic underlying public health emergency has not gone away. ""The basic decision is the right one. If the implementation of it, the interpretation of it needs to be revisited to make sure the rules are sensible, then we will do that. ""Non-essential goods are not allowed to be sold over the next two weeks. That's why there are hundreds of shops the length and breadth of Wales are closed. The underlying issue is not about shopping, it is about saving lives."" Mr Drakeford said a review into how the rules have been implemented would be held on Monday. This video can not be played Marr: Wales' health minister Vaughan Gething explains Wales supermarket rules Following comments earlier on Sunday by Welsh Government ministers Lee Waters and Jeremy Miles, Mr Drakeford said there is some ""discretion"" in the rules for shops to sell ""non-essential"" items in certain circumstances. ""I was told over the weekend of a child arriving with a foster carer with nothing at all. In those circumstances there is discretion for that very unusual set of circumstances to be addressed. ""If we need to make that clearer, if we need to talk to supermarkets about how that can be addressed, that's what we'll be doing tomorrow."" Welsh Government guidance,externalstates if there is doubt as to whether an item is a necessity, shops will be ""expected to use their best endeavours to consider what is available"". The head of the Welsh Retail Consortium, Sara Jones, said: ""To hear that discretion can be applied, of course that's good because it's showing that ministers are listening and that they're willing to look at ways to move forward. ""However, it does open a whole host of other issues. For example, by actually allowing that discretion to happen it means that actually the consumer is going to spend more time in store having to seek advice having to seek guidance. ""That's going to have the opposite effect of what the policy was intended for in the first place, which was to minimise the amount of time people should spend in store."" Sara Jones called for the rules to be reversed How do shoppers feel? One woman, whose daughter was admitted to hospital on Saturday, said she was unable to buy new clothes for her despite her pyjamas being ""soaked in blood"". Chelsea Jones, from Llwynypia, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said she was forced to make a 40-mile trip home to collect replacements. ""I was driving around crying in a panic trying to find somewhere that I am able to pick up some essentials for my child,"" she said. ""I have never felt so angry, frustrated or upset, ever. You just never know when a 'non essential item' will become 'essential' to you."" Another parent, Jodi Merry, who is also from Rhondda Cynon Taf, said the rules were an ""inconvenience"" and she was planning to buy clothes for her eight-year-old son after she gets paid next week. ""I know it's only two weeks but he doesn't have any winter pyjamas...Clothing, shoes and even bedding are definitely essentials."" The toy aisle at Tesco on Western Avenue in Cardiff has been blocked off - the sales ban also applies to clothing Shoppers in Cardiff had mixed opinions on the new rules. Jane Millersmith said: ""I think it's absolutely, totally ridiculous. The idea that somebody who's on benefits and is waiting for their money to come through, maybe until next Thursday or Wednesday, can't then buy a child a pair of school shoes is outrageous."" Meanwhile, Rebecca Edwards said: ""If I was desperate because I'd broken my kettle I'd think 'I'll go and buy a kettle quickly' I'm not going to browse the whole of the homeware department because I need a kettle, I'd just go and buy a kettle because that's what I'd come for."" However, Oliver Bowler said he thought the Welsh Government was taking a ""proportionate approach"". SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What will I be paid under the new scheme? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? Wales' firebreak lockdown is in place until 9 November. The Welsh Government added it had made a further Â£300m available to support businesses affected. Secretary of State for WalesSimon Hart urged,externalMr Drakeford to ""scrap the policy"" while Welsh Conservative leader Paul Davies called for the Senedd/Welsh Parliament to be recalled ""virtually"" to debate the matter. ""This is absolute madness by the Welsh Government, preventing people from buying the products which they want to buy,"" he said. How are the restrictions affecting you?

"""It's a massive amount of pressure. I've sort of kept it to myself. My family don't know about this and I've often thought: 'Is that the right decision?' But I wouldn't want to put them through all this."" John is not his real name but he didn't want to be identified. After all, he has spent more than two years keeping his financial worries hidden from his wife. He is one of an estimated 50,000 people who have been hit by a controversial tax policy known as the loan charge. As a result, he now owes Â£180,000 to HMRC. The pressure of the last two years has been enormous. He told BBC Radio 4's File on 4: ""It's really tough. I can't tell you the last time I slept and it's difficult. It's just relentless, with no real end in sight."" This substantial tax bill stems from how John was paid when he worked as a contractor for a number of years. Taxpayers 'treated unfairly' by HMRC He used a company to manage his admin and also his tax affairs. It promised him he could take home 85% of his earnings and still be compliant with UK tax law. A number of different companies offered these tax schemes. Workers would be paid a small amount of salary as a standard, taxable income. Then they would receive a larger payment as a loan via an offshore trust. Only a very small amount of tax was paid on these loans and there was no expectation they would be repaid. The government has closed this loophole and used the loan charge to demand large sums in backdated taxes from the freelancers and contractors who used them. The policy effectively adds up third-party loans paid since 2010 and taxes them as income. This has meant substantial bills for many workers. ""There's a lot of people who just think I was a tax dodger and that's not the case,"" says John. ""It was more about the ease. If someone had said to me: 'You can take 90% [of earnings] but it's illegal,' would I have done it? Absolutely not. ""I've regretted it for the last two and a half years but I did nothing illegal and we've been made out to be criminals and we're not. We're just normal people earning a living."" A government spokesperson said: ""The loan charge was introduced to ensure those who used disguised remuneration schemes to pay themselves income through loans, often via offshore trusts, contributed their fair share of tax. ""It is right that we continue to tackle these type of schemes."" Now John is now considering bankruptcy and says that will be the moment he tells his wife. ""I guess at that point I've got a plan, I've got a way out, even though it'd be difficult. It's a bitter-sweet one, really. If I get the closure I need, it'll be a relief. ""It'll be a relief because I don't know how much longer I can keep doing what I'm doing and, you know, keep the fight up, I guess."" A number of MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith's constituents have been affected But while he's dealing with the ramifications of his tax bill he's angry that similar action isn't being taken against the firm that signed him up to the scheme. ""The only person getting hit with this is me, there's no liability whatsoever with these promoters. Everybody knows who they are, but it's the small people who are getting destroyed."" ""I think the government and HMRC go after the wrong target, because it's the easy target to go after,"" says MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who has a number of constituents who have been affected by the charge. ""But they're not really going after the promoters."" Mary Aiston, director of the counter avoidance directorate at HMRC, says that it has become harder for tax avoidance promoters to operate and around 20 have left the sector. Meanwhile, the government recently consulted on new laws to strengthen HMRC's ability to tackle promoters sooner, before taxpayers owe such huge sums in backdated tax. In the meantime, taxpayers should make sure they understand any tax or payroll systems they are signed up to. ""The main message is, if it sounds too good to be true, it almost certainly is,"" Ms Aiston says. ""Somebody telling you that part of your income can come as a loan and that you keep it forever but you won't have to pay any tax or pay any tax on it. That is too good to be true."" One additional frustration for John is that loan-based and other potentially risky tax avoidance schemes are still being marketed, meaning growing numbers of people are potentially at risk of a large tax bill in the future.

"Some businesses will be giving out free food bags for children during half term The government's decision not to extend free school meals for children in England into the half-term holiday has been defended by a cabinet minister. Brandon Lewis praised footballer Marcus Rashford for his ""phenomenal"" campaign, but insisted providing help through councils was ""the right way to do it"". Pressure is mounting on the government to reverse its decision. Several Tory MPs oppose the move and Labour want a new vote, saying: ""It's not too late to do the right thing."" Meanwhile, more than 2,000 paediatricianshave signed a letter,externalsaying England should follow Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in providing vouchers for meals during the holidays. Is there really no money for free school meals? Leeds United matches players' Â£25K for free meals Restaurants rally for Rashford's free meal crusade The government extended free school meals to eligible children during the Easter holidays earlier this year and, after a campaign by Rashford, did the same for the summer holiday. But this time it has refused to do so. More than 800,000 people have signed Rashford's petition calling for provision to continue in the holidays, and the PM is facing calls to meet the 22-year-old striker to discuss the issue. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, Northern Ireland Secretary Mr Lewis said ""a couple of things"" had changed since free school meals were provided in the holidays during the first wave of the pandemic. He said the majority of schools are now open, and the government had increased Universal Credit as well as allocated Â£63m to local authorities. ""We've put the uplift into universal credit, just over Â£1000 a year. But also very specifically we've put Â£63m into local authorities to support and help people in hardship... and a number of local authorities are using it to do exactly that,"" he said. ""We've put that support in there and I think that's the right way to do it because the schools aren't open so it's making sure that the welfare system can put the support in, targeted where it's needed most."" Some councilshave promised to supplymeal vouchers for children facing hardship. ""You've got to find that main meal for the kids and I think people struggle."" One mother, whose children received free school meals during the holidays, said: ""We wouldn't have survived without it. ""You worry a lot about making sure they've got enough food for the holidays and that. You've got to find that main meal for the kids and I think people struggle."" In response to the woman's comments, Mr Lewis said: ""We do support free school meals. This is about what happens in the school holidays."" Mr Lewis was asked why the government does not just settle the row and pay the Â£20m a week to keep the scheme going, comparing it with the Â£522m spent onthe Eat Out to Help Out scheme. ""I would challenge the premise of that,"" said Mr Lewis, saying the Eat Out scheme helped an ""industry that employs some of the lowest paid people in the country"". Mr Lewis said he gave ""huge credit"" to Rashford for hiscampaign to get businesses including fish and chip shops, pubs, restaurants and cafesto give free food to eligible children. ""I congratulate them for that and thank them for that,"" he said. ""I've seen that in my own constituency, in Northern Ireland - but I think it's complementary to what we're doing as a government"". Last week, Conservative MPs voted against Labour's attempt to extend free school meals by 322 votes to 261, with five Tory MPs rebelling and voting for Labour's motion. One of those rebels, Robert Halfon, called on Mr Johnson to meet Rashford, telling the BBC: ""It may be that they don't agree with everything that Marcus Rashford is proposing, but it would give us a chance to come up with a long-term plan to combat child food hunger once and for all."" Other Tory MPs have also criticised the government's stance. Former Tory children's minister Tim Loughton - who did not support Labour's motion - said the government's stance was ""politically a mistake"", and he would vote for the scheme to be extended over the Christmas holiday if there was another vote. And Tobias Ellwood, a former defence minister, saidthe free school meals holiday scheme was ""well received"",externaland a ""simple and practical"" way of supporting families. Johnny Mercer, a defence minister,admitted on Twitter,externalthat the government had dealt with the issue ""poorly"". This video can not be played Marcus Rashford and his mother Melanie helped out at FareShare Greater Manchester Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the party will force a new Commons vote on the issue if the government does not change its position before the Christmas Commons recess. Tulip Siddiq, shadow minister for children, said she was sorry the issue had ""become a political football"" but some Conservative MPs ""are realising this is principles before party"" and she appealed for more to stand against the government. She told BBC Breakfast that, with some local councils agreeing to supply meal vouchers during the holidays, the issue had become ""a postcode lottery"" because not every council had ""stepped up"". Children of all ages living in households on income-related benefits may be eligible for free school meals. In England, about 1.3 million children claimed for free school meals in 2019 - about 15% of state-educated pupils. Analysis by the Food Foundation estimates a further 900,000 children in England may have sought free school meals since the start of the pandemic.

"Marcus Rashford's campaign over the summer forced the government to U-turn on free school meals Amid the talks over Manchester's request for an extra Â£30m a month for jobs support, or indeed the tens of millions for half-term free school meals in England, and the debate over a tougher lockdown, the government and its top supporters are citing the idea that there is no money left. Certainly, this morning's public finances showed the government borrowing in the first half of the financial year at a record high, the highest levels of government debt in 60 years and the deficit this year heading for its highest ever level outside of a world war. This is before the statisticians have accounted for likely losses from tens of billions of government-guaranteed lending to businesses. September's numbers alone saw a fivefold increase in borrowing, up from Â£7.7bn last September to Â£36.1bn, driven by more spending on the furlough scheme, health and self-employment, as well as far less VAT and income taxes received. UK borrowing surges as Covid support continues How much harm would a circuit-breaker do? The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) this afternoon also published a chart showing that of the Â£262bn that the Treasury has borrowed by issuing gilts, Â£246bn has been bought by the Bank of England. The central bank has indirectly created and lent most of the extra money required by the government. Overall, the government has not had to raise the funds from the private sector or abroad. So, no, we aren't really running out of cash. The best evidence for that is that the government will indeed be announcing more borrowed money for some of its schemes in the coming days and weeks. And there is ample evidence that market demand for government debt is still strong. For example, the European Union found huge demand this week for its new ""social bonds"" to help Spain and Italy fund pandemic jobs support. However, these Bank of England purchases do, in theory, have to be sold back into the market after the crisis. With a large stock of debt, the government's finances are now very sensitive to even relatively small rises in the rate at which it borrows. It seems unlikely right now, but is far from unthinkable over the next several years. The government had already planned to borrow more to invest in infrastructure as part of its ""levelling-up agenda"". Much higher levels of spending on health and pensions are already baked in to the spending cake as society ages. So getting the public finances in shape does matter, as a medium-term priority. Right now, though, it is difficult to argue that ""no money"" is the constraint on extending free school meals, or furlough support. Particularly not on a day when it was confirmed pensions will rise by two percentage points more than inflation, at a time when average earnings are negative. The cost of that triple lock policy, just as an example, is about Â£1.5bn in extra state pension costs in the coming year, according to Carl Emmerson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. These are political decisions to allocate money where the government feels an obligation to prioritise. How much harm would a circuit-breaker do?

"The two-week quarantine period for contacts of those who test positive for Covid-19 could be cut to 10 or seven days, amid criticism of Test and Trace. Writing in the Telegraph, Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin said a""vacuum of leadership in Test and Trace"",externalwas affecting compliance. Tests could be offered to people after a week of isolation, the paper said. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told the BBC the government would be ""led by the science"" on the issue. And Prof Sir Ian Diamond, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), added there was ""work going on"" to look at the length of self-isolation period and ""certainly it has been discussed at various times"". Research by King's College London,externalsuggested just 10.9% of those traced as contacts of someone with Covid-19 remained at home for the full quarantine period. Earlier this month, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was ""very hopeful"" ofreducing the amount of time people needed to spend in quarantineon arrival in the UK from abroad and this could be done by testing them a week later. Sir Bernard, chairman of the Commons liaison committee, said public consent and co-operation with England's system was ""breaking down"". He added there should be a ""visible and decisive"" change, with a senior military figure put in charge of the system. Baroness Dido Harding, currently at the helm, should be ""given a well-earned break"" so she and others could ""reflect on the lessons learned so far"", he wrote in the paper. ""There is a spaghetti of command and control at the top, which is incapable of coherent analysis, assessment, planning and delivery,"" he added. ""People lack faith that there is a coherent plan."" 'I spoke to one person in four months' Test and Trace needs to improve, PM concedes How does Covid-19 test-and-trace work? A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson said NHS Test and Trace had contacted more 1.1 million people and asked them to self-isolate. ""Dido Harding and her leadership team - drawn from the military, public and private sectors - have built the largest diagnostic industry the UK has ever seen,"" they said. ""It is the equivalent of building an operation the size of Tesco in a matter of months. We need to improve in areas and we are very much focused on that, but we should be talking it up not down."" Last month, it was announced that former Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupewould be taking over as directorof Covid-19 testing at England's NHS Test and Trace agency. More than 20,000 tracers were recruited by the service,but many have complained they were given little or nothing to do. Boris Johnson said on Thursdaythat NHS Test and Trace required improvements so results were provided quicker. The government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, also acknowledged a need for change. Figures for the week ending 14 October reveal that just 15.1% of those who were tested received their results within 24 hours - dropping from 32.8% in the previous week. The figures also showed a fall to 59.6% in the proportion of close contacts reached of people who tested positive. According to Sage, at least 80% of contacts would need to isolate for it to work properly. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has previously said up to 500,000 tests a day could be carried out by 31 October. Latest data showed 340,132 tests were processed on 22 October, with capacity at 361,573. Meanwhile, cabinet minister Mr Lewis told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that ""teams were looking"" at whether the self-isolation period cut be cut from 14 days but he added that ""any final decision on this will be led by the science and we're not in a position to make on a decision on that just yet"". Prof Diamond told the same programme that identifying ""the optimal times for self-isolation is critical"" because it was an ""incredibly important part of the way in which we will control this virus"".

SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? It comes as First Minister Mark Drakeford saidthe government would review the decision to prohibit supermarkets from selling non-essential itemssuch as clothes and microwaves during Wales' 17-day lockdown. Wales' health minister Vaughan Gething defended the ban, saying it was in place to ensure fairness to businesses that are closed during the 17-day lockdown and reduce the opportunities for people to ""go out and mix"". He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""We're reviewing with supermarkets the understanding and the clarity of the policy because there's been different application in different parts.""

"Listen to all the reaction on 5 Live's Chequered Flag podcast Lewis Hamilton passed Valtteri Bottas to take a commanding victory in the Portuguese Grand Prix and break Formula 1's all-time win record. Hamilton dropped to third in a manic first two laps that ended with McLaren's Carlos Sainz leading, but fought back to crush Bottas' hopes. After both Mercedes passed Sainz, Hamilton tracked Bottas before taking the lead on lap 20. From there, Hamilton dominated to take his 92nd career Grand Prix victory. Hamilton v Schumacher: The stats Chequered Flag podcast Hamilton received a standing ovation from the socially distanced crowd, before celebrating with team members and then a long embrace with father Anthony. Hamilton said he ""owed it all"" to his Mercedes team, adding: ""I could only ever have dreamed of being where I am today. ""I didn't have a magic ball when I chose to come to this team and partner with these great people, but here I am. ""Everything we do together - we are all rowing in the same direction and that's why we're doing what we're doing. ""And my dad's here and my step mum Linda, and Roscoe [Hamilton's dog]. It is going to take some time for it to fully sink in. I was still pushing flat out as I came across the line. I can't find the words at the moment."" Hamilton has won eight of the 12 races so far this season Portuguese Grand Prix full race results His victory, on a humiliating day for team-mate Bottas, gave Hamilton a 77-point advantage in the championship as he moves ever closer to a seventh world title, which would match Schumacher's other surviving record. Hamilton had to do it the hard way, cool temperatures and a sprinkling of rain at the start leaving his Mercedes grip-less on its medium tyres on the opening lap, on which he was passed by both Bottas and Sainz. Sainz, using his soft tyres to great advantage over the medium-shod Mercedes, produced a stellar opening lap from seventh on the grid and passed Bottas for the lead at Turn Five on the second lap. But once the Mercedes' tyres were up to temperature, they wasted no time in dispatching the McLaren and disappeared into a race of their own. Hamilton never let Bottas get much more than a couple of seconds ahead and then after 15 laps started to pour on the pace, setting fastest lap after fastest lap to close in on the Finn and then pass for the lead into Turn One. Dad and lad: Hamilton shared his record-breaking moment with his father, Anthony Once ahead, Hamilton left his team-mate behind, pulling out a lead of more than seven seconds in the next 10 laps, and continuing to inch further clear over the remainder of the race. Hamilton extended his lead even further after they made their pit stops, as he was able to get the hard tyres into their temperature window more effectively than his team-mate. The 35-year-old's only concern was cramp in the final 10 laps but it did not seem to affect him unduly, and he still crossed the line 25 seconds clear of his team-mate. It was a masterful performance, befitting the monumental nature of his achievement, supplanting Schumacher at the head of the all-time win lists, where the German had been for 19 years. It was an exciting race on a new track to F1, with overtaking and incident aplenty throughout the field. Red Bull's Max Verstappen was third, after slipping down to fifth on the opening lap, while Charles Leclerc was impressive in recovering fourth place in the Ferrari after he, too, struggled for grip in the opening laps on the medium tyres and dropped to eighth. Alpha Tauri's Pierre Gasly was outstanding in taking fifth, grabbing the place with a lovely move around the outside of Racing Point's Sergio Perez with two laps to go. Perez was voted Driver of the day by F1 fans for his seventh-placed finish at Portimao Perez, too, drove a strong race, recovering from a first-lap collision with Verstappen and spin, which required him to stop for fresh tyres and drop to last. Perez came under further pressure on the last lap, this time from Sainz, who passed him to take sixth place, with the Renaults of Esteban Ocon and Daniel Ricciardo and Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel all close behind. Kimi Raikkonen was just outside the points, after an outstanding first lap, rising from 16th on the grid to seventh place on his soft tyres, and then passing Leclerc's Ferrari for sixth, before the lack of pace of his Alfa told once the race settled down and he began to slip back. There were some outstanding drives in an diverting race, but there can be only one winner. Hamilton, best car admittedly, was in a league of his own, absolutely crushing Bottas with an awe-inspiring performance Next weekend, F1 moves on to Imola in Italy, an historic, challenging and popular track which holds a race for the first time since 2006. Hamilton:""I really owe it all to[Mercedes team] for their teamwork, continually innovating and pushing the barrier even higher every year. It's such a privilege working with them. It really is absolutely incredible."" Bottas:""The opening lap was pretty good, some cars behind with the soft tyre had the upper-hand but I was really pleased I could get the lead but after that, I just had no pace today. I don't understand why."" Verstappen: ""It was very low grip at the start. I tried to stay out of trouble but had a touch with Sergio Perez. He didn't give me enough space so he took himself out. I did my own race after that.""

"Smoke over Nagasaki in Japan after an atomic bomb falls on 9 August 1945 Campaigners have hailed a ""new chapter"" after a key step by the United Nations towards banning nuclear arms. Honduras has become the 50th country to ratify the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons so it will now come into force in 90 days time. But what it will actually achieve remains in doubt because the five recognised nuclear powers have not signed the accord. Supporters hope it will nevertheless have a deterrent effect. The accord was approved by 122 countries at the UN General Assembly in 2017 but needed to be ratified by at least 50 before being enacted. It declares that those countries that ratify it must ""never under any circumstances develop, test, produce, manufacture, otherwise acquire, possess or stockpile nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices"". Who can have nuclear weapons? Is nuclear control set to self-destruct? Q&A: New Start The treaty outlaws the use or threat to use nuclear arms, and bars signatories from allowing ""any stationing, installation or deployment of any nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices"" on  their territory. The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican) described the 50th ratification as heralding ""a new chapter for nuclear disarmament"". Beatrice Fihn, the head of Ican, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017, said: ""Decades of activism have achieved what many said was impossible: nuclear weapons are banned."" Beatrice Fihn of Ican hailed the deal The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, said: ""Today is a victory for humanity, and a promise of a safer future."" A statement from the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, described the move as ""a meaningful commitment towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons, which is the highest disarmament priority of the United Nations"". There has been no immediate reaction from the five main nuclear powers - the US, Russia, China, the UK and France. But the US and the UK made clear their opposition in 2017.

Mr Reynolds said his aunt believed there was no secret to a long life and ""enjoyed butter and cream and she scoffed at idea of dieting"". Mrs Hocquard spent her early life in Kenya where her father was a British colonial officer. She went to boarding school in Sussex and later worked as a cook at a hotel in Geneva.

"Smoke over Nagasaki in Japan after an atomic bomb falls on 9 August 1945 Campaigners have hailed a ""new chapter"" after a key step by the United Nations towards banning nuclear arms. Honduras has become the 50th country to ratify the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons so it will now come into force in 90 days time. But what it will actually achieve remains in doubt because the five recognised nuclear powers have not signed the accord. Supporters hope it will nevertheless have a deterrent effect. The accord was approved by 122 countries at the UN General Assembly in 2017 but needed to be ratified by at least 50 before being enacted. It declares that those countries that ratify it must ""never under any circumstances develop, test, produce, manufacture, otherwise acquire, possess or stockpile nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices"". Who can have nuclear weapons? Is nuclear control set to self-destruct? Q&A: New Start The treaty outlaws the use or threat to use nuclear arms, and bars signatories from allowing ""any stationing, installation or deployment of any nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices"" on  their territory. The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican) described the 50th ratification as heralding ""a new chapter for nuclear disarmament"". Beatrice Fihn, the head of Ican, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017, said: ""Decades of activism have achieved what many said was impossible: nuclear weapons are banned."" Beatrice Fihn of Ican hailed the deal The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, said: ""Today is a victory for humanity, and a promise of a safer future."" A statement from the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, described the move as ""a meaningful commitment towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons, which is the highest disarmament priority of the United Nations"". There has been no immediate reaction from the five main nuclear powers - the US, Russia, China, the UK and France. But the US and the UK made clear their opposition in 2017.

"Listen to all the reaction on 5 Live's Chequered Flag podcast Lewis Hamilton passed Valtteri Bottas to take a commanding victory in the Portuguese Grand Prix and break Formula 1's all-time win record. Hamilton dropped to third in a manic first two laps that ended with McLaren's Carlos Sainz leading, but fought back to crush Bottas' hopes. After both Mercedes passed Sainz, Hamilton tracked Bottas before taking the lead on lap 20. From there, Hamilton dominated to take his 92nd career Grand Prix victory. Hamilton v Schumacher: The stats Chequered Flag podcast Hamilton received a standing ovation from the socially distanced crowd, before celebrating with team members and then a long embrace with father Anthony. Hamilton said he ""owed it all"" to his Mercedes team, adding: ""I could only ever have dreamed of being where I am today. ""I didn't have a magic ball when I chose to come to this team and partner with these great people, but here I am. ""Everything we do together - we are all rowing in the same direction and that's why we're doing what we're doing. ""And my dad's here and my step mum Linda, and Roscoe [Hamilton's dog]. It is going to take some time for it to fully sink in. I was still pushing flat out as I came across the line. I can't find the words at the moment."" Hamilton has won eight of the 12 races so far this season Portuguese Grand Prix full race results His victory, on a humiliating day for team-mate Bottas, gave Hamilton a 77-point advantage in the championship as he moves ever closer to a seventh world title, which would match Schumacher's other surviving record. Hamilton had to do it the hard way, cool temperatures and a sprinkling of rain at the start leaving his Mercedes grip-less on its medium tyres on the opening lap, on which he was passed by both Bottas and Sainz. Sainz, using his soft tyres to great advantage over the medium-shod Mercedes, produced a stellar opening lap from seventh on the grid and passed Bottas for the lead at Turn Five on the second lap. But once the Mercedes' tyres were up to temperature, they wasted no time in dispatching the McLaren and disappeared into a race of their own. Hamilton never let Bottas get much more than a couple of seconds ahead and then after 15 laps started to pour on the pace, setting fastest lap after fastest lap to close in on the Finn and then pass for the lead into Turn One. Dad and lad: Hamilton shared his record-breaking moment with his father, Anthony Once ahead, Hamilton left his team-mate behind, pulling out a lead of more than seven seconds in the next 10 laps, and continuing to inch further clear over the remainder of the race. Hamilton extended his lead even further after they made their pit stops, as he was able to get the hard tyres into their temperature window more effectively than his team-mate. The 35-year-old's only concern was cramp in the final 10 laps but it did not seem to affect him unduly, and he still crossed the line 25 seconds clear of his team-mate. It was a masterful performance, befitting the monumental nature of his achievement, supplanting Schumacher at the head of the all-time win lists, where the German had been for 19 years. It was an exciting race on a new track to F1, with overtaking and incident aplenty throughout the field. Red Bull's Max Verstappen was third, after slipping down to fifth on the opening lap, while Charles Leclerc was impressive in recovering fourth place in the Ferrari after he, too, struggled for grip in the opening laps on the medium tyres and dropped to eighth. Alpha Tauri's Pierre Gasly was outstanding in taking fifth, grabbing the place with a lovely move around the outside of Racing Point's Sergio Perez with two laps to go. Perez was voted Driver of the day by F1 fans for his seventh-placed finish at Portimao Perez, too, drove a strong race, recovering from a first-lap collision with Verstappen and spin, which required him to stop for fresh tyres and drop to last. Perez came under further pressure on the last lap, this time from Sainz, who passed him to take sixth place, with the Renaults of Esteban Ocon and Daniel Ricciardo and Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel all close behind. Kimi Raikkonen was just outside the points, after an outstanding first lap, rising from 16th on the grid to seventh place on his soft tyres, and then passing Leclerc's Ferrari for sixth, before the lack of pace of his Alfa told once the race settled down and he began to slip back. There were some outstanding drives in an diverting race, but there can be only one winner. Hamilton, best car admittedly, was in a league of his own, absolutely crushing Bottas with an awe-inspiring performance Next weekend, F1 moves on to Imola in Italy, an historic, challenging and popular track which holds a race for the first time since 2006. Hamilton:""I really owe it all to[Mercedes team] for their teamwork, continually innovating and pushing the barrier even higher every year. It's such a privilege working with them. It really is absolutely incredible."" Bottas:""The opening lap was pretty good, some cars behind with the soft tyre had the upper-hand but I was really pleased I could get the lead but after that, I just had no pace today. I don't understand why."" Verstappen: ""It was very low grip at the start. I tried to stay out of trouble but had a touch with Sergio Perez. He didn't give me enough space so he took himself out. I did my own race after that.""

"Can we trust the silver bullet of technology to fix climate change? The prime minister seems to think so. In a speech due soon, he is expected to pledge his faith in offshore wind power, solar, carbon capture, hydrogen, clean cars, and zero-emission aviation. Clean technologies are clearly a huge part of any solution. But the PM is being accused of techno-optimism bias, because he does not mention other key factors in reducing emissions. In fact, experts say, tackling climate change will need action right across society and the economy - with a host of new incentives, laws, rules, bans, appliance standards, taxes and institutional innovations. Wind farms could power every home by 2030 - PM Covid crisis does little to slow climate change The week Boris Johnson turned green, or did he? They also warn that citizensâ behaviour must shift, with people probably driving and flying less, and eating less meat and dairy produce. In other words, when it comes to cutting carbon emissions, thereâs no silver bullet â itâs more like silver buckshot. But Boris Johnson still seems to have a bandolero stuffed with technologies resembling silver bullets. Letâs see whether theyâll go with a bang. Take cars. The prime minister is due to accelerate the transition towards battery- and hydrogen-powered vehicles. But Professor Jillian Anable from Leeds University warns that even electric cars pose ""their own problems that politicians seem reluctant to acknowledge."" âProducing electricity and hydrogen requires huge numbers of wind farms or the like, and the cars themselves need resource-hungry tyres, and batteries. Increase car taxes to help climate, advisers say ""They also need roads and parking spaces that could otherwise be used for gardens and trees that soak up carbon dioxide,"" she said. âThe harsh reality is that we have to find ways to limit the number of cars and the amount that we drive themâ There iswidespread agreement that hydrogen will play a rolein reducing climate change â but how much, and in what industrial sectors, is another matter. A key question is whether itâs sourced from natural gas â which is expensive and, depending on the process used, can yield troublesome carbon dioxide as a by-product - or by using surplus wind energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. The latter process does the job cleanly but at still greater cost. Jess Ralston, from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit think tank, said: âHydrogen can power cars, but electricity seems to have won that technology race.  It could heat homes, but electric heat pumps are emerging as a better bet. âHydrogen could be really useful, though, in industries such as steelmaking and in heavy transport â including buses that weâre already seeing. But itâs no silver bullet.â On aviation, the prime minister has launched his ambition to devise clean planes. He calls the projectâjet zeroâ,external. Industry figures appreciate his boosterish support, but critics warn ""jet zero"" mustnât divert attention from the short-term need for rules and taxes to hold down aviation emissions after Covid. British Airways owner cuts flight numbers again Almost 900 airport job cuts blamed on Covid-19 Cait Hewitt from the Aviation Environment Federation told us: âNo zero-carbon technology options are currently available for commercial aviation. She explains: ""Planes use masses of energy. Batteries arenât powerful enough except for tiny planes, and we can only produce biofuels sustainably in small quantities. âWe need a major rollout of radical new technologies, and we need the capacity to remove remaining aircraft emissions from the atmosphere. But she says that âgiven how far we are from delivering these things, weâll also probably need to fly less.â UK governments have agonised for decades about nuclear energy, but Boris Johnson recently gave it the nod. That means heâs likely to either agree a financial package fora new station at Sizewellor for small modular reactors, or both. The existing nuclear power plant at Sizewell could be expanded. But nuclear is still a divisive issue. While it ""could definitely help to reduce emissions,"" said Professor Jim Watson, from UCL, ""itâs very expensive."" âTo play a major role, the cost of new nuclear plants will really need to fall, especially when the costs of other technologies like wind and solar have dropped so far. âAnd nuclear developers will need to show that they can build their plants more quickly because we needallelectricity to be low carbon within the next 10 years.â He agreed thatmini reactors might bring down costsâ but said it was far too soon to be certain. The prime minister has professed himself âan evangelist"" for the technology that captures carbon dioxide as it is emitted from factories and power stations and either stores it in underground rocks or uses it for new chemicals. Two decades ago it was touted as a climate saviour, but it's very expensive and has never taken off. The main climate authority, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), says the technology must be used to capture the emissions from trees being burned for energy. CO2 plant 'worth 22,000 cars off the road' Turning carbon dioxide into cash This way, the plants suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and the emissions are buried - helping to turn climate change into reverse. It's known as Bio Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). But the IPCC's Professor Jim Skea says there are ""potential problems."" He explained: ""If the trees are grown on land that would otherwise be used for producing food then there are problems with food security. And if we plant acres and acres of land with the same type of tree there are implications for wildlife.â So much for silver bullets. But what about the silver buckshot I mentioned earlier? Well, a long list of policies requires government attention, including: standards for new homes;green recovery; food production;planning rules; peat; heat and buildings; meat eating; infrastructure statement; road building;carbon dioxide in soil; medium-term emissions targets; tree planting;energy storage; industrial strategy;appliance standards;and the comprehensive spending review.

"Madrid is one of the worst hit regions in Spain and has been subject to some of the toughest restrictions Spain has declared a national state of emergency and imposed a night-time curfew in an effort to help control a new spike in Covid-19 infections. Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez said the curfew, which came into force on Sunday night, would be in place between the hours of 23:00 and 06:00 Under the measures, local authorities can also ban travel between regions. Mr SÃ¡nchez said he would ask parliament to extend the new rules, initially in force for 15 days, to six months. Spain was hit hard during the first wave of the pandemic earlier this year and at the time imposed a much more restrictive lockdown - one of the toughest in the world. Like many other European regions, however, it has been hit by a second wave of infections. In Italy, new restrictions were also announced on Sunday. The government said the steady rise in cases there was causing a huge strain on the country's health services. Meanwhile France has reported a record number of new daily infections. A total of 52,010 infections were reported on Sunday, up from just over 45,000 on Saturday. This video can not be played Europe's streets empty Mr SÃ¡nchez said different regions would have up to an hour of flexibility if they wanted to modify the duration of the overnight curfew. Restrictions on movement between districts would be determined by regional leaders and was likely to be dependent on work and medical needs, he added. The new measures announced include a limit on public and private gatherings of different households to a maximum of six people. ""The situation we are going through is extreme,"" Mr SÃ¡nchez said in a televised address on Sunday, adding: ""It is the most serious in the past half century."" Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? Covid symptoms - and how to protect yourself When will we have a Covid vaccine? More than half of Spain's 17 regions had been calling for tighter restrictions, and the latest measures will apply to all regions except the Canary Islands. The same level of emergency was introduced during the first wave of the pandemic in April. Spain has passed one million cases since it began and nearly 35,000 people have died. Italy is shutting cinemas, swimming pools, theatres and gyms from Monday. Bars, restaurants and cafes will have to stop table service by 18:00. But shops and the majority of businesses will remain operating. Italy's measures were agreed between Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and regional leaders. ""We think that we will suffer a bit this month but by gritting our teeth with these restrictions, we'll be able to breathe again in December,"" Mr Conte told a news conference on Sunday. The prime minister has said he does not want to repeat the national lockdown imposed during the first wave in March and April because of the economic damage caused. Under the new measures, the bulk of secondary school teaching will be conducted online instead of in the classroom. The Italian move comes amid demonstrations in Naples, and then Rome, against stricter coronavirus measures, including curfews announced last week. Sunday saw a new daily record of cases in Italy of more than 21,200. The number of deaths was 128. Demonstrations took place in Naples and, seen here, in Rome against Covid measures Covid case numbers, hospital admissions and deaths have been increasing across Europe. According to the latest data from the World Health Organization (WHO), Sunday was the third consecutive day to see a record high in reported infections - with 465,319 cases confirmed. Some of the latest developments: The UKrecorded 19,790 new cases on Sunday. The country's death toll remains the highest in Europe, rising by 151 to 44,896 Bulgaria'sPrime Minister Boiko Borisov confirmed that he had tested positive for Covid-19. He said he was experiencing mild symptoms and was self-isolating In theCzech Republic, where new lockdowns came into force this weekend, 12,472 new Covid cases were reported for Saturday - the country's highest daily tally for a weekend day Marking another record, new confirmed cases in theNetherlandsincreased by 10,203 over the latest 24-hour period. This is despite new measures - including the closure of bars and restaurants - imposed this month Total reported cases inRussiahave now surpassed 1.5 million - but the mayor of the worst-hit city, Moscow, said that while ""there is still growth... it is slower"" InGermany, where case numbers have risen sharply in recent weeks, the building belonging to the country's public health body - the Robert Koch Institute - has been vandalised.

"A no-deal Brexit could see import costs for some everyday items rise by almost a third, making them ""much more expensive"", a business group has said. The cost of moving goods could also rise due to tariffs, and inflation could be driven up, Logistics UK added. Ina letter to the Sunday Times,external, David Wells, the group's chief executive, urged the PM to work towards a deal. A government spokesperson said a negotiated outcome by 31 December ""remains our preference"". Ministershave warned firms to ""get ready"" for changeat the end of the transition period. What does 'no-deal' Australia-style Brexit mean? Britain and Japan sign post-Brexit trade deal Trade talks continue as negotiators meet in London In the letter, Mr Wells said everyday household items imported will get more expensive under World Trade Organisation tariffs - some by 30% or more. ""This will make the household shopping basket much more expensive, particularly in the early part of 2021 when we rely on imports for much of our fresh food,"" he added. The head of Logistics UK, previously known as the Freight Transport Association, and which represents hauliers, warned that restrictions to the number of lorry access permits available to enter the EU could put businesses across the country at risk. ""The permit quota available to UK operators will fall short by a factor of four, putting businesses at risk right across the country,"" he said. ""We are urging government to keep pressing for a deal with Brussels, to protect not only our industry but the economy as a whole."" Negotiations have resumedfollowing a week-long standoff, with the UK side agreeing to continue with talks after EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said ""compromises on both sides"" were needed. At a summit in Brussels earlier this month, EU leaderscalled on the UK to ""make the necessary moves"" towards a deal. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has acknowledged that leaving the EU without a trade deal would cause ""some turbulence"". But Mr Wells said that the potential impact on logistics businesses would be ""more than 'turbulence'"". Responding to the letter, a government spokesperson said: ""The prime minister has been clear that a negotiated outcome at the end of the transition period remains our preference."" There will be an ""intensification of negotiations"", with talks taking place daily, the spokesperson added. ""At the end of the year we will be outside the single market and the customs union and intensive planning is underway to help ensure that businesses are ready to seize the opportunities that it will bring.""

"Some businesses will be giving out free food bags for children during half term The government's decision not to extend free school meals for children in England into the half-term holiday has been defended by a cabinet minister. Brandon Lewis praised footballer Marcus Rashford for his ""phenomenal"" campaign, but insisted providing help through councils was ""the right way to do it"". Pressure is mounting on the government to reverse its decision. Several Tory MPs oppose the move and Labour want a new vote, saying: ""It's not too late to do the right thing."" Meanwhile, more than 2,000 paediatricianshave signed a letter,externalsaying England should follow Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in providing vouchers for meals during the holidays. Is there really no money for free school meals? Leeds United matches players' Â£25K for free meals Restaurants rally for Rashford's free meal crusade The government extended free school meals to eligible children during the Easter holidays earlier this year and, after a campaign by Rashford, did the same for the summer holiday. But this time it has refused to do so. More than 800,000 people have signed Rashford's petition calling for provision to continue in the holidays, and the PM is facing calls to meet the 22-year-old striker to discuss the issue. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, Northern Ireland Secretary Mr Lewis said ""a couple of things"" had changed since free school meals were provided in the holidays during the first wave of the pandemic. He said the majority of schools are now open, and the government had increased Universal Credit as well as allocated Â£63m to local authorities. ""We've put the uplift into universal credit, just over Â£1000 a year. But also very specifically we've put Â£63m into local authorities to support and help people in hardship... and a number of local authorities are using it to do exactly that,"" he said. ""We've put that support in there and I think that's the right way to do it because the schools aren't open so it's making sure that the welfare system can put the support in, targeted where it's needed most."" Some councilshave promised to supplymeal vouchers for children facing hardship. ""You've got to find that main meal for the kids and I think people struggle."" One mother, whose children received free school meals during the holidays, said: ""We wouldn't have survived without it. ""You worry a lot about making sure they've got enough food for the holidays and that. You've got to find that main meal for the kids and I think people struggle."" In response to the woman's comments, Mr Lewis said: ""We do support free school meals. This is about what happens in the school holidays."" Mr Lewis was asked why the government does not just settle the row and pay the Â£20m a week to keep the scheme going, comparing it with the Â£522m spent onthe Eat Out to Help Out scheme. ""I would challenge the premise of that,"" said Mr Lewis, saying the Eat Out scheme helped an ""industry that employs some of the lowest paid people in the country"". Mr Lewis said he gave ""huge credit"" to Rashford for hiscampaign to get businesses including fish and chip shops, pubs, restaurants and cafesto give free food to eligible children. ""I congratulate them for that and thank them for that,"" he said. ""I've seen that in my own constituency, in Northern Ireland - but I think it's complementary to what we're doing as a government"". Last week, Conservative MPs voted against Labour's attempt to extend free school meals by 322 votes to 261, with five Tory MPs rebelling and voting for Labour's motion. One of those rebels, Robert Halfon, called on Mr Johnson to meet Rashford, telling the BBC: ""It may be that they don't agree with everything that Marcus Rashford is proposing, but it would give us a chance to come up with a long-term plan to combat child food hunger once and for all."" Other Tory MPs have also criticised the government's stance. Former Tory children's minister Tim Loughton - who did not support Labour's motion - said the government's stance was ""politically a mistake"", and he would vote for the scheme to be extended over the Christmas holiday if there was another vote. And Tobias Ellwood, a former defence minister, saidthe free school meals holiday scheme was ""well received"",externaland a ""simple and practical"" way of supporting families. Johnny Mercer, a defence minister,admitted on Twitter,externalthat the government had dealt with the issue ""poorly"". This video can not be played Marcus Rashford and his mother Melanie helped out at FareShare Greater Manchester Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the party will force a new Commons vote on the issue if the government does not change its position before the Christmas Commons recess. Tulip Siddiq, shadow minister for children, said she was sorry the issue had ""become a political football"" but some Conservative MPs ""are realising this is principles before party"" and she appealed for more to stand against the government. She told BBC Breakfast that, with some local councils agreeing to supply meal vouchers during the holidays, the issue had become ""a postcode lottery"" because not every council had ""stepped up"". Children of all ages living in households on income-related benefits may be eligible for free school meals. In England, about 1.3 million children claimed for free school meals in 2019 - about 15% of state-educated pupils. Analysis by the Food Foundation estimates a further 900,000 children in England may have sought free school meals since the start of the pandemic.

"""I'm pretty ashamed to say to people this is what I'm doing, because the whole point of me setting out to do this was to make a turnaround, to make a contribution."" Alex Lee, a former BBC journalist who retrained as a healthcare professional, is one of thousands who signed up to work for England's coronavirus test-and-trace system. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own systems. Alex was hired as a clinical contact caseworker to call people who had tested positive to tell them to self-isolate and obtain details of their close contacts. During the four months she was working for the service, she spent most of her time in her front room, doing very little, clicking a button labelled ""start tracing"". In the end, she spoke to just one person who had tested positive for the virus. Alex's experience is not unique. Tobin made no calls during his time as a tracer Tobin Stonelake was also hired by NHS Test and Trace. His job was to call the contacts of positive cases. He says he made no successful contact tracing calls for the 10 weeks he was working for the service. An army of more than 20,000 tracers was recruited by England's test-and-trace service. But from the beginning, there were complaints that some had little or nothing to do. An unofficial Facebook support group, which later shut down, featured similar complaints from other clinical contact caseworkers. Alex, who kept a video diary of her time with NHS Test and Trace, recorded herself looking at the group in June and reading out comments including: ""Haven't had a case in days."" Others wrote: ""Something tells me the system isn't working properly"", and ""surely there have been positive results for the country"", and another said: ""there must be... the mind boggles."" During the time she worked for NHS Test and Trace, Alex also encountered system errors which prevented her from logging in, booking shifts, reviewing her training and following up cases. She regularly called team leaders and was told that the issues were widespread and affecting other tracers. Those technical problems have continued into September. Panorama spoke to 19 coronavirus tracers who expressed concerns about a similar lack of work, or technical problems. However, these are not the only criticisms levelled at the system. NHS Test and Trace is the government's flagship programme for fighting coronavirus as we go into the autumn. But it has come under fire for how long it takes to reach positive cases and tell their close contacts to isolate. Latest figures show that just over one in five people who have tested positive for coronavirus are not being reached by the system. Test turnaround times getting longer in England Coronavirus testing: What's going wrong? Coronavirus: How to get a Covid test Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers - which represents all NHS Trusts in England - said people having too little to do over the summer was acceptable, as long as the system could cope with a rise in cases. ""It wouldn't seem to me to be a massive error or failure to create a test-and-trace system in which you've got more people than you need, particularly in the summer months when we know the transmission rate may be lower. ""What you do need to be ready for is when transmission rates increase, which they might do in winter."" NHS Providers has come up with a list of ""key needs"" to ensure the test-and-trace service works effectively over the coming months, including: A better balance between the national and local test-and-trace systems Improved end-to-end contact tracing - from the amount of positive cases being transferred to the system, through to the percentage of contacts reached who actually self-isolate Tailored support for different cultures and communities Improved data flows, so the NHS and public health teams get the data they need Better communication to improve public confidence in the system The NHS Test and Trace system in Englandcut 6,000 staff at the end of August. There are plans for some tracers to work alongside local public health teams to reach more infected people, and their contacts, in communities. ""Those contacts need to be rung up quickly and they need to be persuaded to self-isolate quickly,"" said Mr Hopson. ""And, to be frank, if you've not really done that within 24 to 48 hours - I wouldn't say it's useless, but certainly you're reducing the effectiveness. ""Every step of the way, we're probably losing too many people. It potentially has an impact in terms of how many people are infected. And ultimately, if we don't get it right, it means potentially more people dying."" Joe Saxton, a father of three living in Cumbria, was contacted by NHS Test and Trace in late August - but only after his period of isolation should have ended. ""The poor woman had to tell me on the 23rd of August that I should be self-isolating until the 16th of August,"" he said. ""You could hear the sort of embarrassment and exasperation in this woman's voice that she's asking me to do something that is patently bonkers."" Many local authorities are critical of the government's decision to make tracing a centralised programme, rather than one led by local directors of public health. Leaders in Leicester say that if information had been shared earlier, it might have been possible to avoid England's first local lockdown in June. But information sharing has improved. Local authorities like Leicester are now conducting their own contact tracing for coronavirus alongside the national service. If the national service fails to reach someone who has tested positive, local teams can use the council databases to find alternative contact details. But they only receive details of positive tests in their area a day after the national system, and they want to be involved far earlier. Sir Peter Soulsby, Labour mayor of Leicester, says that if the national service had fed through details of where it was spotting positive cases, it would have been possible to intervene much earlier. ""That is something we ought to be allowed to do."" Leicester City Council says it successfully contacts 90% of the cases, but complains it can take up to 10 days after a person has tested positive before the case reaches them, meaning the self-isolation period is almost finished. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""NHS Test and Trace is one of the largest testing and contact tracing systems in the world. ""The service is working hard to break chains of transmission, with almost half a million people who may otherwise have unknowingly spreading coronavirus contacted and told to isolate. ""We are also providing tests at an unprecedented scale - over 225,000  a day on average over the last week - and expanding capacity further to provide 500,000 tests a day by the end of October."" The DHSC also said initial technical issues were resolved quickly, and that it keeps staffing levels under constant review. It says it's given local authorities Â£300m for the outbreak control plans, is providing dedicated contact tracing teams and that the majority of people who test positive for the virus are contacted by NHS Test and Trace within 24 hours. Experts hope that the system can be improved in time for the pressures of the coming months. ""There's a lot of work to do to make it fit for purpose for winter,"" says Chris Hopson. ""It's not world class yet."" Watch BBC Panorama: Test and Trace Exposed at 19:30 GMT on BBC One, or afterwards on BBC iPlayer.

"England and Wales' Covid-19 app has now launched, joining earlier efforts by Northern Ireland and Scotland. Apple and Google's automated contact-tracing technology is being used to tell people to self-isolate if their phone detects they were near someone later determined to have the virus. Other features are also included, and health chiefs say the primary goal is to change people's behaviour to make them less likely to catch or transmit the coronavirus. The app is available for smartphones only - not tablets, smartwatches or other devices. To get started, go toAndroid's Google Play,externalorApple's App Store,externaland search for ""NHS Covid-19"". This video can not be played WATCH: How to install the NHS Covid-19 app The handsets must have Android 6.0 (released in 2015) or iOS 13.5 (released in May 2020) and Bluetooth 4.0 or higher. That excludes the iPhone 6 and older versions of Apple's handsets. To check what iOS system you have,go into Settings, then tap on General, and click on About,external. To upgrade click on Software Update. On Android,open Settings, then select System, and click on Advanced,external. It will show what version you have. If you click System Update, it will check if there is an available upgrade. Some of the latest Huawei handsets will not run the app. And users must confirm they are 16 or older to get started. There's a raft of features including: The app keeps a record of venues the user has been to in order to warn them if one is later linked to an outbreak a venue check-in barcode scanner a postcode-based risk-level checker a symptoms-reporter tool the means to order a coronavirus test and receive its results a countdown timer to keep track of how long to stay in self-isolation a guide to the latest advice on local restrictions, financial support and other related information When two devices running the app are close to each other, they exchange Bluetooth ""handshakes"" to determine the distance and duration, measured in sessions lasting five minutes. The measurements are not always accurate - and work continues to improve them - but the logs are used to create a cumulative points score for the set of interactions between two people over the course of a day. If the points threshold is met and one of the two owners later shares a positive coronavirus test via the app, then the other will receive an alert. The formula above was used during the trial, but has since been tweaked to take account of when the person with Covid-19 was most infectious. Further changes may be made over time. The notification will tell the recipient to go into self-isolation for a fortnight - and trigger the start of the app's countdown clock. But the recipient is not told who triggered the alert. And the authorities cannot identify either party, although they can track how many people have been told to self-isolate. Even if the recipient has no symptoms or a subsequent negative test result, they must stay at home for the duration. How does Covid-19 test-and-trace work? From 28 September,people in England can be fined,externalÂ£1,000 or more for breaching self-isolation rules. However,the relevant legislation says that it does not apply to notifications,externalserved via the app. In any case, because the app lets users remain anonymous there would be no way to enforce penalties for non-compliance. Unlike when a human contact tracer orders someone to self-isolate, the app keeps the subject's identity a secret. Only if they subsequently get in contact - for example to arrange a financial support payment - will their name be registered. Restaurants, bars and other leisure facilities should display an authorised QR barcode on a poster or digital sign, which the app can scan. The app recognises only QR codes related to the check-in scheme, to which businesses must be registered The venue will then be added to the app's ""digital diary"" of places the user has visited. And in England - but not Wales - the user will not need to give their name and address to the venue. If officials later judge the location to be the centre of an outbreak, they can trigger an alert to users who were there. And this notification will tell them that if they are feeling unwell they should use the app's symptom checker. The app first asks the user for permission to use Bluetooth and their postcode, before revealing its home screen When a smartphone owner first uses the app, they are given the option of typing in the first part of their postcode - ""M23"", for example. Typically, thousands of other households will have the same code, so although this causes information to be shared with the authorities, it should not identify individuals. The user is then given a risk-level for their neighbourhood, at the top of the app's home screen, and can be sent an alert if it changes. And in turn, the NHS and local government can collect data about the numbers of app downloads and coronavirus cases in their area, helping them manage the crisis. The app can trigger notification alerts to warn the user if their local risk level has changed or if they have been linked to someone who has the coronavirus Users can report symptoms - and when they started - at any time. If they suggest infection, the user is told to book a test and that everyone in their household must self-isolate for eight days. Booking a test involves using an external website, which asks for the user's name and address. But these personal details are not shared back to the app. And a unique code lets users receive their test result via the app as soon as it is ready. The developers suggest the app should account for less than 5% of a device's battery use. But if the phone is set to use a low-power mode, owners should go into their settings to exclude the app so it can continue contact tracing at all times. And while the app is continually checking for updated data, the major networks have said they will not deduct usage from people's allowances. Apple and Google's framework will not allow two apps to contact trace simultaneously. So when users cross the border, they need to open the local app and turn on contact tracing within it. This will bring up a prompt asking: ""Switch app for exposure notifications?"" Google Play shows users which UK-related contact-tracing apps are available to them Doing so, will turn off the one they were using beforehand. While users are normally encouraged to keep the app active and their phone to hand whenever out of the house, there are exceptions. To avoid people being told to self-isolate when they were protected, or phones logging each other while  in lockers, there is an option to temporarily turn off contact tracing, at the bottom of the home screen. While the human and automated contact-tracing systems are being deliberately kept separate, they should complement each other. So, for example, if you were in a supermarket queue, human tracers might find it hard to identify the person next in line but the app would be able to. Likewise, if you were at a pub where a contagious user was sitting but not using the app, you might still receive an alert via the check-in service. According to modelling done by the University of Oxford, the app can significantly reduce deaths and hospital admissions if at least 15% of the population use it. But real-world data on how effective such apps have been in other countries using them is scant. And so far, they have been offered when the levels of infection have been relatively low, meaning the chance of any user receiving an alert has been slim. Most people have yet to be convinced to install them too - about a third of the population in Ireland, 22% in Germany and only about 4% in France have done so. As Covid-19 resurges that may change. And as health chiefs note, there are other measures of success, including whether those that do download the app regularly open it and then change their behaviour as a result.

"Pressure is mounting on the government to reverse its decision not to provide free school meals over the holidays in England. Several Conservative MPs are opposing No 10's stance, as Labour threatens to push for another Commons vote and some 2,000 doctors call for a U-turn. It comes as the PM faces calls to meet footballer Marcus Rashford to discusshis free school meals campaign. The government has said it has increased welfare support. Downing Street has also highlighted tens of millions of pounds in funding for councils to help vulnerable families during the pandemic. But there is increasing criticism from within Tory ranks over the government's decision to rule out extending meal vouchers for around 1.3 million vulnerable children in England to cover holidays. Councils promise free meals after Rashford campaign Restaurants rally for Rashford's free meal crusade Is there really no money for free school meals? Former Tory children's minister Tim Loughton, who did not support Labour's motion,said he would lobby ministers,externalto reverse the decision for the Christmas break. And Tobias Ellwood, a former defence minister, saidthe free school meals scheme was ""well received"",externaland a ""simple and practical"" way of supporting families. Johnny Mercer, a defence minister,admitted on Twitter,externalthat the government had dealt with the issue ""poorly"". And more than 2,000 paediatricians who work with young peoplehave signed a letter,externalsaying England should follow Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in providing meals during the holidays. Marcus Rashford has led a viral social media campaign highlighting organisations providing food during half term Meanwhile, chairman of the education select committee Robert Halfon said a meeting would help ministers create a long-term strategy to combat child food hunger. Labour has said it will force a new Commons vote on the issue if the government does not change its position before the Christmas Commons recess. Tulip Siddiq, shadow minister for children, said she was sorry the issue had ""become a political football"" but some Conservative MPs ""are realising this is principles before party"" and she appealed for more to stand against the government. She told BBC Breakfast that, with some local councils agreeing to supply meal vouchers during the holidays, the issue had become ""a postcode lottery"" because not every council had ""stepped up"". On Wednesday, Conservative MPs rejected Labour's Opposition Day motion to extend free school meals by 322 votes to 261, with five Tory MPs rebelling. One of those rebels, Mr Halfon, called on Mr Johnson to meet Rashford, telling the BBC: ""It may be that they don't agree with everything that Marcus Rashford is proposing, but it would give us a chance to come up with a long-term plan to combat child food hunger once and for all."" On Saturday, Rashford, 22,tweeted,externalto condemn the ""unacceptable"" abuse some MPs had received for voting against the motion. The government extended free school meals to eligible children during the Easter holidays earlier this year. Following the Manchester United striker's campaign, itbowed to pressure to do the samethroughout the summer holiday. But this time it has refused to do so, saying it has given councils Â£63m for families facing financial difficulties due to pandemic restrictions, as well as increasing welfare support by Â£9.3bn. Businesses have been offering to provide children with food during half-term This puts it at odds with the other UK nations, which have all extended the policy beyond term time. However, hundreds of cafes, restaurants and some local councils have since pledged to help feed children facing hardship during the October half term - prompting Rashford to say he""couldn't be more proud to call myself British"". Rashford's petition on child food poverty was approaching 800,000 names on Sunday morning. Meanwhile, two Conservative MPs have said comments they made about the issue were ""taken out of context"" after their remarks were criticised. Commenting on a school in Mansfield, Ben Bradley said that ""one kid lives in a crack den, another in a brothel"". Another Twitter user responded, saying that ""Â£20 cash direct to a crack den and a brothel sounds like the way forward with this one"", to which Mr Bradley replied: ""That's what FSM [free school meal] vouchers in the summer effectively did..."" Mr Bradley said the tweet, which has since been deleted,had been ""totally taken out of context"". Similarly, Conservative MP, Selaine Saxby, used the same defence after writing in a since-deleted Facebook post that she hoped businesses who were giving away food for free ""will not be seeking any further government support"".

"The ban has provoked a fierce debate on what goods are ""essential"" Rules banning shops selling non-essential items during Wales' firebreak lockdown will not be reversed, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. On Sunday afternoon, Mr Drakeford said the implementation of the rules may be tweaked, but the ""basic decision"" behind the ban was the right one. Apetition,externalon the issue has exceeded 60,000 signatures, making it the largest ever submitted to the Senedd. The Welsh Conservatives earlier said the rules were ""mixed-messaging"". Supermarkets have been told they can only sell ""essential"" itemsand must close parts of their stores which sell products such as clothes, shoes, toys and bedding during Wales' 17-day ""firebreak"" lockdown. Policing 'challenging' because of Covid 'fatigue' Five more Covid deaths and 1,104 new cases Mark Drakeford has said he will review the lockdown restrictions on what supermarkets can sell, but the ban will not be reversed In an interview with BBC Wales, Mr Drakeford said: ""The position we face in Wales is really and deeply serious and for these two weeks we are asking people to stay at home and not to mix with other people as much as they can. ""If the rules are not sensible rules, if there are anomalies that are emerging, we will put them right, but the basic underlying public health emergency has not gone away. ""The basic decision is the right one. If the implementation of it, the interpretation of it needs to be revisited to make sure the rules are sensible, then we will do that. ""Non-essential goods are not allowed to be sold over the next two weeks. That's why there are hundreds of shops the length and breadth of Wales are closed. The underlying issue is not about shopping, it is about saving lives."" Mr Drakeford said a review into how the rules have been implemented would be held on Monday. This video can not be played Marr: Wales' health minister Vaughan Gething explains Wales supermarket rules Following comments earlier on Sunday by Welsh Government ministers Lee Waters and Jeremy Miles, Mr Drakeford said there is some ""discretion"" in the rules for shops to sell ""non-essential"" items in certain circumstances.

The head of the Welsh Retail Consortium, Sara Jones, said: ""To hear that discretion can be applied, of course that's good because it's showing that ministers are listening and that they're willing to look at ways to move forward. ""However, it does open a whole host of other issues. For example, by actually allowing that discretion to happen it means that actually the consumer is going to spend more time in store having to seek advice having to seek guidance.

"Lee Kun-hee helped to grow Samsung Group into an economic powerhouse in South Korea Lee Kun-hee, the chairman of South Korea's largest conglomerate, Samsung Group, has died aged 78. Mr Lee helped to grow his father's small trading business into an economic powerhouse, diversifying into areas like insurance and shipping. During his lifetime, Samsung Electronics also became one of the world's biggest tech firms. He was the richest person in South Korea, according to Forbes, with a net worth of nearly $21bn (Â£16bn). Samsung said Mr Lee died on Sunday with family by his side, but did not state the exact cause of death. A heart attack in 2014 had left him living in care. ""All of us at Samsung will cherish his memory and are grateful for the journey we shared with him,"" the firm said in a statement. Mr Lee was the third son of Lee Byung-chul, who founded Samsung Group in 1938. He joined the family firm in 1968 and took over as chairman in 1987 after his father's death. At the time, Samsung was seen as a producer of cheap, low-quality products. But under his leadership radical reforms were introduced at the company. Mr Lee became famous for telling employees in 1993: ""Let's change everything except our wives and kids."" The firm then burned its entire mobile phone stock, consisting of 150,000 handsets. Mr Lee, pictured with his parents as a child, was the third son of Lee Byung-chul, who founded Samsung Group Mr Lee rarely spoke to the media and had a reputation for being a recluse, earning him the nickname ""the hermit king"". Samsung is by far the largest of South's Korea's chaebols - the family-owned conglomerates that dominate the country's economy. Chaebols helped to drive South Korea's economic transformation after World War Two, but have long been accused of murky political and business dealings. Mr Lee was twice convicted of criminal offences, including the bribing of former President Roh Tae-woo. He stepped down as Samsung chairman in 2008 after he was charged with tax evasion and embezzlement. He was handed a three-year suspended jail sentence for tax evasion but was given a presidential pardon in 2009 and went on to lead South Korea's successful bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympics. He returned as chairman of Samsung Group in 2010, but was left bedridden by the 2014 heart attack. Mr Lee's son, Lee Jae-yong, has served jail time for his role in a bribery scandal which triggered the ousting of then-President Park Geun-hye from office in 2017. Last month, prosecutors laid fresh charges against him over his role in a 2015 merger deal.

"Marcus Rashford said he was ""blown away"" by news of local businesses stepping up Cafes and restaurants across England have promised to feed children in the school holidays, despite the industry struggling to survive coronavirus restrictions. Responses to Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford's child food poverty campaign escalated after the government voted against extending free meal vouchers out of term time. It said there was enough support available through the benefits system for families facing hardship. The England international has turned hisTwitter feed,externalinto a network of restaurants, cafes and communities who will help feed children during the October school holidays. From horseboxes to beach cafes, high-end restaurants to chip shops, here are just a few of the many willing to help. Laura's Little Bakery and Cupcake Maker has decided to donate a birthday cake a week Laura, who has a baking business in Liverpool, said she understands how children in food poverty feel. After her father died, she and her siblings ""had bare cupboards, begged local shops to give us food or just plain went hungry"". Laura's Little Bakery and Cupcake Maker has decided to donate a birthday cake a week to a family who would otherwise be unable to afford it. Since making the announcement on Facebook, she says she has a list of about 80 other bakers keen to join in. ""It is just insane and amazing, a fair few of these are around the country too - Durham, Leeds, Manchester, Kendal, Warrington, St. Helens, Southport, Surrey, Glasgow, Preston and so on."" Any child between the ages of 4 and 16 in the community can collect a free meal Paul and Harry run vegan restaurant Vutie Beets in Letchworth Garden City. They said they will do their bit to help in their area. Any child between the ages of 4 and 16 can collect a free meal throughout the school holiday. ""We stand with Marcus Rashford in making sure no child in our local community goes hungry this half term."" La Tabella is also asking people to nominate anyone too shy to come forward Rob and Liza Smallman at La Tabella in Churchtown are offering free pasta dishes which can be warmed up at home to any children who need them during the October half term holiday. They are also asking people to nominate anyone who may be too shy to come forward themselves. ""We couldn't sit back and let children in our local area go hungry,"" the couple said. A converted horsebox has been turned into a food bank The team at Rosa restaurant in Westhoughton provides and delivers free holiday meals for children living in poverty. It has now opened its converted horsebox as a food bank. ""We are offering free meals for children and essentials to help support families who are struggling over the school holidays - we would like to do something to help."" Fiona Crump said she thought she was doing a ""local, small thing"" The owner of Castle Beach Cafe in Falmouth will be offering free lunch bags to children who normally get a free school meal. Fiona Crump said she thought she was doing a ""local, small thing"", but was surprised by ""the sheer volume"" of social media shares of her announcement. ""It reminds you in times of doom and gloom that the vast majority of people are delightful, helpful, caring people and the world needs to be reminded of that."" Andrew and May Mahon run the Aubergine Cafe in West Kirby. They are offering a free sandwich, cup of soup and piece of fruit to children. Mr Mahon said they were ""dumbstruck"" by the government's decision. He said for every request for help they have had, they have received more than 20 times as many offers of support, with people asking to donate money to help pay for the meals. He said: ""It's very heartening. We weren't expecting it."" Rashford said he was ""blown away"" by news of local businesses who had offered to help.

"More than 1.4 million people in South Yorkshire are the latest to move to England's top level of restrictions. Tier three measures came into effect at midnight affecting areas including Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield. Sheffield City Region's mayor said the measures were needed but called on the government to ""define precisely what the exit criteria is"" from tier three. Meanwhile, Wales entered the first full day of a national lockdown amid border patrols to stop non-essential travel. Gloucestershire Constabulary said it will patrol routes into the Forest of Dean area and pull over vehicles suspected of making unnecessary journeys out of Wales. Can I go out for a meal with my sister? And other questions What Covid tier is your area in? Tier 2 rules start in Stoke-on-Trent and Coventry Scotland to enter five-level Covid alert system Drivers without a valid excuse will be advised to turn around and, if they do not, will be reported to police in Wales who can issue fines, the force added. It comes as another 174 deaths and 23,012 new confirmed cases were recorded on Saturday. And a leading epidemiologist has warned sending some children home from schoolsmay be the only way to control infection rates. Prof Neil Ferguson, a former government scientific adviser, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the current restrictions on household mixing ""should have a significant effect"". But he said beyond that there was a ""limit to what we can do"" without sending some school year groups home. Prof Ferguson, whose advice led to the lockdown in March, also said it was ""too early to say"" what impact the restrictions were having, adding: ""I think we'll have to wait another week or two."" Asked what the impact would be of relaxing lockdown rules for one or two days on Christmas, Mr Ferguson, whoquit his role in May after an ""error of judgement"", said it was a ""balancing act"" and ""a political judgement"". ""It risks some transmission and there will be consequences of that,"" he said. ""But if it's only one or two days the impact is likely to be limited."" Some 7.3 million people are now living under England's tightest restrictions. As the Sheffield City region entered tier three - very high alert - mayor Dan Jarvis, urged people to ""do their bit"" and stick to the new rules. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he was ""clear what it takes our end"" to get out of tier three, such as a drop in new cases - but the government ""do have to be clear and transparent about the exit strategy"". Church leaders' warning over northern Covid rules Elsewhere, Stoke-on-Trent, Slough and Coventrymoved into tier two- high alert level - at midnight. In Wales, a17-day ""firebreak"" has started, meaning most non-essential businesses are closed, with people only able to leave home for limited reasons. In line with new guidance, supermarkets removed non-essential items from sale - including clothing, kitchen electrical items and crockery - using barriers and plastic sheets to cover products. Shoppers in Wales will not be allowed to buy non-essential items, such as clothing and tableware, in stores In Scotland,a five-level system will be introducedfrom 2 November. The top level would be close to a full lockdown, but the aim is for schools to remain open at all levels. In Northern Ireland, schools have been closed for two weeks as part of an extended half-term break. This ispart of a four-week ""circuit-breaker"" lockdown, with some businesses being told to close temporarily. Under England's tier three rules, pubs and bars not serving substantial meals have to close, while household mixing is banned indoors and outdoors in hospitality settings and private gardens. Additional rules in South Yorkshire include the closure of betting shops, adult gaming centres, casinos, and soft play centres. However, gyms will remain open. The new measures will be reviewed after 28 days, but Sheffield's director of public health, Greg Fell,said he feared four weeks ""will not be long enough"". LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area THREE TIERS:How will the system work? PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What will I be paid under the new scheme? VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? In a letter to residents, Mr Jarvis, who is also the Labour MP for Barnsley Central, said there was light at the end of the tunnel and the restrictions would ""help us reach it sooner, and at a lower cost"". He warned South Yorkshire communities now have some of the highest numbers of cases in the north of England and infection rates are still going up. In Barnsley the infection rate in the seven days to 19 October was 486 cases per 100,000 people, in Sheffield 415, in Rotherham 407 and in Doncaster 393. The average area in England had 117. Mr Jarvis wrote: ""It's tempting to think that because new restrictions are not a silver bullet they are not worth the disruption. ""We don't have the luxury of easy choices. But I have no doubt this was the right one to make. ""The alternatives carry far too great a risk of causing more deaths, and ultimately more harm to our economy."" South Yorkshire joins Greater Manchester, Liverpool City Region and Lancashire in tier three. Tier three rules will also come into force in Warrington on Tuesday,two days earlier than initially planned, to ""urgently"" reduce coronavirus cases, according to the local council. Nottingham and parts of Nottinghamshire are expected to be moved into the highest tier next week, with the finer details such as whether or not gyms can stay open stillto be decided. Meanwhile, Office for National Statistics data estimates cases in England have risento more than 35,200 a day. The ONS survey tests a representative sample of the general population to provide an estimate of the true spread of the virus, as it picks up asymptomatic cases that would not necessarily be identified in the daily figures.

Writing in the Telegraph, Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin said a""vacuum of leadership in Test and Trace"",externalwas affecting compliance. Tests could be offered to people after a week of isolation, the paper said. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told the BBC the government would be ""led by the science"" on the issue. And Prof Sir Ian Diamond, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), added there was ""work going on"" to look at the length of self-isolation period and ""certainly it has been discussed at various times"". Research by King's College London,externalsuggested just 10.9% of those traced as contacts of someone with Covid-19 remained at home for the full quarantine period. Earlier this month, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was ""very hopeful"" ofreducing the amount of time people needed to spend in quarantineon arrival in the UK from abroad and this could be done by testing them a week later. Sir Bernard, chairman of the Commons liaison committee, said public consent and co-operation with England's system was ""breaking down"". He added there should be a ""visible and decisive"" change, with a senior military figure put in charge of the system. Baroness Dido Harding, currently at the helm, should be ""given a well-earned break"" so she and others could ""reflect on the lessons learned so far"", he wrote in the paper. ""There is a spaghetti of command and control at the top, which is incapable of coherent analysis, assessment, planning and delivery,"" he added. ""People lack faith that there is a coherent plan."" 'I spoke to one person in four months' Test and Trace needs to improve, PM concedes How does Covid-19 test-and-trace work? A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson said NHS Test and Trace had contacted more 1.1 million people and asked them to self-isolate. ""Dido Harding and her leadership team - drawn from the military, public and private sectors - have built the largest diagnostic industry the UK has ever seen,"" they said. ""It is the equivalent of building an operation the size of Tesco in a matter of months. We need to improve in areas and we are very much focused on that, but we should be talking it up not down."" Last month, it was announced that former Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupewould be taking over as directorof Covid-19 testing at England's NHS Test and Trace agency. More than 20,000 tracers were recruited by the service,but many have complained they were given little or nothing to do. Boris Johnson said on Thursdaythat NHS Test and Trace required improvements so results were provided quicker. The government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, also acknowledged a need for change. Figures for the week ending 14 October reveal that just 15.1% of those who were tested received their results within 24 hours - dropping from 32.8% in the previous week. The figures also showed a fall to 59.6% in the proportion of close contacts reached of people who tested positive. According to Sage, at least 80% of contacts would need to isolate for it to work properly. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has previously said up to 500,000 tests a day could be carried out by 31 October. Latest data showed 340,132 tests were processed on 22 October, with capacity at 361,573. Meanwhile, cabinet minister Mr Lewis told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that ""teams were looking"" at whether the self-isolation period cut be cut from 14 days but he added that ""any final decision on this will be led by the science and we're not in a position to make on a decision on that just yet"". Prof Diamond told the same programme that identifying ""the optimal times for self-isolation is critical"" because it was an ""incredibly important part of the way in which we will control this virus"".

It comes as First Minister Mark Drakeford saidthe government would review the decision to prohibit supermarkets from selling non-essential itemssuch as clothes and microwaves during Wales' 17-day lockdown. Wales' health minister Vaughan Gething defended the ban, saying it was in place to ensure fairness to businesses that are closed during the 17-day lockdown and reduce the opportunities for people to ""go out and mix"". He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""We're reviewing with supermarkets the understanding and the clarity of the policy because there's been different application in different parts."" A further 19,790 new coronavirus cases were reported on Sunday, with a further 151 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded.
