Max Trobe, 18, posted the picture of himself and his sister Martha Lynch, 10, at Tuesday's Little Mix show. His Twitter post attracted hundreds of comments praising the pair's courage. Max said they will take away good memories of the venue after the ""constant happiness"" of the Little Mix gig. Returning to the venue ""was scary, but I'm glad we did it"", he said. The pair, of Darwen, Lancashire, were not physically injured but witnessed the aftermath of the suicide bombing which killed 22 people. Allow Twitter content?

He told the BBC: ""I wasn't going to go, but then I thought: 'I will not let the senseless actions of one individual ruin my enjoyment, why should I?' ""My sister's still very naive to the situation, she fell straight asleep on the night of the attack because she thought it was a balloon, but to me, going back was a big deal and a tough decision. ""She really wanted to go, and I thought, if Martha can do it, I can do it. ""I felt very safe as there were metal detectors, all belongings had to be scanned, and there were plenty of security staff."" Recalling the events at the Ariane Grande concert six months ago, Max said he was caught in a stampede as people scrambled to leave. He said: ""I started to panic, thinking I was going to become separated from my sister as I was having to lift her over seats to get to the exit. ""We went past the corridor and I saw bodies covered in blood on the floor. I covered my sister's eyes so she couldn't see."" Max and his older sister Megan attended the One Love Manchester concert in June Max said the atmosphere at the Little Mix concert was ""amazing"", and similar to the Ariana Grande concert before the explosion. He said: ""I still look back on that night and try to see it as the great evening it was before the bomb happened, but the Little Mix concert was constant happiness. ""The memories of the night of the attack are still there, but they're now in the back of my mind, and the memories of the Little Mix concert on Tuesday night are what I think of first when I think of the arena.

"Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and Fianna FÃ¡il leader MicheÃ¡l Martin could fight a fresh election in the coming months The Republic of Ireland could face a general election after the country's second largest party tabled a motion of no confidence in the deputy prime minister. The Fianna FÃ¡il motion against Frances Fitzgerald comes over her handling of a police whistleblower controversy. Her party, Fine Gael, passed a motion to support her at an emergency party meeting on Thursday night. Fianna FÃ¡il front bench members lodged the motion for debate next Tuesday. Fine Gael lead the minority government with the support of Fianna FÃ¡il. Fianna FÃ¡il, the main opposition party, agreed to back a Fine Gael minority government after the 2016 general electiondid not return a majority government. Irish government 'new politics' era survives first year Fianna FÃ¡il agrees to back minority Fine Gael government Audit reveals Garda irregularities Timeline: Controversies dog Garda Under the terms of the confidence and supply arrangement, Fianna FÃ¡il agreed not to vote against the minority government in confidence motions and to support it for three budgets, two of which are now past. Now, the government looks likely to collapse, forcing a snap election next month, unless Ms Fitzgerald resigns before the no confidence motion is debated. Frances Fitzgerald was Irish minister for justice during a police whistleblower controversy Sinn FÃ©in, the country's third largest party,had tabled their own no confidence motion on Thursday. It is due to be debated and voted on next week. Ms Fitzgerald has been under pressure over her handling of an ongoing controversy around a Garda (police) whistleblower when she was Irish justice minister. What we are witnessing is a game of call my bluff, involving three political parties. The decision by Sinn FÃ©in to put down a motion of no confidence in Frances Fitzgerald was aimed at calling Fianna FÃ¡il's bluff. That's because Fianna FÃ¡il has an agreement with the minority-led Fine Gael government whereby they were prepared to support them in a confidence-and-supply arrangement. But Fianna FÃ¡il called Sinn FÃ©in's bluff by deciding to put down their motion of no confidence which will take precedence over the Sinn FÃ©in one -  at a time when Sinn FÃ©in is undergoing generational change. Fine Gael is now calling Fianna FÃ¡il's bluff by saying they are prepared to go to the country over this issue. Once TDs go back into their constituencies they will face questions from the public:  How can you bring down a government over a missing or forgotten email by Frances Fitzgerald during key Brexit talks, when many thousands of people are homeless and there are huge hospital waiting lists? Fine Gael normally prides itself on putting the country before the party. I wouldn't be surprised if, in the coming days, Frances Fitzgerald fell on her sword. Ms Fitzgerald has faced questions in the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) about what she knew about what lawyers were going to put to a whistleblower at a commission of enquiry. In particular, she has been questioned over her account of an email she received about the legal strategy of the former Garda commissioner in the case of Sgt Maurice McCabe. Ms Fitzgerald has recently admitted that she was made aware a year earlier than she had previously stated, that lawyers for the Garda were going to attempt to discredit Sgt McCabe. The email was initially sent to Ms Fitzgerald in May 2015, but she told the DÃ¡il earlier this week that she could not remember reading it. Speaking to Irish national broadcaster RTÃ, Fianna FÃ¡il justice spokesperson Jim O'Callaghan said that Ms Fitzgerald ""should go"". He said that party leader MicheÃ¡l Martin had expressed this view to Taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney told RTÃ that the government would continue to support Ms Fitzgerald and that calls for her resignation were ""built on sand"".

The Celebrity Big Brother starwas given a suspended sentenceafter being convicted of assaulting his partner. McConnell, 27, had been staying with a friend in south Wales but Cardiff Magistrates heard he missed eight work appointments in the 200-hour order. The court activated the sentence for failing to comply with his punishment. Dublin-born model McConnell attacked former Hollyoaks actress Stephanie Davis at her home in Rainhill, Merseyside, while she was holding their baby son, Liverpool Magistrates' Court heard. McConnell given suspended sentence for assault The pair met while starring on Celebrity Big Brother together, but rowed during the trial in August and proceedings were stopped at one point. Miss Davis said of the incident in March she thought that ""psychotic"" McConnell was ""going to kill"" her after taking cocaine. Jeremy McConnell leaving the Celebrity Big Brother House After being found guilty and having his sentence suspended, McConnell was carrying out the community service in south Wales as he stayed with the family of a friend. Probation Service officers recommended he be given extra hours of unpaid work, however this was overruled by district judge Wendy Lloyd. Appearing via video link from Liverpool, she described the ""vicious alcohol-fuelled attack"" that left Miss Davis with injuries and damaged property. She said: ""Your enthusiasm for co-operation has been short-lived and there's nothing to show in the future things will change."" McConnell was given some credit for completing part of the work and was sentenced to 18 instead of 20 weeks.

"Theresa May met German's Angela Merkel and other EU leaders Issues still need to be resolved but progress is being made in Brexit negotiations, Theresa May has insisted. The prime minister said there had been a ""very positive atmosphere"" in talks with several EU leaders in Brussels. The UK, she said, would honour its financial commitments and shared the same desire as Ireland to stop barriers to trade or movement across the border. EU Council President Donald Tusk said talks could move to the next phase in December but it was a ""huge challenge"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

At a security summit in Brussels, Mrs May had lunch with Angela Merkel and also met Mr Tusk, who told her last week that she has until the start of December to make an enhanced offer on money and provide guarantees on the Irish border after Brexit. Ministers have given her their backing to increase the UK's ""divorce bill"" but only if the EU shows movement on trade. The government has refused to comment on reports it had agreed to pay about Â£40bn to pave the way for EU leaders to approve the next phase of talks on future relations at a summit on 14 December. All you need to know about Brexit DUP hits out at Irish government on Brexit Brexit: UK 'ready to pay more to EU' Speaking in Brussels, Mrs May did not answer specific questions about money and said there were ""still issues across the various matters that we're negotiating on to be resolved"". But she added: ""There's been a very positive atmosphere in the talks and a genuine feeling that we want to move forward together."" Last week, Mr Tusk said the EU was ""ready"" to move on to the next phase of talks - focused on a trade and security partnership after the UK leaves in March 2019 - but the UK must first show more progress on outstanding ""separation"" issues. The BBC's Europe reporter Adam Fleming said that after holding talks with Mrs May, Danish PM Lars Lokke Rasmussen had told journalists in the Belgian capital that there had been ""movement"" on the issue of money. ""It seems to me that there is progress and so I have decided to be optimistic about this,"" Mr Rasmussen - one of the UK's closest allies - said. The PM also said the UK was in continuing discussions with the Irish government about the solutions for avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. No 10 earlier had to clarify its position after a spokesman appeared to suggest the possibility of Northern Ireland staying in the customs union may be up for negotiation. Asked about the issue at a lobby briefing, the spokesman said the UK must ""continue to negotiate to find an innovative way forward"". But Downing Street later insisted that the UK's stated policy - that the whole of the UK is leaving the single market and customs union - remained in force. The UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016, and served the EU with formal notice of Brexit in March 2017. This began a two-year countdown to the UK's departure day which will be in March 2019.

The tweets, which prompted allegations of racism and homophobia, were published in the Sun newspaper while Maynard, 23, was in Australia. He said he was ""young"" and ""careless"" when he posted them. In an online video, Maynard added: ""I've been really stupid in the past."" The show told viewers Maynard - who has more than 1.2m subscribers to his YouTube channel and is the younger brother of singer Conor Maynard - had left the jungle on Tuesday.

He said he felt ""deeply humbled"" to take the role. And he said he was ""not oblivious to the many Zimbabweans from across the political and racial divide who have helped make this day."" He paid tribute to his predecessor Robert Mugabe - to muted applause - calling him ""a father, mentor, comrade-in-arms and my leader"". Mr Mugabe left office dramatically this week after 37 years of authoritarian rule. His departure followed a power struggle in which Mr Mnangagwa was sacked as vice president to pave the way for Grace Mugabe, the then-first lady, to take up the presidency. Mr Mnangagwa fled the country but returned to a hero's welcome and on Friday struck a conciliatory tone. ""The task at hand is that of rebuilding our country,"" he said. ""I am required to serve our country as the president of all citizens regardless of colour, creed, religion, tribe, totem or political affiliation."" Follow live updates from a historic day The ceremony in pictures Although Mr Mnangagwa has unseated Zimbabwe's long-time ruler, he is still associated by many with some of the worst atrocities committed under the ruling Zanu-PF party since the country gained independence in 1980. He was the country's spymaster during the 1980s civil conflict, in which thousands of civilians were killed. But he has denied any role in the massacres, blaming the army. Tens of thousands of people packed the National Sports Stadium in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare, to witness the inauguration. Pop singer Jah Prayzer provided the entertainment and, as people in the crowd danced, the atmosphere was closer to that of a concert.

No - and the official reason given was that at 93, the former president needed to rest.

President Mugabe was accused of preparing the presidency for his wife Grace Local media are reporting that Mr Mnangagwa has offered the Mugabe family ""maximum security and welfare"". The former president ""expressed his good wishes and support for the incoming president,"" the Herald newspaper reports. The news on Tuesday that Mr Mugabe was stepping down sparked wild celebrations. It came in the form of a letter read out in parliament, abruptly halting impeachment proceedings against him. He had been under pressure since the military took control of the country a week before, seizing the headquarters of the national broadcaster. Although Mr Mugabe was largely under house arrest for several days, he appeared to be resisting pressure to stand down.

In his letter, he said he was resigning to allow a smooth and peaceful transfer of power, and that his decision was voluntary. Zimbabwe's economy is in a very bad state. It has not recovered fully from crises in the last decade, when rampant inflation grew so bad the country had to abandon its own currency. Now, according to some estimates, 90% of people there are unemployed. Its main industrial index has slumped by 40% since last week's military intervention and the stock market has shed $6bn (Â£4.5bn) in a week. Five things Zimbabwe's economy urgently needs Ten numbers that will help you understand what's going on Analysts say the market is now correcting itself, optimistic of a change of economic policy under Mr Mnangagwa. However,the International Monetary Fund has warned that Zimbabwe must act quickly to dig its economy out of a holeand access international financial aid. In his speech, Mr Mnangagwa said he would base a new economic policy on agriculture and foreign direct investment. He has pledged to create jobs. He also said the country's land reform programme would not be reversed, but pledged to compensate farmers for the land that was confiscated from them. The seizure of land from white farmers is seen as a key factor in the country's economic meltdown. On Thursday, Zimbabwe's main opposition MDC party called for deep-rooted political reform to dismantle the repressive apparatus that sustained Mr Mugabe's regime.

It is unclear whether Zanu-PF will govern alone ahead of scheduled elections next year, or whether a coalition government of national unity that includes opposition groups will be formed.

It has not recovered fully from crises in the last decade, when rampant inflation grew so bad the country had to abandon its own currency. Now, according to some estimates, 90% of people there are unemployed. Its main industrial index has slumped by 40% since last week's military intervention and the stock market has shed $6bn (Â£4.5bn) in a week. Five things Zimbabwe's economy urgently needs Ten numbers that will help you understand what's going on Analysts say the market is now correcting itself, optimistic of a change of economic policy under Mr Mnangagwa. However,the International Monetary Fund has warned that Zimbabwe must act quickly to dig its economy out of a holeand access international financial aid. In his speech, Mr Mnangagwa said he would base a new economic policy on agriculture and foreign direct investment. He has pledged to create jobs. He also said the country's land reform programme would not be reversed, but pledged to compensate farmers for the land that was confiscated from them. The seizure of land from white farmers is seen as a key factor in the country's economic meltdown. On Thursday, Zimbabwe's main opposition MDC party called for deep-rooted political reform to dismantle the repressive apparatus that sustained Mr Mugabe's regime. This video can not be played Leader of the opposition MDC party, Morgan Tsvangirai, warns of a ""power retention agenda"" MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai said the ""culture of violence"" and ""culture of corruption"" had to be changed after ""after so many years of Zanu-PF misrule"". It is unclear whether Zanu-PF will govern alone ahead of scheduled elections next year, or whether a coalition government of national unity that includes opposition groups will be formed. Mr Mnangagwa confirmed in his speech that elections would be held as planned. What next for Zimbabwe?

"There has been a big fall in the number of workers starting apprenticeships in England since the introduction of the government's levy scheme earlier this year. The levy was supposed to increase the number of people training at work. But according to Department for Education figures, at the end of this academic year, between May and July, 48,000 people began an apprenticeship. That was less than half the 117,000 for the same period last year. The levy was introduced to raise Â£2.5bn a year for training and is payable by any organisation with a  wage bill over Â£3m. The government estimated that it would affect 2% of businesses. The levy applies to all UK employers; however Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland manage their own apprenticeship schemes. The aim is to fund up to three million new apprenticeships and the government has said it will ""support productivity growth through the increase in training"". Most firms are not large enough to be liable for the levy. However medium-sized firms with wage bills under Â£3m, that employ between 50 and 200 staff, are also faced with new responsibilities. They include releasing apprentices for one day a week for off-site training and contributing some of the training costs, which has made apprenticeships less popular. Apprenticeships: 'The money puts people off' Apprentices plan 'poor value for money' The DfE says it had expected there would be an initial drop-off in the number of people starting apprenticeships following the introduction of the levy. Employers paying the levy have 24 months to spend funds earmarked for apprenticeships, the DfE said, so they are taking time to formulate new schemes. Robert Halfon, who was apprenticeships and skills minister at the Department for Education until the reshuffle in June, said: ""Initially the number of starts has gone down, but I suspect over the coming year they will go back up again."" However, many industry experts say the scheme has been badly organised. ""The policy intent was great, the implementation has been diabolical,"" says Mark Dawe, chief executive of the Association of Employment and Learning Providers (AELP), whose members include independent trainers, employers and further education colleges. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development's (CIPD) skills adviser Lizzie Crowley, said 98% of firms were not large enough to be liable for the levy. But she said these companies were being put off offering more apprenticeships by the cost of releasing the trainees for one day a week and having to shoulder 10% of their off-site training fees ""whereas previously the vast majority would have received this free of charge"". The AELP said it had already made clear to the government what needed to be done to increase the number of apprenticeships. ""There needs to be appropriate flexibility of off-the-job training. In addition, employers without levy funding should not be charged for training 16-24 year old apprentices,"" said Mr Dawe. ""Without these actions, we do not believe the government will reach their manifesto commitment."" Verity Davidge, head of education and skills policy at the manufacturers' organisation the EEF, said some members had been ""left frustrated that the introduction of the levy has in, some cases, resulted in them being unable to offer and deliver apprenticeships"". Ms Davidge described the 59% drop in apprenticeships as ""shocking"" but added that it was ""frankly unsurprising as we continue to hear stories from companies who have hit a brick wall in trying to get levy-supported apprenticeships off the ground"". ""Accessing the funding has proven complex and difficult to unlock in time, and employers have struggled to get their heads around the complex rules and restrictions in accessing funds,"" she said. ""As a result some apprentices have been told that their apprenticeship has been put on hold for now, which is clearly a huge disappointment for young people who had effectively been offered a job - only to have their hopes dashed.""

"A Budget has been delivered by Chancellor Philip Hammond which he says will ""help families to cope with the cost of living"". The chancellor has announced plans on tax, housing and travel, alongside an update on the UK's economic position. Here is what it means for you. The stand out feature ofthe Budgetfor first-time buyers living in England, Northern Ireland and, for a time, in Wales is an immediate abolition of stamp duty when buying properties of up to Â£300,000. For properties costing up to Â£500,000, no stamp duty will be paid on the first Â£300,000. The starting point for paying stamp duty in England was Â£125,000. According to the Halifax, the average first-time buyer in the UK had paid about Â£1,660 in stamp duty, on a property costing Â£211,980. However, in many parts of the country first-time buyers pay relatively little in stamp duty. In the North of England, the typical first-time buyer saving would be Â£24, the lender said. The effect will be felt the most in the South East of England where the average home bought by a first-time buyer could save Â£3,948, and in London with a saving of Â£5,000. The Office For Budget Responsibility also pointed out that a subsequent rise in house prices would more than cancel out the benefit from the stamp duty measures, and it will primarily assist existing homeowners, with only an additional 3,500 first-time buyer sales at a significant cost to the Treasury. It does not affect the biggest up-front cost for first-time buyers - the deposit. In the UK, the average deposit is Â£37,101, according to the Halifax. If a couple are buying and only one is a first-time buyer, then they do not get the tax break. It also will do nothing for those trading up, whose numbers have fallen sharply in the last 10 years, or potential downsizers who are put off by the stamp duty cost. Housing is a devolved issue, so there are different rules in the different nations. In Scotland, the equivalent tax is called Land and Buildings Transaction Tax. Here the tax is levied on buyers purchasing homes costing more than Â£145,000 - the same as the average house price for all buyers. New rates havealready been set in Wales for next April, with a starting point tax of 2.5% on properties of more than Â£150,000. The average home in Wales cost Â£153,000 in September, official figures show. The changes announced in the Budget will take effect until then. Scotland and Wales will need to decide whether they follow this measure in England. Northern Ireland, which has the same stamp duty rates as England, has an average house price of Â£132,000. Mr Hammond announced measures that he said would see 300,000 new homes built a year by the mid-2020s. He had signalled this change earlier in the week. Local authorities will be able to increase the council tax premium on empty homes from 50% to 100% ""to encourage owners of empty homes to bring their properties back into use"". Budget calculator At a glance summary: Budget key points Live: Budget reaction and analysis Stamp duty changes explained At present 31 million people pay income tax in the UK. Nearly 26 million of those pay at the basic rate. The amount earned before income tax is paid - called the personal allowance - will rise from Â£11,500 to Â£11,850 in April. This will cut less than Â£100 a year off a basic rate taxpayer's annual bill. It was a Conservative manifesto pledge to increase the personal allowance to Â£12,500 by 2020-21. The higher rate is paid by 5.2 million people. The threshold will rise from Â£45,000 to Â£46,350. The government has already pledged to increase this to Â£50,000 by 2020-21. The threshold is different in Scotland (owing to devolved powers) where it is Â£43,000. The Scottish government will announce its intentions for these rates in December. Universal credit is a new benefit for working-age people, replacing six benefits and merging them into one payment. They are Income Support, income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, income-related employment and support allowance, Housing Benefit, Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit. Currently people typically have to wait six weeks for their first payment and one in five wait longer. The chancellor announced various measures to tackle some of the issues raised in a concerted campaign from charities and many MPs. This is likely to cut a week off this wait. New Universal Credit claimants in receipt of Housing Benefit will now continue to receive it for two weeks. The duty on beer, cider and spirits has been frozen this time, although there will be an increase on some high-strength drinks, including some white ciders. There was a 2p increase on a pint of beer and 1p increase in cider announced in the Spring Budget. A bottle of Scotch whisky was increased by 36p in March. The chancellor has now announced an additional duty on hand-rolling tobacco, on top of the previously announced inflation plus 2% rise in tobacco duty which would push up the cost of a packet of 20 cigarettes by 28p. Fuel duty has been frozen again, a move that will be welcomed by many drivers. Many drivers of new diesel cars will see an increase in the road tax they pay in the first year of owning their car from April. They will be levied on one band higher than those with petrol cars, owing to the environmental effect of this type of fuel. This will amount to only about Â£20 for smaller cars, and Â£300 for larger cars, Treasury figures show. At present, there is a sliding scale of charges for the first year of ownership and after that petrol or diesel vehicles are subject to a ""standard"" rate of Â£140 a year. Only those diesel vehicles that do not meet the very latest European emissions standards will be affected. The existing diesel supplement in company car tax is also going up, and there will be less of a tax impact for those who charge up their electric car at work, The government has said people up to 30 years-old will be able to buy a Â£30 railcard for discounted train travel from next spring - an extension of the current young person's railcard for those aged 16 to 25. The so called millennials' card will be available from spring next year, and offer up to a third off non-peak fares, which usually apply on services after 10am. The 3% rise in the state pension in April has been confirmed, amounting to Â£3.65 extra a week. As is usually the case, this is in line with inflation, which measures the cost of living, in September. Changes already earmarked for next April and subsequent financial years include: Many working-age benefits will be halfway through a four-year freeze by April. These include Jobseeker's Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, some types of Housing Benefit, and Child Benefit. However, state pensions, Maternity Pay and some disability benefits are excluded. This is on course to save the Treasury Â£4.6bn, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) The gradual process allowing people to pass on property to their descendantsfree from some inheritance taxwill enter its second year. It will reach its target by 2021 Many buy-to-let landlords are seeing the amount oftax relief that they can claim on mortgage interest paymentscut over the course of four years. The process began in April. Eventually, they will only be able to claim at the lower rate of tax, not the higher Director shareholders will see a tax break reduced on the dividends they receive. The tax-free dividend allowance - which came into force in 2016 - will be reduced from Â£5,000 to Â£2,000 from April. That will affect those who own a small business and pay themselves in dividends alongside a small salary and people with large portfolios of shares, perhaps by hundreds of pounds Public sector pay in England and Wales was frozen for two years in 2010, except for those earning less than Â£21,000 a year, and since 2013, rises have been capped at 1% At-a-glance summary: Budget key points Budget 2017: Your questions answered Richer or poorer?

"The claim:Changes to stamp duty will save an average of Â£1,700 to first-time buyers. Reality Check verdict:The average first-time buyer would indeed save about Â£1,700 in stamp duty, but for some people it's likely that would be more than offset by increased house prices, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which provides independent assessments of the Budget. It's likely to be better news for potential first-time buyers struggling to get together a deposit than for those unable to borrow enough as a result of their earnings. Chancellor Philip Hammond has abolished stamp duty on homes costing less than Â£300,000, with reduced rates up to Â£500,000. You can read about the full details of the policywith the variations around the UK here. A first-time buyer purchasing a Â£500,000 property, who would previously have paid Â£15,000 in stamp duty, will now pay Â£10,000, while someone buying a property for Â£300,000, who would previously have faced a stamp duty bill of Â£5,000, will now not pay anything. The chancellor told BBC News that the average saving for first-time buyers would be Â£1,700 - that is the amount of stamp duty that would previously have been payable on the average property bought by first-time buyers,according to the Halifax.,external But forecasts from thejudgement of the OBR,externalsuggest that the benefits would come to existing homeowners and not first-time buyers because house prices are likely to rise by 0.3%. This policy is part of a package of measures designed to help first-time buyers to access the housing market. To understand whether it is a good thing, it is useful to think about two key reasons why people might be struggling to buy houses. One possibility is that people are struggling to raise enough money for a deposit. Most mortgages require the borrower to put up a minimum proportion of the purchase price - 5% or 10% for example. If somebody is struggling to get together a deposit, then being able to spend the Â£5,000 they had earmarked for stamp duty on the deposit instead, for example, will be useful and also may increase the amount they can borrow, which will mean they can buy a property they may not have been able to in other circumstances. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) stressed that while house prices might have risen, this sort of buyer would end up with a more valuable asset, even if only as a result of the new stamp duty policy. ""The price goes up, but the other impact it has is that it allows first-time buyers the ability to purchase properties that they otherwise wouldn't have been able to afford,"" OBR chairman Robert Chote toldthe BBC's Daily Politics. Another possibility is that people have saved up their deposit but their earnings are not high enough for a mortgage provider to be prepared to lend them enough money to buy a suitable property. This policy will not be good for them if house prices rise as the OBR suggested. It said that house prices could go up by twice as much as the stamp duty saving because of the extra borrowing made possible for some people by having a bigger deposit. The OBR also quoted HMRC's verdict on the similar stamp duty holiday after the financial crisis, which was that it ""has not had a significant impact in terms of improving the affordability of residential property for first-time buyers"". This point about rising prices was put to the chancellor onthe Today programme,but he said this was looking at the stamp duty change in isolation without the effect on the market of the 300,000 net homes per year that the government plans to build in England by the middle of the next decade. There has been some doubt about the government's ability to achieve this target, not least from the OBR, which has not made any adjustments to its forecasts for housing starts. It said: ""Governments have announced a number of initiatives aimed at overcoming housing supply constraints,"" referring for example tothe National Planning Policy Framework from 2012.

"Finland recently lifted a ban on the use of insects in food A Finnish bakery is to offer bread made from crushed crickets in a move that is hoped will help tackle world hunger. Fazer Bakery in Finland said the product, available in its stores from Friday, was the first of its kind. Each loaf produced will contain about 70 crickets that have been dried and ground, and then mixed with flour, wheat and other seeds. In 2013, the United Nationsestimated that at least 2 billion people eat insects worldwide,external. According to the UN, more than 1,900 species of insect are used for food. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) began a programme in 2013 to encourage the breeding and consumption of insects. Juhani Sibakov, head of innovation at Fazer, said the concept had been in development since last summer, but it could not be launched until approved by Finnish authorities. Watch: Should we eat bugs like Angelina Jolie? Earlier this month Finland lifted a ban on the sale of insects raised and marketed for food use. Five other European countries - the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria and Denmark - already allow this. Each loaf of bread contains about 70 crickets, which have been imported from the Netherlands Mr Sibakov said the bread contains more protein than normal wheat bread. ""It offers consumers a good protein source and also gives them an easy way to familiarise themselves with insect-based food,"" he said. The bread will be rolled out initially in stores in the Finnish capital, Helsinki. Sara Koivisto, a student there, said she ""couldn't taste the difference"", adding: ""It tastes like bread."" Fazer, which imports the cricket ingredients from the Netherlands, only has a limited supply. However it said it was working to find a local supplier. In many parts of the world, insect-eating is common. In the West, edible bugs are becoming more popular with those who want a gluten-free diet or to protect the environment. Farming insects may use less resources than farming animals. Should we eat bugs like Angelina Jolie? Insects - a future sustainable food? Would you eat bugs instead of meat?

"The victims were, from left, Mark McGrotty, 12, and Evan McGrotty, 8, Sean McGrotty, 49, Ruth Daniels, 57, and Jodie Lee Daniels, 14 Five members of a Londonderry family whose car went into Lough Swilly from a slipway drowned due to misadventure, a coroner inquest jury has found. The Buncrana pier tragedy took the lives of Sean McGrotty, his sons Mark and Evan, his partner's mother, Ruth Daniels and her daughter, Jodie Lee. Mr McGrotty handed his baby daughter to a rescuer moments before the Audi Q7 sank in March 2016. Family member Louise James said it was an ""accident waiting to happen"". The gate on the slipway ""should have been closed"", said Ms James, who was Mr McGrotty's partner, Mark and Evan's mother, Mrs Daniel's daughter and Jodie-Lee's sister. The couple's four-month-old daughter Rionaghac-Ann was the sole survivor. Ms James said there were ""no words capable of expressing my pain, my disbelief and indeed my anger over what happened on that fateful day"". She said her heart was ""shattered"". Davitt Walsh, a former footballer who rescued the infant after swimming out to help the family, ""was an ordinary man who did an extraordinary thing"", the inquest heard on Thursday. Mr Walsh tried to save another child but said he appeared to ""get stuck"" on something. Irish police inspector David Murphy also paid tribute to gardaÃ­ rescuers who arrived on the scene within minutes. He hoped the conclusion of the inquest would go some way to aiding the grieving process for the relatives of those who died, added Insp Murphy. A pathologist told the inquest Sean McGrottyhad a blood alcohol level of 159mg - three times over the Republic of Ireland's drink-drive limit. On Thursday, an RNLI volunteer diver told the inquest that he could not open the doors of the vehicle when it was under the water. John O'Raw said the water was about three metres deep and visibility was an issue. The incident was one of the worst family tragedies along the Irish coastline, the coroner says Mr O'Raw told the inquest he entered the water about 40 minutes after the alarm was raised. On the second day of the inquest in Buncrana, Mr O'Raw recalled how his pager beeped at 19:13 GMT that day. When he got to the scene 17 minutes later, he saw colleagues performing CPR on a woman. He returned home to get snorkelling equipment and entered the water at 19:55. The RNLI volunteer said he tried to open the rear passenger door and the handle came freely, but the mechanism to open the door was not working. ""I couldn't get the door open,"" he said. ""I went to the passenger side front door and it was exactly the same. I told recovery I couldn't get the doors open."" He added: ""I tried the rear driver's side door, and then tried front driver's door but neither would open. The driver's window was half intact and was bowed facing inwards, into the car. ""I couldn't understand what I was seeing. The tailgate at the back of the vehicle was open."" Mr O'Raw said he could get his ""head in through the window and could see there was no one in the two front seats"". He said, it was his opinion, that because the window was broken and the tailgate was open, the water pressure would have been the same inside and outside the vehicle so the doors should have been able to open. The coroner said there would be some resistance, akin to opening a door into wind. Louise James (centre) was present on the opening day of the inquest Garda Seamus Callaghan told the inquest when he arrived at the scene the RNLI were performing CPR on Ruth Daniels. He said four bodies were recovered in a relatively short space of time and a local priest said prayers over each of the victims. Garda Callaghan told the inquest the slipway was ""extremely slippery with thick algae"". Garda Damien Mulcairns told the inquest he inspected the car, an Audi Q7, the following day at a garage in Letterkenny. He said the car was in road-worthy condition before the incident and he had no issue with opening all the doors in the car from the outside and from the inside. Garda Mulcairns said the driver's side window was shattered, but intact with lamination, which is a common safety aspect in modern vehicles. He said it would have taken considerable force to break the glass. Garda Mulcairns said central locking was operated both mechanically and electronically. In his opinion, any electrical component submerged in water would not react in the same way, he said. On the first day of the inquest,Dr Catriona Dillon, the pathologist who carried out the post-mortem examination on Mr McGrotty, told the inquest his blood-alcohol reading ""may indicate a level of intoxication"".

"There has been a big fall in the number of workers starting apprenticeships in England since the introduction of the government's levy scheme earlier this year. The levy was supposed to increase the number of people training at work. But according to Department for Education figures, at the end of this academic year, between May and July, 48,000 people began an apprenticeship. That was less than half the 117,000 for the same period last year. The levy was introduced to raise Â£2.5bn a year for training and is payable by any organisation with a  wage bill over Â£3m. The government estimated that it would affect 2% of businesses. The levy applies to all UK employers; however Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland manage their own apprenticeship schemes. The aim is to fund up to three million new apprenticeships and the government has said it will ""support productivity growth through the increase in training"". Most firms are not large enough to be liable for the levy. However medium-sized firms with wage bills under Â£3m, that employ between 50 and 200 staff, are also faced with new responsibilities. They include releasing apprentices for one day a week for off-site training and contributing some of the training costs, which has made apprenticeships less popular. Apprenticeships: 'The money puts people off' Apprentices plan 'poor value for money' The DfE says it had expected there would be an initial drop-off in the number of people starting apprenticeships following the introduction of the levy. Employers paying the levy have 24 months to spend funds earmarked for apprenticeships, the DfE said, so they are taking time to formulate new schemes. Robert Halfon, who was apprenticeships and skills minister at the Department for Education until the reshuffle in June, said: ""Initially the number of starts has gone down, but I suspect over the coming year they will go back up again."" However, many industry experts say the scheme has been badly organised. ""The policy intent was great, the implementation has been diabolical,"" says Mark Dawe, chief executive of the Association of Employment and Learning Providers (AELP), whose members include independent trainers, employers and further education colleges. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development's (CIPD) skills adviser Lizzie Crowley, said 98% of firms were not large enough to be liable for the levy. But she said these companies were being put off offering more apprenticeships by the cost of releasing the trainees for one day a week and having to shoulder 10% of their off-site training fees ""whereas previously the vast majority would have received this free of charge"". The AELP said it had already made clear to the government what needed to be done to increase the number of apprenticeships. ""There needs to be appropriate flexibility of off-the-job training. In addition, employers without levy funding should not be charged for training 16-24 year old apprentices,"" said Mr Dawe. ""Without these actions, we do not believe the government will reach their manifesto commitment."" Verity Davidge, head of education and skills policy at the manufacturers' organisation the EEF, said some members had been ""left frustrated that the introduction of the levy has in, some cases, resulted in them being unable to offer and deliver apprenticeships"". Ms Davidge described the 59% drop in apprenticeships as ""shocking"" but added that it was ""frankly unsurprising as we continue to hear stories from companies who have hit a brick wall in trying to get levy-supported apprenticeships off the ground"". ""Accessing the funding has proven complex and difficult to unlock in time, and employers have struggled to get their heads around the complex rules and restrictions in accessing funds,"" she said. ""As a result some apprentices have been told that their apprenticeship has been put on hold for now, which is clearly a huge disappointment for young people who had effectively been offered a job - only to have their hopes dashed.""

"This is an image of the Big Bird lineage, which arose through the breeding of two distinct parent species: G. fortis and G. conirostris A population of finches on the Galapagos has been discovered in the process of becoming a new species. This is the first example of speciation that scientists have been able to observe directly in the field. Researchers followed the entire population of finches on a tiny Galapagos island called Daphne Major, for many years, and so they were able to watch the speciation in progress. The research waspublished in the journal Science.,external The group of finch species to which the Big Bird population belongs are collectively known as Darwin's finches and helped Charles Darwin to uncover the process of evolution by natural selection. In 1981, the researchers noticed the arrival of a male of a non-native species, the large cactus finch. Professors Rosemary and Peter Grant noticed that this male proceeded to mate with a female of one of the local species, a medium ground finch, producing fertile young. Almost 40 years later, the progeny of that original mating are still being observed, and number around 30 individuals. ""It's an extreme case of something we're coming to realise more generally over the years. Evolution in general can happen very quickly,"" said Prof Roger Butlin, a speciation expert who wasn't involved in the study. This new finch population is sufficiently different in form and habits to the native birds, as to be marked out as a new species, and individuals from the different populations don't interbreed. Prof Butlin told the BBC that people working on speciation credit the Grant professors with altering our understanding of rapid evolutionary change in the field. In the past, it was thought that two different species must be unable to produce fertile offspring in order to be defined as such.  But in more recent years, it has been established that many birds and other animals that we consider to be unique species are in fact able to interbreed with others to produce fertile young. ""We tend not to argue about what defines a species anymore, because that doesn't get you anywhere,"" said Prof Butlin. What he says is more interesting is understanding the role that hybridisation can have in the process of creating new species, which is why this observation of Galapagos finches is so important. The researchers think that the original male must have flown 65 miles from the large cactus finches' home island of EspaÃ±ola. That's a very long way for a small finch to fly, and so it would be very unlikely for the bird to make a successful return flight. A member of the G. fortis species, one of two that interbred to give rise to the Big Bird lineage A finch belonging to the G. conirostris species. It's the other half of the pairing that gave rise to the Big Bird population By identifying one way that new species can arise, and following the entire population, the researchers state this as an example of speciation occurring in a timescale we can observe. In most cases, the offspring of cross-species matings are poorly adapted to their environment. But in this instance, the new finches on Daphne Major are larger than other species on the island, and have taken hold of new and unexploited food. For this reason, the researchers are calling the animals the ""Big Bird population"". To scientifically test whether the Big Bird population was genetically distinct from the three species of finch native to the island, Peter and Rosemary Grant collaborated with Prof Leif Andersson of Sweden's Uppsala University who analysed the population genetically for the new study. Prof Andersson told BBC News: ""The surprise was that we would expect the hybrid would start to breed with one of the other species on the island and be absorbedâ¦ we have confirmed that they are a closed breeding group."" Due to an inability to recognise the songs of the new males, native females won't pair with this new species. The finches led Darwin to his theory of natural selection, as outlined in On The Origin of Species And in this paper, new genetic evidence shows that after two generations, there was complete reproductive isolation from the native birds. As a result, they are now reproductively - and genetically - isolated. So they have been breeding exclusively with each other over the years. ""What we are saying is that this group of birds behave as a distinct species. If you didn't know anything about [Daphne Major's] history and a taxonomist arrived on this island they would say there are four species on this island,"" said Prof Andersson. There is no evidence that they will breed again with the native medium ground finch, but even if they did, they now have a larger size and can exploit new opportunities. Those advantageous traits may be maintained by natural selection. So hybridisation can lead to speciation, simply through the addition of one individual to a population.  It may therefore be a way for new traits to evolve quickly. ""If you just wait for mutations causing one change at a time, then it would make it more difficult to raise a new species that way. But hybridisation may be more effective than mutation,"" said Prof Butlin.

"The former political editor of the Sun wrote the article in August The UK's press regulator has dismissed a complaint against the Sun for a column that referred to ""the Muslim Problem"". The Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) ruled Trevor Kavanagh's column was ""capable of causing serious offence"" but did not breach the Editors' Code. Mr Kavanagh said it was ""acceptable to say Muslims are a specific rather than a cultural problem"". The Sun said he had already apologised. The regulator said the comment could be compared to language used at the time of the Holocaust. But a spokesman for The Sun said: ""[He] didn't realise that his words could be compared to the phrase 'the Jewish Problem'."" IPSO said the former political editor, who is also a member of the regulatory board, played no part in the adjudication. It saidthe article,externalhad not discriminated against an individual and could not be mistaken for fact. Mr Kavanagh's column was published after the conviction, in August, of 18 people in Newcastle for being involved in a child sex abuse network. He said there was ""one unspoken fear, gagged by political correctness,"" adding that ""the common denominator, almost unsayable until last week's furore over Pakistani sex gangs, is Islam"". IPSO noted ""it was inaccurate to refer to female genital mutilation and 'honour' killings as examples of 'Muslim sex crimes'. The regulator said despite many being offended by the article, there was no clause in the code which ""prohibits publication of offensive content"". When it was published, the article was condemned in an open letter signed by more than 100 MPs. The ruling comes afterformer Labour minister Sarah Champion quit the party's front benchfollowing the publication of an article which appeared in the same edition as Mr Kavanagh's comments. Miqdaad Versi, assistant general secretary of the Muslim Council of Britain said the decision was ""deeply disappointing, albeit not unexpected"". ""What is truly astonishing is that regardless of the specifics of the Code, IPSO does not seem to have any concern that one of its board members used this Nazi-like phrase about Muslims."" The Board of Deputies of British Jews said the decision suggested IPSO was ""unfit for purpose"" and called for a review of the code.

"Emile Cilliers denied attempting to murder Victoria Cilliers on 5 April 2015 An Army sergeant accused of trying to kill his wife is set to face a retrial after a jury failed to reach a verdict. Emile Cilliers denied tampering with Victoria Cilliers' parachute at Netheravon Airfield, Wiltshire, where she suffered near-fatal injuries in 2015. Mr Cilliers, 37, faced two charges of attempted murder and another of criminal damage. Jurors were discharged after a seven-week trial at Winchester Crown Court. Parachuting instructor Mrs Cilliers, 40, survived a 4,000ft fall on Easter Sunday when both her main and reserve parachutes failed. Prosecutors also claimed the defendant made another attempt to kill her by deliberately causing a gas leak in the family home days before the fall. The Crown Prosecution Service has said it will seek a retrial on all three charges. Jurors began deliberations last Tuesday. A week later, after they had discussed the case for more than 23 hours, judge Mr Justice Sweeney told them he would accept a majority verdict. Two jurors, including the forewoman, fell ill and were released after the judge issued the direction. After the remaining jurors had deliberated for about 30 hours, the judge thanked them for their hard work. He told them: ""It has been a long case which you have been required to work very hard on over a long period."" Mr Cilliers was released on conditional bail until the retrial.

The title of European Capital of Culture rotates around eligible countries. Cities from non-EU countries have held the title before - but if a country isn't in the EU, it must be a candidate to join or must be in the European Free Trade Association or European Economic Area. A spokeswoman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said the government was in ""urgent discussions"" with the commission about the decision. ""We disagree with the European Commission's stance and are deeply disappointed that it has waited until after UK cities have submitted their final bids before communicating this new position to us,"" a statement said. ""The prime minister has been clear that while we are leaving the EU, we are not leaving Europe and this has been welcomed by EU leaders."" Dundee's bid team called it ""a bombshell for all of us"" The statement said the government wants the UK to continue ""working with our friends in Europe"", including in cultural programmes, and will work with the bidders to ""help them realise their cultural ambitions"".

""The timing is disrespectful not only to the citizens of Dundee, but to people from all five bidding cities who have devoted so much time, effort and energy so far in this competition,"" a spokesman said. ""It's a sad irony that one of the key drivers of our bid was a desire to further enhance our cultural links with Europe."" A statement from the Nottingham bid said they hoped the situation ""can be resolved positively"" The Leeds bid has cost Â£1m over the past four years - Â£200,000 from the city council and Â£800,000 from private funders. Hilary Benn, MP for Leeds Central and head of the House of Commons Select Committee for leaving the EU, said: ""This is a terrible blow and has come completely out of the blue. ""It's particularly extraordinary especially as the bids have just gone in. ""And to wait until all the work had gone in and turn around and say, 'You can't do this' - it's shoddy treatment of Leeds and the other cities have worked so hard.""

"Jon Venables was 10 when he and Robert Thompson killed James Bulger One of the killers of toddler James Bulger has been recalled to prison suspected of having child abuse images on his computer. It is the second time Jon Venables has been sent back to jail for the same suspected offence. In a statement, James's mother Denise Fergus said: ""Venables has now proved beyond any doubt what a vile, perverted psychopath he has always been."" The 35-year-old was recalled last week but has not yet been charged. He was first recalled in 2010, following his release in 2001 after serving eight years for the murder of James, aged two, in 1993. James Bulger was two when he was abducted and killed in 1993 Ms Fergus went on to say: ""I predicted Venables would re-offend unless they kept a very tight rein on him and I pray that now, someone from the UK government will finally listen to me."" She said ""what hurts me most is the way the probation service has tried to cover this up"", adding she was only told on Wednesday night that Venables was taken back into custody a week ago. Mrs Fergus said it was ""clear that they were trying to keep this quiet, until they got a call from the media"". She said she received ""a hurried call"" from the probation service at 20:40 GMT with ""few details given, just that he had breached his terms of the licence and returned to prison"", which left her ""extremely upset, angry and feeling insulted"". She said she would consider making a formal complaint to the probation service. Denise Fergus ""feared"" Venables would re-offend A Ministry of Justice (MoJ) spokeswoman said it takes the duty of updating victims' families ""extremely seriously"". ""A dedicated victim liaison officer contacts families as soon as the offender is charged, but we regret the additional distress this has caused in this case. ""We want to reassure Mrs Fergus and Mr Bulger [James's father] that a liaison officer will continue to stay in regular contact with them as the case progresses."" On 12 February 1993, James - just a few weeks short of his third birthday - was reported missing by his mother from outside a butcher's shop in the New Strand Shopping Centre in Bootle, Merseyside. CCTV images showed James Bulger being led away by the two boys in a shopping centre CCTV images revealed he had been lured away by Venables and Robert Thompson, both then aged 10. His body was found two days later on a railway line. He had been stripped from the waist down, paint had been thrown in his eyes and he had been beaten to death with bricks and a metal bar. Thompson and Venables were arrested and charged within days. They were both convicted at Preston Crown Court of James's murder, in November 1993. In 2001, the pair were released - with new identities - from secure children's homes on life licence, meaning they can be recalled at any time. What appear to be images of child abuse were found on a computer linked to Jon Venables last week, during a routine visit. He was recalled to prison immediately. The police force investigating him has not been named, as it might reveal where he has been living under a second new identity. Venables was jailed for life in 1993 for murdering and torturing two-year-old James Bulger. He was first released - on licence - in 2001, but jailed again in 2010 for possession of child abuse images. He was released a second time in 2013, at which point James Bulger's parents said they were ""filled with terror"". The parole board will now have to decide whether - or when - it is safe to release him again, and will take into account if he appears to be re-offending in a similar vein. Venables was recalled to prison in 2010 after accessing images of child abuse and breaching his parole conditions by visiting Merseyside.

"This is an image of the Big Bird lineage, which arose through the breeding of two distinct parent species: G. fortis and G. conirostris A population of finches on the Galapagos has been discovered in the process of becoming a new species. This is the first example of speciation that scientists have been able to observe directly in the field. Researchers followed the entire population of finches on a tiny Galapagos island called Daphne Major, for many years, and so they were able to watch the speciation in progress. The research waspublished in the journal Science.,external The group of finch species to which the Big Bird population belongs are collectively known as Darwin's finches and helped Charles Darwin to uncover the process of evolution by natural selection. In 1981, the researchers noticed the arrival of a male of a non-native species, the large cactus finch. Professors Rosemary and Peter Grant noticed that this male proceeded to mate with a female of one of the local species, a medium ground finch, producing fertile young. Almost 40 years later, the progeny of that original mating are still being observed, and number around 30 individuals. ""It's an extreme case of something we're coming to realise more generally over the years. Evolution in general can happen very quickly,"" said Prof Roger Butlin, a speciation expert who wasn't involved in the study. This new finch population is sufficiently different in form and habits to the native birds, as to be marked out as a new species, and individuals from the different populations don't interbreed. Prof Butlin told the BBC that people working on speciation credit the Grant professors with altering our understanding of rapid evolutionary change in the field. In the past, it was thought that two different species must be unable to produce fertile offspring in order to be defined as such.  But in more recent years, it has been established that many birds and other animals that we consider to be unique species are in fact able to interbreed with others to produce fertile young. ""We tend not to argue about what defines a species anymore, because that doesn't get you anywhere,"" said Prof Butlin. What he says is more interesting is understanding the role that hybridisation can have in the process of creating new species, which is why this observation of Galapagos finches is so important. The researchers think that the original male must have flown 65 miles from the large cactus finches' home island of EspaÃ±ola. That's a very long way for a small finch to fly, and so it would be very unlikely for the bird to make a successful return flight. A member of the G. fortis species, one of two that interbred to give rise to the Big Bird lineage A finch belonging to the G. conirostris species. It's the other half of the pairing that gave rise to the Big Bird population By identifying one way that new species can arise, and following the entire population, the researchers state this as an example of speciation occurring in a timescale we can observe. In most cases, the offspring of cross-species matings are poorly adapted to their environment. But in this instance, the new finches on Daphne Major are larger than other species on the island, and have taken hold of new and unexploited food. For this reason, the researchers are calling the animals the ""Big Bird population"". To scientifically test whether the Big Bird population was genetically distinct from the three species of finch native to the island, Peter and Rosemary Grant collaborated with Prof Leif Andersson of Sweden's Uppsala University who analysed the population genetically for the new study. Prof Andersson told BBC News: ""The surprise was that we would expect the hybrid would start to breed with one of the other species on the island and be absorbedâ¦ we have confirmed that they are a closed breeding group."" Due to an inability to recognise the songs of the new males, native females won't pair with this new species. The finches led Darwin to his theory of natural selection, as outlined in On The Origin of Species And in this paper, new genetic evidence shows that after two generations, there was complete reproductive isolation from the native birds. As a result, they are now reproductively - and genetically - isolated. So they have been breeding exclusively with each other over the years. ""What we are saying is that this group of birds behave as a distinct species. If you didn't know anything about [Daphne Major's] history and a taxonomist arrived on this island they would say there are four species on this island,"" said Prof Andersson. There is no evidence that they will breed again with the native medium ground finch, but even if they did, they now have a larger size and can exploit new opportunities. Those advantageous traits may be maintained by natural selection. So hybridisation can lead to speciation, simply through the addition of one individual to a population.  It may therefore be a way for new traits to evolve quickly. ""If you just wait for mutations causing one change at a time, then it would make it more difficult to raise a new species that way. But hybridisation may be more effective than mutation,"" said Prof Butlin.

"Emile Cilliers denied attempting to murder Victoria Cilliers on 5 April 2015 An Army sergeant accused of trying to kill his wife is set to face a retrial after a jury failed to reach a verdict. Emile Cilliers denied tampering with Victoria Cilliers' parachute at Netheravon Airfield, Wiltshire, where she suffered near-fatal injuries in 2015. Mr Cilliers, 37, faced two charges of attempted murder and another of criminal damage. Jurors were discharged after a seven-week trial at Winchester Crown Court. Parachuting instructor Mrs Cilliers, 40, survived a 4,000ft fall on Easter Sunday when both her main and reserve parachutes failed. Prosecutors also claimed the defendant made another attempt to kill her by deliberately causing a gas leak in the family home days before the fall. The Crown Prosecution Service has said it will seek a retrial on all three charges. Jurors began deliberations last Tuesday. A week later, after they had discussed the case for more than 23 hours, judge Mr Justice Sweeney told them he would accept a majority verdict. Two jurors, including the forewoman, fell ill and were released after the judge issued the direction. After the remaining jurors had deliberated for about 30 hours, the judge thanked them for their hard work. He told them: ""It has been a long case which you have been required to work very hard on over a long period."" Mr Cilliers was released on conditional bail until the retrial.

"Rita Ora has revealed on an Australian television show that she had her eggs frozen in her early 20s. The British singer, now 26, said her doctor recommended the procedure as she had ""always wanted a big family"". ""He said 'you are healthy now and it would be great, why not put them away and then you never have to worry about it again?',"" she said. Dr Helen O'Neill, of University College London, said: ""The earlier you freeze your eggs the better."" But it's not an ""absolute guarantee"" for pregnancy and many young people can't afford the cost of Â£5,000 per cycle. Dr O'Neill said: ""The benefits (of egg freezing) are that you are taking your fertility into your own hands. If you're checked and you have a low fertility, it's best to act early."" She said there is a huge decline in the quality of eggs after a woman reaches the age of 30 - and that it continues to decline. ""Unfortunately the prime age people start to freeze their eggs is 35, which is a little bit too late,"" she explained. In the UK, the number of women storing their eggs has increased substantially. In 2014, 816 women froze some eggs for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) later, up 25% on 2013, according to the latest figures from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which regulates the industry. London Women's Clinic in Harley Streetrecently reportedthat the number of women attending its fertility clinics has tripled in the past three years. Single Chinese women want to freeze their eggs and enjoy life Women graduates 'desperately' freeze eggs over 'lack of men' Freezing my eggs 'helped me after rape' The birth rate for using frozen eggs was about 14% in 2013, according to the HFEA. The rate was lower for women over 38. Dr O'Neill said there are comparable success rates between fresh and frozen eggs. ""Our most recent freezing really is excellent,"" she said. ""It should be promoted a lot more."" Prof Adam Balen, chairman of the British Fertility Society, told the BBC: ""Young women are freezing eggs in order to preserve fertility for the future, but have to understand not all eggs will survive the freezing process and be able to be fertilised. ""So it's not an absolute guarantee for pregnancy in the future. ""But the younger you freeze eggs the more fertile they are."" Ms Ora said she was already aware the process may not mean she would have a baby in the future and said: ""I know people might say, 'wow, that's so young'. I just wanted to really be safe.""

The title of European Capital of Culture rotates around eligible countries. Cities from non-EU countries have held the title before - but if a country isn't in the EU, it must be a candidate to join or must be in the European Free Trade Association or European Economic Area. A spokeswoman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said the government was in ""urgent discussions"" with the commission about the decision. ""We disagree with the European Commission's stance and are deeply disappointed that it has waited until after UK cities have submitted their final bids before communicating this new position to us,"" a statement said. ""The prime minister has been clear that while we are leaving the EU, we are not leaving Europe and this has been welcomed by EU leaders."" Dundee's bid team called it ""a bombshell for all of us"" The statement said the government wants the UK to continue ""working with our friends in Europe"", including in cultural programmes, and will work with the bidders to ""help them realise their cultural ambitions"". The Creative Industries Federation, which represents the arts sector, said: ""We are gutted to learn that the UK will not be allowed to host the European Capital of Culture as planned in 2023 after Brexit. ""This is despite the fact that cities in Europe that are outside the European Union have participated in the scheme historically."" It added that people were ""working feverishly behind the scenes to reverse this decision"". Danish chorus girls launched Aarhus as a European Capital of Culture in 2017 The federation's deputy chief executive Rosie Millard, who was to be among the contest's judges,wrote on Twitter,external: ""Very sad for the 5 bidding cities. I am on the judging panel & have seen all their hard work. #Brexitfallout"" Dundee's bid team called it ""a bombshell for all of us"", saying they were ""hugely disappointed"" that the decision had come days before they were due to make their pitch in London. ""The timing is disrespectful not only to the citizens of Dundee, but to people from all five bidding cities who have devoted so much time, effort and energy so far in this competition,"" a spokesman said. ""It's a sad irony that one of the key drivers of our bid was a desire to further enhance our cultural links with Europe."" A statement from the Nottingham bid said they hoped the situation ""can be resolved positively"" The Leeds bid has cost Â£1m over the past four years - Â£200,000 from the city council and Â£800,000 from private funders. Hilary Benn, MP for Leeds Central and head of the House of Commons Select Committee for leaving the EU, said: ""This is a terrible blow and has come completely out of the blue. ""It's particularly extraordinary especially as the bids have just gone in. ""And to wait until all the work had gone in and turn around and say, 'You can't do this' - it's shoddy treatment of Leeds and the other cities have worked so hard."" A Belfast City Council spokesman said they were ""deeply disappointed"" but wanted to make sure ""the time, energy, enthusiasm, ideas and resources put into our bid are carried forward regardless"". A statement from the Nottingham bid team said they hoped the situation ""can be resolved positively"" and Milton Keynes council leader Pete Marland said he remains ""hopeful that a compromise may be found in the future"". Three non-EU cities have previously held the title - Istanbul in 2010, Stavanger in Norway in 2008, and Reykjavik, Iceland, in 2000. Explaining the decision, a spokesman for the European Commission said: ""As one of the many concrete consequences of its decision to leave the European Union by 29 March 2019, the UK cannot host the European Capital of Culture in 2023. ""According to the rules adopted by the European Parliament and the Council (Decision 445/2014), this action is not open to third countries except candidate countries and European Free Trade Association/European Economic Area countries. ""Given that the UK will have left the EU by 29 March 2019, and therefore be unable to host the European Capital of Culture in 2023, we believe it makes common sense to discontinue the selection process now.""

"The former political editor of the Sun wrote the article in August The UK's press regulator has dismissed a complaint against the Sun for a column that referred to ""the Muslim Problem"". The Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) ruled Trevor Kavanagh's column was ""capable of causing serious offence"" but did not breach the Editors' Code. Mr Kavanagh said it was ""acceptable to say Muslims are a specific rather than a cultural problem"". The Sun said he had already apologised. The regulator said the comment could be compared to language used at the time of the Holocaust. But a spokesman for The Sun said: ""[He] didn't realise that his words could be compared to the phrase 'the Jewish Problem'."" IPSO said the former political editor, who is also a member of the regulatory board, played no part in the adjudication. It saidthe article,externalhad not discriminated against an individual and could not be mistaken for fact. Mr Kavanagh's column was published after the conviction, in August, of 18 people in Newcastle for being involved in a child sex abuse network.

On Thursday the party said it ""takes all allegations of sexual harassment extremely seriously"" and had suspended Mr Lewis pending an investigation. Mr Lewis said: ""I am deeply saddened to hear of my suspension ... I strongly dispute the allegations."" He added that he intended to ""co-operate fully"" with the party's investigation. Who are the MPs under scrutiny over conduct claims? It follows allegationsreported by Buzzfeed News,externalthat Mr Lewis had touched a woman's leg and invited her to his house at a Labour Party event in 2010. In a statement issued after the report earlier this month, Mr Lewis said he had never sexually harassed anyone but was sorry if his behaviour towards women he worked with had made anyone feel ""awkward"". He is one of a number of MPs who are being investigated over allegations about past conduct towards women. The MP has represented Bury South since 1997 and has served in various roles in the shadow cabinet, most recently as shadow Northern Ireland secretary until September 2015.

"The former political editor of the Sun wrote the article in August The UK's press regulator has dismissed a complaint against the Sun for a column that referred to ""the Muslim Problem"". The Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) ruled Trevor Kavanagh's column was ""capable of causing serious offence"" but did not breach the Editors' Code. Mr Kavanagh said it was ""acceptable to say Muslims are a specific rather than a cultural problem"". The Sun said he had already apologised. The regulator said the comment could be compared to language used at the time of the Holocaust. But a spokesman for The Sun said: ""[He] didn't realise that his words could be compared to the phrase 'the Jewish Problem'."" IPSO said the former political editor, who is also a member of the regulatory board, played no part in the adjudication.

"The leaked report details EU leaders' frustration with David Davis The government has refused to comment on a leaked report branding its approach to Brexit as ""chaotic"". The internal Irish government paper, obtained by RTÃ, documents EU figures' scathing assessments of cabinet members such as Brexit Secretary David Davis. A Czech minister is quoted as describing Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson as ""unimpressive"". The minister also warns of ""political confusion"" about the UK Government's approach to leaving the EU. Brexit: All you need to know Davis: We have compromised in EU talks Irish PM 'should know better' says Arlene Foster Downing Street said the government was working hard on its preparations for Brexit. It had ""a good and constructive"" relationship with the Irish government, said a spokesperson. Some in Europe have long been frustrated about the British government's approach to Brexit. But what was private has now become more public. The Irish government refused to comment on the leak. But some British MPs and officials suspect the Irish are using this moment of maximum leverage before a crucial EU summit next month to harden their position and put more pressure on the UK. And some believe the leak should be seen in that context. Downing Street insisted there was a good and constructive relationship between London and Dublin. But right now it is a relationship that is being tested. The Irish government refused to comment on the leaked document, which was published by the country's national broadcaster RTÃ on Thursday. ""A core part of the work of our embassies and other missions abroad is to report on the views of our partners on what is a strategically vital issue for Ireland,"" said an Irish government spokesperson. ""These routine reports are internal and confidential and are not intended for the public domain."" RTE's Europe Editor, Tony Connelly, who got hold of the leaked report, said it reflected ""private, anxious conversations that are being held in chancelleries and ministries around Europe when Irish officials are present"". ""But in a sense we've all known - and this has been articulated in public by people like Jean Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk - that there is essentially disarray within the Tory party, within the cabinet on Brexit and that is reflected in the way people view the British strategy,""he told the BBC's Brexitcast podcast.,external The leaked document is based on a compilation of political reports from Irish embassies across Europe, dated between 6 and 10 November. This video can not be played RTÃ's Europe Editor Tony Connelly assesses what EU ministers think of the UK's Brexit negotiating team It claims that Brexit was barely mentioned during a meeting on 23 October between Mr Davis and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and French Minister for European Affairs Nathalie Loiseau - something which was viewed as a wasted opportunity. ""Despite having billed this in the media in advance as a meeting to 'unblock' French resistance, Mr Davis hardly mentioned Brexit at all during the meeting, much to French surprise, focusing instead on foreign policy issues,"" the paper states. The Czech deputy minister for foreign affairs, Jakub Durr, told officials he felt ""sorry for British ambassadors around the EU trying to communicate a coherent message when there is political confusion at home"". The leaked document cites a Czech minister describing Boris Johnson as ""unimpressive"" Meanwhile, during a meeting in Luxembourg, a British judge at the European Court of Justice is quoted bemoaning ""the quality of politicians in Westminster"". The judge, Ian Forrester, also wondered if the British public would view Brexit as ""a great mistake"" when they realised what leaving the EU entailed, according to the leaked paper. The report highlights the significant concerns that will make it difficult to progress negotiations to a second phase at next month's summit. Overall, the various ministries across the EU expressed doubt that the UK would be permitted to move to the second phase of talks unless it brought forward solutions to the issue of the UK's financial liabilities on leaving the EU. They noted that the EU remained united at 27 countries, and that Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, had appeared far from optimistic that a breakthrough would happen at the December summit. The future management of the Irish border is one of three main priorities in UK-EU Brexit talks On Thursday, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said he was hopeful agreement could be reached on Irish-related issues by mid-December to move Brexit talks to the next phase, but that ""it is by no means pre-determined"". Earlier this month, Irish Prime MinisterLeo Varadkar said it was likely"" EU leaders would give the green light for Brexit talks to focus on trade, at their meeting in December. Mr Varadkar said this was his own belief rather than a forecast of any European Council decision. The leak comes days after Mr Varadkar was branded as ""reckless"" by the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party. Mr Varadkar ""should know better"" than to ""play around"" with Northern Ireland over Brexit, DUP leader Arlene Foster said after the Taoiseach suggested leaving the EU could jeopardise the peace process. The Irish government says any hard border with Northern Ireland should be off the table. And an EU paper recently suggested Northern Ireland would have to continue to follow many EU rules after Brexit, if a hard border was to be avoided. It hinted Northern Ireland may need to stay in the EU customs union if there were to be no checks at the border. That is something the UK Conservative government - supported in key votes by the DUP at Westminster - has said it can not accept as it would effectively create a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The leaked report was compiled just weeks after the EU summit in Brussels during whichEU leaders told Theresa May that Britain needed to do more on the three key issues: citizens' rights, the UK's financial obligation and the Irish border.

"More than 10% of women aged between 16 and 19 in England and Wales say they have experienced domestic abuse in the past year, research suggests. The Office for National Statistics' annual report on domestic abuse,externalsays they are the group most likely to be victims of it. Women in their 20s and early 40s are also vulnerable, figures suggest. About 7% of men who are still in their teens have also experienced it, according to the data. Domestic abuse includes non-physical abuse, threats, force, sexual assault or stalking by a partner or family member - the most common of which is abuse by a partner. 'Incredible response' to abuse tweet 'I thought he would kill me but I didn't tell the police' WATCH: Murdered by her stalker The report pulls together data from the police, the government and victim support groups. The latest Crime Survey for England and Wales for the year ending in March shows about 1.2 million women and 713,000 men reported being victims of some form of domestic abuse. However, a large proportion would not have gone to the police. The police, meanwhile, recorded 1.1 million reports of domestic abuse over the same period, which probably includes repeated instances of abuse against the same victim. Of these reports, 488,000 were recorded as crimes and fewer than half resulted in an arrest. Of the domestic abuse cases referred to the Crown Prosecution Service by police, just under three quarters (72%) resulted in a decision to charge. And of the cases that went to court, 76% led to convictions. The CPS says victims failing to turn up to court and retracting their statements were behind about half of all the unsuccessful prosecutions. Katie Ghose, of Women's Aid, said involving official bodies took great courage because many victims were worried they would not be believed, were not given the space to make the call or feared repercussions from their abuser. She said criminal cases should not rely solely on a victim's evidence to see it through to prosecution. Instead, police officers should gather evidence from the scene, as they do with fraud, burglary and traffic offences. The policing areas which saw the highest number of domestic abuse incidents and crimes last year were Durham, Cleveland, Gwent, South Wales and London. Cheshire, Dyfed-Powys, Surrey, North Yorkshire and Thames Valley saw the least, the report found. It also looked at the number of refuge beds available for victims, which Women's Aid said had become a ""postcode lottery"" because of local authority funding cuts and poor commissioning practices. Wales has the most with 10 bed spaces for every 1,000 domestic abuse victims. South-west England has the fewest with two per 1,000 victims. The ONS says its analysis of the figures indicates a gradual downward trend in levels of domestic abuse. Alexa Bradley, from the ONS, said: ""Domestic abuse is a particularly difficult problem to tackle, not least because victims may be reluctant to report abuse or to support action against their abusers.""

The leaked document cites a Czech minister describing Boris Johnson as ""unimpressive"" Meanwhile, during a meeting in Luxembourg, a British judge at the European Court of Justice is quoted bemoaning ""the quality of politicians in Westminster"". The judge, Ian Forrester, also wondered if the British public would view Brexit as ""a great mistake"" when they realised what leaving the EU entailed, according to the leaked paper. The report highlights the significant concerns that will make it difficult to progress negotiations to a second phase at next month's summit. Overall, the various ministries across the EU expressed doubt that the UK would be permitted to move to the second phase of talks unless it brought forward solutions to the issue of the UK's financial liabilities on leaving the EU. They noted that the EU remained united at 27 countries, and that Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, had appeared far from optimistic that a breakthrough would happen at the December summit. The future management of the Irish border is one of three main priorities in UK-EU Brexit talks On Thursday, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said he was hopeful agreement could be reached on Irish-related issues by mid-December to move Brexit talks to the next phase, but that ""it is by no means pre-determined"". Earlier this month, Irish Prime MinisterLeo Varadkar said it was likely"" EU leaders would give the green light for Brexit talks to focus on trade, at their meeting in December. Mr Varadkar said this was his own belief rather than a forecast of any European Council decision. The leak comes days after Mr Varadkar was branded as ""reckless"" by the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party. Mr Varadkar ""should know better"" than to ""play around"" with Northern Ireland over Brexit, DUP leader Arlene Foster said after the Taoiseach suggested leaving the EU could jeopardise the peace process. The Irish government says any hard border with Northern Ireland should be off the table. And an EU paper recently suggested Northern Ireland would have to continue to follow many EU rules after Brexit, if a hard border was to be avoided. It hinted Northern Ireland may need to stay in the EU customs union if there were to be no checks at the border. That is something the UK Conservative government - supported in key votes by the DUP at Westminster - has said it can not accept as it would effectively create a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The leaked report was compiled just weeks after the EU summit in Brussels during whichEU leaders told Theresa May that Britain needed to do more on the three key issues: citizens' rights, the UK's financial obligation and the Irish border.

"This video can not be played Mubashir Jamil: Video shows moment terror plotter arrested in Luton A terror plotter who offered to wear a suicide vest and ""press the button on the same day"" has been jailed. Mubashir Jamil, 22, was convicted of preparing acts of terrorism after being caught in a covert police operation. During his trial, the Old Bailey heard he wanted to join so-called Islamic State (IS) to rid himself of ""evil spirits"". Jamil, from Luton, was jailed for six years, part of which will be served in a secure hospital. The defendant, an Amazon warehouse worker and former Challney High School for Boys pupil, became obsessed with the idea of martyrdom after surfing the internet for IS propaganda, the court had heard. A former grade-A student, he was caught after talking to an undercover officer using encrypted messages on an online app. Mubashir Jamil had surfed the web for propaganda put out by the so-called Islamic State group, the court heard He had told the officer he would blow himself up in Britain if he could not fight for so-called Islamic State in Syria. Jamil told the officer: ""If you or some brother you know can put an explosive belt on me and tell me how to press, as soon as possible for security reasons, I can do something in the UK even tomorrow after I find a good target."" The accused, who has suffered bouts of mental illness, was arrested by counter-terrorism officers in April 2016, a few days before a planned flight to Turkey. During his trial the court heard Jamil had planned his trip carefully, and ""deliberately"" changed his appearance, shaving off his beard after reading guidance online about how to be a ""secret agent"" in a non-Muslim country. The defendant, who was born in Pakistan but brought up in Britain, denied one count of preparing for terrorist acts but was found guilty after a retrial. Jamil shaved off his beard after reading guidance about how to be a ""secret agent"" in a non-Muslim country Sentencing him to six years, Judge Peter Rook QC said his crime was only ""in part"" explained by his mental health disorder and said he was a ""dangerous"" offender. He handed Jamil a ""hybrid order"" meaning he will continue to be treated in a secure hospital until he is well enough to be transferred to prison. Jamil will serve a further five years on extended licence on his release. The moment a terror plotter was arrested.

"Emile Cilliers denied attempting to murder Victoria Cilliers on 5 April 2015 An Army sergeant accused of trying to kill his wife is set to face a retrial after a jury failed to reach a verdict. Emile Cilliers denied tampering with Victoria Cilliers' parachute at Netheravon Airfield, Wiltshire, where she suffered near-fatal injuries in 2015. Mr Cilliers, 37, faced two charges of attempted murder and another of criminal damage. Jurors were discharged after a seven-week trial at Winchester Crown Court. Parachuting instructor Mrs Cilliers, 40, survived a 4,000ft fall on Easter Sunday when both her main and reserve parachutes failed. Prosecutors also claimed the defendant made another attempt to kill her by deliberately causing a gas leak in the family home days before the fall. The Crown Prosecution Service has said it will seek a retrial on all three charges. Jurors began deliberations last Tuesday. A week later, after they had discussed the case for more than 23 hours, judge Mr Justice Sweeney told them he would accept a majority verdict. Two jurors, including the forewoman, fell ill and were released after the judge issued the direction. After the remaining jurors had deliberated for about 30 hours, the judge thanked them for their hard work. He told them: ""It has been a long case which you have been required to work very hard on over a long period."" Mr Cilliers was released on conditional bail until the retrial.

"More than 10% of women aged between 16 and 19 in England and Wales say they have experienced domestic abuse in the past year, research suggests. The Office for National Statistics' annual report on domestic abuse,externalsays they are the group most likely to be victims of it. Women in their 20s and early 40s are also vulnerable, figures suggest. About 7% of men who are still in their teens have also experienced it, according to the data. Domestic abuse includes non-physical abuse, threats, force, sexual assault or stalking by a partner or family member - the most common of which is abuse by a partner. 'Incredible response' to abuse tweet 'I thought he would kill me but I didn't tell the police' WATCH: Murdered by her stalker The report pulls together data from the police, the government and victim support groups. The latest Crime Survey for England and Wales for the year ending in March shows about 1.2 million women and 713,000 men reported being victims of some form of domestic abuse. However, a large proportion would not have gone to the police. The police, meanwhile, recorded 1.1 million reports of domestic abuse over the same period, which probably includes repeated instances of abuse against the same victim. Of these reports, 488,000 were recorded as crimes and fewer than half resulted in an arrest. Of the domestic abuse cases referred to the Crown Prosecution Service by police, just under three quarters (72%) resulted in a decision to charge. And of the cases that went to court, 76% led to convictions. The CPS says victims failing to turn up to court and retracting their statements were behind about half of all the unsuccessful prosecutions. Katie Ghose, of Women's Aid, said involving official bodies took great courage because many victims were worried they would not be believed, were not given the space to make the call or feared repercussions from their abuser. She said criminal cases should not rely solely on a victim's evidence to see it through to prosecution. Instead, police officers should gather evidence from the scene, as they do with fraud, burglary and traffic offences. The policing areas which saw the highest number of domestic abuse incidents and crimes last year were Durham, Cleveland, Gwent, South Wales and London. Cheshire, Dyfed-Powys, Surrey, North Yorkshire and Thames Valley saw the least, the report found. It also looked at the number of refuge beds available for victims, which Women's Aid said had become a ""postcode lottery"" because of local authority funding cuts and poor commissioning practices. Wales has the most with 10 bed spaces for every 1,000 domestic abuse victims. South-west England has the fewest with two per 1,000 victims. The ONS says its analysis of the figures indicates a gradual downward trend in levels of domestic abuse. Alexa Bradley, from the ONS, said: ""Domestic abuse is a particularly difficult problem to tackle, not least because victims may be reluctant to report abuse or to support action against their abusers.""

"This video can not be played As hopes faded for the sub, angry relatives said the search operation had been inadequate Hopes that the 44 crew of a missing Argentine submarine might still be alive have been dashed after the navy said an event consistent with an explosion had been detected. The ""abnormal, singular, short, violent, non-nuclear event"" was recorded in the south Atlantic by a nuclear test watchdog last week. Relatives of the missing crew reacted with grief and anger at the news. It follows a US report of a loud noise in the same area. The ARA San Juan disappeared last Wednesday. More than a dozen countries including the US, Russia and the UK have sent assistance. It was provided to the Argentine navy on Thursday by the Vienna-based Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), spokesman Capt Enrique Balbi said. In a statement, the CTBTO said two of its hydro-acoustic stations had detected a signal from an ""underwater impulsive event"". The ARA San Juan disappeared last Wednesday On Wednesday the navy received a US report of a ""hydro-acoustic anomaly"" detected hours after the submarine went missing. Capt Balbi said the suspected explosion took place near the submarine's last known location. The navy only knew the location of the suspected explosion, not its cause, he said, and search efforts would be concentrated in the area. News of the suspected explosion was broken to family members gathered at the Mar del Plata navy base shortly before Capt Balbi spoke to journalists. Some remonstrated angrily with the navy spokesman, reports said, while others collapsed in tears. Relatives accused the navy of lying to them and of raising false hopes. Others pointed the finger at the government, saying lack of investment and corruption in the armed forces had made the submarine unsafe. One man whose brother was on board the ARA San Juan was quoted by Clarin newspaper [in Spanish] as shouting:,external""They killed my brother, the bastards. They killed my brother because they take them out to sail [in a vessel held together] with wire."" Relatives of crew members fear the worst Grief and anger dominate Argentine media Luis Tagliapietra, whose son DamiÃ¡n was on board, told Radio Cut thatthe navy had told them all the crew had been killed,externalin the explosion at a depth of 200m. On Wednesday, Capt Balbi said oxygen would be running out on board the vessel. The ARA San Juan was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southern-most tip of South America, when it reported an ""electrical breakdown"". According to naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi, the submarine surfaced and reported the breakdown, which Capt Galeazzi described as a ""short circuit"" in the sub's batteries. The sub was ordered to cut its mission short and return to the naval base in Mar del Plata immediately. According to Capt Balbi, the captain of the ARA San Juan contacted the naval base once more after reporting the problem. What happens when a submarine vanishes In the message, he reportedly said that the problem had been adequately fixed and that the sub would submerge and proceed towards Mar del Plata. The last contact was made at 07:30 local time (10:30 GMT) on Wednesday 15 November. It is not known what happened to the sub after that contact. Argentine navy protocol stipulates that in peace time, submarines make contact twice a day with the base. When the submarine failed to call in, the Argentine navy began its search. There are 44 crew on board the submarine, which is under the command of Pedro MartÃ­n FernÃ¡ndez. Forty-three of the crew are men but there is also one woman, Eliana MarÃ­a Krawczyk. The 35-year-old is the first female officer in Argentina to serve on a submarine. Her family says it was Eliana MarÃ­a Krawczyk's dream to become a submariner Nicknamed ""the queen of the sea"" by her father she comes from OberÃ¡, a city in northern Argentina. Despite having been born and raised far inland, her relatives say that ""she was born to be a submariner"", citing her ""will of steel"" and a passion for her job. The rest of the crew is made up of submariners of varying ages and experience. The sub's engineer, HernÃ¡n RodrÃ­guez, has been on the ARA San Juan for 11 years, local media reported. Accidents involving submarines are rare. Here are some of the most serious: All 70 crew aboard China'sGreat WallMing-class submarine suffocated in 2003 when a diesel engine malfunctioned, consuming the vessel's oxygen supply Russia'sKursksubmarine sank in the Barents Sea in 2000 aftera torpedo exploded during an exercise, killing all 118 on board, including 23 who survived the blast but died due to a lack of oxygen TheUSS Scorpionsank in the Atlantic in 1968, possibly because a torpedo exploded, killing the 99 crew TheUSS Threshersank during diving tests in 1963, killing all 129 on board - the biggest submarine death toll in history Brazil, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, Russia, Peru, South Africa, Uruguay and the UK are among the countries that have sent either ships or planes to help with the search. The US navy has deployed two underwater vehicles which use sonar to create images of the sea floor. A Nasa research aircraft has also flown over the search area but failed to spot anything.

"What is the point of capitalism? That might seem like a pretty big question, but one answer could be ""to provide people the opportunity through work to become richer"". What, though, if the economy fails in that endeavour? If the system leaves you - despite all your efforts - worse off in December than you were the previous January? Or worse off now than you were a decade ago? It was Lord Adair Turner, the former head of the Low Pay Commission, who put it succinctly. ""The UK over the last 10 years has created a lot of jobs, but today real wages are below where they were in 2007,""he told me earlier this year. ""That is not the capitalist system delivering its promise that over a decade or so it will raise all boats, and it is a very fundamental issue."" Fundamental indeed. Stagnant earnings forecast 'astonishing' UK 'faces longest fall in living standards' At a glance summary: Budget key points Yesterday the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) announced an aggressive downgrade of both its growth and productivity forecasts. Those big, macro-economic announcements have a significant effect on all of us as well as on the state of the public finances. It means the economy is forecast to be weaker at producing wealth for every hour that we work. Which makes the chances of a pay rise for everyone recede. Today, two pieces of chunky analysis of the OBR's judgements reveal why those downgrades are so important. The social justice think tank, the Resolution Foundation, said that ""lower productivity feeds directly through to pay, which is now forecast to be Â£1,000 a year lower on average than the OBR thought back in March"". The Foundation says that the fall in real incomes people are experiencing could now become the longest since records began. And that wages will not recover to their pre-financial crisis levels until 2025 - that's 17 years during which people have been experiencing an incomes squeeze. The tax and economy think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, agrees. ""Real earnings are falling this year as inflation has risen to 3%,"" Paul Johnson, the Institute's director, said. ""The nascent recovery in earnings, which were growing through 2014 to the first half of 2016, has been choked off. ""That they even might still be below their 2008 level in 2022 as the OBR forecasts is truly astonishing. Let's hope this forecast turns out to be too pessimistic."" Government ministers will be similarly keeping their fingers crossed. And hoping that with strong employment levels and plans to boost investment in the type of infrastructure that boosts productivity - transport, scientific and technology research - the real incomes squeeze can be alleviated. Because if a system does not deliver increasing wealth - even if it is a modest increase - then people, quite naturally, begin to wonder what is the point.

"If the economy is a cruise liner then the chancellor made the cabins more affordable for some passengers on Wednesday. Philip Hammond said first-time buyers buying a home of up to Â£300,000 would pay no stamp duty. While that will make some passengers happy, the weather for their trip could turn stormy in the coming years. That is because the body which assembles economic data is forecasting a dramatic deterioration in conditions. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which prepares the figures that the chancellor bases his Budget on, predicts that annual economic growth will be below 2% for five years - one of the worst forecasts in living memory. Why has the situation turned so gloomy? After all, the UK was one of the fastest growing of the major economies in 2016. The answer hinges on productivity. If we return to our cruise ship, for years the crew were able to make it go significantly faster every year. But since the storm that was the financial crisis of 2007, that improved performance has not been repeated. It's not clear why productivity has been so disappointing. Experts have several theories, including poor management and a lack of investment. Whatever the reason, the official forecasters have conceded that productivity is unlikely to recover and that translates into slower economic growth. You can see how that outlook has deteriorated in the chart below. The government's income is closely linked to growth. The faster the economy grows, the greater the receipts from VAT, income tax, corporation tax and other revenue-raising measures. The government is already borrowing to fund spending on government departments and servicing the nation's debt. It plans to reduce that borrowing, to zero, but the downgrades to growth means that will be harder to do. The chart below shows how the deficit (the difference between government income and expenditure) is forecast to fall over the next five years, but not as fast as the OBR predicted in the spring.

"People prayed outside an Argentine navy base as fears grew about the missing sub's oxygen supply Argentina's navy is investigating reports of a loud noise detected a few hours after a submarine went missing. The ARA San Juan disappeared last Wednesday with 44 people on board. A spokesman called the noise a ""hydro-acoustic anomaly"" and would not confirm whether there had been an explosion. Captain Enrique Balbi said the situation was getting critical and ""concern is growing more and more"" amid fears oxygen on board is close to running out. One crew member's sister said: ""I feel like I'm waiting for a corpse."" Elena Alfaro, who was waiting alongside other family members at the Mar del Plata naval base, told TN news network: ""I feel like I'm at a wake. I also feel time passing and time is crucial."" Relatives of crew members wait for news Elena Alfaro's brother Cristian IbaÃ±ez is on board More than a dozen countries including Russia and the US have sent resources to take part in the search for the submarine. On Thursday, a US Navy aircraft detected an ""object"" near the submarine's last known location, the news agency Reuters reported, but the US Navy quickly confirmed that it was not from the missing sub. On Wednesday, Mr Balbi told journalists: ""Today is the seventh day, which was critical for oxygen capacity."" The loud noise happened four or five hours after the submarine's last radio contact, about 30 nautical miles (60 kilometres) north of its last-known position. ""It's a noise,"" Mr Balbi said. ""We don't want to speculate."" Brazil, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, Peru, South Africa, Uruguay and the UK are among the countries that have sent either ships or planes to help with the search. The US navy has deployed two underwater vehicles which use sonar to create images of the sea floor. A Nasa research aircraft has also flown over the search area but failed to spot anything. The ARA San Juan was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southern-most tip of South America, when it reported an ""electrical breakdown"". According to naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi, the submarine surfaced and reported the breakdown, which Capt Galeazzi described as a ""short circuit"" in the sub's batteries. The sub was ordered to cut its mission short and return to the naval base in Mar del Plata immediately. According to Mr Balbi, the captain of the ARA San Juan contacted the naval base once more after reporting the problem. In the message, he reportedly said that the problem had been adequately fixed and that the sub would submerge and proceed towards Mar del Plata naval base. The last contact was made at 07:30 local time (10:30 GMT) on Wednesday 15 November. It is not known what happened to the sub after that contact. Read:What happens when a submarine vanishes Argentine navy protocol stipulates that in peace time, submarines make contact twice a day with the base. When the submarine failed to call in, the Argentine navy began its search for the vessel. Navy commander Carlos Zavalla at that point spoke only of a ""failure to communicate"" and urged relatives of the crew to remain calm. There was no mention by navy officials of the vessel having any problems at the time and rumours of a fire on board were dismissed by Mr Balbi. On Sunday, relatives of some of the crew said that they had been told in messages sent before contact with the submarine was lost, that there was a problem with the sub's batteries. Naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi told journalists about the mechanical problems on Monday On Monday, Capt Galeazzi confirmed the sub's captain had reported the issue on Wednesday. Capt Galeazzi said that mechanical problems were not uncommon and rarely posed a risk. ""A warship has a lot of backup systems, to allow it to move from one to another when there is a breakdown,"" he said. He also said that the sub had not sent a distress signal to the navy base. There are 44 crew on board the submarine, which is under the command of Pedro MartÃ­n FernÃ¡ndez. Forty-three of the crew are men but there is also one woman, Eliana MarÃ­a Krawczyk. The 35-year-old is the first female officer in Argentina to serve on a submarine. Her family says it was Eliana MarÃ­a Krawczyk's dream to become a submariner Nicknamed ""the queen of the sea"" by her father she comes from OberÃ¡, a city in northern Argentina. Despite having been born and raised far inland, her relatives say that ""she was born to be a submariner"", citing her ""will of steel"" and a passion for her job. The rest of the crew is made up of submariners of varying ages and experience. The sub's engineer, HernÃ¡n RodrÃ­guez, has been on the ARA San Juan for 11 years, local media reported.

"This video can not be played As hopes faded for the sub, angry relatives said the search operation had been inadequate Hopes that the 44 crew of a missing Argentine submarine might still be alive have been dashed after the navy said an event consistent with an explosion had been detected. The ""abnormal, singular, short, violent, non-nuclear event"" was recorded in the south Atlantic by a nuclear test watchdog last week. Relatives of the missing crew reacted with grief and anger at the news. It follows a US report of a loud noise in the same area. The ARA San Juan disappeared last Wednesday. More than a dozen countries including the US, Russia and the UK have sent assistance. It was provided to the Argentine navy on Thursday by the Vienna-based Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), spokesman Capt Enrique Balbi said. In a statement, the CTBTO said two of its hydro-acoustic stations had detected a signal from an ""underwater impulsive event"". The ARA San Juan disappeared last Wednesday On Wednesday the navy received a US report of a ""hydro-acoustic anomaly"" detected hours after the submarine went missing. Capt Balbi said the suspected explosion took place near the submarine's last known location. The navy only knew the location of the suspected explosion, not its cause, he said, and search efforts would be concentrated in the area. News of the suspected explosion was broken to family members gathered at the Mar del Plata navy base shortly before Capt Balbi spoke to journalists. Some remonstrated angrily with the navy spokesman, reports said, while others collapsed in tears. Relatives accused the navy of lying to them and of raising false hopes. Others pointed the finger at the government, saying lack of investment and corruption in the armed forces had made the submarine unsafe. One man whose brother was on board the ARA San Juan was quoted by Clarin newspaper [in Spanish] as shouting:,external""They killed my brother, the bastards. They killed my brother because they take them out to sail [in a vessel held together] with wire."" Relatives of crew members fear the worst Grief and anger dominate Argentine media Luis Tagliapietra, whose son DamiÃ¡n was on board, told Radio Cut thatthe navy had told them all the crew had been killed,externalin the explosion at a depth of 200m.

"Dundee was one of five UK cities hoping to host the title in 2023 Dundee will not be able to compete in the European Capital of Culture 2023 competition due to Brexit, the European Commission has confirmed. Five UK cities were bidding to host the title, with the winner expected to be announced next week. A letter from the European Commission to the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said UK participation ""would not be possible"". It said the UK's selection process should ""immediately be discontinued"". Dundee's bid team were due to make their final presentation to the competition judges next week. BBC Scotland understands that the DCMS only received the Commission's letter on Wednesday. A Dundee 2023 spokesman said that the team was ""hugely disappointed"" at the European Commission's late decision. He said: ""The timing is disrespectful not only to the citizens of Dundee, but to people from all five bidding cities who have devoted so much time, effort and energy so far in this competition. ""It's a sad irony that one of the key drivers of our bid was a desire to further enhance our cultural links with Europe."" The UK's five final bid proposals were submitted at the end of October. They were Dundee, Nottingham, Leeds, Milton Keynes, and a joint proposal from Belfast, Londonderry and Strabane. Dundee's 80-page bid document was understood to include 110 new projects across the city. Scotland's culture secretary Fiona Hyslop said: ""It is now deeply concerning that the amount of time, effort and expense Dundee have put into scoping out their bid could be wasted thanks to the Brexit policy of the UK government . ""We are in urgent contact with the UK government and Dundee to understand the potential implications of this situation and to establish what action the UK Government is going to take to address it."" The DCMS said it ""disagreed"" with the European Commission's stance and was ""deeply disappointed"" that the Commission had waited until the UK cities had submitted their bids before ""communicating this new position to us"". The UK government said previously that the title was ""part of our plan for a dynamic, outward-looking and global Britain"" post-Brexit. However, it had warned bidders that the contest ""may be subject to the outcome of those exit negotiations"".

"What is the point of capitalism? That might seem like a pretty big question, but one answer could be ""to provide people the opportunity through work to become richer"". What, though, if the economy fails in that endeavour? If the system leaves you - despite all your efforts - worse off in December than you were the previous January? Or worse off now than you were a decade ago? It was Lord Adair Turner, the former head of the Low Pay Commission, who put it succinctly. ""The UK over the last 10 years has created a lot of jobs, but today real wages are below where they were in 2007,""he told me earlier this year. ""That is not the capitalist system delivering its promise that over a decade or so it will raise all boats, and it is a very fundamental issue."" Fundamental indeed. Stagnant earnings forecast 'astonishing' UK 'faces longest fall in living standards' At a glance summary: Budget key points Yesterday the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) announced an aggressive downgrade of both its growth and productivity forecasts. Those big, macro-economic announcements have a significant effect on all of us as well as on the state of the public finances. It means the economy is forecast to be weaker at producing wealth for every hour that we work. Which makes the chances of a pay rise for everyone recede. Today, two pieces of chunky analysis of the OBR's judgements reveal why those downgrades are so important. The social justice think tank, the Resolution Foundation, said that ""lower productivity feeds directly through to pay, which is now forecast to be Â£1,000 a year lower on average than the OBR thought back in March"". The Foundation says that the fall in real incomes people are experiencing could now become the longest since records began. And that wages will not recover to their pre-financial crisis levels until 2025 - that's 17 years during which people have been experiencing an incomes squeeze. The tax and economy think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, agrees. ""Real earnings are falling this year as inflation has risen to 3%,"" Paul Johnson, the Institute's director, said. ""The nascent recovery in earnings, which were growing through 2014 to the first half of 2016, has been choked off. ""That they even might still be below their 2008 level in 2022 as the OBR forecasts is truly astonishing. Let's hope this forecast turns out to be too pessimistic."" Government ministers will be similarly keeping their fingers crossed. And hoping that with strong employment levels and plans to boost investment in the type of infrastructure that boosts productivity - transport, scientific and technology research - the real incomes squeeze can be alleviated. Because if a system does not deliver increasing wealth - even if it is a modest increase - then people, quite naturally, begin to wonder what is the point.

"This video can not be played The University of Reading say molecules from burning fat could counteract global warming. Fatty acids released into the air from cooking may contribute to the formation of clouds that cool the climate, say scientists. Fatty acid molecules comprise about 10% of fine particulates over London, and such particles help seed clouds. But researchers dismiss the idea that cooking fats could be used as a geo-engineering tool to reduce warming. Instead, the research is designed to help reduce uncertainties about the role of cooking fats on climate. Researchers believe the fatty molecules arrange themselves into complex 3-D structures in atmospheric droplets. These aerosols persist for longer than normal and can seed the formation of clouds which experts say can have a cooling effect on the climate. The authors say the study will shed new light on the long term role of aerosols on temperatures. Atmospheric aerosols are one of the areas of climate science where there are considerable uncertainties. Molecules from deep fat frying may have a cooling effect on the climate The description covers tiny particles that can be either solid or liquid, ranging from the dusts of the Saharan desert to soot to aerosols formed by chemical reaction. These can have a variety of impacts, while most aerosols reflect sunlight back into space others absorb it. Warm North Sea link to birds' food decline Small steps forward at UN climate talks Europe steps in on climate science funding Aerosols and the clouds seeded by them, are said to reflect about a quarter of the Sun's energy back into space. Researchers have known for some time that the emissions of fatty acid molecules from chip pans and cookers may coat aerosol particles in the atmosphere - but this is the first time that scientists have looked at their role inside the droplets. Using ultrasonic levitation to hold individual droplets of brine and oleic acid in position, the research team was able to make them float so they could analyse them with a laser beam and X-rays. Fatty acid molecules were levitated so researchers could probe their interior structures The X-rays proved crucial in revealing the inner structure. ""We found these drops could form these self-assembled phases which means these molecules can stay much longer in the atmosphere,"" said lead author Dr Christian Pfrang, from the University of Reading. ""These self-assembled structures are highly viscous so instead of having a water droplet you have something that behaves much more like honey, so processes inside the droplet will slow down,"" he told BBC News. ""They are resistant to oxidation so they stay around longer, so cloud formation will be easier."" Scientists believe that the number of fatty acid molecules in the air is relatively high, comprising about 10% of the fine particulate matter over London, according to research published last year. This could be having an impact on the number of clouds and the amount of heat they reflect back into space. ""If you want to establish emissions control measures for McDonalds for example, you could assume that instead of two hours the molecules can last more than one day,"" said Dr Pfrang. ""Then this air parcel that comes from McDonalds will travel 10 times further, this is important for local air pollution but also to determine the effect of clouds which is the largest uncertainty."" ""We know that the complex structures we saw are formed by similar fatty acid molecules like soap in water,"" said co-lead author, Dr Adam Squires, from the University of Bath, ""There, they dramatically affect whether the mixture is cloudy or transparent, solid or liquid, and how much it absorbs moisture from the atmosphere in a lab. ""The idea that this may also be happening in the air above our heads is exciting, and raises challenges in understanding what these cooking fats are really doing to the world around us."" The researchers say that current large-scale atmospheric models do not account for the role of 3-D structures in aerosols at all, according to the research team. But they are dismissive of the idea that cooking fats could somehow be used as a form of geo-engineering to limit the impacts of global warming. Much more important they say, is to collect molecules from the atmosphere and bring them back for further study. ""If it does have an impact, it is likely to be a cooling one,"" said Dr Pfrang. ""And the extent urgently needs further research.""

"What is the point of capitalism? That might seem like a pretty big question, but one answer could be ""to provide people the opportunity through work to become richer"". What, though, if the economy fails in that endeavour? If the system leaves you - despite all your efforts - worse off in December than you were the previous January? Or worse off now than you were a decade ago? It was Lord Adair Turner, the former head of the Low Pay Commission, who put it succinctly. ""The UK over the last 10 years has created a lot of jobs, but today real wages are below where they were in 2007,""he told me earlier this year. ""That is not the capitalist system delivering its promise that over a decade or so it will raise all boats, and it is a very fundamental issue."" Fundamental indeed. Stagnant earnings forecast 'astonishing' UK 'faces longest fall in living standards' At a glance summary: Budget key points Yesterday the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) announced an aggressive downgrade of both its growth and productivity forecasts. Those big, macro-economic announcements have a significant effect on all of us as well as on the state of the public finances. It means the economy is forecast to be weaker at producing wealth for every hour that we work. Which makes the chances of a pay rise for everyone recede. Today, two pieces of chunky analysis of the OBR's judgements reveal why those downgrades are so important. The social justice think tank, the Resolution Foundation, said that ""lower productivity feeds directly through to pay, which is now forecast to be Â£1,000 a year lower on average than the OBR thought back in March"". The Foundation says that the fall in real incomes people are experiencing could now become the longest since records began. And that wages will not recover to their pre-financial crisis levels until 2025 - that's 17 years during which people have been experiencing an incomes squeeze. The tax and economy think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, agrees. ""Real earnings are falling this year as inflation has risen to 3%,"" Paul Johnson, the Institute's director, said. ""The nascent recovery in earnings, which were growing through 2014 to the first half of 2016, has been choked off. ""That they even might still be below their 2008 level in 2022 as the OBR forecasts is truly astonishing. Let's hope this forecast turns out to be too pessimistic."" Government ministers will be similarly keeping their fingers crossed. And hoping that with strong employment levels and plans to boost investment in the type of infrastructure that boosts productivity - transport, scientific and technology research - the real incomes squeeze can be alleviated. Because if a system does not deliver increasing wealth - even if it is a modest increase - then people, quite naturally, begin to wonder what is the point.

"The leaked report details EU leaders' frustration with David Davis The government has refused to comment on a leaked report branding its approach to Brexit as ""chaotic"". The internal Irish government paper, obtained by RTÃ, documents EU figures' scathing assessments of cabinet members such as Brexit Secretary David Davis. A Czech minister is quoted as describing Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson as ""unimpressive"". The minister also warns of ""political confusion"" about the UK Government's approach to leaving the EU. Brexit: All you need to know Davis: We have compromised in EU talks Irish PM 'should know better' says Arlene Foster Downing Street said the government was working hard on its preparations for Brexit. It had ""a good and constructive"" relationship with the Irish government, said a spokesperson. Some in Europe have long been frustrated about the British government's approach to Brexit. But what was private has now become more public. The Irish government refused to comment on the leak. But some British MPs and officials suspect the Irish are using this moment of maximum leverage before a crucial EU summit next month to harden their position and put more pressure on the UK. And some believe the leak should be seen in that context. Downing Street insisted there was a good and constructive relationship between London and Dublin. But right now it is a relationship that is being tested. The Irish government refused to comment on the leaked document, which was published by the country's national broadcaster RTÃ on Thursday. ""A core part of the work of our embassies and other missions abroad is to report on the views of our partners on what is a strategically vital issue for Ireland,"" said an Irish government spokesperson. ""These routine reports are internal and confidential and are not intended for the public domain."" RTE's Europe Editor, Tony Connelly, who got hold of the leaked report, said it reflected ""private, anxious conversations that are being held in chancelleries and ministries around Europe when Irish officials are present"". ""But in a sense we've all known - and this has been articulated in public by people like Jean Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk - that there is essentially disarray within the Tory party, within the cabinet on Brexit and that is reflected in the way people view the British strategy,""he told the BBC's Brexitcast podcast.,external The leaked document is based on a compilation of political reports from Irish embassies across Europe, dated between 6 and 10 November. This video can not be played RTÃ's Europe Editor Tony Connelly assesses what EU ministers think of the UK's Brexit negotiating team It claims that Brexit was barely mentioned during a meeting on 23 October between Mr Davis and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and French Minister for European Affairs Nathalie Loiseau - something which was viewed as a wasted opportunity. ""Despite having billed this in the media in advance as a meeting to 'unblock' French resistance, Mr Davis hardly mentioned Brexit at all during the meeting, much to French surprise, focusing instead on foreign policy issues,"" the paper states. The Czech deputy minister for foreign affairs, Jakub Durr, told officials he felt ""sorry for British ambassadors around the EU trying to communicate a coherent message when there is political confusion at home"". The leaked document cites a Czech minister describing Boris Johnson as ""unimpressive"" Meanwhile, during a meeting in Luxembourg, a British judge at the European Court of Justice is quoted bemoaning ""the quality of politicians in Westminster"". The judge, Ian Forrester, also wondered if the British public would view Brexit as ""a great mistake"" when they realised what leaving the EU entailed, according to the leaked paper. The report highlights the significant concerns that will make it difficult to progress negotiations to a second phase at next month's summit. Overall, the various ministries across the EU expressed doubt that the UK would be permitted to move to the second phase of talks unless it brought forward solutions to the issue of the UK's financial liabilities on leaving the EU. They noted that the EU remained united at 27 countries, and that Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, had appeared far from optimistic that a breakthrough would happen at the December summit. The future management of the Irish border is one of three main priorities in UK-EU Brexit talks On Thursday, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said he was hopeful agreement could be reached on Irish-related issues by mid-December to move Brexit talks to the next phase, but that ""it is by no means pre-determined"". Earlier this month, Irish Prime MinisterLeo Varadkar said it was likely"" EU leaders would give the green light for Brexit talks to focus on trade, at their meeting in December. Mr Varadkar said this was his own belief rather than a forecast of any European Council decision. The leak comes days after Mr Varadkar was branded as ""reckless"" by the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party. Mr Varadkar ""should know better"" than to ""play around"" with Northern Ireland over Brexit, DUP leader Arlene Foster said after the Taoiseach suggested leaving the EU could jeopardise the peace process. The Irish government says any hard border with Northern Ireland should be off the table. And an EU paper recently suggested Northern Ireland would have to continue to follow many EU rules after Brexit, if a hard border was to be avoided. It hinted Northern Ireland may need to stay in the EU customs union if there were to be no checks at the border. That is something the UK Conservative government - supported in key votes by the DUP at Westminster - has said it can not accept as it would effectively create a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The leaked report was compiled just weeks after the EU summit in Brussels during whichEU leaders told Theresa May that Britain needed to do more on the three key issues: citizens' rights, the UK's financial obligation and the Irish border.

"Nikki Entwistle, 33, said stamp-duty changes would not help her afford a deposit What do the measures introduced inthe Budgetmean to young people in the UK? The Chancellor Philip Hammond, announced the immediate abolitionof stamp dutyfor properties up to Â£300,000 in England, Northern Ireland and, for a time, Wales. The average first-time buyer pays about Â£1,600 in stamp duty, according to Halifax Building Society. The BBC spoke to a number of young people to find out if they thought the chancellor had gone far enough. The stamp-duty reform was welcomed by some first-time buyers, but some worried it was not enough to enable young people to get their foot on the ladder Hollie Croft, 31, is buying a house in London with her husband. ""Our stamp duty would have been Â£9,000,"" she said. ""Now, we can afford to redo the bathroom straight away instead of living with the rundown one until we'd saved up. ""Saving for a deposit whilst paying London rent has meant no holidays, no new clothes and very few nights out. ""I still think current house prices are disproportionate to wages and I don't know if this change will help in the long term, but for us right now? We're very happy."" Madeleine van Oss, a 25-year-old law student in Oxford, told the BBC the stamp-duty cut reflected the difficulty many young people faced accessing the housing market. ""If I get a good job and I can buy a house, the stamp-duty [cut] will help me,"" she said. ""It's good to see an acknowledgement that things are harder for us now than it was for them back in the day. ""Personally, I do well out of [this Budget],"" she added. What the Budget 2017 means for you Key points at-a-glance Budget calculator Others were more circumspect. Nick, 19, said: ""A lot of [this Budget], I felt, was just empty promises and things to attempt to win over voters."" He added: ""I'm not sure how much of an impact the stamp-duty change will make to first-time buyers. ""With property prices rising, especially in London, Â£300,000 in house terms isn't a lot, in my opinion."" Nikki Entwistle, 33, agrees. After being made redundant from her job at British Gas in 2016, she decided to go back to college, where she is now studying animal management. ""I've never been able to afford my own home,"" she said. ""I've rented property since I was about 19. ""It seemed expensive then, but prices have gone up a lot. ""I don't know how the government expects us to be able to afford to save. ""With council tax, energy bills, rent and food, there's not enough left. ""I think there needs to be a cap on rent. ""Paying almost Â£700 a month makes it impossible."" James Furniss-Rees welcomed the cut in stamp duty but thinks that measures could be introduced to address student debt James Furniss-Rees, who graduated from university in July with Â£58,000 of debt, said there had been ""not enough"" in the Budget for him. ""There was no real talk about debt, where there will be changes to timeframes, when to pay back and how,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Philip Hammond explains how the UK can get its economic forecast upgraded Philip Hammond says he hopes to prove the bleak economic forecasts released in his Budget wrong. The chancellor said clarity around Brexit would increase consumer confidence and lead to higher growth in the economy. But a new report has warned of the longestfall in people's living standardssince records began over 60 years ago. Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said the economy was ""on its knees"". He said the chancellor had provided ""not a penny more"" for police, social care, mental health, children's services or public sector pay and public sector workers would see living standards ""continue to fall for years to come"". Follow the latest Budget reaction Budget calculator: Are you better or worse off? Warning of long living standards squeeze Stagnant earnings forecast 'astonishing' Key points at-a-glance: A Budget summary The reduced growth forecasts, blamed on the economy's flat productivity, threatened to overshadow a series of announcements in the Budget. These included a cut instamp dutyfor most first-time buyers and setting aside Â£3bn for preparations for the UK to leave the EU. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Hammond, who has been under pressure from Eurosceptic Tory MPs, would be ""broadly content"" with how his big day had played out, but that ""very difficult questions"" about the state of the economy remained. There is a warning by theResolution Foundation,externalthink tank that the squeeze on people's incomes is set to last longer than that which followed the post-2008 crash. Philip Hammond and Theresa May visited a construction college in Leeds the morning after the Budget The chancellor told BBC Breakfast there was always going to be uncertainty about the outcome of Brexit negotiations. But he said moving into 2018 there would be a ""sense of movement"", and that ""confidence will return, certainty about the future will return, businesses will start investing, consumers will start buying big ticket consumer items again and that will help to get our economy growing again faster"". He also denied being ""gloomy"" about the UK's prospects outside the EU, a criticism he has faced from some within his party. What the Budget 2017 means for you In depth: The BBC's Budget coverage Read Laura's blog in full On the predictions by the Office for Budget Responsibility, he said: ""The challenge for us as a nation is to prove them wrong.""

We've got a low-growth economy, we've got the shadow of Brexit over-hanging, we've got years of low growth ahead of us, a very significant problem with productivity. ""If I may borrow somebody else's phrase, there's no money left. So what Philip has had to do is to put sticking plasters on some difficult issues as best he can."" The Office for Budget Responsibility slashed its 2017 growth forecast from 2% to 1.5%. Output, it added, would be weaker than previously thought in each of the subsequent four years. This video can not be played The BBC's political, economics and business editors on the announcements in Philip Hammond's Budget. To put the figures into perspective, while there have been three recessions since the early 1980s there has not been a period since then when growth has been forecast to stay below 2% for more than three years in a row. Sharp cut to UK growth forecast The Resolution Foundation says disposable incomes are now expected to be Â£540 lower by 2023 than forecast in March, largely as a result of weaker pay growth.

"This video can not be played The Labour leader was introduced on stage by Glastonbury Festival founder Michael Eavis His name was chanted by crowds at Glastonbury and emblazoned on T-shirts - but Jeremy Corbyn says he was never meant to be called ""Jeremy"" at all. The Labour leader said his parents had agreed a name for him shortly after his birth, in 1949 - only for his father to change his mind on the way to having it registered, without telling his mother. ""I was supposed to be called something else,"" he told comedian John Bishop. Mr Corbyn said his parents had never revealed their first choice of name. The Jeremy Corbyn Story: Profile of Labour leader The MP made the disclosure during TV channel W's John Bishop: In Conversation with Jeremy Corbyn programme, which airs at 21:00 GMT. Asked if his father, David, made the name-swap without consulting his wife, Mr Corbyn replied: ""Yes. To her dying day, she would never tell me what it was. ""I said, 'Can't you tell me what it was going to be?' She said, 'I can't tell you.' So we can only speculate."" The chant ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" - to the tune of the White Stripes' hit Seven Nation Army - became a bit of an anthem for his supporters over the past year and greeted the Labour leader's appearance at Glastonbury. His supporters have also chanted ""Jez we can"" during his leadership campaign rallies. Describing his family life in the interview, Mr Corbyn said he felt he had ""fallen by the wayside"" by going into politics while his three older brothers - Edward, Andrew and Piers - all became engineers and scientists. He spoke of his devastation at the death of his geologist brother, Andrew, from a brain haemorrhage while on an expedition to Papua New Guinea, saying that going there to collect his body was ""one of the most horrifying and horrific things"" he had ever done. Mr Corbyn also revealed that a neighbour had placed a bet on him to win the Labour leadership at a time when the odds were 200-1. ""Every day I go out on that campaign, he said, 'Are you going to win?'"" said Mr Corbyn. ""I said, 'I don't know'. ""He said, 'Look, I've put a lot of money on this - you've got to win.'

"This video can not be played UK set for long pay squeeze, says IFS director Paul Johnson The prediction that average UK earnings in 2022 could still be less than in 2008 is ""astonishing"", according to an independent economic think tank. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, added that the economic forecasts published in the Budget made for ""pretty grim reading"". He highlighted that since 2014 growth in earnings has been ""choked off"". ""We are in danger of losing not just one but getting on for two decades of earnings growth,"" he said. ""Let's hope this forecast turns out to be too pessimistic."" Mr Johnson was reacting to the productivity, earnings and economic growth forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which were released on Wednesday. Have your wages outstripped inflation? Live: Budget reaction and analysis What the Budget means for you At a glance summary: Budget key points The Chancellor,Philip Hammond, has saidhe hopes to prove the bleak economic forecasts released in the Budget wrong. The chancellor said clarity around Brexit would increase consumer confidence and lead to higher growth in the economy. What is the point of capitalism? That might seem like a pretty big question, but one answer could be ""to provide people the opportunity through work to become richer"". What, though, if the economy fails in that endeavour? If the system leaves you - despite all your efforts - worse off in December than you were the previous January? Or worse off now than you were a decade ago? It was Lord Adair Turner, the former head of the Low Pay Commission, who put it succinctly. ""The UK over the last 10 years has created a lot of jobs, but today real wages are below where they were in 2007,""he told me earlier this year. ""That is not the capitalist system delivering its promise that over a decade or so it will raise all boats, and it is a very fundamental issue."" More from Kamal On Wednesday, the OBR cut its growth forecast for the UK economy sharply, following changes to estimates of productivity and business investment. It now expects the economy to grow by 1.5% this year, down from its previous forecast of 2%. It also said growth would be weaker than previously thought in each of the subsequent four years. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the hit to the economy would ""hit all of society"". He said more government intervention and extra spending would ""pay for itself"" and alleviate the UK's productivity problem. Also on Thursday, another think tank, the Resolution Foundation, said that disposable incomes are now expected to be Â£540 lower by 2023 than forecast in March, largely as a result of weaker pay growth. The Foundationsaid that the UK is on course for its longest fall in living standards since records began more than 60 years ago, with real disposable incomes now set to fall for 19 successive quarters. Despite high levels of employment in the UK, wage growth has remained stubbornly low. This video can not be played Philip Hammond explains how the UK can get its economic forecast upgraded The latest official figures showedworkers' earnings, excluding bonuses, rose 2.2% in the three months to September compared with a year ago. But they fell 0.5% in real terms when accounting for inflation, marking seven months of negative pay growth, according to the Office for National Statistics. The lower forecasts for growth are also jeopardising the government's plan to balance the books by the mid 2020s. The IFS said it was highly unlikely Mr Hammond will meet that target. ""To get there we would have to have another round of spending cuts,"" IFS director Paul Johnson told the BBC.

"The UK is on course for its longest fall in living standards since records began over 60 years ago, the Resolution Foundation think tank has said. Its post-Budget analysis says the squeeze on incomes is set to last longer than that which followed the post-2008 crash. It says real disposable incomes are now set to fall for 19 successive quarters. The think tank was critical of the abolition of Stamp Duty for many first-time buyers. The Resolution Foundation is a not-for-profit research and policy organisation, which says its goal is to improve outcomes for people on low and modest incomes. In itsAutumn Budget response,external, it said the Â£3bn cost of the Stamp Duty measure broke down to a subsidy of Â£160,000 per extra home owner. The Foundation said this meant Chancellor Phillip Hammond could have simply bought people typically priced properties in over a quarter of local authorities, or built around 140,000 homes. In his Budget speech, Mr Hammond said young people would benefit from the move: ""This is our plan to deliver on the pledge we have made to the next generation that the dream of home ownership will become a reality in this country once again."" The Resolution Foundation's main focus was on the growth downgrade, which it said put the economy on course to be Â£42bn smaller in 2022 than previously expected. On Wednesday, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) cut its growth forecast sharply for 2017, from 2% to 1.5%, with growth for the next five years forecast to come in well under 2%. The Foundation said that tax and benefit policies were set to put downward pressure on living standards and upward pressure on inequality, and would take an average of Â£715 away from the poorest third of households a year, while giving Â£185 to the richest third. However, it welcomed the action taken by the government on Universal Credit. The chancellor announced a Â£1.5bn package to ""address concerns"" about the delivery of the benefit, and promised to scrap the initial seven-day waiting period for processing of claims. Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said: ""Faced with a grim economic backdrop, the chancellor will see this Budget as a political success. But that would be cold comfort for Britain's families given the bleak outlook it paints for their living standards. ""Hopefully the OBR's forecasts will prove to be wrong because, while the first sentence of the Budget document reads 'the United Kingdom has a bright future', the brutal truth is: not on these forecasts it doesn't."" One of the key issues holding back incomes is the slow pace of productivity growth, which was revised down by an average of 0.7% a year up to 2023. The Chancellor, Phillip Hammond, tried to address the productivity problem in Wednesday's Budget by expanding the National Productivity Investment Fund (NPIF). This was launched last year to provide additional investment in housing, infrastructure, and research and development. The Budget increases the size of the NPIF from Â£23bn to Â£31bn. He also is increasing the Research and Development (R&D) Expenditure Credit, effectively tax relief for companies doing R&D. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""Over three million more people are in work, and we are helping everyone earn more and keep more of what they earn. ""We are increasing the National Living Wage by an inflation-busting 4.4%, freezing fuel duty and taking millions of people out of income tax altogether. The only way to increase pay in the long term is to improve our productivity, so we are investing over Â£30bn across the country to boost digital connectivity, improve skills and training, and build an economy that is fit for the future."" Mr Hammond, who was under pressure from sections of his party in the run-up to Wednesday's speech, won praise for his Budget from Tory backbenchers.MPs told the BBCit was ""very solid"".

To put the figures into perspective, while there have been three recessions since the early 1980s there has not been a period since then when growth has been forecast to stay below 2% for more than three years in a row. Sharp cut to UK growth forecast The Resolution Foundation says disposable incomes are now expected to be Â£540 lower by 2023 than forecast in March, largely as a result of weaker pay growth. In a new report, it says real disposable incomes are now set to fall for 19 successive quarters. Prime Minister Theresa May said the government ""recognises the pressure facing ordinary families"", citing the freeze on fuel duty and increases to the personal tax allowance as measures ministers were taking.

Stamp duty is a tax paid by people when they buy a home worth more than a certain amount. Mr Hammond said the change, which would mean no stamp duty on the first Â£300,000 of a first-time buyer's home (as long as the total value is under Â£500,000) would benefit 95% of first-time buyers. But the Office for Budget Responsibility said the main gainers would be those who already owned a home. It also said the cut, which will initially only apply in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, would push house prices up by 0.3% and lead to only an extra 3,500 first-time buyer purchases. The policy will cost the Treasury Â£3.2bn over the next five years.

Here are some different ways of looking at the economic picture: MPs privately told the BBC the Budget was ""very solid"" and had been ""well received"" while one said it contained ""nothing too dangerous"" and would pass intact. While conceding the economic downgrades were ""significant"", Nicky Morgan - chairman of the Treasury select committee - said Mr Hammond had ""taken a common-sense approach"" and ""balanced fiscal credibility with demands for spending on multiple fronts"". Leading Brexit supporter John Redwood said the Budget was full of ""good proposals"", including the help for first-time buyers. But opposition parties have said the measures go only a small way to addressing the housing crisis in the country, and that an extraÂ£2.8bn for the NHSin England up to 2022 is insufficient.

"The effects of caffeine can vary from person to person Moderate coffee drinking is safe, and three to four cups a day may have some health benefits, according to a large review of studies, in the BMJ. It found a lower risk of liver disease and some cancers in coffee drinkers, and a lower risk of dying from stroke - but researchers could not prove coffee was the cause. Too much coffee during pregnancy could be harmful, the review confirmed. Experts said people should not start drinking coffee for health reasons. The University of Southampton researchers collected data on the impact of coffee on all aspects of the human body, taking into account more than 200 studies - most of which were observational. Coffee drinkers may live longer Cancer risk from coffee downgraded Is the UK reaching coffee shop saturation point? Compared with non-coffee drinkers, those who drank about three cups of coffee a day appeared to reduce their risk of getting heart problems or dying from them. The strongest benefits of coffee consumption were seen in reduced risks of liver disease, including cancer. But Prof Paul Roderick, co-author ofthe study,external, from the faculty of medicine at University of Southampton, said the review could not say if coffee intake had made the difference. ""Factors such as age, whether people smoked or not and how much exercise they took could all have had an effect,"" he said. Everything in moderation, including coffee The findings back up other recent reviews and studies of coffee drinking so, overall, his message on coffee was reassuring. ""There is a balance of risks in life, and the benefits of moderate consumption of coffee seem to outweigh the risks,"" he said. The NHS recommends pregnant women have no more than 200mg of caffeine a day - two mugs of instant coffee - because too much can increase the risk of miscarriage. This review suggests women at risk of fractures should also cut back on coffee. For other adults, moderate caffeine intake equates to 400mg or less per day - or three to four cups of coffee - but that isn't the only drink (or food) to bear in mind. one mug of filter coffee: 140mg one mug of instant coffee: 100mg one mug of tea: 75mg one can of cola: 40mg one 250ml can of energy drink: up to 80mg bar of plain chocolate: less than 25mg bar of milk chocolate: less than 10mg The researchers say coffee drinkers should stick to ""healthy coffees"" - which avoid extra sugar, milk or cream, or a fatty snack on the side. And they are calling for rigorous clinical trials on coffee intake to find out more about the potential benefits to health. Flea market photo shows 'Billy the Kid' Rihanna and Kim K back teenaged killer Graduate with 2:1 sues Oxford for Â£1m At present, the researchers said pinning down exactly how coffee might have a positive impact on health was ""difficult"" but it could be down to the effects of anti-oxidants and anti-fibrotics, which prevent or slow damage to cells in the body. Commenting on the BMJ review,external, Eliseo Guallar, from the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said there was still uncertainty about the effects of higher levels of coffee intake. But he added: ""Moderate coffee consumption seems remarkably safe, and it can be incorporated as part of a healthy diet by most of the adult population."" Best not to opt for sticky, sweet snacks with your espresso Tom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King's College London, said coffee drinkers may be healthier people to start with - and that could skew the findings. ""Coffee is known to cause headaches in some people and it also increases the urge to go to the toilet - some people chose not to drink coffee for these reasons.

"There has been a big fall in the number of workers starting apprenticeships in England since the introduction of the government's levy scheme earlier this year. The levy was supposed to increase the number of people training at work. But according to Department for Education figures, at the end of this academic year, between May and July, 48,000 people began an apprenticeship. That was less than half the 117,000 for the same period last year. The levy was introduced to raise Â£2.5bn a year for training and is payable by any organisation with a  wage bill over Â£3m. The government estimated that it would affect 2% of businesses. The levy applies to all UK employers; however Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland manage their own apprenticeship schemes. The aim is to fund up to three million new apprenticeships and the government has said it will ""support productivity growth through the increase in training"". Most firms are not large enough to be liable for the levy. However medium-sized firms with wage bills under Â£3m, that employ between 50 and 200 staff, are also faced with new responsibilities. They include releasing apprentices for one day a week for off-site training and contributing some of the training costs, which has made apprenticeships less popular. Apprenticeships: 'The money puts people off' Apprentices plan 'poor value for money' The DfE says it had expected there would be an initial drop-off in the number of people starting apprenticeships following the introduction of the levy. Employers paying the levy have 24 months to spend funds earmarked for apprenticeships, the DfE said, so they are taking time to formulate new schemes. Robert Halfon, who was apprenticeships and skills minister at the Department for Education until the reshuffle in June, said: ""Initially the number of starts has gone down, but I suspect over the coming year they will go back up again."" However, many industry experts say the scheme has been badly organised. ""The policy intent was great, the implementation has been diabolical,"" says Mark Dawe, chief executive of the Association of Employment and Learning Providers (AELP), whose members include independent trainers, employers and further education colleges. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development's (CIPD) skills adviser Lizzie Crowley, said 98% of firms were not large enough to be liable for the levy. But she said these companies were being put off offering more apprenticeships by the cost of releasing the trainees for one day a week and having to shoulder 10% of their off-site training fees ""whereas previously the vast majority would have received this free of charge"". The AELP said it had already made clear to the government what needed to be done to increase the number of apprenticeships. ""There needs to be appropriate flexibility of off-the-job training. In addition, employers without levy funding should not be charged for training 16-24 year old apprentices,"" said Mr Dawe. ""Without these actions, we do not believe the government will reach their manifesto commitment."" Verity Davidge, head of education and skills policy at the manufacturers' organisation the EEF, said some members had been ""left frustrated that the introduction of the levy has in, some cases, resulted in them being unable to offer and deliver apprenticeships"". Ms Davidge described the 59% drop in apprenticeships as ""shocking"" but added that it was ""frankly unsurprising as we continue to hear stories from companies who have hit a brick wall in trying to get levy-supported apprenticeships off the ground"". ""Accessing the funding has proven complex and difficult to unlock in time, and employers have struggled to get their heads around the complex rules and restrictions in accessing funds,"" she said. ""As a result some apprentices have been told that their apprenticeship has been put on hold for now, which is clearly a huge disappointment for young people who had effectively been offered a job - only to have their hopes dashed.""

"This video can not be played The University of Reading say molecules from burning fat could counteract global warming. Fatty acids released into the air from cooking may contribute to the formation of clouds that cool the climate, say scientists. Fatty acid molecules comprise about 10% of fine particulates over London, and such particles help seed clouds. But researchers dismiss the idea that cooking fats could be used as a geo-engineering tool to reduce warming. Instead, the research is designed to help reduce uncertainties about the role of cooking fats on climate. Researchers believe the fatty molecules arrange themselves into complex 3-D structures in atmospheric droplets. These aerosols persist for longer than normal and can seed the formation of clouds which experts say can have a cooling effect on the climate. The authors say the study will shed new light on the long term role of aerosols on temperatures. Atmospheric aerosols are one of the areas of climate science where there are considerable uncertainties. Molecules from deep fat frying may have a cooling effect on the climate The description covers tiny particles that can be either solid or liquid, ranging from the dusts of the Saharan desert to soot to aerosols formed by chemical reaction. These can have a variety of impacts, while most aerosols reflect sunlight back into space others absorb it. Warm North Sea link to birds' food decline Small steps forward at UN climate talks Europe steps in on climate science funding Aerosols and the clouds seeded by them, are said to reflect about a quarter of the Sun's energy back into space. Researchers have known for some time that the emissions of fatty acid molecules from chip pans and cookers may coat aerosol particles in the atmosphere - but this is the first time that scientists have looked at their role inside the droplets. Using ultrasonic levitation to hold individual droplets of brine and oleic acid in position, the research team was able to make them float so they could analyse them with a laser beam and X-rays. Fatty acid molecules were levitated so researchers could probe their interior structures The X-rays proved crucial in revealing the inner structure. ""We found these drops could form these self-assembled phases which means these molecules can stay much longer in the atmosphere,"" said lead author Dr Christian Pfrang, from the University of Reading. ""These self-assembled structures are highly viscous so instead of having a water droplet you have something that behaves much more like honey, so processes inside the droplet will slow down,"" he told BBC News. ""They are resistant to oxidation so they stay around longer, so cloud formation will be easier."" Scientists believe that the number of fatty acid molecules in the air is relatively high, comprising about 10% of the fine particulate matter over London, according to research published last year. This could be having an impact on the number of clouds and the amount of heat they reflect back into space. ""If you want to establish emissions control measures for McDonalds for example, you could assume that instead of two hours the molecules can last more than one day,"" said Dr Pfrang. ""Then this air parcel that comes from McDonalds will travel 10 times further, this is important for local air pollution but also to determine the effect of clouds which is the largest uncertainty."" ""We know that the complex structures we saw are formed by similar fatty acid molecules like soap in water,"" said co-lead author, Dr Adam Squires, from the University of Bath, ""There, they dramatically affect whether the mixture is cloudy or transparent, solid or liquid, and how much it absorbs moisture from the atmosphere in a lab. ""The idea that this may also be happening in the air above our heads is exciting, and raises challenges in understanding what these cooking fats are really doing to the world around us."" The researchers say that current large-scale atmospheric models do not account for the role of 3-D structures in aerosols at all, according to the research team. But they are dismissive of the idea that cooking fats could somehow be used as a form of geo-engineering to limit the impacts of global warming. Much more important they say, is to collect molecules from the atmosphere and bring them back for further study. ""If it does have an impact, it is likely to be a cooling one,"" said Dr Pfrang. ""And the extent urgently needs further research.""

"Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya people are now living in refugee camps like this one in Bangladesh Bangladesh has signed a deal with Myanmar to return hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims who fled a recent army crackdown. A statement from the Bangladesh foreign ministry said displaced people could begin to return within two months. The two sides say they are working on the details. The crisis has been called ethnic cleansing by the UN and the US. Aid agencies have raised concerns about the forcible return of the Rohingya unless their safety can be guaranteed. The Rohingya are a stateless minority who have long experienced persecution in Myanmar, also known as Burma. More than 600,000 have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh since deadly Rohingya attacks on police posts prompted a military crackdown in Rakhine state in late August. On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Myanmar's military action against the minority Rohingya population constituted ethnic cleansing. Why won't Aung San Suu Kyi act? Tales of horror from Myanmar Who are the Rohingya group behind attacks? ""The 'Arrangement' stipulates that the return shall commence within two months,"" a press release from the Bangladeshi government said. Few other details were released following the signing of the memorandum in Myanmar's capital Nay Pyi Taw. Bangladesh Foreign Minister Mahmood Ali said it was a ""first step"". Senior Myanmar official Myint Kyaing said it was ready to receive the Rohingya ""as soon as possible"". Myanmar's conditions of return remain unclear, and many Rohingya are terrified of being sent back. Refugees at Kutupalong Camp in Bangladesh said they want guarantees of citizenship and their land returned. ""We will go back if they don't harass us and if we can live life like the Buddhists and other ethnic minorities,"" one man, Sayed Hussein, told Reuters. ""I don't trust the Myanmar government. My husband left three times and this is my second time to leave. The Myanmar government is always like this,"" a woman, Narusha, said. Last weekMyanmar's powerful military head, Min Aung Hlaing, told Mr Tillerson that Rohingyas could return to Myanmar only if ""real citizens"" accepted them,external, referring to ethnic Rakhine members of the country's Buddhist majority. Both countries are under pressure on the issue, for different reasons. Bangladesh wants to show its population that the Rohingya will not be permanent residents - it was already hosting about 400,000 before the latest influx. The Burmese authorities - and particularly de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi - are responding to international calls to do more to resolve the crisis. This video can not be played Rohingya Muslims displaced from Tula Toli village in Rakhine State gave disturbing accounts to BBC Newsnight The UN refugee agency hoped any agreement would ""respect the right of refugees to return to Myanmar in a safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable way"". ""As the UN agency mandated to assist, protect and seek solutions for refugees, we stand ready to assist in the process to ensure that returns take place in line with international standards,"" a spokesperson said. UN failures on Rohingya revealed Amnesty International said it doubted there could be safe or dignified returns of Rohingya to Myanmar ""while a system of apartheid remains"" and added that it ""hoped those who do not want to go home are not forced to do so"". ""It is completely premature to be talking about returns when hundreds of Rohingya continue to flee persecution and arrive in Bangladesh on an almost daily basis,"" a spokesperson said. ""We're also concerned that the UN... have been completely sidelined from this process. This does not bode well for ensuring a really robust voluntary repatriation agreement that meets international standards."" Last weekthe Burmese army exonerated itself of blame regarding the Rohingyacrisis. It denied killing any Rohingya people, burning their villages, raping women and girls, and stealing possessions. The assertions contradict evidence seen by BBC correspondents. This video can not be played Watch: Who are the Rohingya? Pope Francis is due to arrive in Myanmar on 26 November.

Coffee drinkers may live longer Cancer risk from coffee downgraded Is the UK reaching coffee shop saturation point? Compared with non-coffee drinkers, those who drank about three cups of coffee a day appeared to reduce their risk of getting heart problems or dying from them. The strongest benefits of coffee consumption were seen in reduced risks of liver disease, including cancer. But Prof Paul Roderick, co-author ofthe study,external, from the faculty of medicine at University of Southampton, said the review could not say if coffee intake had made the difference. ""Factors such as age, whether people smoked or not and how much exercise they took could all have had an effect,"" he said. Everything in moderation, including coffee The findings back up other recent reviews and studies of coffee drinking so, overall, his message on coffee was reassuring. ""There is a balance of risks in life, and the benefits of moderate consumption of coffee seem to outweigh the risks,"" he said. The NHS recommends pregnant women have no more than 200mg of caffeine a day - two mugs of instant coffee - because too much can increase the risk of miscarriage. This review suggests women at risk of fractures should also cut back on coffee. For other adults, moderate caffeine intake equates to 400mg or less per day - or three to four cups of coffee - but that isn't the only drink (or food) to bear in mind. one mug of filter coffee: 140mg one mug of instant coffee: 100mg one mug of tea: 75mg one can of cola: 40mg one 250ml can of energy drink: up to 80mg bar of plain chocolate: less than 25mg bar of milk chocolate: less than 10mg The researchers say coffee drinkers should stick to ""healthy coffees"" - which avoid extra sugar, milk or cream, or a fatty snack on the side. And they are calling for rigorous clinical trials on coffee intake to find out more about the potential benefits to health. Flea market photo shows 'Billy the Kid' Rihanna and Kim K back teenaged killer Graduate with 2:1 sues Oxford for Â£1m At present, the researchers said pinning down exactly how coffee might have a positive impact on health was ""difficult"" but it could be down to the effects of anti-oxidants and anti-fibrotics, which prevent or slow damage to cells in the body. Commenting on the BMJ review,external, Eliseo Guallar, from the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said there was still uncertainty about the effects of higher levels of coffee intake. But he added: ""Moderate coffee consumption seems remarkably safe, and it can be incorporated as part of a healthy diet by most of the adult population."" Best not to opt for sticky, sweet snacks with your espresso Tom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King's College London, said coffee drinkers may be healthier people to start with - and that could skew the findings. ""Coffee is known to cause headaches in some people and it also increases the urge to go to the toilet - some people chose not to drink coffee for these reasons.

"People are being urged to beware of fake products and websites in the run-up to Christmas. Offers for mobile phones, clothes, shoes and jewellery are the most likely to be fraudulent, according to the Action Fraud group. Along with City of London police, it is appealing to people to give more thought to where they source presents. In 2016, it is estimated that nearly Â£16 million was lost to Christmas shopping fraud. Common items reported to the agency include fake Yeezy trainers, Kylie Jenner make-up, hair dryers, drones and Fitbit watches.

"This video can not be played The Labour leader was introduced on stage by Glastonbury Festival founder Michael Eavis His name was chanted by crowds at Glastonbury and emblazoned on T-shirts - but Jeremy Corbyn says he was never meant to be called ""Jeremy"" at all. The Labour leader said his parents had agreed a name for him shortly after his birth, in 1949 - only for his father to change his mind on the way to having it registered, without telling his mother. ""I was supposed to be called something else,"" he told comedian John Bishop. Mr Corbyn said his parents had never revealed their first choice of name. The Jeremy Corbyn Story: Profile of Labour leader The MP made the disclosure during TV channel W's John Bishop: In Conversation with Jeremy Corbyn programme, which airs at 21:00 GMT. Asked if his father, David, made the name-swap without consulting his wife, Mr Corbyn replied: ""Yes. To her dying day, she would never tell me what it was. ""I said, 'Can't you tell me what it was going to be?' She said, 'I can't tell you.' So we can only speculate."" The chant ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" - to the tune of the White Stripes' hit Seven Nation Army - became a bit of an anthem for his supporters over the past year and greeted the Labour leader's appearance at Glastonbury. His supporters have also chanted ""Jez we can"" during his leadership campaign rallies. Describing his family life in the interview, Mr Corbyn said he felt he had ""fallen by the wayside"" by going into politics while his three older brothers - Edward, Andrew and Piers - all became engineers and scientists. He spoke of his devastation at the death of his geologist brother, Andrew, from a brain haemorrhage while on an expedition to Papua New Guinea, saying that going there to collect his body was ""one of the most horrifying and horrific things"" he had ever done. Mr Corbyn also revealed that a neighbour had placed a bet on him to win the Labour leadership at a time when the odds were 200-1. ""Every day I go out on that campaign, he said, 'Are you going to win?'"" said Mr Corbyn. ""I said, 'I don't know'. ""He said, 'Look, I've put a lot of money on this - you've got to win.' No pressure, like. I was like, 'I've got to win this for him, now.'""

"This video can not be played 'They are destroying everything' Police in Papua New Guinea (PNG) have moved about 40 refugees and asylum seekers from a former Australian-run detention centre on Manus Island. But more than 300 others remain. They have been refusing to leave since the camp was shut on 31 October, saying they fear attacks from local people. Police moved in on Thursday and ordered the men to leave the camp. One refugee, a journalist, was briefly detained. Australia said it was a PNG operation. The PNG authorities have cut food, water and electricity and have told the remaining men they are squatters on defence force property. Meanwhile, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) called on both Papua New Guinea and Australia to ""engage in constructive dialogue, to de-escalate the tensions"", according to Reuters. Under a controversial policy, Australia has detained asylum seekers who arrive by boat in camps on Manus Island and Nauru, a small Pacific nation. Australia shut down the Manus Island centre after a PNG court ruled it was unconstitutional, urging asylum seekers to move to transit centres elsewhere on the island. 'Our situation is just like hell' Manus: Timeline of a key events Australia asylum: Why is it controversial? Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said his nation would ""not be pressured"" into accepting the men, reiterating a long-held policy that such a move would encourage human trafficking. ""They should obey the law and the lawful authorities of Papua New Guinea,"" Mr Turnbull said. One refugee, Abdul Aziz Adam, said about 420 asylum seekers were in the centre early on Thursday.

The Sudanese refugee told the BBC a large number of police officers had entered the compound. ""They had a really big microphone in their hands and started telling people 'you have to move'. They are taking all the phones away, destroying all the rooms and belongings and everything,"" he said. Another refugee, Iranian reporter Behrouz Boochani, was briefly detained. His arrest was described by Australia's journalism union, the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, as an ""egregious attack on press freedom"". A video and a separate photo appeared to show Mr Boochani being led away by officers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The journalist, a prominent voice within the centre, later tweeted that he had been ""handcuffed"" for more than two hours and had his belongings broken. In another tweet, he wrote that ""police beat up some of the refugees and forced them to the new prison camp in East Lorengau, Hillside Haus and West Haus"". Many of the asylum seekers have refused to leave because of safety fears on the island, where there is tension between them and the local community. Asylum seekers have been attacked in the past, rights groups say. Hywel Griffith, BBC News Sydney correspondent This is the most direct action so far by the PNG authorities, but it doesn't mean the stand-off is ending. In the last three weeks deadlines have come and gone, water supplies have been repeatedly disrupted, food has dwindled, and parts of the centre have been dismantled. With each step the resolve of the men who want to remain there seems only to have increased. They are anxious to try and keep the spotlight on Manus Island, and are likely to resist removal for as long as physically possible. Earlier, Mr Boochani tweeted that an Australian police officer appeared to be ""guiding"" some local officers. This was denied by Australian Federal Police, who said they had no involvement in the operation. Australia has repeatedly said that alternative accommodation for the asylum seekers is ready. However, the UN's refugee agency said on Tuesday that housing remained ""under construction"", was inadequately secured, and lacked ""the most basic services"" such as medical care. This video can not be played Inside the squalid Manus camp ""We were there and saw for ourselves that they are trying to complete the site as quickly as possible,"" said deputy regional representative Nai Jit Lam. The UN has said a majority of the men have refugee status. Canberra has steadfastly ruled out allowing the men into Australia, arguing it would prompt further human trafficking and lead to deaths at sea. Refugees had been given the option of permanent resettlement in PNG, applying to live in Cambodia, or requesting a transfer to Nauru. Advocates say few have taken up these options. The former detainees say authorities have destroyed items in the centre The US has agreed to take up to 1,250 refugees from Manus Island and Nauru under a resettlement deal. However, it may ultimately accept fewer than that. New Zealand has offered to take 150 refugees from the PNG centre, but Canberra has resisted this proposal - arguing it would effectively be a ""back door"" to Australia.

"Much of the rest of the world is growing at a healthier clip. For Britain it is a different story. Today theOffice for Budget Responsibility,external(OBR) downgraded growth forecasts for the next four years. And it has been more aggressive with those downgrades than the Bank of England was in its Inflation Report earlier in the month. The productivity problem is at the heart of that judgement. The UK just hasn't been very good at producing wealth for every hour worked, and today the OBR lowered its expectations about how fast productivity will recover. Which means that tax receipts will suffer, by up to Â£20bn a year by 2023. Add to that the increase in inflation following the Brexit referendum and the squeeze in real incomes and the OBR is clear - the economy is not as strong as it thought it would be. UK growth forecast cut sharply Live: Budget reaction and analysis What the Budget means for you At a glance summary: Budget key points The chancellor's response has been two-fold. First, he has tried to paint a positive vision of Britain's future He has talked of the good record on employment. And, in the short term, the news on borrowing is better as tax revenues have been higher and public spending lower. Second, he has significantly loosened the fiscal tight belt he had thrown around the economy. In March, Mr Hammond planned for two years of higher spending - giveaways - followed by three years of tax rises - takeaways. Now he has said that borrowing will be higher for every year of the five-year forecast, and higher spending will last until 2023. Many economists will welcome such a move, the government doing more to stimulate the economy. When the Bank of England raises rates, it increases the cost of the government's bills The chancellor has pledged more money for health, a stamp duty tax cut and Â£3bn to prepare for leaving the European Union. But debt will continue to rise, and that means the cost of servicing the amount the government borrows will increase. Much of the government's debt is index linked - so its cost rises if inflation goes up. And every time the Bank of England increases interest rates, that also increases the cost of repaying the government's bills. The worry in the Treasury is that they have used up a good deal of the public finances headroom Mr Hammond wanted to build up for the future in case Brexit uncertainty around the economy crystalizes into another growth downgrade. The question now is what will happen if he needs to find more funding and still hit his target to balance the government's books by the middle of the next decade. And of course very little inthis Budgetwill affect the key economic headwind everyone is facing. And that is the fall in real incomes.

"It wasn't a drama - it wasn't a Budget that would inspire queues at the Box Office. No surprise. When ""Box Office Phil"" was given that nickname, it wasn't because he has a reputation for delivering political thrillers. What he tried to do was to act on concerns expressed at the general election and by rebels on the Tory backbenches as well as the Labour opposition. So there were changes to the universal credit benefit, some, but certainly not all the money the NHS says it needs - and an enormous sounding figure of Â£44bn for housing over the next five years (although vital to wait for the detail of how much will go to getting spades in the ground, and how much will guarantee loans for the housing industry). Stamp duty cut for first time buyers Budget key points at-a-glance But he made a bigger-than-expected move to ""revive the home-owning dream"" by scrapping stamp duty on the first Â£300,000 of any property bought by a first-time buyer. The prime minister has set her own personal reputation on fixing the housing crisis, so there is a lot riding on the mixture of moves that has been promised by Philip Hammond today. He also responded to pressure from Brexit-backing colleagues in cabinet, by putting aside an extra Â£3bn to plan for a ""no deal"" scenario. What the chancellor also tried to do was to claim that somehow a corner has been turned in the long-term battle to sort out the country's books, with debt peaking and starting to fall as a share of national income. But it will be tricky for the government to escape the overall picture: that the economy looks like it will be more sluggish, will grow more slowly and will be less productive than expected for some time to come.

"This video can not be played All the best TMS moments from day one in Pint-sized Ashes First Ashes Test, Gabba, Brisbane (day one of five) England 196-4:Vince 83, Stoneman 53 Australia:Yet to bat Scorecard England's Ashes debutant James Vince made 83 before Australia fought back on day one of the first Test in Brisbane. Vince added 125 for the second wicket with Mark Stoneman either side of a 95-minute delay for rain at the Gabba. But Vince was run out by Nathan Lyon's superb direct hit, in between Pat Cummins bowling Stoneman for 53 and trapping captain Joe Root lbw for 15. England, the Ashes holders, closed on 196-4, with Dawid Malan 28 not out and Moeen Ali unbeaten on 13. Australians know who we are now - Vince 'Ashes newcomers show their mettle' Listen: Ashes highlights on TMS Listen: Test Match Special podcast The tourists battled hard after winning the toss and losing Alastair Cook in the third over, perhaps determined not to be blown away in the manner that saw them defeated 5-0 in Australia four years ago. But on a slow pitch, Vince and Stoneman - both of whom were playing their first Ashes Test - were kept in check by a home attack that rarely offered anything loose and will have use of a ball that is only three deliveries old on the second morning. If the surface does harden up over the next few days, Australia could get the best of the batting conditions and more pace for their bowlers in England's second innings. The visitors, therefore, are likely to require their lower and middle order to get them to at least 350 and, ideally, beyond. Play will start half an hour earlier than scheduled at 23:30 GMT on Thursday to make up for the 9.3 overs lost to the weather. How to follow the Ashes on the BBC Don't want to miss the action? Get Ashes alerts sent to your phone Pat Cummins, six years after making his debut, is playing his first Test in Australia Australia's proud record at the Gabba - they are unbeaten since 1988 - and an often hostile crowd has led to the 42,000-capacity ground being nicknamed 'the Gabbatoir'. However, England did not have to deal with Brisbane at its most raucous on Thursday. There was a massive roar when Cook was dismissed, but not until late in the day did the home fans have a real reason to get behind their team. On the contrary, England's travelling support sang Jersualem before play began and were lively deep into the final session. Some spectators relaxed in a swimming pool on the boundary edge, adding to an atmosphere that was more subdued than many expected for the opening skirmishes of this much-hyped contest. Spectators cool off at the Gabba Off-spinner Lyon attracted much attention with his pre-match comments, saying he hoped Australia couldend the careersof some England players during this series. Not only was he excellent with the ball, but in the field he produced the most decisive moment of the day. With Vince looking set for a century, he pushed the ball into the off side and set off for a single. Lyon moved from point, swooped and threw at the non-striker's end, a direct hit beating Vince's lunge for the crease. Soon after, Cummins got Root to play across a full ball, the initial not-out decision overturned on review. James Vince's previous highest score in seven Tests was 42 Hampshire's Vince averaged only 19 when he played seven Tests in 2016, so was something of a surprise selection when recalled for this tour to fill England's problem number three position. While Cook and Root - the two most established members of England's batting line-up - managed 17 runs between them, Vince and Stoneman showed commendable composure on their Ashes debuts. Arriving with England 2-1, 26-year-old Vince looked much more assured than in his previous attempt at Test cricket, showing the good judgement that has previously eluded him. Whenever Australia's pace bowlers went too full, he played his trademark drives, scoring heavily through the covers and point. Vince hit 12 fours in his Test-best 83 After Vince registered his maiden half-century, the runs dried up, particularly against Lyon. Indeed, Vince was dropped by recalled Australia wicketkeeper Tim Paine on 68 when Lyon found the outside edge. Still, he was on course for a memorable hundred when he was stopped by Lyon's brilliance. Stoneman has been England's form batsman of the tour, passing 50 in each of his previous four innings and registering their first century in the final warm-up game last week. Here the 30-year-old left-hander showed patience and concentration, leaving well outside off stump and mainly scoring on the leg side. His second-wicket partnership with Vince was bigger than anything England managed on their previous Ashes tour. Although Stoneman accumulated slowly - his half-century came from 150 balls - he looked solid and it was a surprise when Cummins nipped one between bat and pad to take the top of the stumps. Mark Stoneman added 125 with James Vince before he was bowled playing across the line Much of the talk in the build-up had been of Australia's three-pronged pace attack and its potential to emulate Mitchell Johnson's efforts of four years ago. And when Mitchell Starc had a flat-footed Cook caught at first slip from the 10th delivery he bowled, it was hard not to feel a sense of deja vu. But, hampered by the pitch and repelled by England's grit, Starc, Cummins and Josh Hazlewood had to settle for control. Indeed, Lyon was the pick of the bowlers, finding turn and conceding only 40 runs from 24 overs. Moeen and 30-year-old Ashes debutant Malan, who applied himself well to survive for an hour and a half, had nervous moments, a failed review for a Starc lbw appeal against Malan the last act before the umpires ended play because of bad light. Joe Root is only the sixth England captain to win the toss in the 21 Tests they have played at the Gabba Alastair Cook failed to reach 25 for the fifth successive Test innings Mark Stoneman and James Vince's second-wicket stand of 125 was higher than any England partnership managed in the entire 2013-14 Ashes It was England's first century partnership for the second wicket since Alastair Cook and Root's alliance against Pakistan at Old Trafford in 2016 Vince's 83 and Stoneman's 53 are their highest Test scores Australia have played 78 Tests since Tim Paine's previous appearance, a joint Australia record with Brad Hogg In reaching nine, Root passed 1,000 Test runs against Australia Pat Cummins is playing only his sixth Test in six years, and his first in Australia 'Ashes newcomers show their mettle' Australians 'know who we are now' Relive the opening day of the Ashes Couple get engaged in the Gabba's pool What England must do to win the Ashes - starting with not losing the first Test England in Australia 2017-18 Test Match Special: Clips and Podcast TMS Facebook TMS Twitter England and Wales Cricket Board Cricket Australia Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser EFL Cup semi-final: Spurs v Liverpool back underway as Bentancur suffers concerning injury West Ham to appoint Potter after sacking Lopetegui Scottish Premiership: Maeda puts Celtic ahead & Killie opener disallowed Paddyâs loaf-changing experience inside the bread factory Paddy McGuinness visits the factory he used to work in to find out how they bake 1.4 million loaves a week Dara Ã  Briain and Isy Suttie discover strange-but-true tales The pair are joined by astronaut Helen Sharman to learn about how humans learned to survive in space A round-up of 2024's top sports stories.

"Google says it will apply the new policy globally Google has announced tough new restrictions on ticket resellers, in an effort to combat fraud. From Januaryresellers will need to be certified by Google,externalbefore they use its AdWords service, which allows people to pay for prominent listings in its search results. The sellers must also disclose that the prices they charge may be higher than the face value. Google said the changes were intended ""to protect customers from scams"". They will target fraudsters who set up temporary websites selling non-existent tickets and who pay for a prominent slot on Google before disappearing with fans' money. But the rules also tighten up restrictions on secondary ticketing websites - who are often listed on Google ahead of official sellers, even when the original event isn't sold out. This has often caused confusion for consumers, with Swiss-based firm Viagogo coming in for particular criticism after posing as an ""official"" outlet in search listings - despite selling second-hand tickets. Ed Sheeran ticket adverts criticised The O2 criticised for links to StubHub Ticket sites 'must fight touts' Google's updated policy says sites like Viagogo, as well as StubHub, Get Me In and Seatwave, must make it clear they are resellers, rather than primary agents. From March 2018, the company will also require certified resellers to post the face value of the tickets along with the reseller's price. In the UK, this is currently a requirement under the Consumer Rights Act - but many companies have struggled, or been unwilling, to comply with the rules. Campaign group FanFair Alliance, which calls for greater regulation of the secondary ticketing market, welcomed Google's clampdown. Ed Sheeran fans were targeted by secondary ticketing sites when his tour went on sale ""This is a hugely welcome move, with potential to make the ticket-buying process far less complex for consumers,"" it said in a statement. The group said recent research showed ""a significant proportion of would-be ticket buyers use Google to find tickets"", a fact that secondary ticketing sites exploit by paying for higher search rankings. ""At best, such marketing practices could be construed as misleading -  with music fans systematically directed towards dedicated ticket touts listing above-face value tickets, even when primary inventory is still available from authorised sellers."" Google's move comes three months after MPs criticised the search engine for promoting touts through its AdWords services. ""This throws up an important issue for Google - they are making money out of this process,"" said Damian Collins, chair of the culture, media and sport committee. ""They must act against ticket touts, it's a clear breach of their guidelines."" Ed Sheeran's tour promoter also criticised Google after adverts pointed fans towards Viagogo, where tickets for the singer's tour were being sold at inflated prices. ""Google needs to bow to pressure and stop taking money for tickets which are sold on the secondary market,""he told Radio 4 earlier this year.

"This video can not be played Emmerson Mnangagwa addresses supporters in Harare Zimbabwe's incoming leader Emmerson Mnangagwa has hailed a ""new and unfolding democracy"" after returning from exile to replace Robert Mugabe. He also vowed to create jobs in a country where some estimates say 90% of people are unemployed. ""We want to grow our economy, we want peace, we want jobs, jobs, jobs,"" he told a cheering crowd in Harare. Mr Mnangagwa, who fled to South Africa two weeks ago, is to be made the new president on Friday, state TV said. His dismissal led the ruling party and the military to intervene and force an end to Mr Mugabe's 37-year long rule. Mugabe has gone, but will Zimbabwe change? Five things Zimbabwe's economy urgently needs Mugabe's downfall: The unanswered questions He told supporters at the headquarters of the ruling Zanu-PF party that he had been the subject of several assassination plots and thanked the army for running the ""process"" of removing Mr Mugabe peacefully. This video can not be played How news of Robert Mugabe's resignation was greeted across Zimbabwe The news that 93-year-old Mr Mugabe was stepping down sparked wild celebrations across the country late into Tuesday night. It came in the form of a letter read out in parliament on Tuesday, abruptly halting impeachment proceedings against him. In it, Mr Mugabe said he was resigning to allow a smooth and peaceful transfer of power, and that his decision was voluntary. Zanu-PF purges itself to win back Zimbabweans' trust Emmerson Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back A spokesman for the ruling Zanu-PF party said Mr Mnangagwa, 71, would serve the remainder of Mr Mugabe's term until elections that are due to be held by September 2018. Nicknamed the ""crocodile"" because of his political cunning, Mr Mnangagwa met South African President Jacob Zuma before leaving for Zimbabwe. BBC's Shingai Nyoka in Harare Thousands of party supporters waited for hours to welcome Mr Mnangagwa in his first public appearance since he emerged from hiding. During his 20-minute speech, he corrected himself at least once for referring to Mr Mugabe as president rather than former president. His message was largely conciliatory. But he also relished his stunning return to power and successful removal of Mr Mugabe. He brought up Grace Mugabe's speech a fortnight ago, in which - meaning him - she said we must ""deal with the snake by crushing its head"". A day later he was fired. ""I wonder which snake's head was crushed?"" he said to loud cheers. Mr Mnangagwa's firing by Mr Mugabe two weeks ago triggered an unprecedented political crisis in the country. It had been seen by many as an attempt to clear the way for Grace Mugabe to succeed her husband as leader and riled the military leadership, which stepped in and put Mr Mugabe under house arrest. Mugabe's long career in pictures The polarising Grace Mugabe Robert Mugabe: Hero or villain? Under the constitution, the role of successor would normally go to a serving vice-president, and one still remains in post - Phelekezela Mphoko. However, Mr Mphoko - a key ally of Mrs Mugabe - has just been fired by Zanu-PF and is not believed to be in the country. In his absence, the party has nominated Mr Mnangagwa, the speaker of parliament confirmed. Some have questioned whether the handover to Mr Mnangagwa will bring about real change in the country. He was national security chief at a time when thousands of civilians died in post-independence conflict in the 1980s, though he denies having blood on his hands. This video can not be played BBC correspondent Andrew Harding looks for Grace Mugabe in her heartland Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai told the BBC he hoped that Zimbabwe was on a ""new trajectory"" that would include free and fair elections. He said Mr Mugabe should be allowed to ""go and rest for his last days"". Prominent opposition politician David Coltart tweeted: ""We have removed a tyrant but not yet a tyranny."" African Union president Alpha CondÃ© said he was ""truly delighted"" by the news, but expressed regret at the way Mr Mugabe's rule had ended. ""It is a shame that he is leaving through the back door and that he is forsaken by the parliament,"" he said. At 93, Mr Mugabe was - until his resignation - the world's oldest leader. He once proclaimed that ""only God"" could remove him. Lawmakers from the ruling party and opposition roared with glee when his resignation letter was read aloud in parliament on Wednesday.

"Jon Venables was 10 when he and Robert Thompson killed James Bulger One of the killers of toddler James Bulger has been recalled to prison suspected of having child abuse images on his computer. It is the second time Jon Venables has been sent back to jail for the same suspected offence. In a statement, James's mother Denise Fergus said: ""Venables has now proved beyond any doubt what a vile, perverted psychopath he has always been."" The 35-year-old was recalled last week but has not yet been charged. He was first recalled in 2010, following his release in 2001 after serving eight years for the murder of James, aged two, in 1993. James Bulger was two when he was abducted and killed in 1993 Ms Fergus went on to say: ""I predicted Venables would re-offend unless they kept a very tight rein on him and I pray that now, someone from the UK government will finally listen to me."" She said ""what hurts me most is the way the probation service has tried to cover this up"", adding she was only told on Wednesday night that Venables was taken back into custody a week ago. Mrs Fergus said it was ""clear that they were trying to keep this quiet, until they got a call from the media"". She said she received ""a hurried call"" from the probation service at 20:40 GMT with ""few details given, just that he had breached his terms of the licence and returned to prison"", which left her ""extremely upset, angry and feeling insulted"". She said she would consider making a formal complaint to the probation service. Denise Fergus ""feared"" Venables would re-offend A Ministry of Justice (MoJ) spokeswoman said it takes the duty of updating victims' families ""extremely seriously"". ""A dedicated victim liaison officer contacts families as soon as the offender is charged, but we regret the additional distress this has caused in this case. ""We want to reassure Mrs Fergus and Mr Bulger [James's father] that a liaison officer will continue to stay in regular contact with them as the case progresses."" On 12 February 1993, James - just a few weeks short of his third birthday - was reported missing by his mother from outside a butcher's shop in the New Strand Shopping Centre in Bootle, Merseyside. CCTV images showed James Bulger being led away by the two boys in a shopping centre CCTV images revealed he had been lured away by Venables and Robert Thompson, both then aged 10. His body was found two days later on a railway line. He had been stripped from the waist down, paint had been thrown in his eyes and he had been beaten to death with bricks and a metal bar. Thompson and Venables were arrested and charged within days. They were both convicted at Preston Crown Court of James's murder, in November 1993. In 2001, the pair were released - with new identities - from secure children's homes on life licence, meaning they can be recalled at any time. What appear to be images of child abuse were found on a computer linked to Jon Venables last week, during a routine visit. He was recalled to prison immediately. The police force investigating him has not been named, as it might reveal where he has been living under a second new identity. Venables was jailed for life in 1993 for murdering and torturing two-year-old James Bulger. He was first released - on licence - in 2001, but jailed again in 2010 for possession of child abuse images. He was released a second time in 2013, at which point James Bulger's parents said they were ""filled with terror"". The parole board will now have to decide whether - or when - it is safe to release him again, and will take into account if he appears to be re-offending in a similar vein. Venables was recalled to prison in 2010 after accessing images of child abuse and breaching his parole conditions by visiting Merseyside. He had developed drug and drink problems, started behaving anti-socially and had revealed his real identity to friends. Venables was released again in 2013 with a second new identity.

"Historians believe the photo shows Billy the Kid (second from left) and Pat Garrett (far right) A photo discovered by a US lawyer at a flea market may be a rare image of Wild West outlaw Billy the Kid and could be worth millions, experts have said. Frank Abrams bought the tintype photo in North Carolina for $10 (Â£7) and put it up in the guest room of his home. He consulted experts after watching a TV programme about the discovery of another photo of Billy the Kid. Historians told Mr Abrams his photo may show the outlaw with his future killer. Mr Abrams, a criminal defence lawyer, bought the tintype photo - which is an image produced on a thin sheet of metal - at a flea market near the city of Asheville in 2011. He told BBC News he decided to have it analysed by experts at the Billy the Kid museum in New Mexico after watching a programme in 2015 about a newly found photo of the gunslinger playing croquet. The croquet photo had been valued at around $5m. Mr Abrams came to suspect that one of the five men pictured in his tintype image was Patrick Floyd Garrett. Garrett and Billy the Kid were said to have been close friends until Garrett became sheriff of Lincoln County, New Mexico. Sheriff Garrett is remembered for gunning down the outlaw in 1881. Mr Abrams said his photo - which is dated 2 August 1880 - hung for several years on the wall of a spare room in his home that he rented out through Airbnb. ""If I had known it was one of the most famous photos in history, I would have charged more for the room,"" he laughed. Mr Abrams enlisted Robert Stahl, professor emeritus at Arizona State University, as well as several other forensic experts, to identify whether his image did indeed show Sheriff Garrett and Billy the Kid. William Dunniway, a tintype expert, told the New York Times the photo was probably taken between 1875-80. Mr Dunniway worked with Los Angeles forensic video expert Kent Gibson to investigate the picture. Mr Gibson used facial recognition software to conclude it was most likely a photo of Billy the Kid and Sheriff Garrett. A handwriting expert in Texas compared a signature from Sheriff Garrett on the photo with 10 documents that included his handwriting. He found a match, the Associated Press news agency reported. Although experts say the photo may be worth millions of dollars, Mr Abrams says he is no rush to sell it. ""I've never put a price on it,"" he said in a telephone interview with BBC News. ""My interest is in the history,"" he added. The image that experts say shows Billy the Kid playing croquet was bought in 2010 for $2 from a junk shop in Fresno, California. Three cups of coffee a day 'may have health benefits' Rihanna and Kim K back teenaged killer Graduate with 2:1 sues Oxford for Â£1m The only other authenticated portrait of the gunslinger sold for $2.3m in 2011 at an auction in Denver, Colorado. That tintype depicts the gunfighter in rumpled clothes and a hat, gazing at the camera and holding a Winchester rifle. The outlaw - who was born Henry McCarty but later took the alias William Bonney - was reputedly born in New York. He is thought to have moved to Colorado with his mother and brothers when his father died. The gunslinger fell into a career of thievery and lawlessness and was hunted across the southern US states and northern Mexico. He is widely thought to have killed 21 people, though some sources put the figure as high as 27. Billy the Kid was captured and sentenced to hang for the 1878 murder of a county sheriff. He escaped, only to be hunted down and killed by Sheriff Garrett on 14 July 1881.

"Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya people are now living in refugee camps like this one in Bangladesh Bangladesh has signed a deal with Myanmar to return hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims who fled a recent army crackdown. A statement from the Bangladesh foreign ministry said displaced people could begin to return within two months. The two sides say they are working on the details. The crisis has been called ethnic cleansing by the UN and the US. Aid agencies have raised concerns about the forcible return of the Rohingya unless their safety can be guaranteed. The Rohingya are a stateless minority who have long experienced persecution in Myanmar, also known as Burma. More than 600,000 have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh since deadly Rohingya attacks on police posts prompted a military crackdown in Rakhine state in late August. On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Myanmar's military action against the minority Rohingya population constituted ethnic cleansing. Why won't Aung San Suu Kyi act? Tales of horror from Myanmar Who are the Rohingya group behind attacks? ""The 'Arrangement' stipulates that the return shall commence within two months,"" a press release from the Bangladeshi government said. Few other details were released following the signing of the memorandum in Myanmar's capital Nay Pyi Taw. Bangladesh Foreign Minister Mahmood Ali said it was a ""first step"". Senior Myanmar official Myint Kyaing said it was ready to receive the Rohingya ""as soon as possible"". Myanmar's conditions of return remain unclear, and many Rohingya are terrified of being sent back. Refugees at Kutupalong Camp in Bangladesh said they want guarantees of citizenship and their land returned. ""We will go back if they don't harass us and if we can live life like the Buddhists and other ethnic minorities,"" one man, Sayed Hussein, told Reuters. ""I don't trust the Myanmar government. My husband left three times and this is my second time to leave. The Myanmar government is always like this,"" a woman, Narusha, said. Last weekMyanmar's powerful military head, Min Aung Hlaing, told Mr Tillerson that Rohingyas could return to Myanmar only if ""real citizens"" accepted them,external, referring to ethnic Rakhine members of the country's Buddhist majority. Both countries are under pressure on the issue, for different reasons. Bangladesh wants to show its population that the Rohingya will not be permanent residents - it was already hosting about 400,000 before the latest influx. The Burmese authorities - and particularly de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi - are responding to international calls to do more to resolve the crisis. This video can not be played Rohingya Muslims displaced from Tula Toli village in Rakhine State gave disturbing accounts to BBC Newsnight The UN refugee agency hoped any agreement would ""respect the right of refugees to return to Myanmar in a safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable way"". ""As the UN agency mandated to assist, protect and seek solutions for refugees, we stand ready to assist in the process to ensure that returns take place in line with international standards,"" a spokesperson said. UN failures on Rohingya revealed Amnesty International said it doubted there could be safe or dignified returns of Rohingya to Myanmar ""while a system of apartheid remains"" and added that it ""hoped those who do not want to go home are not forced to do so"". ""It is completely premature to be talking about returns when hundreds of Rohingya continue to flee persecution and arrive in Bangladesh on an almost daily basis,"" a spokesperson said. ""We're also concerned that the UN... have been completely sidelined from this process. This does not bode well for ensuring a really robust voluntary repatriation agreement that meets international standards."" Last weekthe Burmese army exonerated itself of blame regarding the Rohingyacrisis. It denied killing any Rohingya people, burning their villages, raping women and girls, and stealing possessions. The assertions contradict evidence seen by BBC correspondents. This video can not be played Watch: Who are the Rohingya? Pope Francis is due to arrive in Myanmar on 26 November.

Along with City of London police, it is appealing to people to give more thought to where they source presents. In 2016, it is estimated that nearly Â£16 million was lost to Christmas shopping fraud. Common items reported to the agency include fake Yeezy trainers, Kylie Jenner make-up, hair dryers, drones and Fitbit watches. Latest figures suggest that Christmas fraud increased by 25% between 2015 and 2016. Analysis of last year's crimes also suggests that 65% of crimes at Christmas were linked to online auctions.

"This video can not be played Philip Hammond explains how the UK can get its economic forecast upgraded Philip Hammond says he hopes to prove the bleak economic forecasts released in his Budget wrong. The chancellor said clarity around Brexit would increase consumer confidence and lead to higher growth in the economy. But a new report has warned of the longestfall in people's living standardssince records began over 60 years ago. Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said the economy was ""on its knees"". He said the chancellor had provided ""not a penny more"" for police, social care, mental health, children's services or public sector pay and public sector workers would see living standards ""continue to fall for years to come"". Follow the latest Budget reaction Budget calculator: Are you better or worse off? Warning of long living standards squeeze Stagnant earnings forecast 'astonishing' Key points at-a-glance: A Budget summary The reduced growth forecasts, blamed on the economy's flat productivity, threatened to overshadow a series of announcements in the Budget. These included a cut instamp dutyfor most first-time buyers and setting aside Â£3bn for preparations for the UK to leave the EU. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Hammond, who has been under pressure from Eurosceptic Tory MPs, would be ""broadly content"" with how his big day had played out, but that ""very difficult questions"" about the state of the economy remained. There is a warning by theResolution Foundation,externalthink tank that the squeeze on people's incomes is set to last longer than that which followed the post-2008 crash. Philip Hammond and Theresa May visited a construction college in Leeds the morning after the Budget The chancellor told BBC Breakfast there was always going to be uncertainty about the outcome of Brexit negotiations. But he said moving into 2018 there would be a ""sense of movement"", and that ""confidence will return, certainty about the future will return, businesses will start investing, consumers will start buying big ticket consumer items again and that will help to get our economy growing again faster"". He also denied being ""gloomy"" about the UK's prospects outside the EU, a criticism he has faced from some within his party. What the Budget 2017 means for you In depth: The BBC's Budget coverage Read Laura's blog in full On the predictions by the Office for Budget Responsibility, he said: ""The challenge for us as a nation is to prove them wrong."" This video can not be played John McDonnell tells Today any increase in the national debt would ""pay for itself"" over time But the Conservative former deputy PM Lord Heseltine told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour: ""He's boxed in. We've got a low-growth economy, we've got the shadow of Brexit over-hanging, we've got years of low growth ahead of us, a very significant problem with productivity. ""If I may borrow somebody else's phrase, there's no money left. So what Philip has had to do is to put sticking plasters on some difficult issues as best he can."" The Office for Budget Responsibility slashed its 2017 growth forecast from 2% to 1.5%. Output, it added, would be weaker than previously thought in each of the subsequent four years. This video can not be played The BBC's political, economics and business editors on the announcements in Philip Hammond's Budget. To put the figures into perspective, while there have been three recessions since the early 1980s there has not been a period since then when growth has been forecast to stay below 2% for more than three years in a row. Sharp cut to UK growth forecast The Resolution Foundation says disposable incomes are now expected to be Â£540 lower by 2023 than forecast in March, largely as a result of weaker pay growth. In a new report, it says real disposable incomes are now set to fall for 19 successive quarters. Prime Minister Theresa May said the government ""recognises the pressure facing ordinary families"", citing the freeze on fuel duty and increases to the personal tax allowance as measures ministers were taking. This video can not be played The chancellor abolishes stamp duty on homes under Â£300,000 to help first-time buyers. Stamp duty is a tax paid by people when they buy a home worth more than a certain amount. Mr Hammond said the change, which would mean no stamp duty on the first Â£300,000 of a first-time buyer's home (as long as the total value is under Â£500,000) would benefit 95% of first-time buyers. But the Office for Budget Responsibility said the main gainers would be those who already owned a home. It also said the cut, which will initially only apply in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, would push house prices up by 0.3% and lead to only an extra 3,500 first-time buyer purchases. The policy will cost the Treasury Â£3.2bn over the next five years. Freezing alcohol duty apart from an increase in duty on high-strength white ciders The price of 20 cigarettes goes up by 28p and by 41p for 30g of rolling tobacco A promise to fund a pay rise for nurses if one is recommended by an independent panel A one-offtax on new diesel carsthat do not meet latest emissions standards Â£28m for Kensington and Chelsea council for counselling and regeneration after Grenfell Tower fire Bringing forward a plannedcut in business rate risesby two years to 2018 Support for electric cars including a Â£400m charging infrastructure fund Anew railcardoffering discounts to those aged between 26 and 30 Changes to universal credit to bring the overall waiting time down from six weeks to five. Here are some different ways of looking at the economic picture: MPs privately told the BBC the Budget was ""very solid"" and had been ""well received"" while one said it contained ""nothing too dangerous"" and would pass intact. While conceding the economic downgrades were ""significant"", Nicky Morgan - chairman of the Treasury select committee - said Mr Hammond had ""taken a common-sense approach"" and ""balanced fiscal credibility with demands for spending on multiple fronts"". Leading Brexit supporter John Redwood said the Budget was full of ""good proposals"", including the help for first-time buyers. But opposition parties have said the measures go only a small way to addressing the housing crisis in the country, and that an extraÂ£2.8bn for the NHSin England up to 2022 is insufficient.

"Much of the rest of the world is growing at a healthier clip. For Britain it is a different story. Today theOffice for Budget Responsibility,external(OBR) downgraded growth forecasts for the next four years. And it has been more aggressive with those downgrades than the Bank of England was in its Inflation Report earlier in the month. The productivity problem is at the heart of that judgement. The UK just hasn't been very good at producing wealth for every hour worked, and today the OBR lowered its expectations about how fast productivity will recover. Which means that tax receipts will suffer, by up to Â£20bn a year by 2023. Add to that the increase in inflation following the Brexit referendum and the squeeze in real incomes and the OBR is clear - the economy is not as strong as it thought it would be. UK growth forecast cut sharply Live: Budget reaction and analysis What the Budget means for you At a glance summary: Budget key points The chancellor's response has been two-fold. First, he has tried to paint a positive vision of Britain's future He has talked of the good record on employment. And, in the short term, the news on borrowing is better as tax revenues have been higher and public spending lower. Second, he has significantly loosened the fiscal tight belt he had thrown around the economy. In March, Mr Hammond planned for two years of higher spending - giveaways - followed by three years of tax rises - takeaways. Now he has said that borrowing will be higher for every year of the five-year forecast, and higher spending will last until 2023. Many economists will welcome such a move, the government doing more to stimulate the economy. When the Bank of England raises rates, it increases the cost of the government's bills The chancellor has pledged more money for health, a stamp duty tax cut and Â£3bn to prepare for leaving the European Union. But debt will continue to rise, and that means the cost of servicing the amount the government borrows will increase. Much of the government's debt is index linked - so its cost rises if inflation goes up. And every time the Bank of England increases interest rates, that also increases the cost of repaying the government's bills. The worry in the Treasury is that they have used up a good deal of the public finances headroom Mr Hammond wanted to build up for the future in case Brexit uncertainty around the economy crystalizes into another growth downgrade. The question now is what will happen if he needs to find more funding and still hit his target to balance the government's books by the middle of the next decade. And of course very little inthis Budgetwill affect the key economic headwind everyone is facing. And that is the fall in real incomes.

"Stamp duty will be abolished immediately for first-time buyers buying a home of up to Â£300,000, Chancellor Philip Hammond has said. For properties costing up to Â£500,000, no stamp duty will be paid on the first Â£300,000. Mr Hammond said this meant 95% of first-time buyers would see stamp duty cut, while 80% would pay none at all. The change will apply in England and Northern Ireland, and in Wales up until the end of March, but not in Scotland. Scotland has an independent system of land tax. Stamp duty will be devolved to Wales from March 2018. In the rest of the UK stamp duty is paid on all residential properties worth more than Â£125,000. The duty is levied at a staggered rate above that threshold, starting at 2% but increasing in line with the value of the property being bought. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said the main beneficiaries would be existing homeowners, rather than first-time buyers, because it expects all house prices to rise by 0.3% within a year as a result of the change. It also estimates that it will result in only an additional 3,500 first-time buyer purchases. However, the chancellor insisted that young people will benefit. ""This is our plan to deliver on the pledge we have made to the next generation that the dream of home ownership will become a reality in this country once again,"" Mr Hammond said. Live: Budget reaction and analysis What the Budget means for you At a glance summary: Budget key points The policy will cost the Treasury Â£3.2bn over the next five years. Andrew Norfolk, who is saving to buy a property in Cambridge, said the Stamp Duty change was a start, but more could be done. ""As a 26-year-old, working in a well-paid professional job, I find it ridiculous how difficult it is to get on the ladder without help from mum and dad. ""If I'm struggling - and I consider my position more fortunate than most - how on earth do most people ever stand a chance at home ownership?"" Estate agent Savills estimates that the average stamp duty bill for first-time buyers is about Â£2,700. But in many parts of the country, first-time buyers will see no - or very little - saving at all. In the North of England, the average Stamp Duty charge is just Â£11.82, according to analysts at AJ Bell. This is because average house prices in the region are only just above the English Stamp Duty threshold, at Â£125,000. However, buyers who spend Â£500,000 could save up to Â£5,000. ""The stamp duty relief for first time buyers announced in today's budget will be a welcome boost to people purchasing their first home but the impact will be felt disproportionately in the South of England,"" said Tom Selby, senior analyst at AJ Bell. For all first-time buyers, the deposit is a bigger up-front cost than Stamp Duty. The average deposit across the UK is Â£32,899, according to the Halifax, compared to the average Stamp Duty charge of Â£1,654.What does the stamp duty change mean? Tom Kibasi, of the centre-left think tank the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR), said: ""Unaffordable house prices are the problem, not Stamp Duty. For most young people, the stamp duty cut will make little difference. But it will help the beneficiaries of the bank of mum and dad."" The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) pointed out a ""cliff edge"" situation in high-priced areas. A first-time buyer paying Â£500,001 for a home will pay Â£5,000 more in Stamp Duty than someone paying Â£500,000, it said. Other commentators agreed with the OBR that prices will rise as a result. ""Pouring financial fuel on house prices will only result in even higher house prices, just as Help to Buy has done and as previous Stamp Duty holidays have,"" said property expert Henry Pryor.

"It wasn't a drama - it wasn't a Budget that would inspire queues at the Box Office. No surprise. When ""Box Office Phil"" was given that nickname, it wasn't because he has a reputation for delivering political thrillers. What he tried to do was to act on concerns expressed at the general election and by rebels on the Tory backbenches as well as the Labour opposition. So there were changes to the universal credit benefit, some, but certainly not all the money the NHS says it needs - and an enormous sounding figure of Â£44bn for housing over the next five years (although vital to wait for the detail of how much will go to getting spades in the ground, and how much will guarantee loans for the housing industry). Stamp duty cut for first time buyers Budget key points at-a-glance But he made a bigger-than-expected move to ""revive the home-owning dream"" by scrapping stamp duty on the first Â£300,000 of any property bought by a first-time buyer. The prime minister has set her own personal reputation on fixing the housing crisis, so there is a lot riding on the mixture of moves that has been promised by Philip Hammond today. He also responded to pressure from Brexit-backing colleagues in cabinet, by putting aside an extra Â£3bn to plan for a ""no deal"" scenario. What the chancellor also tried to do was to claim that somehow a corner has been turned in the long-term battle to sort out the country's books, with debt peaking and starting to fall as a share of national income. But it will be tricky for the government to escape the overall picture: that the economy looks like it will be more sluggish, will grow more slowly and will be less productive than expected for some time to come.

"ISPs will no longer be able to use the term 'up to' about speeds of service Broadband firms will no longer be able to advertise their fast net services based on the speeds just a few customers get, from May next year. Currently ISPs are allowed to use headline speeds that only 10% of customers will actually receive. In future, adverts must be based on what is available to at least half of customers at peak times. It follows research that suggested broadband advertising can be misleading for consumers. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) looked into consumers' understanding of broadband speed claims and found that many were confused by headline speeds that they would never actually get in their own homes. The concerns were passed on to the Committees of Advertising Practice (Cap) which consulted with ISPs, consumer groups and Ofcom to find a better way to advertise fast net services. Most argued that the fairest and clearest way would be to use the average speeds achieved at peak time by 50% of customers. As well as insisting ISPs use ""average"" instead of ""up to"" speeds, Cap also urged ISPs to promote speed-checking facilities in their adverts so that users could test out the speeds they were likely to get from any given service. Director of the Committees of Advertising Practice, Shahriar Coupal, said: ""There are a lot of factors that affect the broadband speed a customer is going to get in their own home; from technology to geography, to how a household uses broadband. ""Our new standards will give consumers a better understanding of the broadband speeds offered by different providers when deciding to switch providers."" The UK's minister for digital Matt Hancock welcomed the change, describing it as a ""victory for consumers"". ""I'm delighted to see that Cap is finally changing the way broadband speeds are advertised. Headline 'up to' speeds that only need to be available to 10% of consumers are incredibly misleading - customers need clear, concise and accurate information in order to make an informed choice."" The ASA also considered whether the use of ""fibre"" in broadband advertising was misleading for ISPs that only use fibre to the road-side phone cabinet, relying on a copper connection for the so-called last mile to a consumer's home. It found that most people saw the use of fibre as a ""shorthand buzzword"" to describe fast broadband and concluded that it was not misleading for ISPs the use the term. Alex Neill from consumer group Which? said millions of households were currently experiencing broadband speeds that do not meet expectations. She said: ""It is good to see people may finally see the speeds they could achieve before they sign up to a deal."" Andrew Ferguson, editor of broadband news website ThinkBroadband said packages previously advertised as up to 38Mbps (megabits per second) will drop to speeds of between 24 and 30Mbps. Services currently marketed at up to 76Mbps are likely to be in the 45 to 55Mbps region, he added, while those advertised as up to 17Mbps could fall as low as 6Mbps under the new rules. ""People shouldn't expect adverts to change overnight, as most changes are likely to emerge in April just ahead of the deadline,"" he told the BBC. ""However, consumers may start to see a much wider variety of speeds in adverts, and with the addition of the peak time period (defined as 8pm to 10pm) there is likely to be more variation between providers. ""As a result, some providers may elect to refuse service to customers likely to get speeds at the slower end of the scale, which restricts provider choice. Others may not sell the advertised service but instead push customers to a technically identical service marketed under a different name.""

"Serious work on restoring Zimbabwe's finances need to begin once the celebrations over Robert Mugabe's departure have ended Current events in Zimbabwe show that while a week may be a long time in politics, it is really a very short blink of an eye in economics. Zimbabweans on the streets of Harare and Bulawayo may be hopeful for political change, but they are much more sanguine and realistic when it comes to improving the country's economy. Presidents can be impeached in days or weeks. It takes years to wreck economies and usually even longer to repair them. So, will Emmerson Mnangagwa be able to take Zimbabwe's economy off life support and at least start to put it on the road to recovery? Analysts are very sceptical that a quick solution is even feasible. The euphoria that has gripped the nation has certainly raised hopes that the future will be brighter, but if that improved sentiment is to deliver economic dividends, the government needs to make some drastic reforms. Cash injection The first tool President Mnangagwa would need to even get a recovery kick-started is hard currency. Zimbabwe hasn't had a currency of its own since 2009, after hyperinflation killed off the old Zimbabwean dollar. Zimbabwe 100 trillion and 500 thousand dollar banknotes, produced after the country experienced a period of hyperinflation Zimbabwe has lost its status as the breadbasket of Africa Since then, the US dollar has been the main currency for transactions, as well as the South African rand. And in recent years a cash shortage has been slowly strangling the economy, which is half the size it was at the turn of the millennium. Ten numbers that will help you understand what's actually going on But who would stump up the cash? Western donors will remain wary of a Zanu-PF government which simply sees Robert Mugabe replaced by Mr Mnangagwa. The International Monetary Fund, which describes Zimbabwe's economy as one of the most fragile in the world, may be more willing - but only with many strings attached to any deal. China is possibly the most likely cash benefactor in the initial stages of a Mnangagwa administration. In some circles, Mr Mnangagwa is seen as Zimbabwe's Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader who instigated a degree of market liberalisation. Dump damaging policies and stamp out corruption Assuming the cash is forthcoming, what then? Mr Mnangagwa would have to dump economic policies that are unpalatable to foreign investors. Zimbabwe's agricultural production started to plunge after the government-sanctioned programme of farm seizures came into effect Zimbabwe has a potential labour force that is one of the most skilled in Africa In 2009, Mr Mugabe signed the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act (IEEA) into law, which aimed to place 51% of companies into the hands of Black Zimbabweans. Even some Chinese companies have been forced to close their operations in Zimbabwe in recent years, because the IEEA made it unprofitable to do business in the country. Once considered the breadbasket of Africa, Zimbabwe saw its agricultural production start to plunge at the turn of the century after the government-sanctioned programme of farm seizures. Mugabe has gone, but will Zimbabwe change? Robert Mugabe: Hero or villain? Emmerson Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Some sources claim that Mr Mnangagwa is keen to revitalise Zimbabwe's commercial farms, and may seek the help of white farmers to do it. Corruption has been a major restraint on economic growth in Zimbabwe for years. Much of the farmland that was seized from white farmers ended up in the hands of army generals and the political elite, who knew next to nothing about agriculture. The farms simply fell into disarray. Likewise, businesses that ended up with people with more political connections than entrepreneurial flair more often than not went to the wall. Three million Zimbabweans are estimated to live outside the country, having fled the dire economic conditions that emerged over the past two decades Not that corruption is confined to Zimbabwe in the African context, but it is one of those places that it seems to trickle down from the top. Just ask any South African who has driven their car across the border and been stopped at a police roadblock. But Mr Mnangagwa has not escaped the corruption criticism. It is alleged that he was at the top of corruption tree when the army effectively took over theMarange diamond fieldsin the east of the country in 2008. At the time, he was the defence minister. That whole affair raised the eyebrows even of Mr Mugabe, who said last year that he felt at least $13bn of revenue had gone missing from the diamond bonanza. Negotiate with foreign lenders For nearly 20 years, Zimbabwe has been in default on $9bn worth of international debt. That debt needs restructuring, probably with the assistance of the IMF and the World Bank. Perhaps a government that did not only include Zanu-PF could even get the debt (or some of it) wiped out. Mr Mnangagwa is thought to be open to a new deal with the IMF, but getting new financing and renegotiating old deals would probably be easier for a unity government which included opposition politicians, especially former Finance Minister Tendai Biti. Create the conditions to reduce unemployment and entice the diaspora to return Formal jobs in Zimbabwe are rare. Unemployment runs at more than 90%. Creating the conditions for investment and seeing that money flows in should have a dramatic short-term effect on unemployment. Western governments will be wary of a Zanu-PF government which simply sees Robert Mugabe replaced by Emmerson Mnangagwa (above) Other conditions already exist: the country has an abundance of natural resources in both agriculture and mining, and a potential labour force that's one of the most skilled in Africa. All it needs is the political will and the right economic conditions for Zimbabwe's unemployment statistics to become rather less stratospheric. Meanwhile, three million Zimbabweans are estimated to live outside the country, having fled the dire economic conditions that emerged over the past two decades. They too have skills which would be useful in the rebuilding of the economy. But they will have to feel they would be landing on solid and stable ground - both financially and politically. Otherwise, why go back? In addition, it could be argued that a Zanu-PF dominated government would not want them back this side of an election. The vast majority of the returning diaspora would be unlikely to vote for Mr Mnangagwa and his party. Create its own currency In the longer term, Zimbabwe needs to have its own currency. Using the US dollar was necessary after the old Zim dollar became worth less than the paper it was printed on and met its demise. Banks in Zimbabwe have been feeling the strain in recent months But there is so much more to creating a viable currency than switching on a printing press. Confidence is key. Last year, the Reserve Bank introduced ""bond notes"" which were meant to alleviate the chronic shortage of US dollars in the system. However, many thought this was an attempt to re-introduce the Zim dollar via the back door. Mugabe's long career in pictures The polarising Grace Mugabe How Zimbabweans celebrated In fact, the notes have done nothing to address the cash shortage and some analysts say they might have actually made the situation worse, by pushing up the demand for US dollars even further. Few people like using the bond notes, even though the amount in circulation is relatively low and the denominations are small. Putting money into a bank was no longer considered the soundest of options, because the cash could only be withdrawn in small amounts and there was always the fear that the Reserve Bank would come for your hard-earned dollars. So, the stock market soared, ironically becoming one of the best performing bourses in the world. Indeed, the rise in the stock market has only been curtailed by the army intervention and the resignation of Mr Mugabe.

"Up to the moment itself the extraordinary session of parliament had proceeded along expected lines. Speaker after speaker rose to denounce the excesses of the president and his wife. A female MP was speaking of how her constituents were suffering when we saw the messengers approach the speaker. They handed him a letter. A jolt of energy swept the hall. At first there were cheers of anticipation. The speaker rose. The next 10 minutes will remain engraved in my memory. We strained to hear the speaker through the muffled public address system. But the words ""statement of resignation"" were clear. And the wild cheering, the thumping of tables, the dancing and singing told all of us who were present that the age of Robert Mugabe was over. From the corridors outside where Zanu-PF activists had gathered, the MPs could hear loud cheers and singing mingle with their own celebrations. On the floor of parliament - a hotel ballroom specially converted for the session - I watched MPs and senators dance, arms around each other, as the solemn procession of mace bearers left the chamber. This video can not be played MPs cheered and celebrated as the resignation was announced Among the more bizarre experiences was finding ruling-party legislators offering themselves for interview to the BBC. A week ago most foreign journalists were banned from the country. One party stalwart, MP Keith Guzah, told me he believed real democracy would now take root in Zimbabwe. ""He has gone and I am happy, happy, happy for my country."" Another MP told me her greatest joy was that Zimbabwe had managed the transition ""without the shedding of blood."" It  was a comment that ignored the bloodshed and pain inflicted by her party during the decades of Robert Mugabe's rule. Latest updates Robert Mugabe: Hero or villain? Emmerson Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Leaving parliament I moved up through the city towards Africa Unity Square, the heart of Harare, pausing several times as I was enveloped by ecstatic crowds. A man fell to his knees and raised his arms to the sky. A young woman, wrapped in the national flag, shouted: ""Do you see this you guys? Do you see this? It is history in the making."" On the square I ran into Ben Freeth, a farmer who lost his land and whose family were brutally tortured during the land invasions. Like so many others he was struggling to believe that the moment of Mr Mugabe's departure had arrived. ""He was going, going, going and now he's finally gone,"" he said. As we spoke a group of revellers approached. Suddenly we were surrounded by embracing arms. ""And you can see,"" said Ben, ""we are in this together!"" This video can not be played How news of Robert Mugabe's resignation was greeted across Zimbabwe Will this spirit of unity, this freedom from fear, endure under a new dispensation? I cannot be at all certain. The presumptive new leader, Emmerson Mnangagwa, is mired in the excesses of the Mugabe era. He was the deposed president's loyal henchman for decades and only struck against him to prevent Grace Mugabe from succeeding to the presidency. This was not a revolution to bring liberal democratic principles into government. It was about power. That said, there are significant pressures on the new leader to embark on a programme of meaningful change. The corruption and tyranny of the past will not attract the international financial aid and investment that is needed to rescue the nation's shattered economy. Mr Mnangagwa will face a strong challenge if he tries to mire Zimbabwe in the despotism of the past. His instincts are authoritarian but he will not have the same scope for repression as Robert Mugabe. It would be a mistake to regard Zanu-PF as a monolith. A party that turned on one leader can easily turn on another. Robert Mugabe's resignation letter interrupted impeachment proceedings against him Perhaps most important is the attitude of the people. They have endured nearly 40 years of fear. For the first time they have been able to speak openly and demonstrate in the streets. The opposition - for so long divided and beaten down - is rejuvenated. These are the moments in which new leaders emerge and are tested. With elections set for next year, all parties are already in campaigning mode. Traditionally the polls have been times of chaos and crackdowns. Let us see if Mr Mnangagwa lives up to the promise of a more tolerant Zimbabwe.

"ISPs will no longer be able to use the term 'up to' about speeds of service Broadband firms will no longer be able to advertise their fast net services based on the speeds just a few customers get, from May next year. Currently ISPs are allowed to use headline speeds that only 10% of customers will actually receive. In future, adverts must be based on what is available to at least half of customers at peak times. It follows research that suggested broadband advertising can be misleading for consumers. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) looked into consumers' understanding of broadband speed claims and found that many were confused by headline speeds that they would never actually get in their own homes. The concerns were passed on to the Committees of Advertising Practice (Cap) which consulted with ISPs, consumer groups and Ofcom to find a better way to advertise fast net services. Most argued that the fairest and clearest way would be to use the average speeds achieved at peak time by 50% of customers. As well as insisting ISPs use ""average"" instead of ""up to"" speeds, Cap also urged ISPs to promote speed-checking facilities in their adverts so that users could test out the speeds they were likely to get from any given service. Director of the Committees of Advertising Practice, Shahriar Coupal, said: ""There are a lot of factors that affect the broadband speed a customer is going to get in their own home; from technology to geography, to how a household uses broadband. ""Our new standards will give consumers a better understanding of the broadband speeds offered by different providers when deciding to switch providers."" The UK's minister for digital Matt Hancock welcomed the change, describing it as a ""victory for consumers"". ""I'm delighted to see that Cap is finally changing the way broadband speeds are advertised. Headline 'up to' speeds that only need to be available to 10% of consumers are incredibly misleading - customers need clear, concise and accurate information in order to make an informed choice."" The ASA also considered whether the use of ""fibre"" in broadband advertising was misleading for ISPs that only use fibre to the road-side phone cabinet, relying on a copper connection for the so-called last mile to a consumer's home. It found that most people saw the use of fibre as a ""shorthand buzzword"" to describe fast broadband and concluded that it was not misleading for ISPs the use the term. Alex Neill from consumer group Which? said millions of households were currently experiencing broadband speeds that do not meet expectations. She said: ""It is good to see people may finally see the speeds they could achieve before they sign up to a deal."" Andrew Ferguson, editor of broadband news website ThinkBroadband said packages previously advertised as up to 38Mbps (megabits per second) will drop to speeds of between 24 and 30Mbps. Services currently marketed at up to 76Mbps are likely to be in the 45 to 55Mbps region, he added, while those advertised as up to 17Mbps could fall as low as 6Mbps under the new rules. ""People shouldn't expect adverts to change overnight, as most changes are likely to emerge in April just ahead of the deadline,"" he told the BBC. ""However, consumers may start to see a much wider variety of speeds in adverts, and with the addition of the peak time period (defined as 8pm to 10pm) there is likely to be more variation between providers. ""As a result, some providers may elect to refuse service to customers likely to get speeds at the slower end of the scale, which restricts provider choice. Others may not sell the advertised service but instead push customers to a technically identical service marketed under a different name.""

"This video can not be played Judge to Nassar: 'Position of trust used to abuse children' Former USA Olympic gymnastics sports doctor Larry Nassar has pleaded guilty to seven charges of sexual assault against women and girls in his care. He was charged with molesting seven girls, many of whom are gymnasts, while working for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University. As part of the plea deal, Nassar, 54, could face at least 25 years in prison. The hearing comes after a third former US Olympian, Gabby Douglas, accused him of sexual abuse. Douglas reveals abuse by team doctor In a statement to the court on Wednesday, Nassar said he was pleading guilty to ""move the community forward and stop the hurting"". ""I'm so sorry that this was like a match that turned into a forest fire, out of control,"" he said. ""I want them to heal. I want this community to heal. I have no animosity toward any one. I just want healing. It's time."" ""You used that position of trust that you had in the most vile way - to abuse children,"" Ingham County Court Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said, noting that sex abuse is a nationwide ""epidemic"". At least 140 women are suing former USA Olympic gymnastics sports doctor Larry Nassar ""You violated the oath that you took, which is to do no harm, and you harmed them. Selfishly."" Many of his accusers testified that they were abused while he was examining the young athletes, and sometimes while their parents were nearby. He has been accused of abusing more than 130 women - including Olympic gold medalists Ms Douglas,Aly Raismanand McKayla Maroney - during his time as team doctor for the US women's gymnastics team. Ms Douglas, who was one of the so-called Fierce Five that won gold medals at the London Olympics in 2012, revealed her accusation on Instagram. This video can not be played Gymnast Aly Raisman speaks up against former team doctor ""I didn't publicly share my experiences as well as many other things because for years we were conditioned to stay silent and some things were extremely painful,"" she wrote. During the hearing Ms Raisman, a member of the 2012 and 2016 Olympic teams, tweeted that she was ""disgusted"" that Nassar, who lost his licence, was referred to as a doctor. Nassar's case was part of a scandal which saw USA Gymnastics president Steve Penny resign last year. Mr Penny was accused by victims of failing to quickly notify authorities about abuse allegations. In a statement after the plea deal was announced, USA Gymnastics - the organisation which determines the US Olympic team - said it is ""very sorry that any athlete was harmed"" by their former doctor.

They added that it was ""important"" that he acknowledged ""his appalling and devious conduct"" in court and said the deal ""permits punishment without further victimisation of survivors"". Nassar has already pleaded guilty to multiple charges of child pornography in federal court and could face a maximum sentence of life in prison. Before accepting the plea, Judge Aquilina asked him to confirm that he did not wear gloves when abusing his victims between 1998 and 2015, when he was fired. The alleged examinations were ""not for any medical purposes is that right? It was for your own purpose, is that right?"", the judge asked. Nassar responded: ""Yes.""

"Foxconn has faced several claims of poor treatment of workers at its Chinese factories Foxconn, a main supplier for Apple's iPhone, says it has stopped interns from working illegal overtime at its factory in China. It comes aftera Financial Times report,externalfound at least six students worked 11-hour days at its iPhone X plant in Henan province. The practice breached Chinese laws preventing children from working more than 40 hours per week. About 3,000 students were reportedly hired to work at the Zhengzhou plant. Apple said the secondary school students worked voluntarily but they ""should not have been allowed to work overtime"". Both the tech giant and Foxconn have said the interns were ""compensated and provided benefits"". ""Apple is dedicated to ensuring everyone in our supply chain is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve,"" the firm said in a statement. ""We know our work is never done and we'll continue to do all we can to make a positive impact and protect workers in our supply chain."" The Foxconn Technology Group, which operates an internship programme at the Chinese factory, told the BBC in a statement that it took ""immediate action to ensure that no interns are carrying out any overtime work"". It added that ""interns represent a very small percentage"" of its workforce in China and that the breach of labour laws was inconsistent with its own policies.

"Nanyang Technological University in Singapore already uses driverless shuttles at its campus Singapore plans to introduce driverless buses on its public roads by 2022. The government says they will be piloted in three new neighbourhoods which will have less-crowded roads designed to accommodate the buses. The buses will be used to help residents travel in their communities, and to nearby train and bus stations. Densely-populated Singapore hopes driverless technology will help the country manage its land constraints and manpower shortages. ""The autonomous vehicles will greatly enhance the accessibility and connectivity of our public transport system, particularly for the elderly, families with young children and the less mobile,"" the Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan said. The autonomous buses are expected to complement existing manned bus services, and will initially operate during off-peak hours. Additionally, the government plans to let commuters hail on-demand shuttles using their mobile phones. Uber and Volvo strike deal for 24,000 self-drive cars Are we ready for driverless cars? Driverless cars put to the test Singapore has less traffic congestion compared to many other cities in Southeast Asia, due to road tolls and policies that promote public transport. The country also hopes to become a leader in driverless technologies. Driverless taxis are already being trialled in Singapore. ""Our land transport constraints may help us become a global player in urban mobility solutions. What works here is likely to also work in other cities,"" said Mr Khaw, who was speaking at the launch of a test centre for self-driving vehicles on Wednesday. The new centre will allow driverless developers to test how their cars and buses would handle pedestrians, heavy rain, aggressive drivers, cyclists, scooters and other road scenarios.

"An extra Â£28m is to go towards helping victims of the Grenfell Tower fire, Chancellor Philip Hammond has said in his Budget speech. The funding for Kensington and Chelsea Council in London will pay for mental health services and regeneration. The fire in June left 71 people dead, as well as hundreds of people homeless and many needing counselling. Labour welcomed the announcement but questioned whether the council should be responsible for spending the money. Mr Hammond has called on local authorities across the UK to speed up efforts to ensure all high-rise towers were safe. Post-Grenfell fire safety spend over Â£380m Who were the victims? In his Budget speech, Mr Hammond said of the Grenfell fire: ""This tragedy should never have happened, and we must ensure that nothing like it ever happens again."" Kensington and Chelsea Council confirmed that the money would support mental health services in the area, alongside existing NHS agencies, as well as paying for a new community space and refurbishment of the Lancaster West estate in west London - where Grenfell Tower is based. The mental health response to the Grenfell disaster has been described as the biggest operation of its kind in Europe.,external Last month the Central and North West London NHS Trust said around 360 adults and children were undergoing treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder following the fire, while a number of survivors and witnesses were reported to have attempted suicide. This video can not be played How do witnesses and survivors of Grenfell Tower cope? Labour's Emma Dent Coad, the MP for Kensington, said the money was ""very welcome"" but added: ""Who will be in charge of these funds and decide where they are best spent?"" She criticised the local council's spending priorities and suggested that the local community - ""that took over essential council services on the morning of the fire, and since then"" - be part of the decision-making. Elizabeth Campbell, leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council, said the money would help secure ""a long-term future for the people of North Kensington"". Philip Hammond says financial constraints should not get in the way of safety work to tower blocks Following the Grenfell disaster, fire safety flaws were discovered in hundreds of high-rise blocks around the country. In his Budget speech, Mr Hammond said any local authority which does not have the funds to pay for fire safety work should contact central government. He told the Commons: ""All local authorities and housing associations must carry out any identified, necessary safety works as soon as possible. He added: ""I have said before, and I will say again today, we will not allow financial constraints to get in the way of any essential fire safety work."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said councils, including Nottingham and Westminster, had contacted the government but ""nothing was offered to them"". London Mayor Sadiq Khan urged the government to act quickly to help councils fund retrofitting of  buildings with sprinklers. BBC Radio London research found that about half of London's boroughs had asked for financial help,which the government had not yet agreed to.

"This video can not be played Judge to Nassar: 'Position of trust used to abuse children' Former USA Olympic gymnastics sports doctor Larry Nassar has pleaded guilty to seven charges of sexual assault against women and girls in his care. He was charged with molesting seven girls, many of whom are gymnasts, while working for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University. As part of the plea deal, Nassar, 54, could face at least 25 years in prison. The hearing comes after a third former US Olympian, Gabby Douglas, accused him of sexual abuse. Douglas reveals abuse by team doctor In a statement to the court on Wednesday, Nassar said he was pleading guilty to ""move the community forward and stop the hurting"". ""I'm so sorry that this was like a match that turned into a forest fire, out of control,"" he said. ""I want them to heal. I want this community to heal. I have no animosity toward any one. I just want healing. It's time."" ""You used that position of trust that you had in the most vile way - to abuse children,"" Ingham County Court Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said, noting that sex abuse is a nationwide ""epidemic"". At least 140 women are suing former USA Olympic gymnastics sports doctor Larry Nassar ""You violated the oath that you took, which is to do no harm, and you harmed them. Selfishly."" Many of his accusers testified that they were abused while he was examining the young athletes, and sometimes while their parents were nearby. He has been accused of abusing more than 130 women - including Olympic gold medalists Ms Douglas,Aly Raismanand McKayla Maroney - during his time as team doctor for the US women's gymnastics team. Ms Douglas, who was one of the so-called Fierce Five that won gold medals at the London Olympics in 2012, revealed her accusation on Instagram. This video can not be played Gymnast Aly Raisman speaks up against former team doctor ""I didn't publicly share my experiences as well as many other things because for years we were conditioned to stay silent and some things were extremely painful,"" she wrote. During the hearing Ms Raisman, a member of the 2012 and 2016 Olympic teams, tweeted that she was ""disgusted"" that Nassar, who lost his licence, was referred to as a doctor. Nassar's case was part of a scandal which saw USA Gymnastics president Steve Penny resign last year. Mr Penny was accused by victims of failing to quickly notify authorities about abuse allegations. In a statement after the plea deal was announced, USA Gymnastics - the organisation which determines the US Olympic team - said it is ""very sorry that any athlete was harmed"" by their former doctor.

They added that it was ""important"" that he acknowledged ""his appalling and devious conduct"" in court and said the deal ""permits punishment without further victimisation of survivors"". Nassar has already pleaded guilty to multiple charges of child pornography in federal court and could face a maximum sentence of life in prison. Before accepting the plea, Judge Aquilina asked him to confirm that he did not wear gloves when abusing his victims between 1998 and 2015, when he was fired. The alleged examinations were ""not for any medical purposes is that right? It was for your own purpose, is that right?"", the judge asked. Nassar responded: ""Yes.""

"This video can not be played The chancellor abolishes stamp duty on homes under Â£300,000 to help first-time buyers. Chancellor Philip Hammond has given a sobering assessment of the economy, saying it is expected to grow more slowly than previously thought. But he sought to rally Conservative MPs in his Budget by scrapping stamp duty for the first Â£300,000 spent by first-time buyers, a saving of up to Â£5,000. The cut will apply to buyers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Mr Hammond also promised Â£1.5bn to ""address concerns"" about the flagship universal credit scheme. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government had a ""record of failure"". Key points at-a-glance: A Budget summary Budget Live: Rolling text and video updates What the Budget 2017 means for you In depth: The BBC's Budget coverage At the start of his speech, Mr Hammond struck a positive note, saying the economy continued to ""confound those who seek to talk it down"" by creating jobs and continuing to grow. But he then said productivity levels remained ""stubbornly flat"" with growth until 2021 expected to be lower than predicted in March. It is the first time in a generation that growth is forecast to grow below 2% every year. Mr Hammond's statement came with him under pressure from Eurosceptic Tory MPs and others calling for more spending to ease austerity. The chancellor - who has been accused of being too pessimistic about life outside the EU - said Â£3bn would be spent on Brexit planning, and that the government would prepare for ""every possible outcome"" Freezing alcohol duty apart from an increase in duty on high-strength white ciders The price of 20 cigarettes goes up by 28p and by 41p for 30g of rolling tobacco A promise to fund a pay rise for nurses if one is recommended by an independent panel Refunds onVAT for Scottish emergency services A one-offtax on new diesel carsthat do not meet latest emissions standards Â£28m for Kensington and Chelsea council for counselling and regeneration in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire Bringing forward a plannedcut in business rate risesby two years to 2018 An extraÂ£2.8bn for the NHSin England up to 2022 Support for electric cars including a Â£400m charging infrastructure fund Anew railcardoffering discounts to those aged between 26 and 30 Housing had been billed as one of the key themes of the Budget - and the chancellor promised the ""next generation"" that getting on the housing ladder would not be just a ""dream"". Promising the government would deliver 300,000 new homes a year, he pledged Â£44bn capital investment and measures aimed at getting building projects started. And towards the end of his speech he made the pledge on stamp duty, which is paid by people buying properties over a certain value. Rates vary across the UK - in England, Wales and Northern Ireland it kicks in at Â£125,000 - and in Scotland, which has its own devolved tax - at Â£145,000. The cut will only operate in Wales until the matter is devolved next April and stamp duty replaced by a land transaction tax. Mr Hammond said his change would benefit 95% of first-time buyers. But in its assessment, the Office for Budget Responsibility said the main gainers would be those who already own a home. It also said it would lead to higher house prices and predicted it would only lead to an extra 3,500 first-time buyer purchases. Among the Â£44bn package was a pledge to make it easier for councils to build in areas of high housing need. There was also a threat to intervene with compulsory purchase orders if landowners and developers were found to be holding back on building ""for commercial rather than technical reasons"". Mr Hammond said investing more money alone would simply inflate prices and make matters worse. He added: ""Solving the housing challenge takes more than money, it takes planning reform. We will focus on the urban areas where people want to live... building high quality, high density homes."" As well as spending announcements, the chancellor also uses his Budget to update MPs on the state of the economy. And they cast a shadow on his other announcements, with the Office for Budget Responsibility predicting the economy would grow by 1.5% this year, down from the estimate of 2% it made in March. Growth, it says, will drop to 1.3% by 2020 and then rise to 1.5% in 2021, lower in every year than was predicted in March. Borrowing was predicted to be Â£8.4bn lower than in March, but long-term deficit predictions were hiked to Â£34.7bn in 2019, going down to Â£30.1bn in 2021. Mr Hammond said he was still on track to hit his target to balance the nation's books by the middle of the next decade. Sharp cut to UK growth forecast Another high-profile announcement was on universal credit, which is the government's major reform to the way benefits are paid and is currently being rolled out across the UK. Campaigners and MPs in all parties have been calling for changes to the way it is managed. The Â£1.5bn will remove a mandatory seven-day wait after someone submits a claim, taking the overall wait down from six weeks to five. Mr Hammond also said it would become  easier for claimants to receive an advance. Reality Check: What do Universal Credit reforms mean? This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""So much for tackling injustices"" Responding in the Commons, Mr Corbyn predicted the Budget would unravel, warning ""misery"" will continue for people across the country. He cited falling wages and added that economic growth in the first three quarters of this year was the lowest since 2009. The Labour leader also noted the lack of major social care policies in Mr Hammond's statement. And he reacted angrily to a heckle from the Tory benches as he said elderly people were not receiving good enough care. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The CBI said the Budget ""balances support for people on squeezed incomes with vital action to help grow the UK out of austerity"", and the Federation of Small Business said it was a ""business-friendly Budget"", But the GMB union said it was a ""let down"", and that the public sector pay cap continued to bring ""misery"" to thousands of workers. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable criticised the Â£3bn being spent on leaving the EU, saying the cash was ""disappearing down a Brexit black hole"".

"This video can not be played Philip Hammond explains how the UK can get its economic forecast upgraded Philip Hammond says he hopes to prove the bleak economic forecasts released in his Budget wrong. The chancellor said clarity around Brexit would increase consumer confidence and lead to higher growth in the economy. But a new report has warned of the longestfall in people's living standardssince records began over 60 years ago. Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said the economy was ""on its knees"". He said the chancellor had provided ""not a penny more"" for police, social care, mental health, children's services or public sector pay and public sector workers would see living standards ""continue to fall for years to come"". Follow the latest Budget reaction Budget calculator: Are you better or worse off? Warning of long living standards squeeze Stagnant earnings forecast 'astonishing' Key points at-a-glance: A Budget summary The reduced growth forecasts, blamed on the economy's flat productivity, threatened to overshadow a series of announcements in the Budget. These included a cut instamp dutyfor most first-time buyers and setting aside Â£3bn for preparations for the UK to leave the EU. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Hammond, who has been under pressure from Eurosceptic Tory MPs, would be ""broadly content"" with how his big day had played out, but that ""very difficult questions"" about the state of the economy remained. There is a warning by theResolution Foundation,externalthink tank that the squeeze on people's incomes is set to last longer than that which followed the post-2008 crash. Philip Hammond and Theresa May visited a construction college in Leeds the morning after the Budget The chancellor told BBC Breakfast there was always going to be uncertainty about the outcome of Brexit negotiations. But he said moving into 2018 there would be a ""sense of movement"", and that ""confidence will return, certainty about the future will return, businesses will start investing, consumers will start buying big ticket consumer items again and that will help to get our economy growing again faster"". He also denied being ""gloomy"" about the UK's prospects outside the EU, a criticism he has faced from some within his party. What the Budget 2017 means for you In depth: The BBC's Budget coverage Read Laura's blog in full On the predictions by the Office for Budget Responsibility, he said: ""The challenge for us as a nation is to prove them wrong."" This video can not be played John McDonnell tells Today any increase in the national debt would ""pay for itself"" over time But the Conservative former deputy PM Lord Heseltine told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour: ""He's boxed in. We've got a low-growth economy, we've got the shadow of Brexit over-hanging, we've got years of low growth ahead of us, a very significant problem with productivity. ""If I may borrow somebody else's phrase, there's no money left. So what Philip has had to do is to put sticking plasters on some difficult issues as best he can."" The Office for Budget Responsibility slashed its 2017 growth forecast from 2% to 1.5%. Output, it added, would be weaker than previously thought in each of the subsequent four years. This video can not be played The BBC's political, economics and business editors on the announcements in Philip Hammond's Budget. To put the figures into perspective, while there have been three recessions since the early 1980s there has not been a period since then when growth has been forecast to stay below 2% for more than three years in a row. Sharp cut to UK growth forecast The Resolution Foundation says disposable incomes are now expected to be Â£540 lower by 2023 than forecast in March, largely as a result of weaker pay growth. In a new report, it says real disposable incomes are now set to fall for 19 successive quarters. Prime Minister Theresa May said the government ""recognises the pressure facing ordinary families"", citing the freeze on fuel duty and increases to the personal tax allowance as measures ministers were taking. This video can not be played The chancellor abolishes stamp duty on homes under Â£300,000 to help first-time buyers. Stamp duty is a tax paid by people when they buy a home worth more than a certain amount. Mr Hammond said the change, which would mean no stamp duty on the first Â£300,000 of a first-time buyer's home (as long as the total value is under Â£500,000) would benefit 95% of first-time buyers. But the Office for Budget Responsibility said the main gainers would be those who already owned a home. It also said the cut, which will initially only apply in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, would push house prices up by 0.3% and lead to only an extra 3,500 first-time buyer purchases. The policy will cost the Treasury Â£3.2bn over the next five years. Freezing alcohol duty apart from an increase in duty on high-strength white ciders The price of 20 cigarettes goes up by 28p and by 41p for 30g of rolling tobacco A promise to fund a pay rise for nurses if one is recommended by an independent panel A one-offtax on new diesel carsthat do not meet latest emissions standards Â£28m for Kensington and Chelsea council for counselling and regeneration after Grenfell Tower fire Bringing forward a plannedcut in business rate risesby two years to 2018 Support for electric cars including a Â£400m charging infrastructure fund Anew railcardoffering discounts to those aged between 26 and 30 Changes to universal credit to bring the overall waiting time down from six weeks to five. Here are some different ways of looking at the economic picture: MPs privately told the BBC the Budget was ""very solid"" and had been ""well received"" while one said it contained ""nothing too dangerous"" and would pass intact. While conceding the economic downgrades were ""significant"", Nicky Morgan - chairman of the Treasury select committee - said Mr Hammond had ""taken a common-sense approach"" and ""balanced fiscal credibility with demands for spending on multiple fronts"". Leading Brexit supporter John Redwood said the Budget was full of ""good proposals"", including the help for first-time buyers. But opposition parties have said the measures go only a small way to addressing the housing crisis in the country, and that an extraÂ£2.8bn for the NHSin England up to 2022 is insufficient.
