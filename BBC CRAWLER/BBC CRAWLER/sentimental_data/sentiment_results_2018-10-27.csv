"This video can not be played ""It's a horrific crime scene. One of the worst, and I've been on plane crashes"" Eleven people have been killed, officials say, in a gun attack on a synagogue in the US city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The gunman, who opened fire as the Tree of Life synagogue held a service, was later taken into custody. President Donald Trump said ""a lot of people"" had been killed and injured in a ""wicked act of mass murder"". The suspect, who has been officially identified as Robert Bowers, 46, was injured and is receiving treatment. Two other people are in hospital in a critical condition, police said. Pittsburgh shooting: What we know so far America's gun culture in 10 charts Federal investigators are treating the shooting as a hate crime. The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish non-governmental organisation that fights anti-Semitism, said: ""We believe this is the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States,external."" People lit candles as they mourned the victims of the attack Hundreds of people - from the neighbourhood and also all across Pittsburgh - later gathered for an interfaith vigil for the victims of the attack in Squirrel Hill. Sophia Levin, a local resident and one of the organisers, told the BBC some people were ""really sad"" and the mood was ""heavy"". But she added that people also wanted to be ""together, not alone"", and the vigil would help heal the city. President Trump said he would visit Pittsburgh, following the attack. On Saturday morning, worshippers had gathered at the synagogue, in the Squirrel Hill neighbourhood, for a baby naming ceremony during the Sabbath. Squirrel Hill has one of the largest Jewish populations in Pennsylvania and this would have been the synagogue's busiest day of the week. According to reports Mr Bowers, a white male, entered the building armed with an assault rifle and two pistols. The Tree of Life Congregation Synagogue in Pittsburgh Reports say he barricaded himself in a room at the synagogue when police approached. Emergency services arrived at the building at about 10:00 local time (14:00 GMT), and gunshots could be heard. Pittsburgh's Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich later confirmed Mr Bowers was in police custody and was being treated in hospital. The crime scene was ""horrific"", he told reporters. ""One of the worst I've seen, and I've [worked] on some plane crashes. It's very bad,"" he added. Officers cordon off the area outside the synagogue He said that two officers were injured in an ""initial confrontation"" and that a further two Swat officers were later hurt by the gunman when they entered the building. He said that no children were among the casualties. US media said he had shouted ""All Jews must die"" as he carried out the attack. Social media posts by someone with the name Robert Bowers were also reported to be full of anti-Semitic comments. Suspected attacker Robert Bowers Pittsburgh FBI's special agent in charge of the investigation, Bob Jones, told a press conference that Mr Bowers did not appear to be known to authorities prior to events on Saturday. He said that any motive remains unknown but that authorities believe he was acting alone. Mr Jones added that the investigation was ""in the early stages"". ""We will look at every aspect of the suspect's life,"" he said. Mr Bowers is receiving treatment for what has been described as multiple gunshot wounds. Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Pittsburgh In the dwindling light, and with the cold autumn rain falling, hundreds gathered in front of the 6th Presbyterian church just a few streets away from the Tree of Life Synagogue. Holding their candles, they sang the Jewish prayer of healing. The elders in the community had wanted to wait a day before holding the vigil, but the young people said no - they wanted an immediate chance to share their grief and voice their hurt. Fifteen-year-old Sophia Levin declared that she was a different Jew today to the one she was yesterday. Anti-Semitism, she said, had been something she thought happened elsewhere and in earlier times; but now she knew it was right here, right now. Some of these young people have been involved in the student gun control movement that sprang up after the Parkland shooting earlier this year. One of them, Rebecca Glickman, told the crowd that gun control was needed now more than ever. She told me that an anti-Semite with a gun is more dangerous than an anti-Semite without a gun, so that's a good place to start. He called the shooting a ""terrible, terrible thing"". ""To see this happen again and again, for so many years, it's just a shame,"" he told reporters on Saturday. He described the gunman as a ""maniac"" and suggested the US should ""stiffen up our laws of the death penalty"". ""These people should pay the ultimate price. This has to stop,"" he said. Gun control around the world Fight or flight: Would you tackle a gunman? Later on Saturday, Mr Trump appeared at the Future Farmers of America Convention in Indianapolis, saying: ""There must be no tolerance for anti-Semitism. It must be condemned and confronted everywhere and anywhere it appears."" Speaking to reporters after the event, Mr Trump said the attacker was not one of his supporters, describing him as ""sick"". This video can not be played What's Donald Trump said about guns and gun control? Mr Trump has also said that the incident had ""little to do"" with US gun laws. ""If they had protection inside, maybe it could have been a different situation."" Former US President Barack Obama voiced a different position on the ongoing gun law debate,  tweeting: ""We have to stop making it so easy for those who want to harm the innocent to get their hands on a gun.""

Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf said in a statement that the incident was an ""absolute tragedy"",externaland that such acts of violence could not be accepted as ""normal"". He said: ""These senseless acts of violence are not who we are as Americans. ""My thoughts right now are focused on the victims, their families and making sure law enforcement has every resource they need."" The president of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, Jeff Finkelstein, said his ""heart goes out to all these families"". ""Now I'm just sad. This should not be happening. Period. It should not be happening in a synagogue. It should not be happening in our neighbourhood here in Squirrel Hill,"" he said. Other world leaders to condemn the attack include Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said he was ""heartbroken and appalled"". ""We stand together with the American people in the face of this horrendous anti-Semitic brutality,"" he said in a video message. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""shocked"" by the attack. ""Our thoughts are with the Jewish community in Pittsburgh and all those affected by this sickening and cowardly act,"" she said. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country's hearts ""are with the Jewish community in Pittsburgh today"". German Chancellor Angela Merkel said: ""We all have to stand up against anti-Semitism, everywhere.""

If they want to move, we will talk to them and ask why they have to move."" This video can not be played I don't want big names at Leicester - Ranieri ""Everything has turned to Leicester over the past seven months of the season. ""Every team is doing well which is why the league has been so strange. All the teams try so hard to win every match so the big teams slip sometimes and we kept the momentum from last season. We tried to survive in the first half of the season and we achieved it earlier than we thought. ""It was so nice to see the players try and the fans trying to support them and we have had the success now and it makes us so happy. It is difficult to say how we are feeling now to be the champions of the Premier League. ""We have been in the first position from Christmas and New Year's Day and people were doubting, they thought we would slip to the middle of the table. We kept belief and dreaming. ""There is no special secret but the team spirit is so great. They fight for each other and try to cover the mistakes for each other. They never stop and they kept believing. They are a special group of players and love each other. ""When we bought the club, we said we love football and we will try everything to make the club successful. If you asked to if I believe can we win the league? Maybe not realistically. My father said he wanted the team to be in the Champions League one day, and we set the plan with all the staff.

We will compete in the Champions League next season and I am not saying we will win the big cup, but we will try. We want to keep our best players and we will add some quality players with the right people. I am not sure where we will finish next season. ""We will try to win the league again. The target is the same, we want to build the squad and we try to stay in the Premier League as long as we can. To win the title again is so difficult. It will be super difficult from now. If we win, we win. ""We are scouting for players now, we will see when we finish the season. We will talk with Claudio about how many players we want and in which position. I support everything they say. ""If the scouting team ask me to spend, they need to have some reason. Claudio needs to support it as well. I can't as an owner say, 'you can go out and spend whatever you want. We are going to buy Ronaldo and Messi'. ""As a club, we have to manage for the long term. Not just next season, but we need to build. The players have to be for the right position. We have to buy quality to add more for next season. Then we already have young players that we have bought like Demarai Gray and many others.

While investment in Manchester City and Chelsea has been welcomed for bringing success, the Glazer family's handling of Manchester United has not always gone down well with fans despite some big money signings, while Randy Lerner's stewardship of Aston Villa has grown toxic at the relegated club. Srivaddhanaprabha, however, believes his family are doing ""the right thing"" - and the club's Thai fan base will grow as a result. ""Thai people love football and the Premier League interests them the most. To be part of the owners, the Thai people are proud. They are waiting for the players to go to see them because they want to welcome and thank them. If Manchester United and Leicester play at the same time now, they will be switching the television. They want to see the team owned by Thais playing and they love it. ""If you do the right thing, something good will come. We did last season and the season we got promoted. We supported the players, the staff, the fans. We do everything on and off the pitch. ""If you have the foundation right, you can be good. Every owner tries to be successful in everything they do. They are devoted people and love sport. ""We love football, we love sport and we know how important the fans are. I just need them to support the team. If they [the players] play at home, they feel safe - the support is there. Now even away, they feel the same. It is important for the performance. Now they play for the fans, for the support.""

"Alfie's mother, Hannah Deacon, said she believes he will need to use cannabis oil for the rest of his life A seven-year-old boy who was at the heart of a public outcry over medicinal cannabis legalisation is doing ""amazingly well"", his mother has said. Alfie Dingley, from Kenilworth, wasgranted a special licence in Juneto use medicinal cannabis oil. He has a rare form of epilepsy that causes up to 150 seizures a month but his mother, Hannah Deacon, said he has not had any seizures since July. From next weekdoctors will be able to prescribe medicinal cannabis in the UK. Alfie Dingley has not had a seizure since he has been using cannabis oil, his mother said ""He's amazingly well,"" Ms Deacon told the BBC, continuing that ""he has not had any seizures"" since his cannabis oil was reintroduced. ""He's going to school every day, he's riding a horse, he's riding a bike. He has a pretty much normal life,"" she said. Alfie's family petitioned the government in March after they found his condition improved when he was given a cannabis-based medication in the Netherlands, where it is legal, in September 2017. In July, thehome secretary announced plans to allow specialist doctors in the UK to legally prescribe cannabis-derived medicinal products. ""In eight months we've moved hugely,"" Ms Deacon said. Alfie has a rare form of epilepsy which causes up to 150 seizures a month Ms Deacon said her son was ""coming on amazingly"" since he was granted a licence for its use. She said she ""cried"" through most of Alfie's parents' evening on Wednesday, ""because his teachers said he's just doing so well, we can't keep up with him"". ""It's extremely overwhelming,"" she said. ""When I walk him to school I know how lucky I am.""

Prince Harry has praised competitors at the Invictus Games for their part in turning the issue of mental health ""from a sad story to an inspiring one"". He was speaking in Sydney at the closing ceremony of the games, founded to celebrate the sporting achievements of injured service personnel. ""The secret to the success of these Games has been accepting that mental health is the real key to recovery."" Everyone could be inspired by the ""Invictus example"", the duke said. About 500 competitors from 18 nations took part in the games, which involve 11 adapted sports. The Duke of Sussex said the athletes taking part had fought back from ""some of the darkest experiences known to anyone"". ""By simply being here and fighting back... you have become role models for everyone at home or in the stands who might be struggling with a mental illness."" ""Most importantly, you are showing us all that it's OK to ask for help."" Prince Harry referenced his own struggles following the death of his mother, Princess Diana. ""I've been there, you've been there, and we now need to reach out to those who can never even imagine themselves in that place.""

""You do not have to be a veteran who has fought back from injury to be inspired by the Invictus example,"" he said. He added that mental wellbeing was more important than physical fitness because ""without it, we cannot survive, let alone thrive"". ""When you accept a challenge is real, you can have hope. When you understand your vulnerability, you can become strong. When you are brave enough to ask for help, you can be lifted up. You can start living, doing, feeling - not simply surviving. ""And when you share your story, you can change the world. ""I can't think of a better way to continue serving your country,"" he said. The Duchess. wearing a green Antonio Berardi dress, said she was grateful to be 'welcomed into the Invictus family' ""When you share your story, you can change the world,"" the duke said In an earlier speech, the duchess paid tribute to the ""strength of spirit"" of the athletes she had met at the games, such as Ryan Novak - a US serviceman who had been paralysed from the waist down and told he would never walk again. With the ""unwavering support"" of his mother, Mr Novak recovered sufficiently to compete in sailing, swimming and athletics at the Sydney games ""When Harry and I saw him at the finish line of the sailing, he literally jumped into our boat - with dexterity and ease, by the way - to give both of us a hug,"" she said. Meghan called the games - founded by Prince Harry in 2014 - ""an international platform of some of the best athletics and sportsmanship you could ever witness, coupled with a camaraderie and close-knit sense of community which can only be defined as the Invictus Spirit"".

"This video can not be played The Thai fans switching to Leicester Leicester City are five points clear at the top of the Premier League and have just been confirmed as participants in a pre-season tournamentfeaturing the world's elite teams.Their transformation from Midlands also-rans to global power is well under way and nowhere is it more evident than in Thailand, the home of the club's owners... A year ago, as Leicester City languished at the bottom of the Premier League and looked almost certain to be relegated back to the Championship after just one season in the top tier, you could spend a couple of hours at the club shop in central Bangkok and not see a single customer. The rows of blue shirts remained untouched, the games playing on the large-screen TV unwatched apart from by the staff, who had little else to do. By the end of last year, it had closed down. The club's owner, King Power, had done its best to raise the profile, plastering Leicester merchandise all over its shops at Bangkok's busy international airport, where it has had an effective monopoly for the past decade on the duty-free spending of the more than 50 million passengers who pass through it. But outside the airport it was hard to wean Thais off their affection for Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea. Today you cannot buy a Leicester shirt anywhere in Thailand. They have all sold out, and King Power has had to ask fans to order them from the UK. Leicester's fanbase in Thailand is growing and matchday at King Power HQ is quite a spectacle this season The astonishing rise of the Midlands also-rans to league leaders this season is starting to impress Thai fans; even those who support other sides. ""I'm a Liverpool fan but secretly I'm rooting for Leicester to win the league,"" said Sorrapat Sriparn, while watching his side Muan Thong United play. A few rows along, Suphanchai Ketbeungkan, a long-term Chelsea fan, said he was also inspired by the idea of a Thai-owned team that had been so close to relegation last season winning the title. At a Sunday practice match in Bangkok, unable to buy the real thing, I was reduced to showing a picture of a Leicester shirt on my laptop to a Thai boys' team during the half-time break. They all recognised it, and knew the club was Thai owned. Would they consider supporting Leicester? They were not so sure, a few hands going up tentatively. Most of them were, predictably enough, Manchester United or Liverpool supporters. But if Leicester are to capitalise on this season's success and cement a permanent place in the hearts of Thai football fans, its owner is going to have to invest more in raising the profile among younger supporters, whose loyalties are not yet fixed. Phra Prommangkalachan is one of half a dozen Thai Buddhist monks who have been making regular trips to England to bless Leicester's pitch over the past three years At the end of last year, the club began what it calls football clinics, sending coaches led by Thailand's best known goalscorer, Kiatisak 'Zico' Senamuang, to several Thai schools to train young players, with a select few to be sent to the UK. But Arsenal, for example, have a substantial and well-established soccer school in Bangkok, used by hundreds of children every week. ""Leicester's rise has made a strong impression on the fans,"" says football commentator Aekarach Kengtooktang. ""But it will take a lot more time to build up their fan base. Big teams like Manchester United or Liverpool have earned their fans in Thailand from their performances and their fame over decades. This is a historic moment in the English Premier League but it has been only two years, so we have to wait and see."" Football is huge in Thailand, despite the lacklustre record of the national team and the often scrappy quality of local games - although there has been a marked improvement in recent years and a subsequent rise in support for local teams. Some Thais follow the Spanish, German or Italian leagues, but most prefer the more physical game played by English sides. As a consequence, some Thai tycoons have seen buying an English club as a way to raise their status and profile at home. The trend was started by the controversial former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who bought Manchester City in 2007 after he had been forced from office by a military coup, but then sold the club a year later. Thailand's biggest beer maker, Chang, has had a sponsorship deal with Everton since 2004. Then, following King Power's purchase of Leicester in 2010, the country's biggest seafood processor bought Sheffield Wednesday, and another Thai consortium bought Reading. Leicester players Jamie Vardy and Kasper Schmeichel are increasingly recognisable figures in Thailand It is starting to look as though King Power has hit the jackpot. The company's virtual monopoly on duty-free sales in Thailand is controversial, and the owner, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, is publicity-shy - he refused an interview for this article. But King Power has had to respond to the growing fan base in Thailand, and now lays on free food and beer at its futuristic headquarters in Bangkok for the big games. Lightly clad models bearing strategically placed blue fox tattoos mingle with the family crowd, posing with footballs and life-size cut-outs of Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez. Asked why they now support the Siamese Foxes - as they like to call them here - patriotic pride in seeing a Thai-owned side doing so well loomed large. And the roar from the crowd when Mahrez scored the only goal against Crystal Palace was every bit as loud as anything at Selhurst Park. Everything now hangs on what happens in Leicester's seven remaining games. But if they do pull off the fairytale ending, they can tap into a bottomless well of passion in this football-mad nation of 68 million. The Â£39m King Power spent acquiring the club six years ago, and the Â£100m or so it has spent since, look like spectacularly good investments. 'Do England need Rooney any more?'

"More couples could be able to get married outdoors or at home as part of a shake-up of the law designed to cut the cost of weddings. A review of wedding venues in England and Wales is set to be announced by the chancellor in Monday's Budget. It will look at lifting restrictions on al fresco locations, such as gardens and beaches, and temporary structures. The Treasury said more choice could lower the average venue booking cost and boost the hospitality sector. The move could bring England and Wales into line with Scotland, where couples have for years enjoyed much more freedom in where they can tie the knot. A 2015 report found that laws relating to marriage venues in England and Wales, some of which date from the mid-19th Century, were ""badly in need of reform"". At the moment, couples have a limited choice on where they get hitched, whether they are having a church wedding or a civil ceremony. Civil ceremonies must take place in register offices or approved premises that have been licensed for the purpose by local authorities. Are weddings getting out of control? What do young people want from the Budget? Chancellor plans High Street rates relief Weddings can only legally take place outside if they are solemnised in a structure with a solid, permanent roof such as a gazebo. Ceremonies in temporary structures, such as marquees, are not permitted. Requirements that couples specify the building in which the ceremony is to take place - and restrictions on the consumption of food and drink in the area before and during the event - date from 1837. The Treasury said such anachronistic red tape was pushing up the cost of weddings and putting some people off getting married. ""Relaxing restrictions would make it cheaper and simpler for couples to get married, potentially supporting more people to get married,"" it said. ""This review will help the law keep pace with modern Britain while helping people keep the cost of living down."" Tom Blandford told BBC News he got married 10 years ago in an outdoor ceremony with ""live instrumental music from friends, a humanist celebrant and, best of all, sunshine!"". He said though, that as they had had to go to the register office that morning, ""the whole ceremony was kind of a sham"". But he added: ""We didn't care. Most of our friends didn't know. ""My Mum didn't even attend our actual wedding - just a handful of people. This new law is very, very overdue in a society that is not all religious."" Budget 2018: What we know already Hammond urged to 'stump up cash' in Budget The cost of getting married has spiralled over the past decade, with the average outlay on the big day now topping Â£30,000 -according to one survey,externalearlier this year. The review, to be carried out by the Law Commission, will examine how and where marriages can take place and how to meet the ""growing demand"" for legally-binding outdoor weddings. The Law Commission said its work on the subject had shown there was a strong demand for weddings to be ""cheap and personal"" and existing laws were already being ""stretched"" to allow more residential ceremonies. Hotels currently account for about 40% of the 7,500 premises licensed to conduct civil ceremonies. It is hoped the shake-up will see more restaurants and pubs enter the market in a boost for the hospitality trade, while retaining the dignity of marriage ceremonies. Both the last Labour government and the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition looked at loosening the rules on wedding venues but no substantial changes were made. While Anglican, Catholic, Methodist and Muslim weddings are required to take place in buildings certified as a place of worship and registered for the purpose of religious marriage, Jewish and Quaker weddings are not subject to similar restrictions. In Scotland, religious marriages can take place anywhere, while venues for civil marriages are agreed by couples and the appropriate registration bodies and humanist marriages can be staged at a venue agreed with the celebrant.

"This video can not be played ""It's a horrific crime scene. One of the worst, and I've been on plane crashes"" Eleven people have been killed, officials say, in a gun attack on a synagogue in the US city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The gunman, who opened fire as the Tree of Life synagogue held a service, was later taken into custody. President Donald Trump said ""a lot of people"" had been killed and injured in a ""wicked act of mass murder"". The suspect, who has been officially identified as Robert Bowers, 46, was injured and is receiving treatment. Two other people are in hospital in a critical condition, police said. Pittsburgh shooting: What we know so far America's gun culture in 10 charts Federal investigators are treating the shooting as a hate crime. The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish non-governmental organisation that fights anti-Semitism, said: ""We believe this is the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States,external."" People lit candles as they mourned the victims of the attack Hundreds of people - from the neighbourhood and also all across Pittsburgh - later gathered for an interfaith vigil for the victims of the attack in Squirrel Hill. Sophia Levin, a local resident and one of the organisers, told the BBC some people were ""really sad"" and the mood was ""heavy"". But she added that people also wanted to be ""together, not alone"", and the vigil would help heal the city. President Trump said he would visit Pittsburgh, following the attack. On Saturday morning, worshippers had gathered at the synagogue, in the Squirrel Hill neighbourhood, for a baby naming ceremony during the Sabbath. Squirrel Hill has one of the largest Jewish populations in Pennsylvania and this would have been the synagogue's busiest day of the week. According to reports Mr Bowers, a white male, entered the building armed with an assault rifle and two pistols. The Tree of Life Congregation Synagogue in Pittsburgh Reports say he barricaded himself in a room at the synagogue when police approached. Emergency services arrived at the building at about 10:00 local time (14:00 GMT), and gunshots could be heard. Pittsburgh's Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich later confirmed Mr Bowers was in police custody and was being treated in hospital. The crime scene was ""horrific"", he told reporters. ""One of the worst I've seen, and I've [worked] on some plane crashes. It's very bad,"" he added. Officers cordon off the area outside the synagogue He said that two officers were injured in an ""initial confrontation"" and that a further two Swat officers were later hurt by the gunman when they entered the building. He said that no children were among the casualties. US media said he had shouted ""All Jews must die"" as he carried out the attack. Social media posts by someone with the name Robert Bowers were also reported to be full of anti-Semitic comments. Suspected attacker Robert Bowers Pittsburgh FBI's special agent in charge of the investigation, Bob Jones, told a press conference that Mr Bowers did not appear to be known to authorities prior to events on Saturday. He said that any motive remains unknown but that authorities believe he was acting alone. Mr Jones added that the investigation was ""in the early stages"". ""We will look at every aspect of the suspect's life,"" he said. Mr Bowers is receiving treatment for what has been described as multiple gunshot wounds. Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Pittsburgh In the dwindling light, and with the cold autumn rain falling, hundreds gathered in front of the 6th Presbyterian church just a few streets away from the Tree of Life Synagogue. Holding their candles, they sang the Jewish prayer of healing. The elders in the community had wanted to wait a day before holding the vigil, but the young people said no - they wanted an immediate chance to share their grief and voice their hurt. Fifteen-year-old Sophia Levin declared that she was a different Jew today to the one she was yesterday. Anti-Semitism, she said, had been something she thought happened elsewhere and in earlier times; but now she knew it was right here, right now. Some of these young people have been involved in the student gun control movement that sprang up after the Parkland shooting earlier this year. One of them, Rebecca Glickman, told the crowd that gun control was needed now more than ever. She told me that an anti-Semite with a gun is more dangerous than an anti-Semite without a gun, so that's a good place to start. He called the shooting a ""terrible, terrible thing"". ""To see this happen again and again, for so many years, it's just a shame,"" he told reporters on Saturday. He described the gunman as a ""maniac"" and suggested the US should ""stiffen up our laws of the death penalty"". ""These people should pay the ultimate price. This has to stop,"" he said. Gun control around the world Fight or flight: Would you tackle a gunman? Later on Saturday, Mr Trump appeared at the Future Farmers of America Convention in Indianapolis, saying: ""There must be no tolerance for anti-Semitism. It must be condemned and confronted everywhere and anywhere it appears."" Speaking to reporters after the event, Mr Trump said the attacker was not one of his supporters, describing him as ""sick"". This video can not be played What's Donald Trump said about guns and gun control? Mr Trump has also said that the incident had ""little to do"" with US gun laws. ""If they had protection inside, maybe it could have been a different situation."" Former US President Barack Obama voiced a different position on the ongoing gun law debate,  tweeting: ""We have to stop making it so easy for those who want to harm the innocent to get their hands on a gun.""

He said: ""These senseless acts of violence are not who we are as Americans. ""My thoughts right now are focused on the victims, their families and making sure law enforcement has every resource they need."" The president of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, Jeff Finkelstein, said his ""heart goes out to all these families"". ""Now I'm just sad. This should not be happening. Period. It should not be happening in a synagogue. It should not be happening in our neighbourhood here in Squirrel Hill,"" he said. Other world leaders to condemn the attack include Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said he was ""heartbroken and appalled"". ""We stand together with the American people in the face of this horrendous anti-Semitic brutality,"" he said in a video message. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""shocked"" by the attack. ""Our thoughts are with the Jewish community in Pittsburgh and all those affected by this sickening and cowardly act,"" she said. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country's hearts ""are with the Jewish community in Pittsburgh today"".

"Data shows gun ownership in the US has grown over the last several years Gun violence is a fixture in American life - but the issue is a highly political one, pitting gun control advocates against people who are fiercely protective of their right to bear arms. We've looked into some of the numbers behind firearms in the US. There have been more than 488 mass shootings across the US so far in 2024,according to the Gun Violence Archive,external, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are injured or killed. Their figures include shootings that happen in homes and in public places. For each of the last four years there have been more than 600 mass shootings - almost two a day on average. He counts US shootings. He no longer remembers names The deadliest such attack, in Las Vegas in 2017, killed more than 50 people and left 500 wounded. The vast majority of mass shootings, however, leave fewer than 10 people dead. 48,830 people died from gun-related injuries in the US during 2021, according to data fromthe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),external. That was nearly an 8% increase from 2020, which was a record-breaking year for firearm deaths. While mass shootings and gun murders (homicides) generally garner much media attention, more than half of the total in 2021 were suicides. That year, more than 20,000 of the deaths were homicides,according to the CDC,external. Data shows more than 50 people are killed each day by a firearm in the US. That's a significantly larger proportion of homicides than is the case in Canada, Australia, England and Wales, and many other countries. While calculating the number of guns in private hands around the world is difficult, the latest figures from the Small Arms Survey - a Swiss-based research project - estimated that there were 390 million guns in circulation in the US in 2018. The US ratio of 120.5 firearms per 100 residents, up from 88 per 100 in 2011, far surpasses that of other countries around the world. Data from the US has suggested that gun ownership has grown significantly in recent years. A study, published bythe Annals of Internal Medicine in 2021,external, found that 7.5 million US adults became new gun owners between January 2019 and April 2021. That, in turn, exposed 11 million people to firearms in their homes, including 5 million children. About half of new gun owners in that time period were women, while 40% were either black or Hispanic. A majority of Americans are in favour of gun control. 57% of Americans surveyed said they wanted stricter gun lawsaccording to polling by Gallup,externalin November 2022. 32% said the laws should remain the same, while 10% of people surveyed said they should be ""made less strict"". The issue is extremely divisive, falling largely along party lines. ""Democrats are nearly unanimous in their support for stricter gun laws,""another Gallup study noted,externalin 2021, with nearly 91% in favour of stricter gun laws. Only 24% Republicans, on the other hand, agreed with the same statement, along with 45% of Independent voters. Some states have taken steps to ban or strictly regulate ownership of assault weapons. Laws vary by state but California, for example, has banned ownership of assault weapons with limited exceptions. Some controls are widely supported by people across the political divide - such as restrictions governing the sale of guns to people who are mentally ill or on ""watch"" lists. Despite years of financial woes and internal strife, the National Rifle Association (NRA) remains the most powerful gun lobby in the United States, with a substantial budget to influence members of Congress on gun policy. Over the last several election cycles, it, and other organisations, have consistently spent more on pro-gun rights messaging than their rivals in the gun control lobby. A number of states have also gone as far as to largely eliminate restrictions on who can carry a gun. In June 2021, for example, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed into law a ""permitless carry bill"" that allows the state's residents to carry handguns without a licence or training. Similarly, in 2022, Georgia became the 25th in the nation to eliminate the need for a permit to conceal or openly carry a firearm. The law means any citizen of that state has the right to carry a firearm without a licence or a permit. The law was backed by the NRA, and leaders within the organisation called the move ""a monumental moment for the Second Amendment"". He counts US shootings.

"Adel al-Jubeir conceded that some people had exceeded their authority. Saudi Arabia's foreign minister has said the suspects in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi would be prosecuted in Saudi Arabia. At a conference in Bahrain, Adel al-Jubeir accused the Western media of ""hysteria"" in its coverage of the case. His comments come a day after Turkey said it wished to extradite 18 Saudi nationals who authorities say were involved in the murder. The writer was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul three weeks ago. Riyadh denies the ruling royal family was involved and blames ""rogue agents"". Saudi Arabia initially denied all knowledge of the journalist's fate but the Saudi public prosecutor now describes it as premeditated murder. Khashoggi had been an outspoken critic of the crown prince, the de facto Saudi ruler. The Jamal Khashoggi story so far The journalist who vanished into a consulate How Saudis changed story on Khashoggi ""On the issue of extradition, the individuals are Saudi nationals. They're detained in Saudi Arabia, and the investigation is in Saudi Arabia, and they will be prosecuted in Saudi Arabia,"" Mr Jubeir told a security conference in Bahrain. Turkey and Saudi Arabia are not known to have an extradition treaty. Jamal Khashoggi was an outspoken critic of the Saudi government Analysis by BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner in Bahrain Saudis are describing the Khashoggi murder as their biggest crisis with Washington since the 9/11 terror attacks of 2001. On Saturday, US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis, the plain-speaking ex-US Marine Corps general, left the audience here in no doubt about US intolerance of what happened. Both he and the Saudi foreign minister vowed to get to the bottom of who was behind this murder. But here lies the problem for both countries. If the trail leads, as some suspect, to the all-powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, then Western governments may feel obliged to insist on his removal or else downgrade ties with Riyadh. But Saudis worry that, for all his autocratic behaviour, ""MBS"" represents their hope for a more modern, civil society. If his power is curtailed, they fear, then hardline clerics will look to roll back many of their newfound freedoms. Washington has tried to keep up the pressure on the Saudis to explain the death fully. Defence Secretary Mattis said Khashoggi's death ""must concern us all"" and that the United States ""does not tolerate this kind of ruthless action to silence Mr Khashoggi, a journalist, through violence. ""Failure of any nation to adhere to international norms and the rule of law undermines regional stability at a time when it is needed most."" President Trump has said he is ""not satisfied"" with the Saudi account. However, while he has floated the possibility of imposing sanctions. he has also stressed the importance of the two countries' ties. Mr Trump also said it was ""possible"" the crown prince did not know about the killing. Hatice Cengiz says she has declined an invitation to the White House from President Donald Trump, accusing him of not being sincere about investigating the killing. She told Turkish TV she thought the invitation was aimed at influencing public opinion in the US. Hatice Cengiz says the US is not sincere in investigating the case In a tearful television interview on Friday, Ms Cengiz recounted the day her fiancÃ© vanished, saying she would never have let her partner enter the consulate if she had thought that the ""Saudi Arabia authorities would hatch a plot"" to kill him. ""I demand that all those involved in this savagery from the highest to the lowest levels are punished and brought to justice,"" she told Haberturk TV. She said she had not been contacted by any Saudi officials but that she was unlikely to go to Saudi Arabia for a funeral, should Khashoggi's missing body eventually be found. Meanwhile, the US-based writer's eldest son arrived in the US from Saudi Arabiaon Thursday, along with his family. Salah Khashoggi, a dual Saudi-US citizen, had been barred from leaving Saudi Arabia because of his father's criticism of the country's leadership, but this sanction was recently lifted. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called on the Saudis to reveal who ordered the killing and to say where the body is. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death Although most of Saudi Arabia's Western allies have expressed shock and have demanded a full explanation, there is disagreement over how to respond. Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West While Germany has suspended arms exports to the Gulf nation, French President Emmanuel Macron said it would be ""pure demagoguery to say 'we must stop arms sales'"". The sale of weapons ""has nothing to do with Mr Khashoggi. One shouldn't mix everything up"", he said on Friday. The European Parliament on Thursdaypassed a non-binding resolution urging an EU-wide arms embargo,externalon Saudi Arabia in response to the murder. Russia has said the royal family should be believed and that ""no-one should have any reasons not to believe them,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.

In a statement to the BBC, Sir Philip said: ""As many people have said, Lord Hain's blatant disregard of a judgement made by three senior judges is outrageous."" Sir Philip has been the centre of an eight-month investigation by the Daily Telegraph. The paper says that former employees of the businessman have accused him of sexual and racial harassment. But the Court of Appeal granted Sir Philip an injunction, preventing the paper from naming him. Businesses face boycott over claims Sir Philip named in Lords On Wednesday theTelegraph reported ""a leading businessman"" was granted an injunction.,external The paper said interviews with five members of staff revealed that alleged victims had been paid ""substantial sums"" in return for legal commitments - non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) - not to discuss their alleged experiences. NDAs are used to prevent people from discussing confidential information and keep trade secrets private, but have also been used to keep allegations of wrongdoing out of the press.

The Telegraph and the media at large were then entitled to report Lord Hain's statement in Parliament, even though the injunction had been issued by the courts. Lord Hain defends naming Sir Philip The former Neath MP was criticised by some Parliamentarians over his decision to flout the court's ruling. Former Lord Chief Justice Baron Judge said: ""The consequences are so serious. Whatever we think of Sir Philip... he's entitled to go to a court as much as anybody else."" Sir Philip has said in a statement that he ""wholly and categorically"" denies any allegation of ""unlawful sexual or racist behaviour"". On Friday he said he had been advised that Lord Hain's actions are likely to have breached the House of Lords Code of Conduct. Since Lord Hain spoke, it has emerged he is aglobal and government adviser at Gordon Dadds,external, the law firm used by the Telegraph. Sir Philip also said that if Lord Hain had read the judgement in the case - as he says the peer should have done if he is talking about it - he would have seen the firm's name on the first page. Gordon Dadds said Lord Hain had not obtained any information from it regarding the case, ""including any information which would enable him to identify Philip Green as having any involvement in it"".

"The fracking site in Lancashire is located near a farm A second tremor of 0.8 magnitude has been recorded within 24 hours at the UK's only active site for fracking. It was detected on Saturday after drilling for shale gas resumed in Lancashire following a 0.8 tremor on Friday. Neither was felt at surface. Since 15 October, Little Plumpton has been the first UK shale fracking site after the process was halted in 2011 when it waslinked with earthquakes. Fracking firm Cuadrilla said it aimed to resume operations on Monday. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a technique to extract gas and oil from the earth Liquid is pumped underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release gas or oil within Applications have also been submitted by various firms in Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and for a second site in Lancashire The Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy says shale gas ""has the potential to be a new domestic energy source"" Governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have said they will oppose fracking until further research is completed into its environmental impact The process restarted on Saturday morning after a 0.8 magnitude tremor on Friday, which is categorised as a ""red"" event by the monitoring system regulated by the Oil and Gas Authority. Saturday's tremor was detected at the firm's site in Little Plumpton shortly before 12:00 BST. Any tremor measuring 0.5 or above means fracking must be temporarily stopped while tests are carried out. Fracking has drawn strong opposition, including from activist and designer Vivienne Westwood (centre) A Cuadrilla spokeswoman said that, as the operations had finished before the detection, ""This is not an 'red' incident under the traffic light system operated by the Oil and Gas Authority as we were not pumping fracturing fluid as part of our hydraulic fracturing operations at the time. ""However we will, as always, continue to monitor the seismic activity closely and plan to resume hydraulic fracturing on Monday 29 October."" She said all relevant regulators had been informed. A spokesman for the the Oil and Gas Authority said: ""While the operations at the Preston New Road site have been designed to minimise any disturbance, minor events like these were expected."" He added: ""Provided that the event is in line with the agreed Hydraulic Fracture Plan and the risk of induced seismicity continues to be appropriately managed, then operations may resume on Monday."" Fracking started near Preston New Road on 15 October Fracking resumed earlier this week after it was paused as a precautionfollowing a 0.4 tremor on Tuesday. On Friday, a Cuadrilla spokesman said: ""Micro seismic events such as these result in tiny movements that are way below anything that would be felt at surface, much less cause any harm or damage."" The firm's chief executive Francis Egan added: ""It is an extraordinarily conservative figure, far below the 2.5 in Europe or 4 in Canada."" Mr Egan said he expected more incidents to be recorded because of the sensitivity of the recording equipment used by the company. Fracking resumed in October for the first time since 2011 after campaigners failed to stop the process with an injunction bid. A spokesman for Frack Free Lancashire said ""more fossil fuels had no place in a modern-day energy strategy"". Test drilling was suspendedafter two tremorsin the nearby Fylde Coast - one of 2.3 magnitude and the other of 1.5 - in April and May 2011 respectively. A study foundit was ""highly probable"" the test drilling for shale gas caused the tremors. A government-appointed panel recommended greater monitoring and said operators should observe a ""traffic light"" regime, with tremors of 0.5 or above triggering a ""red light"" and an immediate halt. Cuadrilla said earlier this month it would spend at least three months fracking two horizontal wells and then test to see if the gas flow was commercially viable.

"More couples could be able to get married outdoors or at home as part of a shake-up of the law designed to cut the cost of weddings. A review of wedding venues in England and Wales is set to be announced by the chancellor in Monday's Budget. It will look at lifting restrictions on al fresco locations, such as gardens and beaches, and temporary structures. The Treasury said more choice could lower the average venue booking cost and boost the hospitality sector. The move could bring England and Wales into line with Scotland, where couples have for years enjoyed much more freedom in where they can tie the knot. A 2015 report found that laws relating to marriage venues in England and Wales, some of which date from the mid-19th Century, were ""badly in need of reform"". At the moment, couples have a limited choice on where they get hitched, whether they are having a church wedding or a civil ceremony. Civil ceremonies must take place in register offices or approved premises that have been licensed for the purpose by local authorities. Are weddings getting out of control? What do young people want from the Budget? Chancellor plans High Street rates relief Weddings can only legally take place outside if they are solemnised in a structure with a solid, permanent roof such as a gazebo. Ceremonies in temporary structures, such as marquees, are not permitted. Requirements that couples specify the building in which the ceremony is to take place - and restrictions on the consumption of food and drink in the area before and during the event - date from 1837. The Treasury said such anachronistic red tape was pushing up the cost of weddings and putting some people off getting married. ""Relaxing restrictions would make it cheaper and simpler for couples to get married, potentially supporting more people to get married,"" it said. ""This review will help the law keep pace with modern Britain while helping people keep the cost of living down."" Tom Blandford told BBC News he got married 10 years ago in an outdoor ceremony with ""live instrumental music from friends, a humanist celebrant and, best of all, sunshine!"". He said though, that as they had had to go to the register office that morning, ""the whole ceremony was kind of a sham"". But he added: ""We didn't care. Most of our friends didn't know. ""My Mum didn't even attend our actual wedding - just a handful of people. This new law is very, very overdue in a society that is not all religious."" Budget 2018: What we know already Hammond urged to 'stump up cash' in Budget The cost of getting married has spiralled over the past decade, with the average outlay on the big day now topping Â£30,000 -according to one survey,externalearlier this year. The review, to be carried out by the Law Commission, will examine how and where marriages can take place and how to meet the ""growing demand"" for legally-binding outdoor weddings. The Law Commission said its work on the subject had shown there was a strong demand for weddings to be ""cheap and personal"" and existing laws were already being ""stretched"" to allow more residential ceremonies. Hotels currently account for about 40% of the 7,500 premises licensed to conduct civil ceremonies. It is hoped the shake-up will see more restaurants and pubs enter the market in a boost for the hospitality trade, while retaining the dignity of marriage ceremonies. Both the last Labour government and the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition looked at loosening the rules on wedding venues but no substantial changes were made. While Anglican, Catholic, Methodist and Muslim weddings are required to take place in buildings certified as a place of worship and registered for the purpose of religious marriage, Jewish and Quaker weddings are not subject to similar restrictions. In Scotland, religious marriages can take place anywhere, while venues for civil marriages are agreed by couples and the appropriate registration bodies and humanist marriages can be staged at a venue agreed with the celebrant.

"This video can not be played 'We can achieve so much together' Michael D Higgins has been re-elected as Irish president after receiving 56% of the country's election vote. Businessman Peter Casey came second with 23.1%, while none of the other four candidates polled more than 10%. Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said she was ""disappointed"", but felt it was wrong for Fianna FÃ¡il and Fine Gael to ""sit on the sidelines"" in the election. Fitting words needed from 'poet president' Who is Michael D Higgins? Voters also supportedthe proposal to remove blasphemy as an offence from the Constitution, with 64.85% voting yes. Mr Higgins, the first incumbent in 50 years to face a challenge in his bid for a second term, won with 822,566 votes. Londonderry businessman Peter Casey took significantly more votes than the final opinion polls of the campaign had predicted. His final tally was 342,727. Peter Casey is a former Dragons' Den investor Sinn FÃ©in MEP Liadh Ni Riada got 93,987 votes - 6.4% of the total votes polled. ""I am not sorry that we had an election - I think it was wrong for Fianna FÃ¡il and Fine Gael to sit on the sidelines,"" Ms McDonald told the BBC's Sunday Politics programme. ""We decided to challenge in the election - the other parties didn't."" Mary Lou McDonald accused Fianna FÃ¡il and Fine Gael of sitting ""on the sidelines"" She added: ""I think my leadership would have rightly been called into question if I fell in line with MicheÃ¡l Martin and Leo Varadkar. ""Of course I'm disappointed. I would have liked a better showing for Liadh [Ni Riada]but that was not to be. ""You learn from every contest. You learn from every encounter that you have with the electorate and we'll certainly learn from this.""

Speaking after his win, Mr Higgins said he accepted his mandate with ""humility, determination and excitement"". ""People are interested in ideas that are sincere and constructive,"" he said. ""For words matter, words can hurt, words can heal, words can empower, words can divide. ""And the words and ideas I have used in this campaign reflect a vision for Ireland based on four strands. ""Equal and together, strong sustainable communities, sharing history - shaping the future and Ireland's voice matters."" Peter Casey is a former Dragons' Den investor Taking to the podium after Mr Higgins, second-placed Mr Casey said the last time he had stood in an election to the Irish Senate he got just 14 votes. ""Somebody worked it out there - it's about 23,000 per cent improvement,"" he joked. Sinn FÃ©in MEP Liadh Ni Riada said she hoped it was the last Irish presidential election in which people in Northern Ireland could not vote. Turnout was reported to be low in many areas of the country. More than 3.2 million people were eligible to cast their ballots in the election and referendum. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar congratulated Mr Higgins on his predicted win on Saturday morning. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Duke of Sussex says admitting you are struggling is the first step to a better future. Prince Harry has praised competitors at the Invictus Games for their part in turning the issue of mental health ""from a sad story to an inspiring one"". He was speaking in Sydney at the closing ceremony of the games, founded to celebrate the sporting achievements of injured service personnel. ""The secret to the success of these Games has been accepting that mental health is the real key to recovery."" Everyone could be inspired by the ""Invictus example"", the duke said. About 500 competitors from 18 nations took part in the games, which involve 11 adapted sports. The Duke of Sussex said the athletes taking part had fought back from ""some of the darkest experiences known to anyone"". ""By simply being here and fighting back... you have become role models for everyone at home or in the stands who might be struggling with a mental illness."" ""Most importantly, you are showing us all that it's OK to ask for help."" Prince Harry referenced his own struggles following the death of his mother, Princess Diana. ""I've been there, you've been there, and we now need to reach out to those who can never even imagine themselves in that place.""

""You do not have to be a veteran who has fought back from injury to be inspired by the Invictus example,"" he said. He added that mental wellbeing was more important than physical fitness because ""without it, we cannot survive, let alone thrive"". ""When you accept a challenge is real, you can have hope. When you understand your vulnerability, you can become strong. When you are brave enough to ask for help, you can be lifted up. You can start living, doing, feeling - not simply surviving.

The Duchess. wearing a green Antonio Berardi dress, said she was grateful to be 'welcomed into the Invictus family' ""When you share your story, you can change the world,"" the duke said In an earlier speech, the duchess paid tribute to the ""strength of spirit"" of the athletes she had met at the games, such as Ryan Novak - a US serviceman who had been paralysed from the waist down and told he would never walk again. With the ""unwavering support"" of his mother, Mr Novak recovered sufficiently to compete in sailing, swimming and athletics at the Sydney games ""When Harry and I saw him at the finish line of the sailing, he literally jumped into our boat - with dexterity and ease, by the way - to give both of us a hug,"" she said. Meghan called the games - founded by Prince Harry in 2014 - ""an international platform of some of the best athletics and sportsmanship you could ever witness, coupled with a camaraderie and close-knit sense of community which can only be defined as the Invictus Spirit"".

"The boy was taken to Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham but was later pronounced dead A six-year-old boy has died after a house fire in Ilkeston. Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service said they were called to a property on Shaw Street West at about 22:40 BST on Friday. They performed CPR on the boy before he was taken to Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham, but he was later pronounced dead. The fire service and Derbyshire Police have launched a joint investigation into the cause of the blaze. Firefighters were called to the scene at about 22:40 on Friday Neighbour Jack Hill said his wife heard ""a mother's scream"" while they were going to bed, so he ran in and went upstairs to try and save the child, who he had been told was in the front room. After finding the stairs ""virtually engulfed"" in flames he got a wet towel from his house and went to a local Chinese takeaway to get a fire extinguisher. Jack Hill said he was going to bed when he and his wife heard screaming ""I ran back up stairs, put the towel around my face [and] tried to put the flames out,"" he said. ""I tried to break the door down with the fire extinguisher. I couldn't get up because the smoke was that thick, so I stayed there until the fire engine came."" Mr Hill said he was ""devastated"" by the child's death, and described the family as ""very nice"". Rob Taylor, from Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service, said firefighters managed to remove the boy from the building Local resident Brian Smith said he was going to bed when he heard ""all this screaming and shouting"" and saw the flashing lights from the fire engines. He said cars parked on the corner of the road got in the way of the ambulance arriving at the scene. ""We've been trying to get that corner cleared, but nothing's been done about it,"" he said. Three crews attended the fire at its peak, the service confirmed. Rob Taylor, group manager for Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service, said the front of the house was the main part of the building that was damaged. ""It's a very difficult incident for the community and the crews to deal with, especially as it's a young child,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Van of mail bomb suspect A 56-year-old man has been arrested in Florida in connection with a mail-bombing campaign aimed at critics of US President Donald Trump. US officials named the man as Cesar Sayoc. He faces five charges including mailing explosives and threatening ex-presidents. Mr Trump said the acts were ""despicable and have no place in our country"". Fourteen items have been sent in recent days to figures including ex-President Barack Obama and actor Robert de Niro. Two were found in Florida and New York City on Friday morning. Later, two more were discovered in California. Billionaire and Democrat donorTom Steyer said that a package sent to him had been intercepted at a mail facility in Burlingame,external, and another addressed to Democrat Senator Kamala Harris was reported in Sacramento. The incidents come less than two weeks before the US mid-term elections, with politics highly polarised. How the US mail bomb suspect was caught Why Trump attacks the media The president praised law enforcement for the quick arrest of the suspect, describing the search as looking for a ""needle in a haystack"". ""These terrorising acts are despicable and have no place in our country,"" he said. This video can not be played Trump: 'We can never allow political violence' The comments were in stark contrast to Mr Trump's tweet earlier in the day, when he suggested the incidents, which he described as ""'Bomb' stuff"", were slowing Republican ""momentum"" in early voting.

But Mr Trump returned to the theme later, accusing US media of exploiting the latest case. ""The media's constant, unfair coverage, deep hostility and negative attacks... only serve to drive people apart and to undermine healthy debate,"" he said at a rally in North Carolina. ""We have seen an effort by the media in recent hours to use the sinister actions of one individual to score political points against me and the Republican party."" US media reports suggest Mr Sayoc is a registered Republican who attended some of Mr Trump's rallies in 2016 and 2017. However, the president rejected any suggestion that his rhetoric had contributed to the attacks. ""I heard he was a person that preferred me over others. There's no blame, there's no anything,"" Mr Trump said. Former intelligence chief James Clapper, one of the recipients of Friday's packages, told CNN: ""This is definitely domestic terrorism, no question in my mind."" He said that anyone who had been a critic of President Trump needed to be on the alert and take extra precautions. ""I'm not suggesting a direct cause-and-effect relationship between anything he's said or done and  the distribution of these explosives. But I do think he bears some responsibility for the coarseness of civility of the dialogue in this country,"" he added. He was at a vehicle parts shop in the city of Plantation, Florida. FBI Director Christopher Wray revealed that he was detained after his fingerprint was allegedly found on one of the packages. Officials also said DNA and mobile phone data were used to track the suspect down. Cesar Sayoc was reportedly arrested at a shop in Plantation, Florida The Department of Justice said he faced up to 48 years in jail. ""We will not tolerate such lawlessness, especially political violence,"" US Attorney General Jeff Sessions said at a news conference. ""Let this be a lesson to anyone, regardless of their political beliefs, that we will use the full force of the law against you."" Law enforcement agencies said Mr Sayoc lives in Aventura, Florida. In 2002, he was arrested for making a bomb threat in Miami-Dade County, and received one year of probation for the charge. Who is mail bomb suspect Cesar Sayoc? Mr Sayoc has a criminal record dating back to 1991 in Broward County, according to clerk records. He was arrested, aged 29, on a theft charge. He has also faced charges of fraud and battery. Court records show Mr Sayoc filed for bankruptcy in 2012 while he was living with his mother. A handwritten note in his bankruptcy report reads: ""Lives w/mom. Has no furniture."" The suspect's van displayed a collection of pro-Trump posters In 1980, he spent three semesters as a student at Brevard College in North Carolina, a university spokeswoman told BBC News. He did not graduate, the spokeswoman added. Following his arrest, US TV broadcast live images of a white van, said to belong to Mr Sayoc, being loaded on to a trailer in Plantation and towed away for examination. The van's windows were covered in images. One piece of artwork depicted President Trump standing on a tank and another showed Hillary Clinton with a bullseye superimposed on her face. Twitter and Facebook accounts in the name of Cesar Altieri and Cesar Altieri Randazzo respectively, believed to be used by the suspect, have been taken down. The series of bomb alerts began on Monday, whena suspected device was found in the post box of billionaire businessman George Soros, a major Democratic Party donor. This video can not be played Police in New York City find another suspicious package addressed to a Trump critic A total of 13 devices were sent to the following 11 individuals, according to the FBI. George Soros Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Former President Barack Obama Former Vice-President Joe Biden (two devices) Former CIA Director John Brennan, care of CNN Former Attorney General Eric Holder California Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters (two devices) Robert De Niro Democrat Senator Cory Booker Former director of national intelligence James Clapper Democrat Senator Kamala Harris The package sent to Mr Steyer was not mentioned on the complaint against Mr Sayoc. None of the devices went off. FBI Assistant Director William Sweeney said thorough examinations of all the packages were under way at the FBI laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, near Washington DC. The package addressed to Mr Clapper was found in New York Several of the packages appear to have contained pipe bombs, according to the FBI. CNN quotes investigators as saying they were functional but unstable, meaning they could be set off merely by handling. They have timers easily bought at retail outlets. But experts speaking to several US media outlets have cast doubt on their effectiveness after seeing X-ray images. New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill could not confirm whether all the devices were intended to explode, but he said officials ""are treating them as suspected explosive devices"". Later FBI Director Wray said that, though they were still being examined, ""these are not hoax devices"". He said it was possible there were more undiscovered packages. Some of the packages included photos of the intended targets with red Xs drawn through them, investigators said. How the US mail bomb suspect was caught Bomb truck removes package sent to De Niro.

"Morocco has decided to scrap winter time and will instead keep its clocks at summer time, GMT+1, all year around. The announcement comes less than two days before the clocks would have gone back by one hour on Sunday. Avoiding the switch would save ""an hour of natural light"", Administrative Reform Minister Mohammed Ben Abdelkader told Maghreb Arabe Press. The north African nation joins a number of others, mainly in Africa and Asia, which do not use daylight saving. Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is the time measured on the Earth's zero degree line of longitude, or meridian This runs from the North Pole to the South Pole, passing through the Old Royal Observatory in the London suburb of Greenwich This line has been called the Greenwich Meridian since 1884, and it is from here that all terrestrial longitudes are measured and the world's time zones are calculated GMT remains constant throughout the year In the winter months, local time in the UK is the same as GMT, but in March, local time is moved forward one hour to British Summer Time (BST) until the end of October A number of other countries around the world also use this daylight savings measure and change their local times to take advantage of earlier sunrises Co-ordinated Universal Time, or UTC, is essentially the same as GMT, but UTC is measured by an atomic clock and is thus more accurate - by split seconds Reaction to the change has been mixed on social media, with one person calling the last-minute decision Kafkaesque: Allow Twitter content?

While many people around the world enjoy the extra hour in bed that comes as clocks go back one hour for winter time, there have been prominent campaigns to abolish it. One UK campaign group even says staying at summer time all year-round would reduce traffic accidents,external, because road users would be able to see better in the evenings.

"Ava Rose Patel and her younger sister Violet haven't left any room for pumpkins in their wheelbarrow at The Pop Up Farm in Hertfordshire The scorching summer of 2018 wasn't just good news for sun worshippers - it also provided the perfect weather for pumpkin growing. And with Halloween just around the corner, it seems more of us than ever before are rolling our sleeves up and picking our own. Social media has been abuzz with photos of gourd-lovers getting to grips with these crucial Halloween props. Apparently a buggy wasn't enough for this man at Undley Pumpkin Patch in Lakenheath, Suffolk Of course the dogs have got in on the act... ...but Gordon setter puppy Charles would probably prefer to chase smaller balls at this farm in Bednall, Staffordshire Farmer Richard Simkin grows several thousand pumpkins for people to pick at Essington Farm in Staffordshire.

""If you want to keep it for longer than a few days then it's important you keep the stalk on. If that is removed it creates a wound which rots. ""And if you want to keep it then don't carve it because it only has a life off about three to four days after it's carved.""

"This video can not be played 'I've been harassed on the street, on buses and in bars' What would you do if someone shouted lewd remarks or even exposed themselves to you as you walked down the street? It's what many women have to endure and MPs are calling for the government to take action toclampdown on street harassment. Some people can't imagine this sort of thing happening to them, but others have come forward revealing their experience of feeling vulnerable in public for many years. Ruth from Kent is now in her 60s and recalls a litany of harassment since childhood. ""These days I'm not noticed by anyone, but when I was a child there was always unwanted attention from men. Aged 10, a man exposed his penis to me in public. ""Aged 11, a man selling ice cream from a van reached over the counter and touched my chest. I didn't report it, and even felt like it was partly my fault."" Just two years later another man exposed himself to her in a park and grabbed her dog. Again, she didn't tell anyone but it's still on her mind. ""Those things don't ever leave you"" she said. Ruth used to commute when she was a teenager and remembers men rubbing against her. ""If a carriage was full, men would press up against me and if it was empty there was the potential of being harassed if you were on your own. ""Women don't think about rubbing their bodies against men! It's a society thing, like we're a lesser sex."" Metropolitan Police: Stay safe,external Victim Support,external Live Life Safe: Suzy Lamplugh Trust,external Network for surviving stalking,external The daily commute can make some women uncomfortable Sarah in Canterbury is now 77 years old and recalls her shock at having her bottom touched on holiday in Italy. ""It was expected and accepted that when you went abroad you were subjected to bottom pinching."" But, at home, she clearly remembers ""the feeling of discomfort and tension as we ran the gauntlet of catcalls and shouts, especially past building sites."" When she complained about not being able to walk down the street comfortably in a relaxed way, she was told that it was harmless. ""Nobody was going to attack you. But it was incredibly unpleasant."" The harassment stopped, she says, only when she had a baby. Aggie lives in Bristol and was stalked by two different men in just six months. She reported the first instance, but was not satisfied with the response. ""I was told to try to avoid my usual route to/from work but I still feel really vulnerable."" During the second incident, she was aware of being stared at while on the bus to work, and instinctively knew the man was going to follow her when she got off. ""He pretended to go a different way to me and I made a beeline for the nearest shop, hoping to lose him, but he saw me and followed me. I went into a shop and told the staff I was being followed."" The staff member walked her to work. She didn't report it as she felt she'd only be told to change her route again: ""What can I do to defend myself when the police won't defend me? Society is telling me to be more vigilant and to change routes so that I am not so much of an easy target. ""Men that harass women have no repercussions."" Aggie will soon be using her bike, despite it taking her much longer to get to work. She wants people to realise how common this type of behaviour is. Gemma from Amesbury in Wiltshire describes feeling threatened by young men who followed her while she was out running. ""It was a route I've run so many times and in broad daylight. Plenty of people were around. A van came up beside me and stopped in the lay-by. I thought the men were stopping for directions, but when I approached them, they were just staring at me. ""They were kerb-crawling me. I swore at them. I should be able to go wherever I want to go!"" Gemma: ""I should be able to go wherever I want to go without being harassed"" After feeling shaken up and angry, Gemma says she is much more wary of people now. ""It makes you think twice about stopping for anyone, even if it could be an innocent query."" Tanya in Malta says she is self-conscious when she goes for a run: ""I know I will be beeped, shouted at, whistled at, stared at, even if I am wearing baggy clothes. ""Creepy older men say sexually aggressive things to me as I pass them. ""I hate the way men can do whatever they please, but I am made to feel that the responsibility of their actions is mine."" Despite being, in her words, ""invisible"", Sarah in Canterbury was harassed in her 70s. ""Someone laid hands on me. He was drunk or on drugs. ""Luckily a crowd of young people waiting outside a bar came over and pulled him off. ""I didn't call the police. I didn't think about it at the time."" When Ibi's 14-year-old daughter started her work experience at Canary Wharf in London, it was only a matter of days before she mentioned unwanted attention. ""She called my wife complaining of adult men in their 30s who kept wolf whistling and making comments to her as she left the station,"" he says. ""She was upset and confused by it. ""It makes me really ashamed as a man, we are honestly powerless to do anything with men who demonstrate such disgusting behaviour and feel it's acceptable."" Hollaback! - an international movement tackling harassment - says there is no right or wrong way to respond. It says the most important thing is to get yourself out of the situation if you feel unsafe. But if you choose to speak directly to the assailant, it offers the following advice: Be firm:Look them in the eye and denounce their behaviour with a strong, clear voice Say what feels natural:The important thing is that you are not apologetic in your response Don't engage:Harassers may try to argue with you or dismiss you through further conversation or by making fun of you. As tempting as it may be get into a verbal war with them, it is not recommended. The attention may feed their abusive behaviour Keep moving:Once you've said your piece, keep moving.

"Police said Saleem should be ashamed of himself A guest house owner who sexually assaulted two young girls who wanted to play with his rescued kittens has been jailed. Adam Saleem, 45, of Oakcroft,  Hale Barns House, Hale was jailed for two years at Manchester Crown Court. He was ordered to sign the sex offenders register for 10 years. Det Con Paul Walls, of Greater Manchester Police (GMP), said: ""Saleem should feel utterly ashamed of his actions."" GMP said three young girls staying at Saleem's guest house in March 2017 were keen to spend time with the cats that he boasted were in his sanctuary for rescued animals. He opened his bedroom door and told the girls, aged four, eight and nine that they could play with them in his room. Saleem shut the door and invited the girls to sit on the floor and while they played with the cats he sexually assaulted two of them. He was reported to police in November when one of the girls told their parents. Saleem was convicted of two counts of sexual assault of a female under 13 at an earlier trial. Det Con Walls said: ""Saleem promised a safe haven for travelling guests and unloved cats, but there was nothing protecting these young girls from his abhorrent behaviour. ""He looked at these girls playing, and instead of seeing a picture of innocence, chose to act on his most twisted desires."" Saleem is also subject to a sexual harm prevention order for 10 years.

"Cesar Sayoc, 56, was arrested on Friday A man who had worked as a road manager for an all-male striptease show has been arrested after a spate of bomb scares across the US. Authorities say 56-year-old Cesar Sayoc - who was arrested in Florida on Friday - is the prime suspect in the case of a mail-bombing campaign aimed at high-profile US figures critical of President Donald Trump. Recent days saw a dozen suspected live explosive devices sent to top Democrats, including former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as well as individuals outspoken against Mr Trump, such as actor Robert De Niro. None of these suspected explosives detonated, and no-one was injured. On Friday, federal officials arrested Mr Sayoc outside an auto-parts store in Plantation, Florida, just north of Miami. What we know about US mail bomb threats He was identified after his fingerprint was discovered on a package sent to Congresswoman Maxine Waters, officials say. Authorities have yet to comment on a suspected motive, but Attorney General Jeff Sessions said  ""he appears to be partisan"". Social media accounts that appear to be owned by Mr Sayoc featured anti-Democrat posts County records show Mr Sayoc, who is described as a white American, was born in Brooklyn, New York. Mr Sayoc filed for bankruptcy in 2012, court records show, while he was living with his mother. ""Lives w/mom. Has no furniture,"" reads a hand-written note in his bankruptcy report. In 1980, he spent three semesters as a student at Brevard College in North Carolina, a university spokeswoman told BBC News. He did not graduate, the spokeswoman added. High Point University, which he listed on his LinkedIn CV, told the BBC that he was never enrolled there as a student. Law enforcement officials said Mr Sayoc resides in Aventura, Florida. In 2002, he was arrested for making a bomb threat in Miami-Dade County, and received one year of probation for the charge. Mr Sayoc has a lengthy criminal record dating back to 1991 in Broward County, according to clerk records. He was arrested, aged 29, on a theft charge. In May 2014, he pleaded guilty to charges of grand theft and battery arising from a shoplifting arrest at Macy's department store, court documents indicate. During his one year of probation, he petitioned the court to be allowed to continue travelling, arguing that it was necessary for his job as a ""road manager for a variety of travelling male revue shows"". Documents show he worked for ""Chippendales, International Gold Productions, Cesar Palace Royale Burlesques show"" and that he had the ""potential to earn between $100-$200 a day. ""This has been significantly cut back since been [sic] on probation because of travel restrictions,"" his petition describes. ""His desire is to be able to continually tour,"" the petition says. It does not indicate whether his request was successful. This video can not be played Van of mail bomb suspect He is a registered Republican, US media report. Video footage also appears to show Mr Sayoc at President Trump's rallies in 2016 and 2017. Social media accounts that appear to be owned by Mr Sayoc featured pro-Trump and anti-Democrat posts, including some tweets threatening the figures who received suspicious packages this week. Twitter and Facebook have now suspended these accounts. In the criminal complaint against Mr Sayoc, FBI Special Agent David Brown detailed some of his suspicious social media posts. Some had misspellings consistent with the mailed packages, such as ""Hilary"" instead of ""Hillary,"" and ""Shultz"" instead of ""Schultz"". Mr Brown also pointed out a post dated 24 October - right after officials recovered the suspected pipe bomb addressed to George Soros - that was ""critical of, among others, President Barack Obama and George Soros"". Mr Sayoc's van, which has been impounded by officials, was covered in pro-Trump images Locals in Aventura have said they had noticed his unusual white van driving around. According to a Department of Justice charging document, the windows of his van was ""covered with images including images critical of CNN"". ""It struck me because of the crazy conspiratorial stickers covering the windows,"" one former resident,David Cypkin, told the New York Times,externalafter the arrest. ""It was unsettling, and also it seemed to be occupied. Sometimes the door would be ajar or a window would be open, which indicated to me that maybe somebody was living in the van,"" he continued.

"A police bomb sniffing dog is seen in New York after an explosive device was found Cesar Sayoc, 56, has been arrested after a number of suspected mail bombs were sent to critics of US President Donald Trump, authorities say. The suspected bombs were found across the country, from New York to Los Angeles, and were reportedly crudely made and sent in similar envelopes. None of the packages exploded, and the suspect has been taken into custody. He faces five federal crime charges: interstate transportation of an explosive, illegal mailing of an explosive, threats against former presidents and other persons, threatening interstate communications and assaulting current and former federal officers. Here is what we know. Law enforcement officials say Cesar Sayoc is the principal suspect, and that fingerprint samples, DNA and mobile phone data were used to track him down. Who is mail bomb suspect Cesar Sayoc? He is a resident of south Florida and has a criminal record. Mr Sayoc also reportedly has ties to New York. At a news conference on Friday, Justice Department officials announced Mr Sayoc was in the custody of the FBI. FBI Director Chris Wray said the nationwide investigation spanned ""from New York to Delaware to Maryland to the District of Columbia to Florida to California"". Mr Sayoc was identified in the last 36 hours, the director said, after his fingerprint was discovered on a package sent to Congresswoman Maxine Waters. Mr Wray also said they confirmed Mr Sayoc's DNA from two different devices mailed in different envelopes with a DNA sample from Mr Sayoc, collected from a previous arrest. Late on Thursday night, the FBI confirmed this information with Florida law enforcement. Cesar Sayoc (2nd right) is escorted by FBI agency Electronic devices were used to ping and track his mobile phone, leading to his arrest in a car park in Plantation, Florida. Mr Sayoc's Twitter account was also used by investigators to confirm his identity. Several posts misspelled ""Hillary"" as ""Hilary"" and ""Schultz"" as ""Shultz"", which is the same spelling mistake that appeared on the envelopes that contained the explosives, officials say. ""We do believe we've caught the right guy,"" Mr Wray said. ""But we also know that this is an ongoing investigation and there's a lot of work to be done - there are still plenty of unanswered questions."" The first device was found in a postbox near the New York home of billionaire businessman George Soros on 22 October. Mr Soros, a major donor to the Democratic Party, has become a frequent target for criticism by right-wing groups because of his support for liberal causes. The item was discovered by one of his employees and it was later destroyed by bomb squad officers. Police said the package contained explosive powder and ""had the components"" of a bomb. A suspected explosive device was found in a mailbox outside Mr Soros's home in Bedford, New York The following day, the Secret Service discovered a package addressed to former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. It was reportedly found during a routine screening of mail sent to the home she shares with her husband - former President Bill Clinton - in Chappaqua, New York. A US official told the Associated Press that it was a ""functional explosive device"". Who is billionaire financier George Soros? Trump attacks 'media hostility' after mail bombs 'Those responsible will be brought to justice' A third package, addressed to former President Barack Obama, was intercepted early on 24 October in Washington DC. ""[The] packages were intercepted prior to being delivered to their intended location,"" a statement from the Secret Service said of both incidents. ""The protectees did not receive the packages nor were they at risk of receiving them,"" it added. The next development occurred when CNN's New York office was evacuated on Wednesday morning after a suspected bomb was sent to their mailroom. It was addressed to former CIA Director John Brennan, a vocal critic of Mr Trump, who was scheduled to appear on the network that day. Police say they found an ""envelope containing white powder"" in the packaging of the device. The network was on air when the package was discovered, and an alarm could be heard in the background as the presenters discussed the story. Allow Twitter content?

Later that day, reports emerged that former Attorney General Eric Holder had been sent a suspected explosive device. This was followed by news that another device, addressed to Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters, had been found at a mail sorting facility near Washington, DC. A second suspicious package addressed to her was later discovered in Los Angeles. One of the packages - addressed to Congresswoman Waters - was found at this mail sorting facility On Thursday, shortly after 05:00 local time, another suspected explosive device was found in New York City. It had been sent to the Tribeca Grill in Manhattan, a restaurant owned by the actor Robert De Niro. De Niro - the star of films Raging Bull and Meet the Parents - is a vocal Trump opponent and once called him ""a national disaster"". Trump hits back at Robert De Niro The package was similar to the previous examples, officials said. The FBI later confirmed that two further suspicious devices had been sent to former Vice-President Joe Biden in Delaware. This video can not be played A specialist ""total containment vehicle"" removes a suspect package sent to Robert De Niro On Friday, more packages were found. One was located during a search of a Florida mail facility and was addressed to the Democratic Senator Cory Booker. The other package was discovered at a post office in New York and the target was ex-national intelligence chief James Clapper. Later, two more were discovered in California. Billionaire and Democrat donorTom Steyer said that a package sent to him had been intercepted at a mail facility in Burlingame,external, and another addressed to Democrat Senator Kamala Harris was reported in Sacramento. None of the suspicious packages exploded and there have been no reports of injuries. FBI Director Mr Wray described the devices as ""roughly six inches of PVC pipe, a small clock, a battery, some wiring, and what is known as energetic material"", which is material that can give off heat and energy as a reaction to heat, shock or friction. ""Though we're still analysing the devices in our lab, these are not hoax devices,"" Mr Wray said at a news conference on Friday. They were all sent in manila envelopes with bubble wrap, addressed with computer-printed labels. Each listed Debbie Wasserman Schultz, former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, as the sender, although her name was misspelt. The Florida congresswoman said she was ""deeply disturbed"" by the way her name was used. The devices are suspected to be pipe bombs. The one sent to CNN - of which there are pictures - is wrapped in black tape and was about 6in (15 cm) long. FBI Assistant Director William Sweeney has confirmed that the white powder found in this package ""did not present a biological threat"". The package that was sent to CNN's offices in New York Investigators are working to establish whether they were capable of detonating. An X-Ray of the package sent to De Niro reportedly showed it contained a device matching the others which resembled a pipe bomb. All of the packages are now being examined at the FBI laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, outside Washington DC. Unnamed officials told US media that investigators believe at least one was sent from Florida, and the FBI searched a mail facility near Miami late on Thursday. The political fallout has been swift. Conservatives claim Democrats, including those who were targeted in the bomb scare, have encouraged ""angry mob"" behaviour. Mr Trump has called on the media ""to stop the endless hostility"" following the incidents. But his critics say his comments are hypocritical, as he often uses vicious language against his opponents and the press. This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""Stop endless hostility"" CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker was one such voice. ""There is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media,"" he said on Wednesday. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders praised Mr Trump's reaction to the bomb scares on Fox News, saying: ""The president, I think could not have been more presidential."" She added that ""certainly the media has a role to play in this process"" adding that ""90% of the coverage of this president is negative despite the historic successes"". Some of Mr Trump's supporters have also said they believe the packages are part of a Democratic plot to win votes in the mid-terms, but there is no evidence for this. Every person who has been sent a package is known to be a critic of the president. Mr Soros, the target of the first package, branded Mr Trump ""an imposter, a [political] conman and a would-be dictator"" during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos last year. In return, Mr Trump has pinned a number of unsubstantiated accusations on the businessman. Most recently, he accused him of paying women to protest againstBrett Kavanaugh's nominationto the Supreme Court. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Senator Booker - a possible 2020 presidential hopeful - was a vocal opponent of Mr Kavanaugh's nomination and is a frequent critic of Mr Trump. ""We cannot surrender America to Trump,"" he tweeted last year. ""We must fight."" In a similar vein, Mr Brennan and Mr Clapper have both made regular TV appearances in which they have criticised the president.

"We don't know how you're going to perform Shut Up properly either mate... In Shut Up, Stormzy raps: ""Shut down Wireless, shut down Twitter."" He played that song, which contains five swear words, during his headline set at this year's Wireless Festival. But if he performed an uncensored version of that song atnextyear's Wireless, it could in fact shut down the event. New licensing rules,external, which come in from 2019, mean Wireless can still be held at London's Finsbury Park - as long as performers don't swear on stage. It's one of a handful of new rules from Haringey Council - including restrictions on noise levels, opening times and ""offensive"" clothes. So Wireless Festival could be very different in the future. Radio 1 Newsbeat has been taking a look at how these new rules could affect things. Post Malone would have trouble performing without slipping up on swearing (or getting served after 9:30pm) at Wireless 2019 Given these new restrictions, just a quick look at this year's line-up would put the festival in a bit of trouble if it was the same in 2019. Post Malone opened his set with Too Young (it contains 20 swear words), Lisa Mercedez's outfit could be judged as ""attire which exposes the groin, private parts, buttock or female breast(s)"" and surprise headliner Drake finished after the new 10pm performing curfew. Under the new rules, Stormzy would have to change at least 17 of the 21 songs performed during his set in 2018 because of the lyrics. The council's report says ""some of the language"" used by acts on the main stage was ""clearly audible and not appropriate"" for children in the local area to hear. Lisa Mercedez The rules are part of Haringey Council's look at how the festival promoter Live Nation runs the event, after 67 complaints were made about things like noise levels, drug taking and anti-social behaviour at the festival. A committee decided to change its conditions instead of taking away the licence altogether. If the new rules are not followed or organisers don't show ""reasonable efforts"" to make sure they're being followed, the festival could be given fines or stopped from being held in Finsbury Park in the future. The Friends of Finsbury Park group says it is pleased the council is doing something to limit the ""excessive and invasive noise"" and is happy that the event will finish earlier. But the group says some of its ideas have been ignored. It wanted a limit on the number of people allowed to attend, which it called the ""most important"" point. Last year 37,000 people went to Wireless. The current maximum capacity is 49,999. When asked how it would police the new rules, Festival Republic - which promotes the event - told Newsbeat: ""There's no statement from our side for the time being."" However, the festival's website does claim that ""Festival Republic is dedicated to having a positive impact on the local community"". Live Nation and The Friends of Finsbury Park have 21 days to appeal the decision. Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,externalandTwitter,external.

"Ava Rose Patel and her younger sister Violet haven't left any room for pumpkins in their wheelbarrow at The Pop Up Farm in Hertfordshire The scorching summer of 2018 wasn't just good news for sun worshippers - it also provided the perfect weather for pumpkin growing. And with Halloween just around the corner, it seems more of us than ever before are rolling our sleeves up and picking our own. Social media has been abuzz with photos of gourd-lovers getting to grips with these crucial Halloween props. Apparently a buggy wasn't enough for this man at Undley Pumpkin Patch in Lakenheath, Suffolk Of course the dogs have got in on the act... ...but Gordon setter puppy Charles would probably prefer to chase smaller balls at this farm in Bednall, Staffordshire Farmer Richard Simkin grows several thousand pumpkins for people to pick at Essington Farm in Staffordshire. He says the pumpkins are ""very weather sensitive"". ""They had nice warm weather which they like,"" he said. ""They were a bit short of water so we had to irrigate them most days.""

""If you want to keep it for longer than a few days then it's important you keep the stalk on. If that is removed it creates a wound which rots. ""And if you want to keep it then don't carve it because it only has a life off about three to four days after it's carved.""

"This video can not be played 'I've been harassed on the street, on buses and in bars' What would you do if someone shouted lewd remarks or even exposed themselves to you as you walked down the street? It's what many women have to endure and MPs are calling for the government to take action toclampdown on street harassment. Some people can't imagine this sort of thing happening to them, but others have come forward revealing their experience of feeling vulnerable in public for many years. Ruth from Kent is now in her 60s and recalls a litany of harassment since childhood. ""These days I'm not noticed by anyone, but when I was a child there was always unwanted attention from men. Aged 10, a man exposed his penis to me in public. ""Aged 11, a man selling ice cream from a van reached over the counter and touched my chest. I didn't report it, and even felt like it was partly my fault."" Just two years later another man exposed himself to her in a park and grabbed her dog. Again, she didn't tell anyone but it's still on her mind. ""Those things don't ever leave you"" she said. Ruth used to commute when she was a teenager and remembers men rubbing against her. ""If a carriage was full, men would press up against me and if it was empty there was the potential of being harassed if you were on your own. ""Women don't think about rubbing their bodies against men! It's a society thing, like we're a lesser sex."" Metropolitan Police: Stay safe,external Victim Support,external Live Life Safe: Suzy Lamplugh Trust,external Network for surviving stalking,external The daily commute can make some women uncomfortable Sarah in Canterbury is now 77 years old and recalls her shock at having her bottom touched on holiday in Italy. ""It was expected and accepted that when you went abroad you were subjected to bottom pinching."" But, at home, she clearly remembers ""the feeling of discomfort and tension as we ran the gauntlet of catcalls and shouts, especially past building sites."" When she complained about not being able to walk down the street comfortably in a relaxed way, she was told that it was harmless. ""Nobody was going to attack you. But it was incredibly unpleasant."" The harassment stopped, she says, only when she had a baby. Aggie lives in Bristol and was stalked by two different men in just six months. She reported the first instance, but was not satisfied with the response. ""I was told to try to avoid my usual route to/from work but I still feel really vulnerable."" During the second incident, she was aware of being stared at while on the bus to work, and instinctively knew the man was going to follow her when she got off. ""He pretended to go a different way to me and I made a beeline for the nearest shop, hoping to lose him, but he saw me and followed me. I went into a shop and told the staff I was being followed."" The staff member walked her to work. She didn't report it as she felt she'd only be told to change her route again: ""What can I do to defend myself when the police won't defend me? Society is telling me to be more vigilant and to change routes so that I am not so much of an easy target. ""Men that harass women have no repercussions."" Aggie will soon be using her bike, despite it taking her much longer to get to work. She wants people to realise how common this type of behaviour is. Gemma from Amesbury in Wiltshire describes feeling threatened by young men who followed her while she was out running. ""It was a route I've run so many times and in broad daylight. Plenty of people were around. A van came up beside me and stopped in the lay-by. I thought the men were stopping for directions, but when I approached them, they were just staring at me. ""They were kerb-crawling me. I swore at them. I should be able to go wherever I want to go!"" Gemma: ""I should be able to go wherever I want to go without being harassed"" After feeling shaken up and angry, Gemma says she is much more wary of people now. ""It makes you think twice about stopping for anyone, even if it could be an innocent query."" Tanya in Malta says she is self-conscious when she goes for a run: ""I know I will be beeped, shouted at, whistled at, stared at, even if I am wearing baggy clothes. ""Creepy older men say sexually aggressive things to me as I pass them. ""I hate the way men can do whatever they please, but I am made to feel that the responsibility of their actions is mine."" Despite being, in her words, ""invisible"", Sarah in Canterbury was harassed in her 70s. ""Someone laid hands on me. He was drunk or on drugs. ""Luckily a crowd of young people waiting outside a bar came over and pulled him off. ""I didn't call the police. I didn't think about it at the time."" When Ibi's 14-year-old daughter started her work experience at Canary Wharf in London, it was only a matter of days before she mentioned unwanted attention. ""She called my wife complaining of adult men in their 30s who kept wolf whistling and making comments to her as she left the station,"" he says. ""She was upset and confused by it. ""It makes me really ashamed as a man, we are honestly powerless to do anything with men who demonstrate such disgusting behaviour and feel it's acceptable."" Hollaback! - an international movement tackling harassment - says there is no right or wrong way to respond. It says the most important thing is to get yourself out of the situation if you feel unsafe. But if you choose to speak directly to the assailant, it offers the following advice: Be firm:Look them in the eye and denounce their behaviour with a strong, clear voice Say what feels natural:The important thing is that you are not apologetic in your response Don't engage:Harassers may try to argue with you or dismiss you through further conversation or by making fun of you. As tempting as it may be get into a verbal war with them, it is not recommended. The attention may feed their abusive behaviour Keep moving:Once you've said your piece, keep moving.

"Would you stay in a pod less than half the size of a normal Premier Inn room? For prices as low as Â£19, the Whitbread chain is betting the answer is yes. The first Zip by Premier Inn hotel opens in the Roath area of Cardiff early next year and will have 138 rooms sized 8.5 sq m including a bathroom. Whitbread says customers are willing to sacrifice room size and central locations for a bargain basement price. PriestmanGoode, which designs first class plane cabins, designed the rooms. They have twin single beds that can be pushed together to create a double bed, as well as air conditioning, flat screen TVs and WiFi. Whitbread said the smaller room format would allow it to use a wider range of buildings in towns and cities across the UK. Coca-Cola to buy Costa coffee for Â£3.9bn Costa UK sales slide It has secured a second location in Southampton that will have 140 rooms and is searching for more sites. Alison Brittain, Whitbread chief executive, said Zip would let the company access a wider range of customers, including those who are ""on a particularly tight budget but still expect and deserve the basics done brilliantly"". Greg Johnson, an analyst at Shore Capital, said Zip should allow Whitbread to open hotels in locations that could not sustain a regular Premier Inn. He added that the main chain already has 800 hotels with about 80,000 rooms and would soon account for one in every eight hotel stays in the UK, suggesting that segment of the market was close to saturation. In April, Whitbread said it would spin off its Costa coffee chain in the wake of pressure from activist investors, before revealing a shockÂ£3.9bn sale of the chain to Coca-Colaat the end of August. The FTSE 100 firm has tested its new hotel format with six Zip rooms on sale for several months at an unspecified Premier Inn hotel. There are more than 800 Premier Inns in the UK, along with 10 Hub by Premier Inn hotels in central locations in London and Edinburgh. Hub is described as ""design-led"", with 11 sq m rooms that cost more than the Â£57 average for the main chain. Whitbread is still planning to open more Premier Inn hotels as well as new Hub and Zip locations. The Yotel chain also offers compact pod-style rooms in New York, Boston and Singapore city centres, as well as Gatwick, Heathrow, Charles de Gaulle and Schiphol airports at considerably higher prices. Capsule, or pod, hotels with rooms barely larger than a single bed first emerged in Japan and were popular with ""salarymen"" who missed their last train home after one too many drinks.

"Shale company Cuadrilla has been fracking at the Preston New Road site since 15 October Operations have been suspended at the UK's only active shale gas fracking site following an earthquake - just 11 days after it was given the go ahead. Energy firm Cuadrilla said it would halt fracking at the Lancashire site for 18 hours after a tremor of 0.8 magnitude was recorded. Drilling for shale gas at Preston New Road, Little Plumpton, started on 15 October after a legal challenge failed. Cuadrilla chief executive Francis Egan said people should not be concerned. Fracking in Lancashire was stopped in 2011 after beinglinked with earthquakes. The seismic activity was detected by the British Geological Survey (BGS) at about 12:36 BST and is classed as a ""red"" event on the traffic light monitoring system regulated by the Oil and Gas Authority. Any tremor measuring 0.5 or above means fracking must be temporarily stopped while tests are carried out. Mr Egan said the 0.5 level was ""far below anything that can be felt or cause damage or harm."" He added: ""It is an extraordinarily conservative figure far below the 2.5 in Europe or 4 in Canada."" Mr Egan said he expected more incidents to be recorded because of the sensitivity of the recording equipment the company was using at the site in Lancashire. A Cuadrilla spokesman added: ""All the relevant regulators were informed without delay and we have verified that the well integrity is intact. ""As per the hydraulic fracture plan in place at Preston New Road, work will now pause for at least 18 hours and is expected to recommence on Saturday morning."" What is fracking? Fracking given go-ahead by government Fracking gear brought to first UK wells A 2.3 magnitude tremor on the Fylde coast seven years ago was probably caused by shale gas test drilling,a study found. Cuadrilla said earlier this month it would spend at least three months fracking two horizontal wells and then test to see if the gas flow was commercially viable. Anti-fracking campaigners had tried to stop the process with an injunction bid but failed.

"The arc of development would link the historic university towns of Oxford and Cambridge A controversial mega-development of homes, offices and roads across central England is being backed by the Transport Secretary, Chris Grayling. Up to a million new homes could be built along the Oxford, Milton Keynes, Northampton and Cambridge arc. A new expressway would also shorten journey times from East to West. Government advisers say the developments are needed to safeguard the booming economies of the UKâs science and technology hub. But environmentalists argue thatthe mega-plan will ruin green space the size of Birmingham. And they ask if wealthy towns need to become ever more rich. Up to a million new homes could be built along the Oxford, Milton Keynes, Northampton and Cambridge arc The plan from the National Infrastructure Commission (PDF),externalincludes the re-opening of the previously closed Oxford to Cambridge railway. That element is supported by the government and campaigners alike. But environmentalists are opposing the expressway, and the scale of the housing development. They say the road will generate traffic and lead to even more congestion in the long term. They note that the preferred transport in Oxford and Cambridge is the bicycle. Mr Grayling told BBC News: ""If we don't improve road connections in what is a busy part of the country, the existing roads will become more and more congested. There will also be local transport improvements."" The road would improve air quality in snarled-up towns, he added. The new expressway would shorten journey times between Oxford and Cambridge, developers say Asked whether it was possible for the UK to continue expanding transport systems in the light of climate change obligations, Mr Grayling said the government had to strive for increased growth: ""We see the development of the corridor for economic and housing is essential."" He agreed there were clearly limits as to how many new roads could physically be built, especially along the south coast. But said this didnât yet apply to central England. Transport experts say new roads generate more traffic, but when asked what happens if and when the expressway fills up, Mr Grayling replied: ""The expressway is intended to provide relief to smaller towns that get congested."" The Chancellor is due to respond to the expressway proposal in Mondayâs Budget, but green campaigners are angry that the issue has received no formal public consultation, environmental assessment or parliamentary enquiry. In his column, the environmentalist George Monbiot said: âIn 30 years, if this scheme goes ahead, (Oxfordshire) must build as many new houses, and the infrastructure, public services and businesses required to support them, as have been built in the past 1,000. A million new homes amounts, in effect, to an Oxford-Cambridge conurbation. ""But none of this is up for debate. By the time we are asked for our opinion, there will be little left to discuss but the colour of the road signs. ""Is continued growth, in one of the wealthiest regions of the world, desirable? If it is desirable, does it outweigh the acceleration of climate breakdown the scheme will cause? When air pollution alreadyexceeds legal limits,external, are new roads and their associated infrastructure either appropriate or safe? And are we really engaged in a race with other nations, in which being âleft behindâ is something to be feared?""
