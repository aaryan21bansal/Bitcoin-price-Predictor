"Serious violence increased by nearly a quarter after Covid-19 lockdown restrictions were eased in England and Wales last year, a study suggests. The 23% rise is the biggest since records began, say researchers. Serious violence almost reached pre-pandemic levels last August, however, the Cardiff University report suggests 2021 levels were below previous years. ""Precise targeting of police resources at violence hot spots"" is needed, the authors argue. The university's Violence Research Group analysed data from 74 emergency units in England and Wales in 2021 and found an estimated 146,856 people attended A&E for treatment of violence-related injuries - a rise of 27,745 people on 2020. ""The easing of restrictions in 2021 was associated with a significant increase in serious violence,"" says co-author Prof Jonathan Shepherd. This rise in serious violence, defined as violence resulting in emergency hospital treatment, affected all age groups. The age groups with the largest increases were: children aged 0-10 years (up 41.9%) and adults aged 18-30 years (up 29.2%) Last year's increase followed amassive drop in violence in 2020, which was the sharpest for at least 20 years and was driven by social gathering bans and the closure of pubs and nightclubs. ""Violence levels ebbed and flowed throughout 2020 as restrictions were eased and tightened,"" says the report. Two Covid-19-related national lockdowns were imposed in England and Wales in March and November 2021 and a third began in England in January 2021. Serious violence began to increase in February 2021. ""This increase may reflect lockdown fatigue or perception of the lower Covid-19 risks associated with vaccination,"" says the report. Although violence saw a sharp rise in 2021, the year as a whole saw levels of violence down 24% compared with 2017 and 49% compared 2011, for example. Researchers found that violence-related hospital attendances were most frequent on Saturdays and Sundays. Pandemic restrictions meant the Office for National Statistics Crime Survey could not conduct face-to-face interviews for two years. The Cardiff University team says its ""public health perspective of violence represents the only overall measure of violence causing serious, non-fatal harm"" during this period. However, Covid-19-related service pressures in the NHS - including post-pandemic backlogs of patients waiting for treatment - limited the number of hospitals able to share data. Despite concerns that successive lockdown restrictions may have increased the risk of serious violence for women and girls, the researchers found no evidence of this. The report's authors also studied violence in Scotland for the first time, with an estimated 8,549 people attending emergency units for violence-related injury in 2021. The authors say their findings highlight the need for police resources to be targeted at hot spots identified from A&E data. By using a continuous stream of detailed hospital information, police and local authorities can work out where to deploy resources, they argue. ""Without this detailed information, police are blind to when and where half of this serious violence takes place,"" says the report. ""If tried and tested prevention practice is implemented, the burdens on stretched emergency services will be reduced as well as the disfiguring, disabling effects of violence and its impact on mental health. ""Serious violence is preventable, not inevitable.""

"President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden paid their respects at the Robb Elementary School memorial The US Department of Justice says it will investigate the police response to last week's mass shooting at a school in Uvalde, Texas, which killed 19 children and two teachers. Public anger is growing after it emerged that officers waited in the hallway as children trapped with the shooter made desperate 911 calls. In Uvalde, President Joe Biden met the victims' families on Sunday. He also met survivors and first responders. First Lady Jill Biden, herself a teacher, accompanied the president to a memorial at Robb Elementary School. They were seen comforting the school's principal Mandy Gutierrez, beside a carpet of floral tributes for the teachers and children who lost their lives. Both were seen wiping tears from beneath their sunglasses. Mrs Biden touched each child's photo in turn. The couple then attended a Catholic Mass at the local Sacred Heart church. Protesters outside the church shouted, ""Do something!"" as the president walked out. ""We will,"" he answered. Announcing its Critical Incident Review on Sunday, the US Department of Justice said the goal was to ""provide an independent account of law enforcement actions and responses that day, and to identify lessons learned and best practices to help first responders prepare for and respond to active shooter events"". President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden comfort Mandy Gutierrez, the principal at Robb Elementary School The shooting on 24 May has provoked new calls for gun control measures, in a country reeling from two vicious shootings in under 10 days - although leading Republicans oppose tightening rules. The US has now surpassed 200 mass shootings since the beginning of 2022. A mass shooting is defined as an incident in which four or more people are shot or killed, excluding the shooter. White House officials say Mr Biden is unlikely to offer specific policy proposals or seek to issue an executive order in the coming weeks to avoid interfering with delicate negotiations between Senate Democrats and Republicans. The president's visit comes days after18-year-old Salvador Ramos shot his grandmother, and then opened fire on a classroomof fourth-graders with a legally acquired AR-15 style assault rifle. The gunman's rampage lasted for over an hour and police found as many as 1,657 rounds of ammunition and 60 magazines in his possession after he was shot dead. Authorities have struggled to give a clear timeline of how events unfolded in Uvalde. On Friday, officialsadmitted that police had delayed entering the school for over 40 minutesbecause they did not believe it was still an ""active shooter"" situation. The senior officer on the scene decided to wait until the school janitor arrived with the keys because they thought that either ""no kids were at risk"" by then, or ""no-one was living anymore"". Several senior Republicans have already pushed back against calls for tighter rules on gun ownership, such as background checks. On Friday, former US President Donald Trump told the National Rifle Association's annual conference that decent Americans should be allowed firearms todefend themselves against ""evil"". And Texas Senator Ted Cruz has accused Democrats and the media of seeking to ""politicise"" the shooting in Uvalde to ""restrict the constitutional rights of law abiding citizens"". Speaking to the BBC at a memorial site in Uvalde ahead of Mr Biden's visit, several mourners expressed support for stricter gun laws. Melissa Rangel said she was in favour of age checks, questioning ""how at 18 years old you're able to buy a gun"". San Antonio resident Eduardo Messa said: ""I mean, we have age limits for things like cigarettes and alcohol, why not for guns, you know, this is just... this kind of massacre that occurred this week is just so heart-breaking and sad."" Eduardo Messa called for background checks and age limits before gun purchases However, Tad Neutze, a local businessman, told the BBC that he was a gun owner and challenged the need for increased checks. ""If the guy was evil, he was an evil person. And evil is going to find a way to harm people,"" he said. On Saturday, Vice-President Kamala Harrismade an impassioned plea for a ban on assault weaponswhile attending the funeral of Ruth Whitfield, an 86-year-old killed in a mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, on 14 May. The attack at a supermarket in a predominantly black neighbourhood is believed to have been racially motivated. The teenaged suspect had also legally bought an AR-15-style weapon. ""Do you know what an assault weapon is?"" Ms Harris asked mourners. ""It was designed for a specific purpose: to kill a lot of human beings quickly. An assault weapon is a weapon of war, with no place, no place in a civil society."" Ms Harris also called for enhanced background checks on all firearms purchases. Patricia Castanon said no amount of legislation will help her get over the murder of her niece But for Patricia Castanon, whose niece Annabelle Rodriguez died at Robb Elementary School, there is little President Biden can do to ease her anguish. ""He can't bring her back. He can't bring none of them back and nobody can,"" she told the BBC earlier on Sunday.

"Denver Barfield was travelling in different countries before starting a job in London The mother of a man killed in a motorbike crash in Vietnam has said his body is due to arrive in the UK after ""an awful nightmare"". Denver Barfield, 24, from Beaumont Leys in Leicester, died in Hoi An on 16 May, his family say. Beth Thompson, a masters student at the University of Leicester, was also killed in the crash. Mr Barfield's mum Debbie Clayton said she was ""in shock"", adding now his body is coming home, it has ""become real"". The 50-year-old added: ""I am really upset. I just think I have been telling myself it is mistaken identity. I am in shock really."" Miss Clayton said she was visited by police officers at her home on the morning of 16 May to tell her he had died. Then, Miss Clayton was the subject of a scam from someone who claimed to be the coroner in Vietnam. She said she started getting repeated WhatsApp messages, in which they demanded $12,500 to send her son's body home. She added: ""They were asking me what I wanted to do with my dead son's body and they started sending graphic images."" Mr Barfield finished his degree at Aston University in 2020 but graduated earlier this year - the day before he left to go travelling Miss Clayton said she received more than 50 messages before police confirmed to her on 19 May that it was a scam. She added: ""It has just been an awful nightmare."" On Friday night, she said the Foreign Office confirmed his body was on an aeroplane and due to arrive at Heathrow Airport on Saturday evening. Mr Barfield was in Vietnam as part of a trip to different countries with a friend, and they had plans to go on to Cambodia, Bali and then Australia - which is where his mother grew up - before he started a job in London. Miss Clayton said her son had been ""all over the world and has since he was 16"" Talking about her son, she said: ""He was my world. He was kind, caring, quirky and an incredible human being. I was so proud. He had good manners and was a beautiful soul. ""He had his future mapped out - he was a blessing. ""The last time I spoke to him was the Saturday [before his death], he said 'mum guess where am I going to end up?' ""He said 'I am going to end up in your home town'."" Mr Barfield's friend Harri Stavrou has started a fundraising page, which has raised more than Â£23,000, and the funds have been used towards bringing Mr Barfield's body home. Dr Wendy Tabrizi, head of the marketing & strategy department at Aston Business School, said: ""We are all extremely saddened to hear this news. Denver performed well on the BSc Marketing degree, achieving a 2:1 in June 2020, despite the difficulties all students experienced with lockdown at that time."" Geoff Green, registrar and secretary at the University of Leicester, said: ""I am deeply saddened to hear about the death of Beth Thompson - our thoughts are with her family and friends. ""Beth was a bright and dedicated chemistry student. She completed her masters last year and had already embarked on a successful career as a chemical analyst.""

"Kate Forbes will set out her spending review on Tuesday Scotland's economy is in a ""very difficult position"" which will force tough spending decisions in the coming months, the finance secretary has said. Kate Forbes said tackling the cost-of-living crisis while still feeling the effects of the pandemic made her upcoming financial review critical. It came after the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warned of an estimated Â£3.5bn funding gap by 2026/27. Opposition parties have criticised the government's spending ""mismanagement"". The IFS has said the government could be forced to choose between axing key policy priorities or increasing taxes to tackle the deficit. The shortfall is the equivalent of Â£640 per person and the IFS warned it could rise even higher. Ms Forbes' spending review on Tuesday will be the first time a multi-year plan has been announced in more than a decade. The finance secretary said she will set out plans to focus public sector funds ""to achieve ambitions to tackle child poverty, reach net zero and deliver sustainable services for the future"". She said: ""These are challenging times, and we need to be canny with our spending, but I'm confident that if we work together we can get through this cost-of-living crisis and still achieve our ambitions. ""We face a very difficult financial position over the next few years with funding increases below inflation levels and the challenge of recovering from the pandemic without the financial tools available to every other government in the world. ""That means that while the spending review is not a budget, it will include difficult decisions to ensure we can really focus on supporting households and services at this time."" The Scottish government is using its new welfare powers for more generous benefits than in the rest of the UK. It faces heath service backlogs coming out of the Covid crisis, and income tax - although raising rates for higher Scottish earners - is generating less revenue than expected. So the Institute of Fiscal Studies warned on Friday that either taxes will have to go up, significant cuts will be required or, with tightly constrained borrowing powers, Kate Forbes could simply hope that Westminster will deliver more funding than it has set out so far. This week's review of non-capital spending until 2026 to 2027, the end of this Parliamentary term, should show which of these ministers are choosing. In setting expectations, Kate Forbes today warns the difficult financial position will require difficult decisions, with a focus on protecting households and services. But opposition parties have condemned the Scottish government's handling of the economy. Scottish Conservatives finance spokesperson Liz Smith MSP said: ""It appears Kate Forbes' response to warnings from the IFS of a Â£3.5bn black hole in the SNP government's spending plans is to stick her fingers in her ears. ""Years of economic mismanagement by the SNP - including squandering taxpayers' cash on failed public sector projects like the ferries fiasco - has left Scotland's finances in a perilous state. Yet there is no acknowledgement of this in Ms Forbes' pre-spending review spin. ""The reality is Scots face big public spending cuts, huge tax rises or a combination of both if the SNP are to bridge the huge funding gap they've created."" Daniel Johnson, Scottish Labour's finance spokesperson, said the IFS assessment ""laid bare"" the price of  ""SNP economic failure"". He said: ""It is clear that the spending review will reveal the heavy cost of the SNP economic mismanagement. ""You can hear them trying to get the excuses in now, but the truth is that during a cost-of-living crisis, Scots will pay for nationalists prioritising the constitution over the economy. ""This will be counted in lost jobs, cuts to public services and few will be able to forgive the SNP for it.""

"President Volodymyr Zelensky makes a rare trip outside Kyiv - visiting troops on the front line in Kharkiv region His office said he had thanked troops for defending the country Russians have attacked Kharkiv city again - weeks after being pushed away by Ukrainian troops Mr Zelensky has described the situation in parts of Kharkiv region as ""indescribably difficult"" for the Ukrainian army The Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai says civilians have been killed in Severodonetsk, with buildings destroyed in the key eastern city Russiaâs ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine Andrei Kelin also denied Russian forces were shelling civilians, and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a ""fabrication"" Meanwhile, heavy fighting is continuing near Severodonetsk in Luhansk Region, the General Staff of Ukraineâs Armed forces said Edited by Jeremy Gahagan And here we come to the end of today's live coverage. Here's a reminder of the day's key developments:  Russian rockets are devastating large areas of eastern Ukraine Russia is reported to have fired its latest multiple-rocket system
against Ukrainian targets in the Kharkiv area â a weapon described as a giant
flamethrower. That is what a Russian security official told the state-run
Tass news agency. It has not been confirmed officially. The TOS-2 Tosochka is a thermobaric fuel-air weapon: it creates massive explosions by igniting gas clouds on impact, depriving anyone in the
area of oxygen. Ukraine has pushed Russian forces back from the outskirts of
Kharkiv, the second city, which was visited by President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday. Earlier Russia confirmed that it was using TOS-1
Solntsepyok (âBlazing Sunâ) rockets against targets in the Donbas, where
Ukrainian forces are under constant, intense bombardment. TOS-1 is also thermobaric, with a range of up to 10km (six
miles). The TOS-2âs manufacturer Rostec says TOS-2 has a longer
range, better automatic targeting and more versatility. TOS-2 rockets are carried on an armoured truck, not a tank chassis. TOS-2 artillery on display - the system was first deployed last year Hugo BachegaReporting from Zaporizhzhia It was a rare trip for President Zelensky outside Kyiv. He
visited troops on the frontline near Kharkiv, Ukraineâs second city, handed out
awards and gifts, and thanked soldiers for their service. âYouâre risking your life for all of us and our state,â he
said. âThank you for defending Ukraineâs independence. Take care!â The visit was a demonstration of the countryâs success in
pushing Russian forces back from the city. And was probably intended to boost
morale as Ukraine tries to contain a massive Russian offensive in the Donbas
area further east. An onslaught that is causing enormous suffering and
destruction. Hours after the president left, loud explosions were
reported in Kharkiv. A message that the threat posed by the invading forces
there may have subsided, but itâs not entirely gone. James WaterhouseKyiv correspondent, BBC News Verdi's Rigoletto is being performed at Kyiv's Opera House Ukraineâs capital is 1,540
years old this weekend, and youâd be forgiven for assuming Kyiv wasnât in the mood
to celebrate. After all, itâs just over
three months ago that the city found itself surrounded by Russian forces, with some
predicting it would fall within 72 hours. At the time, I remember
standing outside the Opera House, where the only gathering of people was
outside a nearby pharmacy - scared and angry. Today it's a different
scene. There is a sea of smiling faces, colourful outfits and cheerful chatter
as people walk in to watch a performance of Verdi's Rigoletto. Shows returned
last week; and you canât help but feel the joy of those lucky enough to get a ticket.
Tickets are limited to 300, the capacity of the theatre's bomb shelter. âLife really goes on and we do not stop,â says Pavlo, one of the soldiers in uniform, in passing. âWe hope for the best and believe everything is going to be alrightâ. Backstage one of the lead singers, Olga Fomichova, sits illuminated by her make up mirror. âI can see our audience needs us, from the sold-out tickets, but it wonât be the sameâ she admits. âI donât have anger or defiance, only the desire to be heard, that the Ukrainians are a cultural and educated nation which deserves world-wide respect and attention.â For several of its 1,540 years, other rulers and empires have tried to take Kyiv by force. Some have been more successful than others, but few predicted such attempts would be made in 2022. Soprano for the National Opera of Ukraine Olga Fomichova Joe InwoodBBC News, Kyiv Volodymyr Zelensky has not turned out
to be the president many predicted. The former comedian, the voice of Ukrainian
Paddington Bear, was once mocked as a lightweight. Now,
he is compared to Winston Churchill. His
steadfastness in the face of overwhelming Russian force is credited by many as
being a crucial factor in his countryâs remarkable performance in the beginning
of this war. His
defiant videos from the streets of the capital, Kyiv, were a metaphorical
middle finger to Russia and its president. While
President Zelensky would appear with his colleagues, arms around their
shoulders, Vladimir Putin was pictured at one end of an almost comedically long
table, his officials barely in shouting distance. As
effective as they were, however, those appearances were all in the capital.
Todayâs visit to Kharkiv is the first time he has left the Kyiv region since
the start of Russiaâs invasion. He
met the troops that have not just defended Kharkiv, but repelled the Russians,
almost pushing them back to the international border. The
fact that he was able to visit shows just how much the tide has turned in
Ukraineâs second city. A few weeks ago, this morale boosting visit would never
have been possible. But,
do not be mistaken, Kharkiv is only safe for now. Elsewhere, Ukraine very much
appears on the back foot, withering Russian artillery barrages forcing them to
retreat in the Donbas. With
its charismatic president, Ukraine has very much won the informational war.
Unfortunately for them, that is not where this conflict will ultimately be
decided. Stopping Russia is the common mission of all civilised countries, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak has said. ""'Why does the world pay more attention to Ukraine than to Africa or the East?' - such a narrative is promoted by Russian agents,"" he wrote in a tweet. The Ukraine war is not a local conflict - it is the question of what the world will be like tomorrow, he added. Allowing Russia to win would ""open Pandora's box and push humanity into the dark ages."" Podolyak went on to say: ""Any autocrat would be able to provoke territorial conflicts, seize countries and exterminate nations. ""Stopping Russia is a mission of all civilized countries. There's time, but we should hurry up."" Moscow-imposed authorities in the southern city of Kherson say nearby fighting could affect the timing of its formal bid to join Russia. Russian forces occupied Kherson in early March - one week after the invasion of Ukraine began. It was the first major city to fall. Kirill Stremousov, deputy-head ofKherson's Moscow-installed administration, says the process might involve a referendum, backtracking on previous comments suggesting none was needed. According to Reuters news agency, he says: ""We'll announce later when some kind of vote or plebiscite
is planned, but it wonât be today and it wonât be tomorrow
because our first task is to restore order in the Kherson
region."" Russia has said that the fate of the Kherson region is for local residents to decide. But the UK Ministry of Defence said,in an intelligence update in April,external, a referendum would be a way for Russia to justify its occupation of Ukraine. And President Zelensky has said it fits in with Russia's plans of breaking Ukraine apart by creating ""pseudo-republics"" throughout the country. He has advised peoplenot to give the Russian authorities any personal data, such as passport numbers, as they might be used to falsify votes. More now on President Zelensky's rare trip outside of the capital Kyiv. He visited the frontline in the Kharkiv region where he spoke with troops and presented gifts. It comes as intense fighting continues in the region as troops attempt to regain control of the area from the Russians. Here are some more pictures of his visit. Ukraine's president has made a rare trip outside the capital, Kyiv, the presidential office says. Mr Zelensky visited front line positions in the Kharkiv region, it said. ""I want to thank each of you for your service. You risk your life for all of us and our state,"" the president told troops. The north-easten city has seen some of the worst fighting since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February.  Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said last week's talks with Finnish and Swedish delegations
were not at the ""expected level"" and Ankara cannot approve their applications to join the Nato military alliance. ""For as long as Tayyip Erdogan is the head of the Republic
of Turkey, we definitely cannot say 'yes' to countries which
support terrorism entering Nato,"" the president said. Without the support of all Nato members, Sweden and Finland cannot join the military alliance. Both Nordic countries deny supporting Kurdish militants. But they have joined other EU countries in imposing a weapons embargo on Turkey following its operations against Kurdish groups in Syria. What is Nato and how can Finland and Sweden join? If you're just joining us, here is a brief recap of the latest events in Ukraine to bring you up to speed.Russia's ambassador to the UK says his country will not use nuclear weapons in Ukraine  Russian forces continue assault in eastern Ukraine As we reported earlier, Russia's defence ministry says its missiles have destroyed a large arsenal of Ukrainian army weapons in Kryvyi Rih - the home city of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Now we can bring you more details. Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov claims in the last 24 hours more than 300 ""nationalists"" [Ukrainian soldiers]  have been killed. He also claims a number of other Ukrainian military targets were hit in the offensive, including a Russian defence systems shooting down a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet in Dnipro. He says: ""In total, as a result of Russian air strikes, more than 300 nationalists and up to 50 units of military and special equipment of the armed forces of Ukraine were destroyed."" The governor of the Luhansk region has accused Russia of systematically destroying the city of Severodonetsk and its residents. Serhiy Haidai said the attacks were relentless as fierce fighting rages in the area. Severodonetsk is the easternmost place in the Donbas region still held by Ukraine and it is currently a key target for Russian forces. The Luhansk governor said more civilians in the city had been killed in the latest attacks and buildings had been destroyed, including apartment blocks and a cinema. But he said Russian troops trying to capture a vital road out had been driven back. Earlier Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the situation remained difficult in the Donbas and Kharkiv regions where he said Russia was trying to ""squeeze out some result for itself"". Russia's defence ministry says that missiles have destroyed a large arsenal of
the Ukrainian army in Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's home city,
state news agency Tass reports. The defence ministry also said Russian anti-aircraft defence
systems shot down a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet in Dnipro. Steve RosenbergBBC Russia editor What we heard from Russia's UK ambassador Andrei Kelin, weâve been hearing for years from Russian officials whenever their county
is accused of anything. All accusations are
rebuffed, all evidence of Russian complicity is dismissed. What you end up with
is this parallel reality in which CCTV footage of Russian soldiers shooting
dead unarmed Ukrainian civilians is dismissed as a joke or a computer game. Where thehorrors of Buchaare dismissed as a fabrication, and where the levelling of residential
areas of Mariupol is brushed aside as either collateral damage or blamed on Ukrainian
soldiers. In other words,
none of this is ever Russiaâs fault, everyone is against Russia, everyone is
blaming Russia, everyone is accusing Russia and it claims it is the innocent
party. This is the Kremlin
narrative which weâve heard many times before. We heard it after the Salisbury
poisonings, we heard it after the attempted assassination of the Russian
opposition leader Alexei Navalny and weâre hearing it again now. As we've previously reported, Russia's ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine. He has also criticised the UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss for her tough stance on Russia. Britain hasimposed a number of sanctions on Russian individuals and businesses, as well as sending weapons to Ukraine. Ambassador Andrei Kelin told the BBC's Clive Myrie: ""She's neither a professional military man or she's not for a long time at this position. ""But she's very belligerent... ""On the position that UK would like to supply more and more arms, [but] not to think about the future of Ukraine or of Europe... ""But just to instigate conflict. Why this? What's the motivation for that? ""To make Russia more feeble?"" The ambassador added that Russia's economy has not ""toppled down"" despite the restrictions and asked what the benefit of sanctions was for the UK, which hasseen inflation hit a 40-year high, partly driven by the Ukraine war. After sanctions were imposed on Russia, the rouble fell 22% in value pushing up the price of imported goods, before it recovered. More than 1,000 international companies have also suspended trading in Russia or withdrawn altogether - including McDonalds, Coca-Cola and Starbucks. Jeremy BowenReporting from Donbas The question about negotiating in a war depends on the battlefield and on the state of mind of the parties contesting it. It has to get to a point where either side is suffering so much they are prepared to go into negotiations and give some ground, or that one side feels it has achieved enough and it is prepared to bank those gains. But at the moment I think both the Russians and Ukrainians have unfinished agendas. The Ukrainians want the Russians out. The Russians want to move forward and make their points, and deliver a victory. So I think politically there is no chance right now for a negotiation that means anything other than people getting together and talking in a room. Russia has rejected accusations that its invasion of Ukraine has created serious threats to global food security, instead blaming Western sanctions. The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. The war in Ukraine has blocked the country's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. ""The attempts of the West to attribute all troubles to the special military operation and accuse Russia of blocking foreign ships in the ports of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov are absolutely groundless,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. ""The main catalyst for the existing negative trends was the anti-Russian sanctions of the West, which led to a rupture of ties in the field of global logistics and transport infrastructure,"" she said. The hike in prices for agricultural products started in 2020 ""and is by no means a result of the special military operation"" in Ukraine she claimed, before also blaming Covid. The pandemic ""has severely disrupted value chains and significantly increased the cost of food transportation services"", she added. This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war James WaterhouseKyiv correspondent, BBC News The war is especially raging in the east of Ukraine in the
Donbas region. Russian forces have launched a number of assaults around the
city of Severodonetsk, which is increasingly finding itself
surrounded. Military experts think there is not much for Russia to gain economically or militarily by taking the city other than to declare some kind of early victory in the war, as it remains the last major city not in Russian control in the region of Luhansk. What isn't clear is whether Russian President Vladimir Putin, should the Donbas region fall, will continue to try and take more of Ukraine. It's been another night where we've seen more missile attacks, which continually raise questions over what happens next. Russiaâs ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine. Speaking to Clive Myrie, Andrei Kelin said such weapons would be used only if Russiaâs existence was threatened. The ambassador also denied Russian forces were shelling civilians, and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a ""fabrication"". Kelin's claims are contradicted by numerouseyewitness accounts from residents, who have told the BBC that Russian troops executed their loved ones. The full interview can be seen in the UK on the Sunday Morning programme, BBC One 9am. This video can not be played War crimes a 'fabrication'- Russian Ambassador Â© 2025 BBC.

Nottingham Forest have swept away misery and replaced it with hope and joy. Relegation as low as League One, for a team twice European champions, was a nadir. Now, the future looks bright under Steve Cooper. For Huddersfield too. Carlos Corberan has made them a force this term and they will be keen to go again in 2022-23. Decisions went against them today, but they will be back no doubt. That brings our coverage of the EFL to an end for the 2021-22 season. We hope you've enjoyed the rollercoaster that is the Championship, League One and League Two. Thank you for being with us. Stick the weekend of 29-31 July in your diaries. We'll be back before you know it. Until then, goodbye. Nottm Forest promoted to Premier League Steve Cooper's big issue now will be acquiring players who starred on loan. James Garner, Philip Zinckernagel, Djed Spence, Keinan Davis... they might well be wanted by other clubs, not to mention their parent sides. That will occupy Cooper's thoughts, once the hangover subsides. FT: Huddersfield 0-1 Nottm Forest Huddersfield manager Carlos Corberan has been talking to BBC Radio Leeds: ""[It] was a very balanced game - both teams were not able to create enough chances. We were more aggressive in the second half and attacked more. In the first half we counter-attacked more. They score a half-chance, and we couldn't do that. ""[On the penalty decisions]: The players felt that they would have finished the actions if it wasn't a foul, because both had clear advantages to finish the attacks. You have the referee and VAR. We were close to finishing the attacks and I can only accept the decisions. ""When I can't change the consequences of the actions, I try to forget it. I have frustration with the result, but I cannot criticise my players - they competed really well. The determination was clear to go for the game. I am proud of the year they have done. ""I am sorry for the fans that we couldn't achieve the result today - they supported us a lot."" Nottm Forest promoted to Premier League The last time Forest were able to parade any trophy from the council house onto Market Square, was back in 1998 when Dave Bassett's team won the Division One title.

The odd hoarse roar of ""The Reds are going up!"" punctures the air, as the gravity of the achievement sinks in. Some fans are just stood, many in family groups, still looking down at the pitch, likely trying to truly appreciate what has happened.

"President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden paid their respects at the Robb Elementary School memorial The US Department of Justice says it will investigate the police response to last week's mass shooting at a school in Uvalde, Texas, which killed 19 children and two teachers. Public anger is growing after it emerged that officers waited in the hallway as children trapped with the shooter made desperate 911 calls. In Uvalde, President Joe Biden met the victims' families on Sunday. He also met survivors and first responders. First Lady Jill Biden, herself a teacher, accompanied the president to a memorial at Robb Elementary School. They were seen comforting the school's principal Mandy Gutierrez, beside a carpet of floral tributes for the teachers and children who lost their lives. Both were seen wiping tears from beneath their sunglasses. Mrs Biden touched each child's photo in turn. The couple then attended a Catholic Mass at the local Sacred Heart church. Protesters outside the church shouted, ""Do something!"" as the president walked out. ""We will,"" he answered. Announcing its Critical Incident Review on Sunday, the US Department of Justice said the goal was to ""provide an independent account of law enforcement actions and responses that day, and to identify lessons learned and best practices to help first responders prepare for and respond to active shooter events"". President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden comfort Mandy Gutierrez, the principal at Robb Elementary School The shooting on 24 May has provoked new calls for gun control measures, in a country reeling from two vicious shootings in under 10 days - although leading Republicans oppose tightening rules. The US has now surpassed 200 mass shootings since the beginning of 2022. A mass shooting is defined as an incident in which four or more people are shot or killed, excluding the shooter. White House officials say Mr Biden is unlikely to offer specific policy proposals or seek to issue an executive order in the coming weeks to avoid interfering with delicate negotiations between Senate Democrats and Republicans. The president's visit comes days after18-year-old Salvador Ramos shot his grandmother, and then opened fire on a classroomof fourth-graders with a legally acquired AR-15 style assault rifle. The gunman's rampage lasted for over an hour and police found as many as 1,657 rounds of ammunition and 60 magazines in his possession after he was shot dead. Authorities have struggled to give a clear timeline of how events unfolded in Uvalde. On Friday, officialsadmitted that police had delayed entering the school for over 40 minutesbecause they did not believe it was still an ""active shooter"" situation. The senior officer on the scene decided to wait until the school janitor arrived with the keys because they thought that either ""no kids were at risk"" by then, or ""no-one was living anymore"". Several senior Republicans have already pushed back against calls for tighter rules on gun ownership, such as background checks. On Friday, former US President Donald Trump told the National Rifle Association's annual conference that decent Americans should be allowed firearms todefend themselves against ""evil"". And Texas Senator Ted Cruz has accused Democrats and the media of seeking to ""politicise"" the shooting in Uvalde to ""restrict the constitutional rights of law abiding citizens"". Speaking to the BBC at a memorial site in Uvalde ahead of Mr Biden's visit, several mourners expressed support for stricter gun laws. Melissa Rangel said she was in favour of age checks, questioning ""how at 18 years old you're able to buy a gun"". San Antonio resident Eduardo Messa said: ""I mean, we have age limits for things like cigarettes and alcohol, why not for guns, you know, this is just... this kind of massacre that occurred this week is just so heart-breaking and sad."" Eduardo Messa called for background checks and age limits before gun purchases However, Tad Neutze, a local businessman, told the BBC that he was a gun owner and challenged the need for increased checks. ""If the guy was evil, he was an evil person. And evil is going to find a way to harm people,"" he said. On Saturday, Vice-President Kamala Harrismade an impassioned plea for a ban on assault weaponswhile attending the funeral of Ruth Whitfield, an 86-year-old killed in a mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, on 14 May. The attack at a supermarket in a predominantly black neighbourhood is believed to have been racially motivated. The teenaged suspect had also legally bought an AR-15-style weapon. ""Do you know what an assault weapon is?"" Ms Harris asked mourners. ""It was designed for a specific purpose: to kill a lot of human beings quickly. An assault weapon is a weapon of war, with no place, no place in a civil society."" Ms Harris also called for enhanced background checks on all firearms purchases. Patricia Castanon said no amount of legislation will help her get over the murder of her niece But for Patricia Castanon, whose niece Annabelle Rodriguez died at Robb Elementary School, there is little President Biden can do to ease her anguish.

The attack at a supermarket in a predominantly black neighbourhood is believed to have been racially motivated. The teenaged suspect had also legally bought an AR-15-style weapon. ""Do you know what an assault weapon is?"" Ms Harris asked mourners. ""It was designed for a specific purpose: to kill a lot of human beings quickly. An assault weapon is a weapon of war, with no place, no place in a civil society."" Ms Harris also called for enhanced background checks on all firearms purchases. Patricia Castanon said no amount of legislation will help her get over the murder of her niece But for Patricia Castanon, whose niece Annabelle Rodriguez died at Robb Elementary School, there is little President Biden can do to ease her anguish. ""He can't bring her back. He can't bring none of them back and nobody can,"" she told the BBC earlier on Sunday.

"President Volodymyr Zelensky makes a rare trip outside Kyiv - visiting troops on the front line in Kharkiv region His office said he had thanked troops for defending the country Russians have attacked Kharkiv city again - weeks after being pushed away by Ukrainian troops Mr Zelensky has described the situation in parts of Kharkiv region as ""indescribably difficult"" for the Ukrainian army The Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai says civilians have been killed in Severodonetsk, with buildings destroyed in the key eastern city Russiaâs ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine Andrei Kelin also denied Russian forces were shelling civilians, and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a ""fabrication"" Meanwhile, heavy fighting is continuing near Severodonetsk in Luhansk Region, the General Staff of Ukraineâs Armed forces said Edited by Jeremy Gahagan And here we come to the end of today's live coverage. Here's a reminder of the day's key developments:  Russian rockets are devastating large areas of eastern Ukraine Russia is reported to have fired its latest multiple-rocket system
against Ukrainian targets in the Kharkiv area â a weapon described as a giant
flamethrower. That is what a Russian security official told the state-run
Tass news agency. It has not been confirmed officially. The TOS-2 Tosochka is a thermobaric fuel-air weapon: it creates massive explosions by igniting gas clouds on impact, depriving anyone in the
area of oxygen. Ukraine has pushed Russian forces back from the outskirts of
Kharkiv, the second city, which was visited by President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday. Earlier Russia confirmed that it was using TOS-1
Solntsepyok (âBlazing Sunâ) rockets against targets in the Donbas, where
Ukrainian forces are under constant, intense bombardment. TOS-1 is also thermobaric, with a range of up to 10km (six
miles). The TOS-2âs manufacturer Rostec says TOS-2 has a longer
range, better automatic targeting and more versatility. TOS-2 rockets are carried on an armoured truck, not a tank chassis. TOS-2 artillery on display - the system was first deployed last year Hugo BachegaReporting from Zaporizhzhia It was a rare trip for President Zelensky outside Kyiv. He
visited troops on the frontline near Kharkiv, Ukraineâs second city, handed out
awards and gifts, and thanked soldiers for their service. âYouâre risking your life for all of us and our state,â he
said. âThank you for defending Ukraineâs independence. Take care!â The visit was a demonstration of the countryâs success in
pushing Russian forces back from the city. And was probably intended to boost
morale as Ukraine tries to contain a massive Russian offensive in the Donbas
area further east. An onslaught that is causing enormous suffering and
destruction. Hours after the president left, loud explosions were
reported in Kharkiv. A message that the threat posed by the invading forces
there may have subsided, but itâs not entirely gone. James WaterhouseKyiv correspondent, BBC News Verdi's Rigoletto is being performed at Kyiv's Opera House Ukraineâs capital is 1,540
years old this weekend, and youâd be forgiven for assuming Kyiv wasnât in the mood
to celebrate. After all, itâs just over
three months ago that the city found itself surrounded by Russian forces, with some
predicting it would fall within 72 hours. At the time, I remember
standing outside the Opera House, where the only gathering of people was
outside a nearby pharmacy - scared and angry. Today it's a different
scene. There is a sea of smiling faces, colourful outfits and cheerful chatter
as people walk in to watch a performance of Verdi's Rigoletto. Shows returned
last week; and you canât help but feel the joy of those lucky enough to get a ticket.
Tickets are limited to 300, the capacity of the theatre's bomb shelter. âLife really goes on and we do not stop,â says Pavlo, one of the soldiers in uniform, in passing. âWe hope for the best and believe everything is going to be alrightâ. Backstage one of the lead singers, Olga Fomichova, sits illuminated by her make up mirror. âI can see our audience needs us, from the sold-out tickets, but it wonât be the sameâ she admits. âI donât have anger or defiance, only the desire to be heard, that the Ukrainians are a cultural and educated nation which deserves world-wide respect and attention.â For several of its 1,540 years, other rulers and empires have tried to take Kyiv by force. Some have been more successful than others, but few predicted such attempts would be made in 2022. Soprano for the National Opera of Ukraine Olga Fomichova Joe InwoodBBC News, Kyiv Volodymyr Zelensky has not turned out
to be the president many predicted. The former comedian, the voice of Ukrainian
Paddington Bear, was once mocked as a lightweight. Now,
he is compared to Winston Churchill. His
steadfastness in the face of overwhelming Russian force is credited by many as
being a crucial factor in his countryâs remarkable performance in the beginning
of this war. His
defiant videos from the streets of the capital, Kyiv, were a metaphorical
middle finger to Russia and its president. While
President Zelensky would appear with his colleagues, arms around their
shoulders, Vladimir Putin was pictured at one end of an almost comedically long
table, his officials barely in shouting distance. As
effective as they were, however, those appearances were all in the capital.
Todayâs visit to Kharkiv is the first time he has left the Kyiv region since
the start of Russiaâs invasion. He
met the troops that have not just defended Kharkiv, but repelled the Russians,
almost pushing them back to the international border. The
fact that he was able to visit shows just how much the tide has turned in
Ukraineâs second city. A few weeks ago, this morale boosting visit would never
have been possible. But,
do not be mistaken, Kharkiv is only safe for now. Elsewhere, Ukraine very much
appears on the back foot, withering Russian artillery barrages forcing them to
retreat in the Donbas. With
its charismatic president, Ukraine has very much won the informational war.
Unfortunately for them, that is not where this conflict will ultimately be
decided. Stopping Russia is the common mission of all civilised countries, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak has said. ""'Why does the world pay more attention to Ukraine than to Africa or the East?' - such a narrative is promoted by Russian agents,"" he wrote in a tweet. The Ukraine war is not a local conflict - it is the question of what the world will be like tomorrow, he added. Allowing Russia to win would ""open Pandora's box and push humanity into the dark ages."" Podolyak went on to say: ""Any autocrat would be able to provoke territorial conflicts, seize countries and exterminate nations. ""Stopping Russia is a mission of all civilized countries. There's time, but we should hurry up."" Moscow-imposed authorities in the southern city of Kherson say nearby fighting could affect the timing of its formal bid to join Russia. Russian forces occupied Kherson in early March - one week after the invasion of Ukraine began. It was the first major city to fall. Kirill Stremousov, deputy-head ofKherson's Moscow-installed administration, says the process might involve a referendum, backtracking on previous comments suggesting none was needed. According to Reuters news agency, he says: ""We'll announce later when some kind of vote or plebiscite
is planned, but it wonât be today and it wonât be tomorrow
because our first task is to restore order in the Kherson
region."" Russia has said that the fate of the Kherson region is for local residents to decide. But the UK Ministry of Defence said,in an intelligence update in April,external, a referendum would be a way for Russia to justify its occupation of Ukraine. And President Zelensky has said it fits in with Russia's plans of breaking Ukraine apart by creating ""pseudo-republics"" throughout the country. He has advised peoplenot to give the Russian authorities any personal data, such as passport numbers, as they might be used to falsify votes. More now on President Zelensky's rare trip outside of the capital Kyiv. He visited the frontline in the Kharkiv region where he spoke with troops and presented gifts. It comes as intense fighting continues in the region as troops attempt to regain control of the area from the Russians. Here are some more pictures of his visit. Ukraine's president has made a rare trip outside the capital, Kyiv, the presidential office says. Mr Zelensky visited front line positions in the Kharkiv region, it said. ""I want to thank each of you for your service. You risk your life for all of us and our state,"" the president told troops. The north-easten city has seen some of the worst fighting since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February.  Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said last week's talks with Finnish and Swedish delegations
were not at the ""expected level"" and Ankara cannot approve their applications to join the Nato military alliance. ""For as long as Tayyip Erdogan is the head of the Republic
of Turkey, we definitely cannot say 'yes' to countries which
support terrorism entering Nato,"" the president said. Without the support of all Nato members, Sweden and Finland cannot join the military alliance. Both Nordic countries deny supporting Kurdish militants. But they have joined other EU countries in imposing a weapons embargo on Turkey following its operations against Kurdish groups in Syria. What is Nato and how can Finland and Sweden join? If you're just joining us, here is a brief recap of the latest events in Ukraine to bring you up to speed.Russia's ambassador to the UK says his country will not use nuclear weapons in Ukraine  Russian forces continue assault in eastern Ukraine As we reported earlier, Russia's defence ministry says its missiles have destroyed a large arsenal of Ukrainian army weapons in Kryvyi Rih - the home city of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Now we can bring you more details. Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov claims in the last 24 hours more than 300 ""nationalists"" [Ukrainian soldiers]  have been killed. He also claims a number of other Ukrainian military targets were hit in the offensive, including a Russian defence systems shooting down a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet in Dnipro. He says: ""In total, as a result of Russian air strikes, more than 300 nationalists and up to 50 units of military and special equipment of the armed forces of Ukraine were destroyed."" The governor of the Luhansk region has accused Russia of systematically destroying the city of Severodonetsk and its residents. Serhiy Haidai said the attacks were relentless as fierce fighting rages in the area. Severodonetsk is the easternmost place in the Donbas region still held by Ukraine and it is currently a key target for Russian forces. The Luhansk governor said more civilians in the city had been killed in the latest attacks and buildings had been destroyed, including apartment blocks and a cinema. But he said Russian troops trying to capture a vital road out had been driven back. Earlier Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the situation remained difficult in the Donbas and Kharkiv regions where he said Russia was trying to ""squeeze out some result for itself"". Russia's defence ministry says that missiles have destroyed a large arsenal of
the Ukrainian army in Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's home city,
state news agency Tass reports. The defence ministry also said Russian anti-aircraft defence
systems shot down a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet in Dnipro. Steve RosenbergBBC Russia editor What we heard from Russia's UK ambassador Andrei Kelin, weâve been hearing for years from Russian officials whenever their county
is accused of anything. All accusations are
rebuffed, all evidence of Russian complicity is dismissed. What you end up with
is this parallel reality in which CCTV footage of Russian soldiers shooting
dead unarmed Ukrainian civilians is dismissed as a joke or a computer game. Where thehorrors of Buchaare dismissed as a fabrication, and where the levelling of residential
areas of Mariupol is brushed aside as either collateral damage or blamed on Ukrainian
soldiers. In other words,
none of this is ever Russiaâs fault, everyone is against Russia, everyone is
blaming Russia, everyone is accusing Russia and it claims it is the innocent
party. This is the Kremlin
narrative which weâve heard many times before. We heard it after the Salisbury
poisonings, we heard it after the attempted assassination of the Russian
opposition leader Alexei Navalny and weâre hearing it again now. As we've previously reported, Russia's ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine. He has also criticised the UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss for her tough stance on Russia. Britain hasimposed a number of sanctions on Russian individuals and businesses, as well as sending weapons to Ukraine. Ambassador Andrei Kelin told the BBC's Clive Myrie: ""She's neither a professional military man or she's not for a long time at this position. ""But she's very belligerent... ""On the position that UK would like to supply more and more arms, [but] not to think about the future of Ukraine or of Europe... ""But just to instigate conflict. Why this? What's the motivation for that? ""To make Russia more feeble?"" The ambassador added that Russia's economy has not ""toppled down"" despite the restrictions and asked what the benefit of sanctions was for the UK, which hasseen inflation hit a 40-year high, partly driven by the Ukraine war. After sanctions were imposed on Russia, the rouble fell 22% in value pushing up the price of imported goods, before it recovered. More than 1,000 international companies have also suspended trading in Russia or withdrawn altogether - including McDonalds, Coca-Cola and Starbucks. Jeremy BowenReporting from Donbas The question about negotiating in a war depends on the battlefield and on the state of mind of the parties contesting it. It has to get to a point where either side is suffering so much they are prepared to go into negotiations and give some ground, or that one side feels it has achieved enough and it is prepared to bank those gains. But at the moment I think both the Russians and Ukrainians have unfinished agendas. The Ukrainians want the Russians out. The Russians want to move forward and make their points, and deliver a victory. So I think politically there is no chance right now for a negotiation that means anything other than people getting together and talking in a room. Russia has rejected accusations that its invasion of Ukraine has created serious threats to global food security, instead blaming Western sanctions. The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. The war in Ukraine has blocked the country's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. ""The attempts of the West to attribute all troubles to the special military operation and accuse Russia of blocking foreign ships in the ports of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov are absolutely groundless,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. ""The main catalyst for the existing negative trends was the anti-Russian sanctions of the West, which led to a rupture of ties in the field of global logistics and transport infrastructure,"" she said. The hike in prices for agricultural products started in 2020 ""and is by no means a result of the special military operation"" in Ukraine she claimed, before also blaming Covid. The pandemic ""has severely disrupted value chains and significantly increased the cost of food transportation services"", she added. This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war James WaterhouseKyiv correspondent, BBC News The war is especially raging in the east of Ukraine in the
Donbas region. Russian forces have launched a number of assaults around the
city of Severodonetsk, which is increasingly finding itself
surrounded. Military experts think there is not much for Russia to gain economically or militarily by taking the city other than to declare some kind of early victory in the war, as it remains the last major city not in Russian control in the region of Luhansk. What isn't clear is whether Russian President Vladimir Putin, should the Donbas region fall, will continue to try and take more of Ukraine. It's been another night where we've seen more missile attacks, which continually raise questions over what happens next. Russiaâs ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine. Speaking to Clive Myrie, Andrei Kelin said such weapons would be used only if Russiaâs existence was threatened. The ambassador also denied Russian forces were shelling civilians, and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a ""fabrication"". Kelin's claims are contradicted by numerouseyewitness accounts from residents, who have told the BBC that Russian troops executed their loved ones.

"President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden paid their respects at the Robb Elementary School memorial The US Department of Justice says it will investigate the police response to last week's mass shooting at a school in Uvalde, Texas, which killed 19 children and two teachers. Public anger is growing after it emerged that officers waited in the hallway as children trapped with the shooter made desperate 911 calls. In Uvalde, President Joe Biden met the victims' families on Sunday. He also met survivors and first responders. First Lady Jill Biden, herself a teacher, accompanied the president to a memorial at Robb Elementary School. They were seen comforting the school's principal Mandy Gutierrez, beside a carpet of floral tributes for the teachers and children who lost their lives. Both were seen wiping tears from beneath their sunglasses. Mrs Biden touched each child's photo in turn. The couple then attended a Catholic Mass at the local Sacred Heart church. Protesters outside the church shouted, ""Do something!"" as the president walked out. ""We will,"" he answered. Announcing its Critical Incident Review on Sunday, the US Department of Justice said the goal was to ""provide an independent account of law enforcement actions and responses that day, and to identify lessons learned and best practices to help first responders prepare for and respond to active shooter events"". President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden comfort Mandy Gutierrez, the principal at Robb Elementary School The shooting on 24 May has provoked new calls for gun control measures, in a country reeling from two vicious shootings in under 10 days - although leading Republicans oppose tightening rules. The US has now surpassed 200 mass shootings since the beginning of 2022. A mass shooting is defined as an incident in which four or more people are shot or killed, excluding the shooter. White House officials say Mr Biden is unlikely to offer specific policy proposals or seek to issue an executive order in the coming weeks to avoid interfering with delicate negotiations between Senate Democrats and Republicans. The president's visit comes days after18-year-old Salvador Ramos shot his grandmother, and then opened fire on a classroomof fourth-graders with a legally acquired AR-15 style assault rifle. The gunman's rampage lasted for over an hour and police found as many as 1,657 rounds of ammunition and 60 magazines in his possession after he was shot dead. Authorities have struggled to give a clear timeline of how events unfolded in Uvalde. On Friday, officialsadmitted that police had delayed entering the school for over 40 minutesbecause they did not believe it was still an ""active shooter"" situation. The senior officer on the scene decided to wait until the school janitor arrived with the keys because they thought that either ""no kids were at risk"" by then, or ""no-one was living anymore"". Several senior Republicans have already pushed back against calls for tighter rules on gun ownership, such as background checks. On Friday, former US President Donald Trump told the National Rifle Association's annual conference that decent Americans should be allowed firearms todefend themselves against ""evil"". And Texas Senator Ted Cruz has accused Democrats and the media of seeking to ""politicise"" the shooting in Uvalde to ""restrict the constitutional rights of law abiding citizens"". Speaking to the BBC at a memorial site in Uvalde ahead of Mr Biden's visit, several mourners expressed support for stricter gun laws. Melissa Rangel said she was in favour of age checks, questioning ""how at 18 years old you're able to buy a gun"". San Antonio resident Eduardo Messa said: ""I mean, we have age limits for things like cigarettes and alcohol, why not for guns, you know, this is just... this kind of massacre that occurred this week is just so heart-breaking and sad."" Eduardo Messa called for background checks and age limits before gun purchases However, Tad Neutze, a local businessman, told the BBC that he was a gun owner and challenged the need for increased checks. ""If the guy was evil, he was an evil person. And evil is going to find a way to harm people,"" he said. On Saturday, Vice-President Kamala Harrismade an impassioned plea for a ban on assault weaponswhile attending the funeral of Ruth Whitfield, an 86-year-old killed in a mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, on 14 May.

"East Midlands Railway said it was running a full timetable and had ""strengthened services where possible"" Hundreds of people have been queuing near Nottingham railway station ahead of the Championship play-off final in London later. Nottingham Forest take on Huddersfield Town at Wembley and a win for the Reds would see them in the Premier League. But some Forest fans due to travel by train have been unable to make their journey. East Midlands Railway (EMR) said it was running a full timetable and had ""strengthened services where possible"".

Nottingham Forest have swept away misery and replaced it with hope and joy. Relegation as low as League One, for a team twice European champions, was a nadir. Now, the future looks bright under Steve Cooper. For Huddersfield too. Carlos Corberan has made them a force this term and they will be keen to go again in 2022-23. Decisions went against them today, but they will be back no doubt. That brings our coverage of the EFL to an end for the 2021-22 season. We hope you've enjoyed the rollercoaster that is the Championship, League One and League Two. Thank you for being with us. Stick the weekend of 29-31 July in your diaries. We'll be back before you know it. Until then, goodbye. Nottm Forest promoted to Premier League Steve Cooper's big issue now will be acquiring players who starred on loan.

We were close to finishing the attacks and I can only accept the decisions. ""When I can't change the consequences of the actions, I try to forget it.

"President Volodymyr Zelensky makes a rare trip outside Kyiv - visiting troops on the front line in Kharkiv region His office said he had thanked troops for defending the country Russians have attacked Kharkiv city again - weeks after being pushed away by Ukrainian troops Mr Zelensky has described the situation in parts of Kharkiv region as ""indescribably difficult"" for the Ukrainian army The Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai says civilians have been killed in Severodonetsk, with buildings destroyed in the key eastern city Russiaâs ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine Andrei Kelin also denied Russian forces were shelling civilians, and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a ""fabrication"" Meanwhile, heavy fighting is continuing near Severodonetsk in Luhansk Region, the General Staff of Ukraineâs Armed forces said Edited by Jeremy Gahagan And here we come to the end of today's live coverage. Here's a reminder of the day's key developments:  Russian rockets are devastating large areas of eastern Ukraine Russia is reported to have fired its latest multiple-rocket system
against Ukrainian targets in the Kharkiv area â a weapon described as a giant
flamethrower. That is what a Russian security official told the state-run
Tass news agency. It has not been confirmed officially. The TOS-2 Tosochka is a thermobaric fuel-air weapon: it creates massive explosions by igniting gas clouds on impact, depriving anyone in the
area of oxygen. Ukraine has pushed Russian forces back from the outskirts of
Kharkiv, the second city, which was visited by President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday. Earlier Russia confirmed that it was using TOS-1
Solntsepyok (âBlazing Sunâ) rockets against targets in the Donbas, where
Ukrainian forces are under constant, intense bombardment. TOS-1 is also thermobaric, with a range of up to 10km (six
miles). The TOS-2âs manufacturer Rostec says TOS-2 has a longer
range, better automatic targeting and more versatility. TOS-2 rockets are carried on an armoured truck, not a tank chassis. TOS-2 artillery on display - the system was first deployed last year Hugo BachegaReporting from Zaporizhzhia It was a rare trip for President Zelensky outside Kyiv. He
visited troops on the frontline near Kharkiv, Ukraineâs second city, handed out
awards and gifts, and thanked soldiers for their service. âYouâre risking your life for all of us and our state,â he
said. âThank you for defending Ukraineâs independence. Take care!â The visit was a demonstration of the countryâs success in
pushing Russian forces back from the city. And was probably intended to boost
morale as Ukraine tries to contain a massive Russian offensive in the Donbas
area further east. An onslaught that is causing enormous suffering and
destruction. Hours after the president left, loud explosions were
reported in Kharkiv. A message that the threat posed by the invading forces
there may have subsided, but itâs not entirely gone. James WaterhouseKyiv correspondent, BBC News Verdi's Rigoletto is being performed at Kyiv's Opera House Ukraineâs capital is 1,540
years old this weekend, and youâd be forgiven for assuming Kyiv wasnât in the mood
to celebrate. After all, itâs just over
three months ago that the city found itself surrounded by Russian forces, with some
predicting it would fall within 72 hours. At the time, I remember
standing outside the Opera House, where the only gathering of people was
outside a nearby pharmacy - scared and angry. Today it's a different
scene. There is a sea of smiling faces, colourful outfits and cheerful chatter
as people walk in to watch a performance of Verdi's Rigoletto. Shows returned
last week; and you canât help but feel the joy of those lucky enough to get a ticket.
Tickets are limited to 300, the capacity of the theatre's bomb shelter. âLife really goes on and we do not stop,â says Pavlo, one of the soldiers in uniform, in passing. âWe hope for the best and believe everything is going to be alrightâ. Backstage one of the lead singers, Olga Fomichova, sits illuminated by her make up mirror. âI can see our audience needs us, from the sold-out tickets, but it wonât be the sameâ she admits. âI donât have anger or defiance, only the desire to be heard, that the Ukrainians are a cultural and educated nation which deserves world-wide respect and attention.â For several of its 1,540 years, other rulers and empires have tried to take Kyiv by force. Some have been more successful than others, but few predicted such attempts would be made in 2022. Soprano for the National Opera of Ukraine Olga Fomichova Joe InwoodBBC News, Kyiv Volodymyr Zelensky has not turned out
to be the president many predicted. The former comedian, the voice of Ukrainian
Paddington Bear, was once mocked as a lightweight. Now,
he is compared to Winston Churchill. His
steadfastness in the face of overwhelming Russian force is credited by many as
being a crucial factor in his countryâs remarkable performance in the beginning
of this war. His
defiant videos from the streets of the capital, Kyiv, were a metaphorical
middle finger to Russia and its president. While
President Zelensky would appear with his colleagues, arms around their
shoulders, Vladimir Putin was pictured at one end of an almost comedically long
table, his officials barely in shouting distance. As
effective as they were, however, those appearances were all in the capital.
Todayâs visit to Kharkiv is the first time he has left the Kyiv region since
the start of Russiaâs invasion. He
met the troops that have not just defended Kharkiv, but repelled the Russians,
almost pushing them back to the international border. The
fact that he was able to visit shows just how much the tide has turned in
Ukraineâs second city. A few weeks ago, this morale boosting visit would never
have been possible. But,
do not be mistaken, Kharkiv is only safe for now. Elsewhere, Ukraine very much
appears on the back foot, withering Russian artillery barrages forcing them to
retreat in the Donbas. With
its charismatic president, Ukraine has very much won the informational war.
Unfortunately for them, that is not where this conflict will ultimately be
decided. Stopping Russia is the common mission of all civilised countries, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak has said. ""'Why does the world pay more attention to Ukraine than to Africa or the East?' - such a narrative is promoted by Russian agents,"" he wrote in a tweet. The Ukraine war is not a local conflict - it is the question of what the world will be like tomorrow, he added. Allowing Russia to win would ""open Pandora's box and push humanity into the dark ages."" Podolyak went on to say: ""Any autocrat would be able to provoke territorial conflicts, seize countries and exterminate nations. ""Stopping Russia is a mission of all civilized countries. There's time, but we should hurry up."" Moscow-imposed authorities in the southern city of Kherson say nearby fighting could affect the timing of its formal bid to join Russia. Russian forces occupied Kherson in early March - one week after the invasion of Ukraine began. It was the first major city to fall. Kirill Stremousov, deputy-head ofKherson's Moscow-installed administration, says the process might involve a referendum, backtracking on previous comments suggesting none was needed. According to Reuters news agency, he says: ""We'll announce later when some kind of vote or plebiscite
is planned, but it wonât be today and it wonât be tomorrow
because our first task is to restore order in the Kherson
region."" Russia has said that the fate of the Kherson region is for local residents to decide. But the UK Ministry of Defence said,in an intelligence update in April,external, a referendum would be a way for Russia to justify its occupation of Ukraine. And President Zelensky has said it fits in with Russia's plans of breaking Ukraine apart by creating ""pseudo-republics"" throughout the country. He has advised peoplenot to give the Russian authorities any personal data, such as passport numbers, as they might be used to falsify votes. More now on President Zelensky's rare trip outside of the capital Kyiv. He visited the frontline in the Kharkiv region where he spoke with troops and presented gifts. It comes as intense fighting continues in the region as troops attempt to regain control of the area from the Russians. Here are some more pictures of his visit. Ukraine's president has made a rare trip outside the capital, Kyiv, the presidential office says. Mr Zelensky visited front line positions in the Kharkiv region, it said. ""I want to thank each of you for your service. You risk your life for all of us and our state,"" the president told troops. The north-easten city has seen some of the worst fighting since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February.  Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said last week's talks with Finnish and Swedish delegations
were not at the ""expected level"" and Ankara cannot approve their applications to join the Nato military alliance. ""For as long as Tayyip Erdogan is the head of the Republic
of Turkey, we definitely cannot say 'yes' to countries which
support terrorism entering Nato,"" the president said. Without the support of all Nato members, Sweden and Finland cannot join the military alliance. Both Nordic countries deny supporting Kurdish militants. But they have joined other EU countries in imposing a weapons embargo on Turkey following its operations against Kurdish groups in Syria. What is Nato and how can Finland and Sweden join? If you're just joining us, here is a brief recap of the latest events in Ukraine to bring you up to speed.Russia's ambassador to the UK says his country will not use nuclear weapons in Ukraine  Russian forces continue assault in eastern Ukraine As we reported earlier, Russia's defence ministry says its missiles have destroyed a large arsenal of Ukrainian army weapons in Kryvyi Rih - the home city of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Now we can bring you more details. Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov claims in the last 24 hours more than 300 ""nationalists"" [Ukrainian soldiers]  have been killed. He also claims a number of other Ukrainian military targets were hit in the offensive, including a Russian defence systems shooting down a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet in Dnipro. He says: ""In total, as a result of Russian air strikes, more than 300 nationalists and up to 50 units of military and special equipment of the armed forces of Ukraine were destroyed."" The governor of the Luhansk region has accused Russia of systematically destroying the city of Severodonetsk and its residents. Serhiy Haidai said the attacks were relentless as fierce fighting rages in the area. Severodonetsk is the easternmost place in the Donbas region still held by Ukraine and it is currently a key target for Russian forces. The Luhansk governor said more civilians in the city had been killed in the latest attacks and buildings had been destroyed, including apartment blocks and a cinema. But he said Russian troops trying to capture a vital road out had been driven back. Earlier Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the situation remained difficult in the Donbas and Kharkiv regions where he said Russia was trying to ""squeeze out some result for itself"". Russia's defence ministry says that missiles have destroyed a large arsenal of
the Ukrainian army in Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's home city,
state news agency Tass reports. The defence ministry also said Russian anti-aircraft defence
systems shot down a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet in Dnipro. Steve RosenbergBBC Russia editor What we heard from Russia's UK ambassador Andrei Kelin, weâve been hearing for years from Russian officials whenever their county
is accused of anything. All accusations are
rebuffed, all evidence of Russian complicity is dismissed. What you end up with
is this parallel reality in which CCTV footage of Russian soldiers shooting
dead unarmed Ukrainian civilians is dismissed as a joke or a computer game. Where thehorrors of Buchaare dismissed as a fabrication, and where the levelling of residential
areas of Mariupol is brushed aside as either collateral damage or blamed on Ukrainian
soldiers. In other words,
none of this is ever Russiaâs fault, everyone is against Russia, everyone is
blaming Russia, everyone is accusing Russia and it claims it is the innocent
party. This is the Kremlin
narrative which weâve heard many times before. We heard it after the Salisbury
poisonings, we heard it after the attempted assassination of the Russian
opposition leader Alexei Navalny and weâre hearing it again now. As we've previously reported, Russia's ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine. He has also criticised the UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss for her tough stance on Russia. Britain hasimposed a number of sanctions on Russian individuals and businesses, as well as sending weapons to Ukraine. Ambassador Andrei Kelin told the BBC's Clive Myrie: ""She's neither a professional military man or she's not for a long time at this position. ""But she's very belligerent... ""On the position that UK would like to supply more and more arms, [but] not to think about the future of Ukraine or of Europe... ""But just to instigate conflict. Why this? What's the motivation for that? ""To make Russia more feeble?"" The ambassador added that Russia's economy has not ""toppled down"" despite the restrictions and asked what the benefit of sanctions was for the UK, which hasseen inflation hit a 40-year high, partly driven by the Ukraine war. After sanctions were imposed on Russia, the rouble fell 22% in value pushing up the price of imported goods, before it recovered. More than 1,000 international companies have also suspended trading in Russia or withdrawn altogether - including McDonalds, Coca-Cola and Starbucks. Jeremy BowenReporting from Donbas The question about negotiating in a war depends on the battlefield and on the state of mind of the parties contesting it. It has to get to a point where either side is suffering so much they are prepared to go into negotiations and give some ground, or that one side feels it has achieved enough and it is prepared to bank those gains. But at the moment I think both the Russians and Ukrainians have unfinished agendas. The Ukrainians want the Russians out. The Russians want to move forward and make their points, and deliver a victory. So I think politically there is no chance right now for a negotiation that means anything other than people getting together and talking in a room. Russia has rejected accusations that its invasion of Ukraine has created serious threats to global food security, instead blaming Western sanctions. The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. The war in Ukraine has blocked the country's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. ""The attempts of the West to attribute all troubles to the special military operation and accuse Russia of blocking foreign ships in the ports of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov are absolutely groundless,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. ""The main catalyst for the existing negative trends was the anti-Russian sanctions of the West, which led to a rupture of ties in the field of global logistics and transport infrastructure,"" she said. The hike in prices for agricultural products started in 2020 ""and is by no means a result of the special military operation"" in Ukraine she claimed, before also blaming Covid. The pandemic ""has severely disrupted value chains and significantly increased the cost of food transportation services"", she added. This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war James WaterhouseKyiv correspondent, BBC News The war is especially raging in the east of Ukraine in the
Donbas region. Russian forces have launched a number of assaults around the
city of Severodonetsk, which is increasingly finding itself
surrounded. Military experts think there is not much for Russia to gain economically or militarily by taking the city other than to declare some kind of early victory in the war, as it remains the last major city not in Russian control in the region of Luhansk.

"Kate Forbes will set out her spending review on Tuesday Scotland's economy is in a ""very difficult position"" which will force tough spending decisions in the coming months, the finance secretary has said. Kate Forbes said tackling the cost-of-living crisis while still feeling the effects of the pandemic made her upcoming financial review critical. It came after the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warned of an estimated Â£3.5bn funding gap by 2026/27. Opposition parties have criticised the government's spending ""mismanagement"". The IFS has said the government could be forced to choose between axing key policy priorities or increasing taxes to tackle the deficit. The shortfall is the equivalent of Â£640 per person and the IFS warned it could rise even higher. Ms Forbes' spending review on Tuesday will be the first time a multi-year plan has been announced in more than a decade. The finance secretary said she will set out plans to focus public sector funds ""to achieve ambitions to tackle child poverty, reach net zero and deliver sustainable services for the future"". She said: ""These are challenging times, and we need to be canny with our spending, but I'm confident that if we work together we can get through this cost-of-living crisis and still achieve our ambitions. ""We face a very difficult financial position over the next few years with funding increases below inflation levels and the challenge of recovering from the pandemic without the financial tools available to every other government in the world. ""That means that while the spending review is not a budget, it will include difficult decisions to ensure we can really focus on supporting households and services at this time."" The Scottish government is using its new welfare powers for more generous benefits than in the rest of the UK. It faces heath service backlogs coming out of the Covid crisis, and income tax - although raising rates for higher Scottish earners - is generating less revenue than expected. So the Institute of Fiscal Studies warned on Friday that either taxes will have to go up, significant cuts will be required or, with tightly constrained borrowing powers, Kate Forbes could simply hope that Westminster will deliver more funding than it has set out so far. This week's review of non-capital spending until 2026 to 2027, the end of this Parliamentary term, should show which of these ministers are choosing. In setting expectations, Kate Forbes today warns the difficult financial position will require difficult decisions, with a focus on protecting households and services. But opposition parties have condemned the Scottish government's handling of the economy. Scottish Conservatives finance spokesperson Liz Smith MSP said: ""It appears Kate Forbes' response to warnings from the IFS of a Â£3.5bn black hole in the SNP government's spending plans is to stick her fingers in her ears. ""Years of economic mismanagement by the SNP - including squandering taxpayers' cash on failed public sector projects like the ferries fiasco - has left Scotland's finances in a perilous state. Yet there is no acknowledgement of this in Ms Forbes' pre-spending review spin. ""The reality is Scots face big public spending cuts, huge tax rises or a combination of both if the SNP are to bridge the huge funding gap they've created."" Daniel Johnson, Scottish Labour's finance spokesperson, said the IFS assessment ""laid bare"" the price of  ""SNP economic failure"". He said: ""It is clear that the spending review will reveal the heavy cost of the SNP economic mismanagement. ""You can hear them trying to get the excuses in now, but the truth is that during a cost-of-living crisis, Scots will pay for nationalists prioritising the constitution over the economy. ""This will be counted in lost jobs, cuts to public services and few will be able to forgive the SNP for it.""

"President Volodymyr Zelensky makes a rare trip outside Kyiv - visiting troops on the front line in Kharkiv region His office said he had thanked troops for defending the country Russians have attacked Kharkiv city again - weeks after being pushed away by Ukrainian troops Mr Zelensky has described the situation in parts of Kharkiv region as ""indescribably difficult"" for the Ukrainian army The Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai says civilians have been killed in Severodonetsk, with buildings destroyed in the key eastern city Russiaâs ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine Andrei Kelin also denied Russian forces were shelling civilians, and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a ""fabrication"" Meanwhile, heavy fighting is continuing near Severodonetsk in Luhansk Region, the General Staff of Ukraineâs Armed forces said Edited by Jeremy Gahagan And here we come to the end of today's live coverage. Here's a reminder of the day's key developments:  Russian rockets are devastating large areas of eastern Ukraine Russia is reported to have fired its latest multiple-rocket system
against Ukrainian targets in the Kharkiv area â a weapon described as a giant
flamethrower. That is what a Russian security official told the state-run
Tass news agency. It has not been confirmed officially. The TOS-2 Tosochka is a thermobaric fuel-air weapon: it creates massive explosions by igniting gas clouds on impact, depriving anyone in the
area of oxygen. Ukraine has pushed Russian forces back from the outskirts of
Kharkiv, the second city, which was visited by President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday. Earlier Russia confirmed that it was using TOS-1
Solntsepyok (âBlazing Sunâ) rockets against targets in the Donbas, where
Ukrainian forces are under constant, intense bombardment. TOS-1 is also thermobaric, with a range of up to 10km (six
miles). The TOS-2âs manufacturer Rostec says TOS-2 has a longer
range, better automatic targeting and more versatility. TOS-2 rockets are carried on an armoured truck, not a tank chassis. TOS-2 artillery on display - the system was first deployed last year Hugo BachegaReporting from Zaporizhzhia It was a rare trip for President Zelensky outside Kyiv. He
visited troops on the frontline near Kharkiv, Ukraineâs second city, handed out
awards and gifts, and thanked soldiers for their service. âYouâre risking your life for all of us and our state,â he
said. âThank you for defending Ukraineâs independence. Take care!â The visit was a demonstration of the countryâs success in
pushing Russian forces back from the city. And was probably intended to boost
morale as Ukraine tries to contain a massive Russian offensive in the Donbas
area further east. An onslaught that is causing enormous suffering and
destruction. Hours after the president left, loud explosions were
reported in Kharkiv. A message that the threat posed by the invading forces
there may have subsided, but itâs not entirely gone. James WaterhouseKyiv correspondent, BBC News Verdi's Rigoletto is being performed at Kyiv's Opera House Ukraineâs capital is 1,540
years old this weekend, and youâd be forgiven for assuming Kyiv wasnât in the mood
to celebrate. After all, itâs just over
three months ago that the city found itself surrounded by Russian forces, with some
predicting it would fall within 72 hours. At the time, I remember
standing outside the Opera House, where the only gathering of people was
outside a nearby pharmacy - scared and angry. Today it's a different
scene. There is a sea of smiling faces, colourful outfits and cheerful chatter
as people walk in to watch a performance of Verdi's Rigoletto. Shows returned
last week; and you canât help but feel the joy of those lucky enough to get a ticket.
Tickets are limited to 300, the capacity of the theatre's bomb shelter. âLife really goes on and we do not stop,â says Pavlo, one of the soldiers in uniform, in passing. âWe hope for the best and believe everything is going to be alrightâ. Backstage one of the lead singers, Olga Fomichova, sits illuminated by her make up mirror. âI can see our audience needs us, from the sold-out tickets, but it wonât be the sameâ she admits. âI donât have anger or defiance, only the desire to be heard, that the Ukrainians are a cultural and educated nation which deserves world-wide respect and attention.â For several of its 1,540 years, other rulers and empires have tried to take Kyiv by force. Some have been more successful than others, but few predicted such attempts would be made in 2022. Soprano for the National Opera of Ukraine Olga Fomichova Joe InwoodBBC News, Kyiv Volodymyr Zelensky has not turned out
to be the president many predicted. The former comedian, the voice of Ukrainian
Paddington Bear, was once mocked as a lightweight. Now,
he is compared to Winston Churchill. His
steadfastness in the face of overwhelming Russian force is credited by many as
being a crucial factor in his countryâs remarkable performance in the beginning
of this war. His
defiant videos from the streets of the capital, Kyiv, were a metaphorical
middle finger to Russia and its president. While
President Zelensky would appear with his colleagues, arms around their
shoulders, Vladimir Putin was pictured at one end of an almost comedically long
table, his officials barely in shouting distance. As
effective as they were, however, those appearances were all in the capital.
Todayâs visit to Kharkiv is the first time he has left the Kyiv region since
the start of Russiaâs invasion. He
met the troops that have not just defended Kharkiv, but repelled the Russians,
almost pushing them back to the international border. The
fact that he was able to visit shows just how much the tide has turned in
Ukraineâs second city. A few weeks ago, this morale boosting visit would never
have been possible. But,
do not be mistaken, Kharkiv is only safe for now. Elsewhere, Ukraine very much
appears on the back foot, withering Russian artillery barrages forcing them to
retreat in the Donbas. With
its charismatic president, Ukraine has very much won the informational war.
Unfortunately for them, that is not where this conflict will ultimately be
decided. Stopping Russia is the common mission of all civilised countries, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak has said. ""'Why does the world pay more attention to Ukraine than to Africa or the East?' - such a narrative is promoted by Russian agents,"" he wrote in a tweet. The Ukraine war is not a local conflict - it is the question of what the world will be like tomorrow, he added. Allowing Russia to win would ""open Pandora's box and push humanity into the dark ages."" Podolyak went on to say: ""Any autocrat would be able to provoke territorial conflicts, seize countries and exterminate nations. ""Stopping Russia is a mission of all civilized countries. There's time, but we should hurry up."" Moscow-imposed authorities in the southern city of Kherson say nearby fighting could affect the timing of its formal bid to join Russia. Russian forces occupied Kherson in early March - one week after the invasion of Ukraine began. It was the first major city to fall. Kirill Stremousov, deputy-head ofKherson's Moscow-installed administration, says the process might involve a referendum, backtracking on previous comments suggesting none was needed. According to Reuters news agency, he says: ""We'll announce later when some kind of vote or plebiscite
is planned, but it wonât be today and it wonât be tomorrow
because our first task is to restore order in the Kherson
region."" Russia has said that the fate of the Kherson region is for local residents to decide. But the UK Ministry of Defence said,in an intelligence update in April,external, a referendum would be a way for Russia to justify its occupation of Ukraine. And President Zelensky has said it fits in with Russia's plans of breaking Ukraine apart by creating ""pseudo-republics"" throughout the country. He has advised peoplenot to give the Russian authorities any personal data, such as passport numbers, as they might be used to falsify votes. More now on President Zelensky's rare trip outside of the capital Kyiv. He visited the frontline in the Kharkiv region where he spoke with troops and presented gifts. It comes as intense fighting continues in the region as troops attempt to regain control of the area from the Russians. Here are some more pictures of his visit. Ukraine's president has made a rare trip outside the capital, Kyiv, the presidential office says. Mr Zelensky visited front line positions in the Kharkiv region, it said. ""I want to thank each of you for your service. You risk your life for all of us and our state,"" the president told troops. The north-easten city has seen some of the worst fighting since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February.  Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said last week's talks with Finnish and Swedish delegations
were not at the ""expected level"" and Ankara cannot approve their applications to join the Nato military alliance. ""For as long as Tayyip Erdogan is the head of the Republic
of Turkey, we definitely cannot say 'yes' to countries which
support terrorism entering Nato,"" the president said. Without the support of all Nato members, Sweden and Finland cannot join the military alliance. Both Nordic countries deny supporting Kurdish militants. But they have joined other EU countries in imposing a weapons embargo on Turkey following its operations against Kurdish groups in Syria. What is Nato and how can Finland and Sweden join? If you're just joining us, here is a brief recap of the latest events in Ukraine to bring you up to speed.Russia's ambassador to the UK says his country will not use nuclear weapons in Ukraine  Russian forces continue assault in eastern Ukraine As we reported earlier, Russia's defence ministry says its missiles have destroyed a large arsenal of Ukrainian army weapons in Kryvyi Rih - the home city of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Now we can bring you more details. Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov claims in the last 24 hours more than 300 ""nationalists"" [Ukrainian soldiers]  have been killed. He also claims a number of other Ukrainian military targets were hit in the offensive, including a Russian defence systems shooting down a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet in Dnipro. He says: ""In total, as a result of Russian air strikes, more than 300 nationalists and up to 50 units of military and special equipment of the armed forces of Ukraine were destroyed."" The governor of the Luhansk region has accused Russia of systematically destroying the city of Severodonetsk and its residents. Serhiy Haidai said the attacks were relentless as fierce fighting rages in the area. Severodonetsk is the easternmost place in the Donbas region still held by Ukraine and it is currently a key target for Russian forces. The Luhansk governor said more civilians in the city had been killed in the latest attacks and buildings had been destroyed, including apartment blocks and a cinema. But he said Russian troops trying to capture a vital road out had been driven back. Earlier Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the situation remained difficult in the Donbas and Kharkiv regions where he said Russia was trying to ""squeeze out some result for itself"". Russia's defence ministry says that missiles have destroyed a large arsenal of
the Ukrainian army in Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's home city,
state news agency Tass reports. The defence ministry also said Russian anti-aircraft defence
systems shot down a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet in Dnipro. Steve RosenbergBBC Russia editor What we heard from Russia's UK ambassador Andrei Kelin, weâve been hearing for years from Russian officials whenever their county
is accused of anything. All accusations are
rebuffed, all evidence of Russian complicity is dismissed. What you end up with
is this parallel reality in which CCTV footage of Russian soldiers shooting
dead unarmed Ukrainian civilians is dismissed as a joke or a computer game. Where thehorrors of Buchaare dismissed as a fabrication, and where the levelling of residential
areas of Mariupol is brushed aside as either collateral damage or blamed on Ukrainian
soldiers. In other words,
none of this is ever Russiaâs fault, everyone is against Russia, everyone is
blaming Russia, everyone is accusing Russia and it claims it is the innocent
party. This is the Kremlin
narrative which weâve heard many times before. We heard it after the Salisbury
poisonings, we heard it after the attempted assassination of the Russian
opposition leader Alexei Navalny and weâre hearing it again now. As we've previously reported, Russia's ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine. He has also criticised the UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss for her tough stance on Russia. Britain hasimposed a number of sanctions on Russian individuals and businesses, as well as sending weapons to Ukraine. Ambassador Andrei Kelin told the BBC's Clive Myrie: ""She's neither a professional military man or she's not for a long time at this position. ""But she's very belligerent... ""On the position that UK would like to supply more and more arms, [but] not to think about the future of Ukraine or of Europe... ""But just to instigate conflict. Why this? What's the motivation for that? ""To make Russia more feeble?"" The ambassador added that Russia's economy has not ""toppled down"" despite the restrictions and asked what the benefit of sanctions was for the UK, which hasseen inflation hit a 40-year high, partly driven by the Ukraine war. After sanctions were imposed on Russia, the rouble fell 22% in value pushing up the price of imported goods, before it recovered. More than 1,000 international companies have also suspended trading in Russia or withdrawn altogether - including McDonalds, Coca-Cola and Starbucks. Jeremy BowenReporting from Donbas The question about negotiating in a war depends on the battlefield and on the state of mind of the parties contesting it. It has to get to a point where either side is suffering so much they are prepared to go into negotiations and give some ground, or that one side feels it has achieved enough and it is prepared to bank those gains. But at the moment I think both the Russians and Ukrainians have unfinished agendas. The Ukrainians want the Russians out. The Russians want to move forward and make their points, and deliver a victory. So I think politically there is no chance right now for a negotiation that means anything other than people getting together and talking in a room. Russia has rejected accusations that its invasion of Ukraine has created serious threats to global food security, instead blaming Western sanctions. The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. The war in Ukraine has blocked the country's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. ""The attempts of the West to attribute all troubles to the special military operation and accuse Russia of blocking foreign ships in the ports of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov are absolutely groundless,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. ""The main catalyst for the existing negative trends was the anti-Russian sanctions of the West, which led to a rupture of ties in the field of global logistics and transport infrastructure,"" she said. The hike in prices for agricultural products started in 2020 ""and is by no means a result of the special military operation"" in Ukraine she claimed, before also blaming Covid. The pandemic ""has severely disrupted value chains and significantly increased the cost of food transportation services"", she added. This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war James WaterhouseKyiv correspondent, BBC News The war is especially raging in the east of Ukraine in the
Donbas region. Russian forces have launched a number of assaults around the

"The government will launch a post-Brexit review next week on how and where traders can sell produce using imperial measurements. Currently they must use metric when selling packaged or loose goods - although Britain's traditional weighing system can be shown alongside. The review, which hadalready been signalled, will begin on Friday. Labour MP Angela Eagle said it was a ""pathetic"" attempt to ""weaponise nostalgia"". Under EU rules from 2000 copied over after Brexit, traders can use imperial measurements - such as pounds and ounces - alongside metric, but they cannot be more prominent. In September, the government said it would review these rules as part of broader plans to reshape UK law after Brexit, and legislate ""in due course"". It has confirmed a consultation on potential changes will start next week, to coincide with the Queen's Jubilee weekend, and last for three months. Imperial units just part of Brexit revamp - No 10 Bunting at the ready - party planners set for Jubilee When's the four-day Jubilee bank holiday? Did the EU ban crown marks on pint glasses? In 2001, the rules became the focus of debate in the UK following the prosecution of the ""metric martyrs"" - a group of market traders convicted of selling goods using only imperial measures - although they have not been rigorously enforced since. The UK copied the law over when it left the EU to smooth its exit, but the review will now look at how, if at all, the regulation should change. The BBC understands there is not expected to be any move away from metric units. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told Sky News traders would be ""pleased"" with the ""freedom"" to move away from EU rules. But Conservative MP Alicia Kearns, who recently called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson toresign over Partygate, said ""not one"" of her constituents had asked for the change.

"The government will launch a post-Brexit review next week on how and where traders can sell produce using imperial measurements. Currently they must use metric when selling packaged or loose goods - although Britain's traditional weighing system can be shown alongside. The review, which hadalready been signalled, will begin on Friday. Labour MP Angela Eagle said it was a ""pathetic"" attempt to ""weaponise nostalgia"". Under EU rules from 2000 copied over after Brexit, traders can use imperial measurements - such as pounds and ounces - alongside metric, but they cannot be more prominent. In September, the government said it would review these rules as part of broader plans to reshape UK law after Brexit, and legislate ""in due course"". It has confirmed a consultation on potential changes will start next week, to coincide with the Queen's Jubilee weekend, and last for three months. Imperial units just part of Brexit revamp - No 10 Bunting at the ready - party planners set for Jubilee When's the four-day Jubilee bank holiday? Did the EU ban crown marks on pint glasses? In 2001, the rules became the focus of debate in the UK following the prosecution of the ""metric martyrs"" - a group of market traders convicted of selling goods using only imperial measures - although they have not been rigorously enforced since. The UK copied the law over when it left the EU to smooth its exit, but the review will now look at how, if at all, the regulation should change. The BBC understands there is not expected to be any move away from metric units. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told Sky News traders would be ""pleased"" with the ""freedom"" to move away from EU rules. But Conservative MP Alicia Kearns, who recently called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson toresign over Partygate, said ""not one"" of her constituents had asked for the change. ""This isn't a Brexit freedom. It's a nonsense,"" she added.

"President Volodymyr Zelensky makes a rare trip outside Kyiv - visiting troops on the front line in Kharkiv region His office said he had thanked troops for defending the country Russians have attacked Kharkiv city again - weeks after being pushed away by Ukrainian troops Mr Zelensky has described the situation in parts of Kharkiv region as ""indescribably difficult"" for the Ukrainian army The Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai says civilians have been killed in Severodonetsk, with buildings destroyed in the key eastern city Russiaâs ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine Andrei Kelin also denied Russian forces were shelling civilians, and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a ""fabrication"" Meanwhile, heavy fighting is continuing near Severodonetsk in Luhansk Region, the General Staff of Ukraineâs Armed forces said Edited by Jeremy Gahagan And here we come to the end of today's live coverage. Here's a reminder of the day's key developments:  Russian rockets are devastating large areas of eastern Ukraine Russia is reported to have fired its latest multiple-rocket system
against Ukrainian targets in the Kharkiv area â a weapon described as a giant
flamethrower. That is what a Russian security official told the state-run
Tass news agency. It has not been confirmed officially. The TOS-2 Tosochka is a thermobaric fuel-air weapon: it creates massive explosions by igniting gas clouds on impact, depriving anyone in the
area of oxygen. Ukraine has pushed Russian forces back from the outskirts of
Kharkiv, the second city, which was visited by President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday. Earlier Russia confirmed that it was using TOS-1
Solntsepyok (âBlazing Sunâ) rockets against targets in the Donbas, where
Ukrainian forces are under constant, intense bombardment. TOS-1 is also thermobaric, with a range of up to 10km (six
miles). The TOS-2âs manufacturer Rostec says TOS-2 has a longer
range, better automatic targeting and more versatility. TOS-2 rockets are carried on an armoured truck, not a tank chassis. TOS-2 artillery on display - the system was first deployed last year Hugo BachegaReporting from Zaporizhzhia It was a rare trip for President Zelensky outside Kyiv. He
visited troops on the frontline near Kharkiv, Ukraineâs second city, handed out
awards and gifts, and thanked soldiers for their service. âYouâre risking your life for all of us and our state,â he
said. âThank you for defending Ukraineâs independence. Take care!â The visit was a demonstration of the countryâs success in
pushing Russian forces back from the city. And was probably intended to boost
morale as Ukraine tries to contain a massive Russian offensive in the Donbas
area further east. An onslaught that is causing enormous suffering and
destruction. Hours after the president left, loud explosions were
reported in Kharkiv. A message that the threat posed by the invading forces
there may have subsided, but itâs not entirely gone. James WaterhouseKyiv correspondent, BBC News Verdi's Rigoletto is being performed at Kyiv's Opera House Ukraineâs capital is 1,540
years old this weekend, and youâd be forgiven for assuming Kyiv wasnât in the mood
to celebrate. After all, itâs just over
three months ago that the city found itself surrounded by Russian forces, with some
predicting it would fall within 72 hours. At the time, I remember
standing outside the Opera House, where the only gathering of people was
outside a nearby pharmacy - scared and angry. Today it's a different
scene. There is a sea of smiling faces, colourful outfits and cheerful chatter
as people walk in to watch a performance of Verdi's Rigoletto. Shows returned
last week; and you canât help but feel the joy of those lucky enough to get a ticket.
Tickets are limited to 300, the capacity of the theatre's bomb shelter. âLife really goes on and we do not stop,â says Pavlo, one of the soldiers in uniform, in passing. âWe hope for the best and believe everything is going to be alrightâ. Backstage one of the lead singers, Olga Fomichova, sits illuminated by her make up mirror. âI can see our audience needs us, from the sold-out tickets, but it wonât be the sameâ she admits. âI donât have anger or defiance, only the desire to be heard, that the Ukrainians are a cultural and educated nation which deserves world-wide respect and attention.â For several of its 1,540 years, other rulers and empires have tried to take Kyiv by force. Some have been more successful than others, but few predicted such attempts would be made in 2022. Soprano for the National Opera of Ukraine Olga Fomichova Joe InwoodBBC News, Kyiv Volodymyr Zelensky has not turned out
to be the president many predicted. The former comedian, the voice of Ukrainian
Paddington Bear, was once mocked as a lightweight. Now,
he is compared to Winston Churchill. His
steadfastness in the face of overwhelming Russian force is credited by many as
being a crucial factor in his countryâs remarkable performance in the beginning
of this war. His
defiant videos from the streets of the capital, Kyiv, were a metaphorical
middle finger to Russia and its president. While
President Zelensky would appear with his colleagues, arms around their
shoulders, Vladimir Putin was pictured at one end of an almost comedically long
table, his officials barely in shouting distance. As
effective as they were, however, those appearances were all in the capital.
Todayâs visit to Kharkiv is the first time he has left the Kyiv region since
the start of Russiaâs invasion. He
met the troops that have not just defended Kharkiv, but repelled the Russians,
almost pushing them back to the international border. The
fact that he was able to visit shows just how much the tide has turned in
Ukraineâs second city. A few weeks ago, this morale boosting visit would never
have been possible. But,
do not be mistaken, Kharkiv is only safe for now. Elsewhere, Ukraine very much
appears on the back foot, withering Russian artillery barrages forcing them to
retreat in the Donbas. With
its charismatic president, Ukraine has very much won the informational war.
Unfortunately for them, that is not where this conflict will ultimately be
decided. Stopping Russia is the common mission of all civilised countries, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak has said. ""'Why does the world pay more attention to Ukraine than to Africa or the East?' - such a narrative is promoted by Russian agents,"" he wrote in a tweet. The Ukraine war is not a local conflict - it is the question of what the world will be like tomorrow, he added. Allowing Russia to win would ""open Pandora's box and push humanity into the dark ages."" Podolyak went on to say: ""Any autocrat would be able to provoke territorial conflicts, seize countries and exterminate nations. ""Stopping Russia is a mission of all civilized countries. There's time, but we should hurry up."" Moscow-imposed authorities in the southern city of Kherson say nearby fighting could affect the timing of its formal bid to join Russia. Russian forces occupied Kherson in early March - one week after the invasion of Ukraine began. It was the first major city to fall. Kirill Stremousov, deputy-head ofKherson's Moscow-installed administration, says the process might involve a referendum, backtracking on previous comments suggesting none was needed. According to Reuters news agency, he says: ""We'll announce later when some kind of vote or plebiscite
is planned, but it wonât be today and it wonât be tomorrow
because our first task is to restore order in the Kherson
region."" Russia has said that the fate of the Kherson region is for local residents to decide. But the UK Ministry of Defence said,in an intelligence update in April,external, a referendum would be a way for Russia to justify its occupation of Ukraine. And President Zelensky has said it fits in with Russia's plans of breaking Ukraine apart by creating ""pseudo-republics"" throughout the country. He has advised peoplenot to give the Russian authorities any personal data, such as passport numbers, as they might be used to falsify votes. More now on President Zelensky's rare trip outside of the capital Kyiv. He visited the frontline in the Kharkiv region where he spoke with troops and presented gifts. It comes as intense fighting continues in the region as troops attempt to regain control of the area from the Russians. Here are some more pictures of his visit. Ukraine's president has made a rare trip outside the capital, Kyiv, the presidential office says. Mr Zelensky visited front line positions in the Kharkiv region, it said. ""I want to thank each of you for your service. You risk your life for all of us and our state,"" the president told troops. The north-easten city has seen some of the worst fighting since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February.  Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said last week's talks with Finnish and Swedish delegations
were not at the ""expected level"" and Ankara cannot approve their applications to join the Nato military alliance. ""For as long as Tayyip Erdogan is the head of the Republic
of Turkey, we definitely cannot say 'yes' to countries which
support terrorism entering Nato,"" the president said. Without the support of all Nato members, Sweden and Finland cannot join the military alliance. Both Nordic countries deny supporting Kurdish militants. But they have joined other EU countries in imposing a weapons embargo on Turkey following its operations against Kurdish groups in Syria. What is Nato and how can Finland and Sweden join? If you're just joining us, here is a brief recap of the latest events in Ukraine to bring you up to speed.Russia's ambassador to the UK says his country will not use nuclear weapons in Ukraine  Russian forces continue assault in eastern Ukraine As we reported earlier, Russia's defence ministry says its missiles have destroyed a large arsenal of Ukrainian army weapons in Kryvyi Rih - the home city of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Now we can bring you more details. Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov claims in the last 24 hours more than 300 ""nationalists"" [Ukrainian soldiers]  have been killed. He also claims a number of other Ukrainian military targets were hit in the offensive, including a Russian defence systems shooting down a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet in Dnipro. He says: ""In total, as a result of Russian air strikes, more than 300 nationalists and up to 50 units of military and special equipment of the armed forces of Ukraine were destroyed."" The governor of the Luhansk region has accused Russia of systematically destroying the city of Severodonetsk and its residents. Serhiy Haidai said the attacks were relentless as fierce fighting rages in the area. Severodonetsk is the easternmost place in the Donbas region still held by Ukraine and it is currently a key target for Russian forces. The Luhansk governor said more civilians in the city had been killed in the latest attacks and buildings had been destroyed, including apartment blocks and a cinema. But he said Russian troops trying to capture a vital road out had been driven back. Earlier Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the situation remained difficult in the Donbas and Kharkiv regions where he said Russia was trying to ""squeeze out some result for itself"". Russia's defence ministry says that missiles have destroyed a large arsenal of
the Ukrainian army in Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's home city,
state news agency Tass reports. The defence ministry also said Russian anti-aircraft defence
systems shot down a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet in Dnipro. Steve RosenbergBBC Russia editor What we heard from Russia's UK ambassador Andrei Kelin, weâve been hearing for years from Russian officials whenever their county
is accused of anything. All accusations are
rebuffed, all evidence of Russian complicity is dismissed. What you end up with
is this parallel reality in which CCTV footage of Russian soldiers shooting
dead unarmed Ukrainian civilians is dismissed as a joke or a computer game. Where thehorrors of Buchaare dismissed as a fabrication, and where the levelling of residential
areas of Mariupol is brushed aside as either collateral damage or blamed on Ukrainian
soldiers. In other words,
none of this is ever Russiaâs fault, everyone is against Russia, everyone is
blaming Russia, everyone is accusing Russia and it claims it is the innocent
party. This is the Kremlin
narrative which weâve heard many times before. We heard it after the Salisbury
poisonings, we heard it after the attempted assassination of the Russian
opposition leader Alexei Navalny and weâre hearing it again now. As we've previously reported, Russia's ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine. He has also criticised the UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss for her tough stance on Russia. Britain hasimposed a number of sanctions on Russian individuals and businesses, as well as sending weapons to Ukraine. Ambassador Andrei Kelin told the BBC's Clive Myrie: ""She's neither a professional military man or she's not for a long time at this position. ""But she's very belligerent... ""On the position that UK would like to supply more and more arms, [but] not to think about the future of Ukraine or of Europe... ""But just to instigate conflict. Why this? What's the motivation for that? ""To make Russia more feeble?"" The ambassador added that Russia's economy has not ""toppled down"" despite the restrictions and asked what the benefit of sanctions was for the UK, which hasseen inflation hit a 40-year high, partly driven by the Ukraine war. After sanctions were imposed on Russia, the rouble fell 22% in value pushing up the price of imported goods, before it recovered. More than 1,000 international companies have also suspended trading in Russia or withdrawn altogether - including McDonalds, Coca-Cola and Starbucks. Jeremy BowenReporting from Donbas The question about negotiating in a war depends on the battlefield and on the state of mind of the parties contesting it. It has to get to a point where either side is suffering so much they are prepared to go into negotiations and give some ground, or that one side feels it has achieved enough and it is prepared to bank those gains. But at the moment I think both the Russians and Ukrainians have unfinished agendas. The Ukrainians want the Russians out. The Russians want to move forward and make their points, and deliver a victory. So I think politically there is no chance right now for a negotiation that means anything other than people getting together and talking in a room. Russia has rejected accusations that its invasion of Ukraine has created serious threats to global food security, instead blaming Western sanctions. The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. The war in Ukraine has blocked the country's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. ""The attempts of the West to attribute all troubles to the special military operation and accuse Russia of blocking foreign ships in the ports of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov are absolutely groundless,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. ""The main catalyst for the existing negative trends was the anti-Russian sanctions of the West, which led to a rupture of ties in the field of global logistics and transport infrastructure,"" she said. The hike in prices for agricultural products started in 2020 ""and is by no means a result of the special military operation"" in Ukraine she claimed, before also blaming Covid. The pandemic ""has severely disrupted value chains and significantly increased the cost of food transportation services"", she added. This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war James WaterhouseKyiv correspondent, BBC News The war is especially raging in the east of Ukraine in the
Donbas region. Russian forces have launched a number of assaults around the
city of Severodonetsk, which is increasingly finding itself
surrounded. Military experts think there is not much for Russia to gain economically or militarily by taking the city other than to declare some kind of early victory in the war, as it remains the last major city not in Russian control in the region of Luhansk. What isn't clear is whether Russian President Vladimir Putin, should the Donbas region fall, will continue to try and take more of Ukraine. It's been another night where we've seen more missile attacks, which continually raise questions over what happens next. Russiaâs ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine. Speaking to Clive Myrie, Andrei Kelin said such weapons would be used only if Russiaâs existence was threatened. The ambassador also denied Russian forces were shelling civilians, and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a ""fabrication"". Kelin's claims are contradicted by numerouseyewitness accounts from residents, who have told the BBC that Russian troops executed their loved ones.

"Real Madrid are champions of Europe for a record 14th time Liverpool's bid to claim the Champions League trophy for the seventh time ended in bitter disappointment as Vinicius Jr's second-half winner gave Real Madrid victory in Paris. Jurgen Klopp's side ran into a one-man wall of defiance as Real goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois produced one of the great individual performances to thwart Liverpool time and again. Mohamed Salah, seeking revenge for his early departure through injury in the 2018 final against Real, was denied six times by Courtois who was simply unbeatable. The victory also sees Carlo Ancelotti make history by becoming the first coach to win a fourth Champions League title. Real were always a threat and the decisive moment came after 59 minutes when Vinicius stole in unmarked at the far post to score. This was also a final marred by chaotic scenes outside Stade de France with thousands of Liverpool fans, some targeted with pepper spray by French police, unable to get into the stadium, forcing the kick-off to be delayed by more than 30 minutes. 'A miserable night on every level imaginable' Liverpool want investigation into final scenes From embarrassment to glory - 'remarkable' Real Organisation of final 'a shambles' - Robertson This video can not be played Champions League: Liverpool will 'go again' says Jurgen Klopp Liverpool's magnificent season brought them the Carabao Cup and the FA Cup - both won on penalties against Chelsea - but ended in a double disappointment in the final week of a stellar campaign. The Champions League might have eased the agony of just missing out on the Premier League to Manchester City by one point, only for Liverpool to find themselves on the wrong end of a goalkeeping masterclass from Courtois. The Belgian was simply perfect as he was a constant thorn in Salah's side, turned Sadio Mane's shot on to the post brilliantly and commanded his penalty area with faultless handling. Salah held his head in disbelief on many occasions as Courtois manned the barricade for Real, leaving the Egyptian to nurse the pain of another Champions League final defeat by the Spanish giants. Liverpool will come again after final loss - Klopp I don't get enough respect says Real's Courtois Champions League final: Real Madrid beat Liverpool - recap Go straight to all the best Liverpool content Mohamed Salah was denied several times by Thibaut Courtois Liverpool were not quite at their best and eventually paid the price for not taking chances as Real pounced in trademark fashion to win this tournament for a record-extending 14th time. Klopp's side could not have given any more as they pushed to the final whistle but looked jaded towards the end - no surprise given the demands made of them this season. Liverpool will still take huge credit by maintaining a push for an historic quadruple until the final week of the season but the conclusion will sting. The occasion left even more of a sour taste given the events outside Stade de France. Liverpool are demanding a full investigation into how thousands of their fans could not get into the stadium, with dangerous numbers packed into small areas as kick-off approached. Real Madrid have been living by the skin of their teeth in the Champions League this season, but any side that beats Paris St- Germain, Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool to reach their goal answers every question. This is a side that knows how to get the job done, no matter how late they leave it, no matter how much the odds seem stacked against them. Real are bolstered by years of experience and quality that gives them concrete-clad self-belief that has seen them navigate their way out of so many tight situations. And what a moment for their legendary coach Ancelotti, who was brought back to the Bernabeu from Everton a year ago and has won La Liga and the Champions League on his return. Ancelotti can now lay claim to history with that fourth triumph, once again showing his mastery of managing egos and high-class players who respond to the vastly experienced Italian's promptings. He was the most relaxed man in Paris at his pre-match press conference, oozing confidence, and can now look back at two Champions League wins over Liverpool, here and for AC Milan in 2007, after losing in the so-called miracle of Istanbul in 2005.

"The parade leaves the grounds of Stormont, heading for the city centre About 100,000 people have watched an Orange Order parade to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland, the chief constable has said. Some 25,000 people took part, amid a huge policing operation in Belfast. Before the parade started, Orange Order Grand Secretary, the Rev Mervyn Gibson, rejected any change to Northern Ireland's position within the UK. He said Northern Ireland has ""no interest in becoming part of an all-Ireland - save your breath"". The parade, which led to traffic restrictions in many areas of the city, ended on Saturday evening. Bands converged in the city centre on Saturday afternoon The march from Stormont to Belfast City Hall was postponed last year because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Itstarted at Stormont,externalat 13:00 BST before heading down the Newtownards Road, over Queen's Bridge and on to City Hall. Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Chief Constable Simon Byrne said months of planning had gone into Saturday's operation with 500 officers on duty, mostly across Belfast. ""This is quite a significant policing operation,"" he said. This video can not be played 'British we are and British we'll stay' - centennial parade is told ""This is slightly unique because of the traffic disruption over the length of journey, but what we see here today is a blueprint for what could be a busy summer. ""But we're really optimistic about a family fun day and a celebration of the past."" People gathered to listen to speeches and music on the lawn at Stormont People started gathering at Stormont from about 10:00 with speeches beginning at noon in front of Parliament Buildings. Addressing the crowd at Stormont, the Rev Gibson said that ""it doesn't matter what you promise or offer [in a united Ireland], it doesn't matter if every day was the 12th of July"". ""If it's not under the Union Jack then count us out,"" he said. ""British we are and British we'll stay."" However, he warned thatthe Northern Ireland Protocol, part of the Brexit trade deal, was a threat to the union. ""No fundamental change to the protocol, then no functioning assembly,"" he said. ""Because let me make clear if the protocol is not sorted then make no mistake - no mistake - there will be no next 100 years for Northern Ireland."" Allow Twitter content?

The Rev Gibson ended his speech by saying: ""And the cry to those who seek to persuade us or push us into a united Ireland is still the same: 'no surrender'."" He added that he wants to see a Northern Ireland that is ""financially stable, where there is truly equality of opportunity for all, equality in education, an effective and efficient health service, where culture and heritage are celebrated and respected"". How was Northern Ireland's centenary year marked? Grand Master Edward Stevenson said that unionists ""are fully justified in not only commemorating, but proudly celebrating, this anniversary"". About 25,000 are thought to be taking part in the parade He added that ""disappointingly but predictably, throughout 2021 there were those who told us that there is nothing to celebrate"". ""Rather than a celebration they repeatedly downplayed the anniversary and all it stood for,"" he added. ""Regrettably, even our own UK government did little - despite much encouragement by this organisation and others - to ensure that the centenary was marked in a fitting way.""
