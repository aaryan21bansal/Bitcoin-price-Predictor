BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra More from England coach Chris Silverwood, speaking to TMS earlier, on what he would like from the rest of the tour:""I'd like two wins, to be honest. I'd like us to put our best foot forward, come out and compete. It's going to be hard work, we know that. Australia have showed their class in all three games."" #bbccricket Robin Bernstein:Losing like this is shameful. Previous Australian teams, which were much better, had to work harder than this team have had to. Meek and weak in every department from the management all way through to the players. BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra England coach Chris Silverwood, speaking to TMS after the defeat:""We have to find a way of moving forward and getting runs against high-quality attacks. ""Without no games to back them up, the best we can do is get players in the nets. It is a difficult thing to do. That's the way it is in this day and age. ""I have to give credit to the bowlers. To do what they did and perform at the level they did yesterday was excellent."" Many of you are placing blame on the ECB's new 100-ball competition which took place in the summer.

As you might expect, there's been little social media action from the England team. If you're just joining us, you'll have seen the headlines and wondering what on earth happened. Here are the highlights from day three of the third Ashes Test for you to... I'll say 'watch' instead of 'enjoy'... #bbccricket Ian Clark:I feel sorry for Joe Root and the bowlers in the England team. We just canât bat against a decent bowling line up abroad. We canât just say we win at home everythingâs fine. The way things are at the moment, Test cricket for England is dead. Martin:For those saying itâs the end of Root as captain, who the hell would you make captain out of the rest of them? Not a single decent choice amongst them all. More from Joe Root, speaking to TMS earlier:""My main focus and the groups focus is on the next ball, which is the first ball of the next Test. ""You can't start looking at things too far in the future. More than anything, we've got to make sure we end up coming away from this tour with something. ""We do not want to be stood there 5-0 at the end of the series. We've got two Test matches, a lot of World Test Championship points to play for, and we have to put some pride back into the badge and give the fans that are so loyal to us back home something to shout about and enjoy."" #bbccricket Danny Bushell:Surely that's it for Silverwood and Root? Utter shambles. GP:Englandâs worst performance in decades. Canât get worse. No fight. England captain Joe Root, speaking to TMS after the defeat:""I look at this squad of players as being the best 18 red-ball players that are in our county system. ""If we want to talk about the set up and the structure below then that is
a longer conversation for another time. ""The fact is we have 18 players here playing for England and theyâve got
a responsibility. Weâve all got a responsibility to be better than what we have
been so far and weâve got two games to show just that and put some pride back in
to the badge and give something for the fans back home to cheer about and show
how much we care about playing for our country."" Just scrolling through some of your comments social media. it's not even daylight but you lot are not holding back on. I expected no less, to be honest. Let's hear what Joe Root had to say on Test Match Special earlier... #bbccricket Ditchy:Now England know why they call it Ashes...they are burnt out. And here's the winning moment. England were finally put out of their misery as Cameron Green dismissed James Anderson... The final five wickets fell in the space of 30 balls. England's 68 all out is their lowest total in Australia since March 1904 and their ninth lowest score against them in Tests. Sigh. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Taliban took power in August after a swift military campaign The Taliban have said Afghan women seeking to travel long distances by road should be offered transport only if accompanied by a male relative. The directive, issued on Sunday, is the latest curb on women's rights since the Islamist group seized power in August. A majority of secondary schools remain shut for girls, while most women have been banned from working. Campaign group Human Rights Watch said the new restriction moved further towards making women prisoners. Heather Barr, the group's associate director of women's rights, told AFP news agency the order ""shuts off opportunities for [women] to be able to move about freely"" or ""to be able to flee if they are facing violence in the home"". The latest directive, issued by the Taliban's Ministry of Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, said women travelling for more than 45 miles (72km) should be accompanied by a close male family member. The document calls on vehicle owners to refuse rides to women not wearing Islamic head or face coverings, although it does not say which type of covering to use. Most Afghan women already wear headscarves. It also bans the playing of music in vehicles. ""I felt really bad,"" Fatima, a midwife who lives in Kabul, told the BBC, reacting to the directive. ""I cannot go out independently. What should I do if either I or my child is sick and my husband is not available?"" She added: ""The Taliban captured our happiness from us... I have lost both my independence and happiness."" Another Afghan woman told the BBC that, while the measure would help some women ""feel at ease"", a family escort was no guarantee against violence and harassment. She referred to an incident in Paghman in 2015 when four women were kidnapped from their family at gunpoint and later gang-raped. ""[The Taliban] have to create an environment around the country in such a way that women feel safe,"" she added.

"The Missionaries of Charity run community kitchens, schools and hospices across India India's government has refused to renew the foreign-funding licence for a charity founded by Mother Teresa. The Missionaries of Charity has thousands of nuns supervising projects like homes for abandoned children, schools, clinics and hospices. On Christmas Day, India's home ministry announced it had not renewed the registration due to ""adverse inputs"". Hindu hardliners have long accused the charity of using its programmes to convert people to Christianity. The charity has denied these allegations. In a statement on Monday, it confirmed that its renewal application had been denied, and that it would not operate any foreign funding accounts ""until the matter is resolved"". Earlier the chief minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, drew criticism after tweeting that the government had frozen the charity's bank accounts. But the government and the country have both since denied that the accounts were frozen. The Kolkata-based charity was founded in 1950 by Mother Teresa, a Roman Catholic nun who moved to India from her native Macedonia. It is one of the world's best-known Catholic charities. Mother Teresa was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her humanitarian work, and she was declared a saint by Pope Francis in 2016, 19 years after her death. This video can not be played Who was Mother Teresa? The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has sought to squeeze foreign funding for charities and other NGOs based in India. Last year, restrictions led to the freezing of bank accounts belonging to Greenpeace and Amnesty International. There have also been several attacks on religious minorities across India. According to the Evangelical Fellowship of India, attacks have been prominent in the southern state of Karnataka, with nearly 40 reports of threats or violence. Hindu vigilante groups disrupted Christmas celebrations in parts of the country this year, protesting outside religious gatherings, and vandalising a church in northern India. The majority of India's population are Hindu. But there are around 24 million Christians in the country - around 2% of the population - and it is home to the second-largest Catholic community in Asia, behind the Philippines. Authorities have sought to crack down on alleged campaigns to convert Hindus to Christianity and Islam. Several BJP-ruled states have recently passed, or are considering passing laws that ban religious conversion for marriage.

"Bar owners are having difficulty enforcing the new rules, with one saying footfall has dropped by at least 50% New rules for hospitality in Wales have left some customers confused while others stayed away, said bar owners. Since 26 December, two-metre social distancing returned in Wales, along with mask wearing, table service and contact tracing. Groups have also been limited to a maximum of six people, to slow the spread of the Omicron variant. One bar owner said it's been a ""nightmare"" trying to enforce the new rules as many people just aren't aware. New Covid restrictions come into force in Wales Tighter restrictions see pub group limits in Wales PM gets Covid briefing as UK nations tighten rules ""A lot people have just given up watching TV at this rate, and they just don't realise [the new rules] have come in,"" said Joann Cooney, owner of The Irish bar in Llandudno, Conwy. ""It's just been a bit of a nightmare that way, and just controlling people it was just really hard, and it definitely wasn't a busy as it usually would be."" Joann Cooney says many customers don't realise masks are now mandatory in pubs, so she had to turn them away ""Boxing Day is always a great day, everyone walking around having a bit of banter at the bar, and we couldn't have that, it was just really difficult. ""We were definitely at least over 50% down, because it's usually normally busy with live music and everything, it's normally a great atmosphere."" Ms Cooney thinks in addition to the new restrictions, people are staying home because they are ""frightened"" of the new variant. Mr Beynon says he conforms to every rule - yet there are always new ones to adhere to ""What you've got to realise is that to put table service on, that's extra work, but you're not getting extra money for it,"" said Dai Beynon, owner of Pontarddulais Workingmens Club. He thinks clubs like his need to have more staff on shift to collect track and trace information, as well as providing table service. Mr Beynon added: ""In hospitality everyone's doing their best to keep order, two metres apart, etc, and yet we're persecuted time after time."" When he announced the new restrictions last week, First Minister Mark Drakeford warned of ""a wave of infections caused by the new, fast-moving and very-infectious Omicron"". On Christmas Eve, the last day data was published,6,755 new Covid cases were reportedby Public Health Wales, the highest figure since the start of the pandemic. Phil Ash represents west Conwy Pubwatch, which has around 120 pubs as members Phil Ash, a bar owner who also represents west Conwy Pubwatch, has said the amount of restrictions in place in Wales is ""unfair"". ""I do get it, to a point, its just we've had the hardest restrictions out of the four nations, once again,"" he said. ""Us in wales have had to have more restrictions put on us than the other three nations, which is a bit unfair."" Mr Ash also thinks its getting increasingly hard to implement the restrictions with customers. ""Yesterday people were turning up and they didn't know that there were new rules in place, which made it ten times harder for us to police. He said more people now claim they are exempt from wearing face coverings, and enforcing rules is tricky ""especially when people have had alcohol, then they're not as willing to abide by them"". The Welsh government said a total of Â£120m will be made available for nightclubs, retail, hospitality, leisure and tourism businesses. However, Mr Ash said the money may be too late, as businesses need the support now. ""It will help when we get it, [but] we won't get the money until the end of January, which doesn't help with the loss of trade in December,"" he said.

"The number of people taking advantage of post-Christmas sales on Monday fell by 32% compared with 2019, new data shows, amid persistent Covid concerns. Retail analyst Springboard said footfall figures were better than Boxing Day. But popular shopping destinations such as central London saw a drop caused in part bydisruption to rail services. Shoppers chose to visit retail parks on Monday, but footfall there was still down 7.2% from pre-pandemic levels. That contrasted with a sharp drop in footfall on High Streets, down 40.1% on 2019, and in shopping centres, which recorded a 38.8% decline. ""The greater attraction of retail parks is in part likely to be a result of shoppers restocking groceries following the weekend's festivities,"" said Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard. It is a reversal of the trend seen on Boxing Day when more people shopped on High Streets than in retail parks. However, overall Boxing Day footfall figures were far lower than pre-Covid levels. No new England Covid rules to be announced on Monday How Covid disrupted our Christmas toy deliveries Shoppers avoid city centres on Christmas Eve Across the UK, Springboard said High Streets saw footfall drop on Boxing Day by 37.7% compared with 2019. Retail parks recorded a 40.2% decline in footfall while there was a sharper 48.4% drop in shopping centres. Springboard said footfall declined on Boxing Day due to fears over Covid, as well as the fact the traditional start of post-Christmas sales fell on a Sunday this year and some big name stores opted to stay closed. Companies including Next, John Lewis and M&S decided to shut on Boxing Day to give staff a longer Christmas break, though they launched their sales online. On Monday, footfall across all UK regions declined with the sharpest drop in Wales, where it fell by 40.3%. Wales introduced tighter Covid restrictions on 26 December, including limiting the number of people who can meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants to groups of no more than six people. Scotland and Northern Ireland also brought in similar rulesfrom Monday. In Scotland, footfall in shops dropped by 33.3% while in Northern Ireland it fell by 36.6%. Overall, shopping numbers in England fell by 31.1%, according to Springboard. In London, footfall plunged by 50% compared with the same day in 2019, a much sharper drop than in other areas of the UK. Ms Wehrle said: ""Footfall is weaker in central London than in large city centres elsewhere in the UK, which in part is likely to be a result of cancellations of trains restricting shoppers' ability to get into the capital."" But Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of the West End Company, which represents shops, hotels and restaurants in central London, told the BBC: ""We are still dealing with Covid and we haven't got international tourists here so it is going to be muted for some time [for] customers coming into the West End.""

"The government is showing ""nowhere near enough urgency"" in finding a solution to steep increases in gas and electricity prices, one energy boss has told the BBC. Ovo's boss Stephen Fitzpatrick predicts the rise in wholesale gas prices and its impact on people will be ""an enormous crisis for 2022"". The business secretary met with Ofgem and energy firms on Monday. The government says it wants to make sure households are protected. A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the meeting was ""to discuss the ongoing effects of record high global gas prices on the sector"". ""Throughout the meeting there was discussion of the issues facing the sector and an agreement for meetings to continue over the coming days and weeks to ensure UK consumers are protected,"" she said. It is understood that representatives from the Treasury and Number 10 were also present. Mr Fitzpatrick, who attended the virtual meeting, said his priority was for the government and the regulator to understand how critical the situation is. He said the main worry was how consumers would be supported through price increases. ""We've seen this energy crisis unfold now for the last three months and we've watched as energy prices have spiked, fallen back, and spiked again,"" he said. ""We've had more than 30 bankruptcies in the sector, we've had millions of customers forced to change supplier. ""The cost to the consumer has already been more than Â£4bn. We haven't seen any action from the government or from the regulator. There's an acceptance that there's a problem, but nowhere near enough urgency to find a solution,"" he added. He pointed to the example of someEuropean governments that have helped consumers in their countries. Why are gas prices so high? 'Penny-pinching and duvets to keep warm' In recent months, wholesale gas prices have risen to unprecedented levels. Last week, they hit a new record of 450p per therm, which experts think could take average annual gas bills to about Â£2,000 next year. On Thursday, Energy UK, the industry's trade body, warnedbills could soar by another 50%unless the government intervened. The meeting between Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng and the energy industry has taken place at a time when the sector is facing an unprecedented situation. The prices paid by suppliers for the gas and electricity they sell on to consumers have risen dramatically in recent weeks. Because household bills are capped by the regulator Ofgem, they have been unable to pass the extra costs to their customers immediately, and dozens have gone out of business. Nor are consumers themselves immune. The price cap is due to be raised in the spring, and very steep increases are expected. Against this background, energy firms have been demanding radical action, such as cuts in taxes and environmental levies to bring down bills for vulnerable consumers, as well as changes to the way in which the price cap itself operates. Against this background, today's meeting is likely to be one of many over the coming days and weeks. Mr Fitzpatrick said: ""It is already households' largest single bill to pay and it is going to double that. And I think expecting consumers to shoulder that kind of volatility without any kind of support from government is just unrealistic."" More than 20 energy companies have collapsed since wholesale prices started to spike, unable to pay high prices or pass the increased cost on to consumers. Nearly four million customers have been affected. Consumers are protected from big rises in wholesale costs by a price cap set by the regulator Ofgem. However, the cap is due to change in April. Mr Fitzpatrick said it was important ""we don't waste any more time"" addressing the rising cost of household energy. ""It is a really good sign of just how urgent everything is that we're meeting between Christmas and New Year to work this out,"" he said. ""But we really have to take the opportunity today."" Labour has urged the government to use the money raised throughhigher than expected VAT receipts,external, driven by the higher cost of food and energy prices, to cut household energy bills. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Labour wanted the government to immediately announce the removal of VAT from household heating bills over winter. ""We need a sustainable and ambitious approach to energy,"" she said. Mr Fitzpatrick also suggested the government could consider ""taking away some of the environmental social policy costs that we have seen increase over the years and it may mean that we need some kind of price smoothing mechanism from the government"". ""These are all things that we are going to be discussing today,"" he said. The government said: ""We regularly engage with the energy industry and will continue to ensure that consumers are protected through the Energy Price Cap, which is insulating millions from record global gas prices.""

"This video can not be played Sarah Henton and her daughter have joined the scheme offering free hygiene products A school which donates free tampons and towels to girls who can't afford them said the pandemic is making everyday essentials a luxury. Milford Haven School in Pembrokeshire has said there's also been increases in free school meal claims and food bank referrals. The project also says there is a further need for basic toiletries. The Welsh government says since 2018 it has invested Â£9m to help give free period products to those in need. One of those benefitting from the period poverty scheme at the school is mum Sarah Henton. She first received a bag of sanitary towels and tampons when coronavirus hit. Ms Henton said as a parent managing a budget for two young boys and a daughter on a low income during a pandemic is difficult. Rising bills and inflation also added to the financial pressure. ""With the cost of everything rising, it is nice to know that is one less thing that we have to worry about. ""Making sure that we've got enough food, heating, electricity,"" she added. ""And then hygiene products, especially for women is something that we do have to think about."" She and her daughter, Elaina, 12, joined the scheme through Milford Community Action, set up by Milford Haven School and youth project Milford Youth Matters. Although Elaina is not a pupil at Milford Haven School she could still benefit. The monthly bags contain reusable and sustainable period products and toiletries. They also include treats such as chocolates, face masks and hand sanitisers. Sarah said the parcels gave her ""a bit more dignity"" and ""made you feel that more human, like somebody cared about you"". ""There is a stigma behind asking for things like that."" Owen (l) and Harry say hygiene parcels could break down the stigma for boys needing help Elaina added that it also took away her peers' sense of awkwardness and shame about periods. ""It's nice to have sweet things and an easy way to get the products,"" she added. ""If you can get them whenever you want you don't really have to ask and then you don't have to feel embarrassed."" Research by Loughborough University for the UK End Child Poverty Coalition of charities has suggested at least one in five children in Wales was living below the poverty line before the pandemic - the worst of the UK nations. One of the areas where the rate of child poverty is increasing the fastest is Pembrokeshire. Mari (l) and Grace have been helping to put the period parcels together At Milford Haven School 28% of pupils receive free school meals. Gemma Baker is period poverty project lead at the school. She wants to create ""period dignity"" by giving young women a choice of menstrual products. This includes free eco-friendly products like period pants and reusable pads for all pupils, regardless of financial status, thereby removing any stigma. Mari and Grace, both 15, helped to create the packs. ""As time has gone on we've made it better and added other things,"" Grace said. ""It's stuff that's going to last you a lot longer,"" Mari added. Schools to get free sanitary products Â£3.3m to end 'period poverty' in Wales Plastic-free sanitary products plan welcomed Teacher Rachel Mansell said by offering free towels and tampons, girls had ""made huge leaps and bounds"" with their academic outcomes. She said it ""eradicated"" obstacles ""that could potentially stop them coming to school, could cause that embarrassment, could cause that sense of I don't quite fit in"". Ms Baker added that since the pandemic more families are in need - not just for period products but for basic toiletries. ""There wasn't always money left for actually what we would classify as essential items, but became luxuries."" As Welsh government only funds period products the school has been exploring other ways to raise money and serve this need. Gemma Baker says a trial showed there a wider need for hygiene products which the pandemic has shone a light on Donations from the town's Tesco and the Women's Institute (WI) meant they could run a trial offering 30 toiletry packs for men. When the parcels containing shower gel, deodorant and toothbrushes were rolled out they were gone within a day. Pupils Owen and Harry said these parcels helped break down the stigma for boys needing help. ""Males don't tend to speak up about it as much as females do,"" Charlie said. Owen added: ""If people talked about it more the issue could be made more aware of."" Ms Henton said the Welsh government should extend funding to cover toiletries for anyone in need. ""Personal hygiene is something everybody has a right to, whether they have money or not,"" Ms Henton added. The Welsh government said: ""We have allocated an additional Â£500,000 as part of the Â£51m Household Support Fund to help meet increased demand over the winter period. ""Since 2018, we have invested almost Â£9m to ensure children and young people and women on low incomes have access to free period products.""

"Experts say the current UK energy crisis has seen the demand for solar panels rise With energy bills soaring and the climate in crisis, you might ask why don't all new homes have solar panels to generate clean electricity for free? Gas and electricity bills have risen by about Â£400 a year on average and Ofgem, the UK's energy regulator, has warned costs willspike further next year. Ministers in Wales plan to force house builders to cut the carbon footprint of new homes by more than a third in 2022. But developers want more government help to meet new building standards. Families are bracing themselves to pay more for their energy as industry experts predict those that were paying Â£850 on average last year will see their bills rise to more than Â£1700. The energy price cap, which limits how much providers can charge for energy per unit, will rise in the spring because of the ""unprecedented""rise in gas pricesthat has seensome energy companies go bust. Energy price cap: Why are fuel bills rising? How will we heat our homes in future? What you can do to reduce emissions ""In December 2020 the average energy bill was Â£850,"" said Stephen Murray, from price comparison website Moneysupermarket. ""By April next year, if you're on a standard tariff, it will be around Â£1750 - that's over double where it was."" There are up to 25 million UK homes with gas boilers butthey are being phased out- withnone being sold after 2035- as gas heating accounts for 21% of the UK's carbon emissions. Moneysupermarket has warned families could face ""expected increases of Â£450 to Â£500 at a one-off stroke"" because of the crisis, caused by more demand and less supply. There are plans to helpsubsidise low-carbon heat pumpsin place of gas boilers in some homes in Wales and England from April 2022 but with the country in the midst of an energy crisis, shouldsolar panelsbe a new standard on all new homes? For a medium-sized house, one established installer estimates a good 4kW solar panel system from a well-respected brand would cost about Â£6,000 to Â£7,000 to install. New housing developments in Wales will have to be better for the environment Gareth Jones says his company, Carbon Zero Renewables, experienced a 1000% surge in orders for solar roof panels since the start of the energy crisis, with weekly enquiries surging from ""one or two to 25 to 30"". ""The reasons people are considering solar panels has changed from wanting to make money, to doing it to help the climate crisis,"" said Mr Jones, who is based in St Asaph, Denbighshire. ""You're not going to make much putting electricity back into the grid, but the environmental aspect is now a big driver - coupled with not getting impacted by soaring energy costs. ""And with gas being phased out, turning your home into its own electric creation station is proving attractive to some people. Plus if you have an electric car to charge too, customers like the fact all the energy they use is clean. ""Good systems aren't cheap but with energy costs rising, people think they can make their money back quicker than before - and good panels have a long lifespan."" But while having a panel on your roof might work for many households, Mr Jones is quick to stress that while families should consider seeing if the sun would be a viable and cost-effective option to power and heat your home, it won't work for everyone. ""If your house is very shaded or possibly doesn't get the sun as much as most, then perhaps it might not work for you,"" he said. Gas boilers to heat our homes are gradually being phased for cleaner options ""People need to consider amending their lifestyles too, so using electricity when the solar panels are creating energy when it's sunny. So instead of putting the dishwasher or washing machine on when it's dark, you do it in the day. ""The other things that need to be checked is if your roof is strong enough to support the panels and whether the location is appropriate - that's why it's advised to get a good and respected installer."" So with an energy crisis and anestimated average of 7,400 new homes,externalneeded in Wales every year to keep up with housing demand, are governments considering dictating to builders new clean energy standards? The Welsh government, for example, hasdeclared a climate emergencyand set steep targets tobecome net zero by 2050, so Wales' climate change minister is planning to tell developers that any new homes built from 2022 must cut emissions by 37%, compared to current standards. But Julie James plans to leave it to the individual house builder on individual developments to decide how their homes will reduce their footprint - like solar panels orheat pumps- as Ms James accepts not all renewable energy sources work everywhere. ""We don't mandate a particular technology, we're mandating a particular outcome,"" she told the BBC. One-sixth of Wales' carbon emissions come from heating and powering homes, yet new homes are still being built without clean energy consideration. Ministers in Cardiff see renewable power as a way of helping people pay their bills and reducing fuel poverty - as well as moving towardsnet zeroby 2050. ""This is a win-win situation for everyone really,"" said Ms James, the only minister in the UK whose brief is just climate change. How can you make your home eco-friendly? What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? ""This isn't just because I tend to like this kind of house, this is a climate emergency we are seeing... we see the extreme weather conditions people will have to cope with inside their houses. ""We want the house to be able to withstand those increased weather pressures."" The Welsh government is working with the construction industry to cut the carbon footprint on homes by at least 37% from next year - and to make sure as many of the supplies come from Wales to reduce any supply chain carbon footprint. How will that extra cost affect you? The organisation that represents small developers agrees climate change is the biggest threat, and that renewable energy built into new homes is the future. This video can not be played What does it take to live on renewable energy? But the Federation of Master Builders (FMB) has warned the cost could be picked up by customers, which could affect first-time buyers the most. ""There are 70,000 households in Wales on housing waiting lists and we need more homes built,"" said Ifan Glyn, FMB Wales director. ""To enable that, small builders need extra support from Welsh government to help them meet any new housing standards."" Some housing associations have already started fitting solar panels to new and existing homes after securing grants from the Welsh government - and they could provide a template for how to install panels to new homes cost-effectively that could be upscaled for major housing developments. More than 7,000 new homes are needed to be built a year in Wales to keep up with demand ""Now when architects look at a brand new site, we think 'how easy is it to walk to?'"" said Elfed Roberts, of Pobl Housing's latest development at Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taf. ""Then we analyse where the sun is, where the great views are and where does the wind come from, that is a new way of working in new-home construction."" How will Wales go green by 2050? The former coal villages turning green Action on green energy needed now, says trade body How will we heat our homes in future?

"Large events such as concerts have strict limits on numbers from Sunday New rules aimed at slowing transmission of the Omicron variant have come into force in Scotland, meaning all large public events have been cancelled. The limits on the size of events were announced last week but came into force at 05:00 on Sunday. However, many concerts, theatre shows and pantomimes were already cancelled ahead of the restrictions. Boxing Day football matches in the Scotland's top flight will be played in front of a maximum of 500 seated fans. At the Celtic V St Johnstone match at McDiarmid Park, police said they dispersed a ""small"" group of fans who had gathered outside the Perth stadium. Hogmanay events cancelled as Covid rules tightened Nightclubs in Scotland to close for three weeks Premiership winter break brought forward After Sunday's fixtures, the SPFL (Scottish Professional Football League) will then bring forward its winter break and fixtures will not resume until 17 January. It said it was ""very hopeful"" capacity crowds could return to matches after the three-week cap on attendances over the festive period. Attendance at all live public events for the next three weeks is limited to: 100 people for indoor standing events 200 people for indoor seated events 500 people for all outdoor events (seated or standing) This effectively cancelled large Hogmanay parties including Edinburgh's Hogmanay. The restrictions do not apply to private life events such as weddings. Further restrictions prevent adult non-professional contact sports - such as five-a-side football - in indoor spaces. Hospitality measures will come into effect on Monday Other measures announced by the first minister on Tuesday,externalwill take effect from 05:00 on Monday 27 December. They include a return to 1m physical distancing in all hospitality and indoor leisure settings, which includes pubs, restaurants, gyms, theatres and museums. Table service must also be used in places where alcohol is served to drink on the premises. Nightclubs also have to close for a period of at least three weeks, though they can stay open if they operate as a pub with table service and distancing. All of the measures will be reviewed after three weeks on Tuesday 11 January. The new restrictions follow rising Covid case numbers fuelled by the new Omicron variant. Themost recent figures, released on Christmas Eve, showed 7,076 new cases of Covid-19, the highest daily total since August. The figures also showed 10 deaths and a 14.7% positivity rate. The Scottish government's health secretary, Humza Yousaf, said the new measures were proportionate, but acknowledged that they would have an impact on businesses. He said the Scottish government had put in place a Â£375m support package for business. ""I can completely understand why people are scunnered and sick and tired of the protective measures and restrictions we bring in. ""But science is helping us,"" he added, asking everyone toget booked in for their booster appointment as soon as possible,external. He said there were ""plenty"" of appointments available for 27 December onwards. ""Get yourself boosted by the bells,"" he said, noting that without vaccines the situation would be far worse - and much tougher curbs would be needed. The Scottish government urged people should stay home as much as possible to limit the number of contacts they have and to gather in groups of no more than three households. Wales and Northern Ireland have also implemented further restrictionson the hospitality and leisure industry, resumed social distancing rules and put limits on the size of gatherings. No further restrictions have been implemented in England. Bars will go to table service-only from 05:00 on Monday Hospitality businesses were preparing for the change in operating procedures on Monday. In Glasgow, staff at Hootenanny on Howard Street were getting ready to return to measures last used in the summer. Manager Andy Fairgrieve told the BBC: ""We're going back to full table service like we were in the summer. So basically no one is allowed to come to the bar counter. No one is allowed to walk about with food or drinks."" He said that procedures for table service and physical distancing were already in place. ""All the staff know what they are doing, so it is quite easy going back. But the thing about the summer was people didn't mid sitting outside and using the space there. I am not sure how keen people will be in the middle of January to sit outside and have a beer and some food."" He said a quiet January on top of a December of cancelled parties and people not going out would take its toll financially. ""I just hope people will still come out,"" he added. This variant is very contagious - it spreads faster than others and can infect people even if they are fully vaccinated Vaccines and boosters are still essential - they do a great job at protecting against severe disease that could put you in hospital It is milder - if you catch it, the risk of needing hospital treatment is up to 70% lower than with previous variants - but that is largely because many of us have built up immunity from vaccines and past infections rather than changes to the virus Even if Omicron is milder, because it is more contagious a large number of people will catch it and some will still become very ill, which puts pressure on the NHS Read more RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"Temporary measures have begun for hospitality and leisure businesses in Scotland in an effort to halt the spread of the Omicron variant. From 05:00 on Monday, 1m physical distancing has been reinstated in all hospitality and indoor leisure settings. This includes pubs, restaurants, gyms, theatres and museums. Table service must also be used in places where alcohol is served to drink on the premises. Nightclubs also have to close for a period of at least three weeks, though they can stay open if they operate as a pub with table service and distancing.

The measureswere announced by the first minister last Tuesday. The new restrictions follow rising Covid case numbers fuelled by the new Omicron variant. The measures will tackle the spread of the virus while the vaccination booster programme is accelerated. The latest data - published on Christmas Eve - saw Scotland record 7,076 new confirmed cases of Covid, thehighest daily total since August. The first phase of the latest restrictions aimed at events and sport, including football, came into effect at 05:00 on Sunday. Attendance at events for the next three weeks is limited to 100 people for indoor standing events, 200 people for indoor seated events and 500 people for all outdoor events (seated or standing). This effectively cancelled large Hogmanay parties including Edinburgh's Hogmanay. Andthe SPFL chose to bring forward its winter breakrather than impose spectator restrictions. The SPFL said it was ""very hopeful"" capacity crowds could return to matches after the three-week cap on attendances over the festive period. People are being encouraged to book booster jabs as soon as possible Latest restrictions are backed by Â£375m in business support, the Scottish government said, following discussions with business organisations and local authorities.  Hospitality businesses are already eligible for top-up funding through the December and January Business Top Up. Further guidance has also been published,externalto help businesses take measures to limit the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. Economy Secretary Kate Forbes said the restrictions were targeted at reducing the spread of Omicron while the booster programme takes effect. She said: ""I understand how difficult this has been for businesses in recent weeks but we must reduce our contacts and limit the spread of the virus. ""We're providing Â£375m in business support, which is a significant investment, to support those who have experienced cancellations and help them get back on their feet in the new year. ""The best way to support business sustainably, is to get the virus back under control. Please get your boosters and stay at home as much as possible just now."" Clinicians from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde joined the calls toget ""boosted for the bells"",external. The health board has added thousands of extra vaccine clinics in the lead-up to the New Year and additional vaccinators have been recruited to help provide as many options as possible for the public. John Carson, the chief nurse at Glasgow Royal Infirmary said: ""Our hospitals are presently facing an extremely difficult a position and we can't afford for it to get worse. ""Please get the vaccine - it only takes a short time out of your day and the side effects for the vast majority are very mild.

"No further Covid restrictions will be announced in England on Monday, the BBC understands. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is being briefed on the latest Covid data this afternoon, after two days without published figures. Ministers are expected to continue regular meetings with scientists, and keep the data under review. Meanwhile, Scotland and Northern Ireland have tightened rules for a second day. In both nations hospitality venues have returned to table service only and social distancing has been reintroduced in several settings. Nightclubs have also been closed in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. BBC political correspondent Ione Wells said the lack of new legal restrictions for England on Monday did not rule out more guidance, or stronger language urging people to be careful. Record 103 new Premier League Covid cases How to look after yourself if you get Covid Omicron: Good news, bad news and what it all means Empty bars in Wales as new rules cause confusion Only partial Covid data has been published for the Christmas period. But figures show that the number of cases has remained high, with 113,628 infections reported in England on Christmas Day. Some 103,558 cases were recorded in England on 26 December and 98,515 on 27 December. Meanwhile, the Scottish government said provisional data suggested Christmas weekendhad seen the highest daily cases recorded in Scotland since the start of the pandemic. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the expected wave of cases fuelled by the Omicron variant was ""materialising"". Downing Street previously said it would not hesitate to act after Christmas if necessary. England's current guidance - known as Plan B - requires people in England to work from home, wear face coverings in shops and other public settings and present Covid passes to gain entry to large events. The data emerging in England points to a very difficult month ahead for the NHS, but not a completely overwhelming one. Last week, estimates were published suggesting Omicron was causing milder illness. But it was unclear what that would translate to in the real world - if infections rose high enough, there was still a threat the NHS would not be able to cope. The latest data in London, which was the first to see an Omicron wave, gives us an indication of what to expect. The first half of December saw the number of cases detected double week-on-week. But the growth in hospital admissions - even when you take into account the lag between initial infection and becoming seriously ill - has been much lower at around two-thirds. And those who are admitted appear to be spending less time in hospital. What's more, the increase in infections appears to have started levelling off before Christmas. If this is right and the trends hold and the same pattern is repeated elsewhere, it would suggest hospital numbers will peak at under half of what was seen last winter. That, though, is a lot of ifs. But it looks like it has been enough to convince ministers more restrictions cannot be justified at this point. The briefing by scientific advisers on Monday is one of a regular series of updates given to the prime minister, and he has not yet called a cabinet meeting or announced a recall of Parliament. MPs have been promised a vote if it is decided fresh legal measures are needed, after Mr Johnson suffered the largest rebellion since he became PM over the introduction of Covid passes earlier this month. Some business owners have called for clarity as they plan ahead for New Year's Eve. Paul Kemp, owner of Beerd bar in Bristol, told the BBC: ""People need to know now, they've got staff that they need to put in place, they've got security that they need to book, they've got stock that they need to order. He needs to tell people now, right now so they know what they are doing."" Early findings last week suggested people infected with the fast-spreading Omicron variant were less likely to be admitted to hospital - although a range of factors is likely to be examined when looking at the case for restrictions. This variant is very contagious - it spreads faster than others and can infect people even if they are fully vaccinated Vaccines and boosters are still essential - they do a great job at protecting against severe disease that could put you in hospital It is milder - if you catch it, the risk of needing hospital treatment is up to 70% lower than with previous variants - but that is largely because many of us have built up immunity from vaccines and past infections rather than changes to the virus Even if Omicron is milder, because it is more contagious a large number of people will catch it and some will still become very ill, which puts pressure on the NHS. Read more here. The UK has massively ramped up its booster programme in response to Omicron, which was first identified in South Africa just one month ago. A record 968,665 booster jabs and third doses were reported in one day last week, and the NHS said a further 1.5 million vaccination slots were available to book in England in the coming days. In a tweet, the prime minister said: ""We know two jabs don't give you enough protection against Omicron so whether it's your first, second or booster jab I urge you to book an appointment now."" Meanwhile, there were no walk-in PCR tests available to book in England for a few hours on Monday due to ""high demand"". Appointments were temporarily unavailable in every region of England, but the UK Health Security Agency said the issue was now resolved.

"There have been more Covid-related flight cancellations globally as the week starts, capping off a miserable festive period for thousands of people. More than 2,200 flights have been scrapped on Monday, with Chinese and US destinations being the worst hit,the FlightAware data tracking website says,external. US airlines say the disruption is due to crews testing positive or isolating. Hong Kong is banning all South Korea's Korean Air flights for two weeks, after positive cases among some arrivals. In all, more than 8,000 flights have been grounded over the long Christmas weekend that began on Friday. Although the number of cancellations is a small percentage of the total, it is higher than normal and comes at a time of year when many are travelling to spend time with family and friends. In a separate development, US authorities are monitoring dozens of cruise ships hit by Covid cases while sailing in the country's waters, with several of them reportedly denied port in the Caribbean, AFP news agency reports. Recorded Covid cases are rising sharply around the world, largely driven by the Omicron variant. Despite early findings that Omicron is milder than other coronavirus variants, scientists are concerned by the sheer number of infections being recorded. How can I tell I have Omicron? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Omicron wave appears milder, but concern remains The majority of the flights cancelled on Monday are those by Chinese companies, according to FlightAware. They include China Eastern, which cancelled more than 420 flights, and Air China, with more than 190 cancellations. Airports in Beijing and Shanghai appear to be the worst affected, with nearly 300 cancellations combined. The Chinese authorities have not commented on the issue. The airport in the northern Chinese city of Xi'an is also on the list.More than 13 million people in the city have been recently ordered to stay at homeas authorities attempt to tackle a Covid outbreak there. Meanwhile, the hardest-hit US companies are United and JetBlue. And Seattle-Tacoma is one of the worst-affected airports. United warned last week that a spike in Omicron cases had ""had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation"", with many employees required to self-isolate after coming into contact with those infected. Omicron now is the dominant variant in the US. But severe weather is also a factor. A blanket of snow delayed flights and disrupted roads in the western state of Washington on Sunday, adding to the travel chaos. In the UK, British Airways reported more than 40 cancellations on Monday, according to FlightAware. Nearly 5.4 million people have died with coronavirus worldwide, according to America's Johns Hopkins University. There have been almost 280 million confirmed cases.

"This video can not be played Ella Daish has been campaigning since seeing plastic waste on her post round An environmental campaigner says she is ""overjoyed"" after convincing a council to buy only plastic-free menstrual products. In April the Welsh Governmentannounced a Â£2.3m grantto provide all Welsh schools with free sanitary products. Councils had been asked to spend 10% of the money on reusables but Caerphilly council said every penny would go on plastic-free disposable products. Campaigner Ella Daish said more councils should take action. All Welsh schools to get free sanitary products Period poverty: Socks 'being used as sanitary towels' Kenyan schoolgirl takes her own life after 'period shaming' The 26-year-old former postal worker from Cardiff started a petition calling on companies to remove plastic from period products last year after seeing discarded plastic on the streets when on her round. The 26-year-old former postal worker has been campaigning since seeing plastic waste on her round She has been lobbying supermarkets to stock eco-friendly products, with one recently announcing it would stop the production and sale of its own-brand plastic tampon applicators. When the Welsh Government announced the Period Dignity Grant she was concerned it would be spent on conventional products, which can beup to 90% plastic,external, so began lobbying councils. Tampons often come wrapped in plastic and encased in plastic applicators She said: ""I'm overjoyed that one of the councils I've been contacting has decided to take this step to actually go completely eco-friendly with their spending. ""We need more councils and governments to be taking this action, to consider the environment and start making green choices. ""We can tackle period poverty, the plastic crisis and protect the environment simultaneously."" Phillippa Marsden, cabinet member for education at Caerphilly council said:  ""We had an email from Ella, which was perfect timing because it aligned with our way of thinking in the group and actually we were all absolutely unanimous from the start, that's what we would do.

"The prime minister is due to be briefed on the latest Covid data as he weighs whether to impose additional measures in England before the new year. After two days without published figures, Boris Johnson will hear the impact on the NHS of record infections. But the BBC understands no further Covid restrictions in England are set to be announced on Monday. Scotland and Northern Ireland have tightened up for a second day, with new restrictions for pubs and restaurants. In both nations hospitality venues have returned to table service only - while social distancing has been reintroduced in several places including gyms, cinemas and theatres in Scotland, and offices in Northern Ireland. Nightclubs have also been closed in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. Downing Street said no decisions have been taken yet on whether extra measures would be introduced in England, but it previously said it would not hesitate to act after Christmas if necessary.

In addition, cabinet office minister Stephen Barclay will also chair one of the regular Covid meetings on staff shortages and workplace resilience. Dr Ian Higginson, the vice president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, has told BBC Radio 4 some hospitals were experiencing ""significant staffing issues right now"" - with one department losing 50% of its nurses on Sunday night for Covid-related reasons. MPs have been promised a vote if it is decided fresh legal measures are needed, after Mr Johnson suffered the largest rebellion since he became PM over the introduction of Covid passes earlier this month. But Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, treasurer of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tories, has urged the PM to be ""very cautious"" before applying further restrictions. The Cotswolds MP said the latest figures published before Christmas showed the number of cases in hospital was ""relatively stable"". Speaking to Times Radio, he added: ""I just don't think the evidence, unless the data coming out today looks very different, is there for any further measures."" Asked whether he was concerned England was ""out of step"" with the rest of the UK in terms of Omicron restrictions, Sir Geoffrey replied: ""I think it is the other way round. I think the [other nations] are out of step with England. I think they have been overly cautious."" Dr Simon Clarke, from the University of Reading, told the BBC he thinks the government ""is going to sit tight"" and ""wait for a signal that Omicron, if indeed it is, is more severe in older people"". Meanwhile, NHS England national medical director Professor Stephen Powis has called on people to get boosted in time for the New Year. The NHS has said there are 1,551,187 vaccination slots still available to be booked between Monday and January. Ministers welcomed early findings last week that people infected with the fast-spreading Omicron variant were less likely to be admitted to hospital - although the BBC understands a range of factors will be examined when looking at the case for restrictions. Infections surged by 48.2% in the seven days before Christmas, hitting a record 122,186 confirmed cases on Friday, the last day figures were published. But the number of people admitted to hospital and deaths following a positive test have risen much more slowly so far.

"No further Covid restrictions will be announced in England on Monday, the BBC understands. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is being briefed on the latest Covid data this afternoon, after two days without published figures. Ministers are expected to continue regular meetings with scientists, and keep the data under review. Meanwhile, Scotland and Northern Ireland have tightened rules for a second day. In both nations hospitality venues have returned to table service only and social distancing has been reintroduced in several settings. Nightclubs have also been closed in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. BBC political correspondent Ione Wells said the lack of new legal restrictions for England on Monday did not rule out more guidance, or stronger language urging people to be careful. Record 103 new Premier League Covid cases How to look after yourself if you get Covid Omicron: Good news, bad news and what it all means Empty bars in Wales as new rules cause confusion Only partial Covid data has been published for the Christmas period. But figures show that the number of cases has remained high, with 113,628 infections reported in England on Christmas Day. Some 103,558 cases were recorded in England on 26 December and 98,515 on 27 December. Meanwhile, the Scottish government said provisional data suggested Christmas weekendhad seen the highest daily cases recorded in Scotland since the start of the pandemic. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the expected wave of cases fuelled by the Omicron variant was ""materialising"". Downing Street previously said it would not hesitate to act after Christmas if necessary. England's current guidance - known as Plan B - requires people in England to work from home, wear face coverings in shops and other public settings and present Covid passes to gain entry to large events. The data emerging in England points to a very difficult month ahead for the NHS, but not a completely overwhelming one. Last week, estimates were published suggesting Omicron was causing milder illness. But it was unclear what that would translate to in the real world - if infections rose high enough, there was still a threat the NHS would not be able to cope. The latest data in London, which was the first to see an Omicron wave, gives us an indication of what to expect. The first half of December saw the number of cases detected double week-on-week. But the growth in hospital admissions - even when you take into account the lag between initial infection and becoming seriously ill - has been much lower at around two-thirds. And those who are admitted appear to be spending less time in hospital. What's more, the increase in infections appears to have started levelling off before Christmas. If this is right and the trends hold and the same pattern is repeated elsewhere, it would suggest hospital numbers will peak at under half of what was seen last winter. That, though, is a lot of ifs. But it looks like it has been enough to convince ministers more restrictions cannot be justified at this point. The briefing by scientific advisers on Monday is one of a regular series of updates given to the prime minister, and he has not yet called a cabinet meeting or announced a recall of Parliament. MPs have been promised a vote if it is decided fresh legal measures are needed, after Mr Johnson suffered the largest rebellion since he became PM over the introduction of Covid passes earlier this month. Some business owners have called for clarity as they plan ahead for New Year's Eve. Paul Kemp, owner of Beerd bar in Bristol, told the BBC: ""People need to know now, they've got staff that they need to put in place, they've got security that they need to book, they've got stock that they need to order. He needs to tell people now, right now so they know what they are doing."" Early findings last week suggested people infected with the fast-spreading Omicron variant were less likely to be admitted to hospital - although a range of factors is likely to be examined when looking at the case for restrictions. This variant is very contagious - it spreads faster than others and can infect people even if they are fully vaccinated Vaccines and boosters are still essential - they do a great job at protecting against severe disease that could put you in hospital It is milder - if you catch it, the risk of needing hospital treatment is up to 70% lower than with previous variants - but that is largely because many of us have built up immunity from vaccines and past infections rather than changes to the virus Even if Omicron is milder, because it is more contagious a large number of people will catch it and some will still become very ill, which puts pressure on the NHS.

A record 968,665 booster jabs and third doses were reported in one day last week, and the NHS said a further 1.5 million vaccination slots were available to book in England in the coming days. In a tweet, the prime minister said: ""We know two jabs don't give you enough protection against Omicron so whether it's your first, second or booster jab I urge you to book an appointment now.""

"It is table service only for hospitality venues under the latest Covid-19 measures Hospitality venues across Northern Ireland will return to table service only from Monday as the latest Covid measures come into force. A maximum of six people will be allowed to sit together at a table and dancing is prohibited, unless at a wedding. The rules state only three households should mix and employers must work to ensure 2m social distancing in offices. The executive announcedtougher Covid-19 restrictions in a bid to curb the spread of the Omicron variant. It is understood that Omicron is now the dominant strain of Covid in Northern Ireland andmakes up almost 60% of cases. From Monday, people are being urged to limit meetings inside private homes to no more than three households, but this is guidance and people who return home over the festive period will be part of their original households. Sporting events can continue with no limit on capacityhowever those travelling to and from games are asked not to car share. The work from home message is being bolstered and legislation requires 2m social distancing in the workplace or alternative mitigations. The rules on face coverings have been strengthened too, with some exemptions removed and a statutory duty placed on businesses to promote compliance. The Stormont executive agreed a grant scheme to support hospitality businesses affected by the latest Covid-19 restrictions. Finance Minister Conor Murphy said his departmentwould offer Â£40m of funding for more than 3,000 businesses. The rules surrounding wearing face coverings have been strengthened Figures suggest thatBoxing Day shopping footfall saw the largest decline since 2011. Eugene Reid from the Ballymena Chamber of Commerce told BBC's Good Morning Ulster he thought Covid had affected footfall as there was a ""bit of trepidation and nervousness"" amongst shoppers. ""The traders themselves know there's nervousness amongst people who may not be going into town as much in the past,"" he said. The Director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, AodhÃ¡n Connolly, said Covid had not started the move away from the high street but had accelerated it. He added: ""There's a bit of concern but the fact that retail is a safe environment and that it's a social thing means that while it may be reduced it won't go away"". On Sunday,nightclubs closed and large indoor standing events were prohibited. Fresh coronavirus restrictions came into force inWales and Scotland on the same day. The latest regulations will be reviewed by Stormont ministers on Thursday. Last week, health officials warned that a ""significant intervention"" could be needed after Christmas. From 06:00 on 27 December: It is strongly recommended that household mixing should be reduced to a maximum of three households There will be a legal requirement for businesses to take reasonable measures to achieve 2m social distancing in office spaces or, where this cannot be achieved, to provide alternative mitigations It is strongly recommended that you should work from home where possible and where that is not possible that there should be regular workplace testing There will be a statutory duty on businesses to take reasonable measures to promote compliance with face coverings requirements, with a grace period until 7 January before enforcement is implemented The exemption from wearing a face covering where it causes severe stress will be removed and the onus of proving an exemption on medical grounds will be on the individual, with a grace period until 7 January before enforcement is implemented There will be a legal duty on businesses to take all reasonable steps to minimize transmission of the spread of the virus, with a grace period until 7 January before enforcement is implemented You will be required to be seated in all indoor hospitality settings with a maximum of six people, or 10 people from a single household, allowed at a table (children aged 12 and under are not counted and this requirement does not apply to weddings or civil partnership celebrations) Indoor seated and all outdoor events can proceed and it is strongly recommended that face coverings should be worn, lateral flow tests are taken before attending events and there should be no multi-household travel in the same vehicle On Friday, arecord number of Covid-19 cases were recordedby the Department of Health.

"Temporary measures have begun for hospitality and leisure businesses in Scotland in an effort to halt the spread of the Omicron variant. From 05:00 on Monday, 1m physical distancing has been reinstated in all hospitality and indoor leisure settings. This includes pubs, restaurants, gyms, theatres and museums. Table service must also be used in places where alcohol is served to drink on the premises. Nightclubs also have to close for a period of at least three weeks, though they can stay open if they operate as a pub with table service and distancing. Large events banned as Omicron restrictions begin New Covid rules in force for three UK nations Nightclubs in Scotland to close for three weeks All of the temporary measures will reviewed after three weeks on Tuesday 11 January. The measureswere announced by the first minister last Tuesday. The new restrictions follow rising Covid case numbers fuelled by the new Omicron variant. The measures will tackle the spread of the virus while the vaccination booster programme is accelerated. The latest data - published on Christmas Eve - saw Scotland record 7,076 new confirmed cases of Covid, thehighest daily total since August. The first phase of the latest restrictions aimed at events and sport, including football, came into effect at 05:00 on Sunday. Attendance at events for the next three weeks is limited to 100 people for indoor standing events, 200 people for indoor seated events and 500 people for all outdoor events (seated or standing). This effectively cancelled large Hogmanay parties including Edinburgh's Hogmanay. Andthe SPFL chose to bring forward its winter breakrather than impose spectator restrictions. The SPFL said it was ""very hopeful"" capacity crowds could return to matches after the three-week cap on attendances over the festive period. People are being encouraged to book booster jabs as soon as possible Latest restrictions are backed by Â£375m in business support, the Scottish government said, following discussions with business organisations and local authorities.  Hospitality businesses are already eligible for top-up funding through the December and January Business Top Up. Further guidance has also been published,externalto help businesses take measures to limit the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. Economy Secretary Kate Forbes said the restrictions were targeted at reducing the spread of Omicron while the booster programme takes effect. She said: ""I understand how difficult this has been for businesses in recent weeks but we must reduce our contacts and limit the spread of the virus. ""We're providing Â£375m in business support, which is a significant investment, to support those who have experienced cancellations and help them get back on their feet in the new year. ""The best way to support business sustainably, is to get the virus back under control. Please get your boosters and stay at home as much as possible just now."" Clinicians from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde joined the calls toget ""boosted for the bells"",external. The health board has added thousands of extra vaccine clinics in the lead-up to the New Year and additional vaccinators have been recruited to help provide as many options as possible for the public. John Carson, the chief nurse at Glasgow Royal Infirmary said: ""Our hospitals are presently facing an extremely difficult a position and we can't afford for it to get worse. ""Please get the vaccine - it only takes a short time out of your day and the side effects for the vast majority are very mild. This is a very small trade off to help support the health service, and the only way we'll be able to survive through the winter."" RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"This video can not be played In the latest Climate Check, Ben Rich looks back at some of the year's defining weather events Weather events, linked to a changing climate, brought misery to millions around the world in 2021 according to a new report. The study, from the charity Christian Aid, identified 10 extreme events that each caused more than $1.5bn of damage. The biggest financial impacts were from Hurricane Ida which hit the US in August and flooding in Europe in July. In many poorer regions, floods and storms caused mass displacements of people and severe suffering. Four cheap ways to save energy at home this winter Which countries are still cutting down trees? Arctic heat record is like Mediterranean, says UN Not every extreme weather event is caused by or linked to climate change, although scientists have become bolder in exploring the connections. One leading researcher, Dr Friederike Otto, tweeted earlier this year that every heatwave happening in the world now is ""made more likely and more intense"" by human induced climate change. In relation to storms and hurricanes, there is growing evidence that climate change is also affecting these events. In August, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)published the first part of its sixth assessment report. In relation to hurricanes and tropical cyclones, the authors said they had ""high confidence"" that the evidence of human influence has strengthened. ""The proportion of intense tropical cyclones, average peak tropical cyclone wind speeds, and peak wind speeds of the most intense tropical cyclones will increase on the global scale with increasing global warming,"" the study said. Just a few weeks after that report came out,Hurricane Ida hit the US. Flooding in New Jersey in the wake of Hurricane Ida According to Christian Aid it was the most financially destructive weather event of the year. The slow-moving hurricane saw thousands of residents in Louisiana evacuated out of its path. That storm brought massive rainfall across a number of states and cities, with New York issuing a flash-flood emergency alert for the first time. Around 95 people died, with the economic losses estimated at $65bn. The second most financial costly event was thewidespread flooding across Germany, France and other European countries in July. The speed and intensity of the water overwhelmed defences and 240 people lost their lives. Reported damages were around $43bn. In the study, the majority of the weather events in the list occurred in developed countries. A train hit by debris in Austria after severe flooding in August That's because it is more feasible to estimate financial losses from insurance claims and these are usually available in richer countries, where people can afford to insure their homes and businesses. According to insurance company Aon, 2021 is likely to be the fourth time in five years that global natural catastrophes have cost more than $100bn. The report also documents many other events where the financial impact is harder to ascertain, but where the impact on people is significant. Flooding in South Sudan displaced over 800,000 people while 200,000 had to move to escape Cyclone Tauktae which hit India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives in May. ""That's a huge human impact,"" said report author Dr Kat Kramer from Christian Aid. ""Obviously, losing your home, your livelihoods, and everything, and not having the resources to rebuild that is incredibly tough. Whereas at least if you have insurance, you have some mechanism for building that back."" The report highlights the need for increased efforts on curbing emissions of carbon dioxide to reduce future weather related impacts. It is also calling on global climate diplomats to put their money where their mouth is and help poorer countries that suffer huge economic losses. In the COP26 global climate talks in Glasgow, this issue of finance for loss and damage caused by climate-related events saw major disagreement between countries. Developing nations wanted cash - the richer ones said we need more talks on the question. In South Sudan floods caused hundreds of thousands of people to leave their homes ""Although it was good to see the issue of loss and damage become a major issue at COP26, it was bitterly disappointing to leave without a fund set up to actually help people who are suffering permanent losses from climate change,' said Nushrat Chowdhury, Christian Aid's climate justice adviser in Bangladesh. ""Bringing that fund to life needs to be a global priority in 2022."" The report can be foundhere,external.

"The latest instalment of the Spider-Man franchise has become the first pandemic-era movie to make more than $1bn (Â£750m) at the global box office. Spider-Man: No Way Home also took the title of highest-grossing film of 2021. It beat out Chinese-made Korean War epic The Battle of Lake Changjin, which has grossed more than $905m worldwide. The last movie to gross more than $1bn was 2019's Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, according to media data analytics firm Comscore. No other Hollywood production has come near to reaching that box office milestone since the pandemic began two years ago. Over the weekend, global box office takings for the latest Marvel Cinematic Universe film reached $1.05bn. The co-production between Sony and Disney hit its milestone less than two weeks after its premiere even as the Omicron variant of Covid-19 has spread rapidly around the world, raising fresh concerns about indoor events. The film has not been released in China, which is currently the world's biggest cinema market. Spider-Man: No Way Home sees Tom Holland return as the third iteration of Peter Parker alongside Zendaya's MJ and Benedict Cumberbatch as the sorcerer Doctor Strange. The movie sees Tom Holland play Spider-Man alongside Zendaya's MJ The  franchise's 2019 offering Spider-Man: Far From Home was the first Spider-Man film to break the $1bn mark at the box office and is currently the highest-grossing movie in the franchise with $1.132bn in global ticket sales, according to Comscore. The latest film follows on from Far From Home, in which the villainous Mysterio unmasked Parker before dying. The series is a collaboration between the Disney's Marvel Studios and Sony. In 2015, Disney, Marvel Studios, and Sony agreed to share the film rights for Spider-Man, which led to a new iteration of the character being introduced and integrated into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Before No Way Home, MGM's latest James Bond movie No Time to Die, which made $774m at the box office globally, was the highest-grossing Hollywood film of both 2021 and the pandemic.

Tutu was one of the country's best known figures at home and abroad. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a statement,externalthat Tutu had helped bring about ""a liberated South Africa"". A contemporary of Nelson Mandela, Tutu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his role in the struggle to abolish the apartheid system enforced by the white minority government against the black majority in South Africa from 1948-91. Tutu - the staunch and steadfast healer of a nation Obituary: South Africa's rebellious priest In pictures: The life of Desmond Tutu Queen leads UK tributes to archbishop South Africans of all ages and backgrounds have been going to Cape Town's St George's Cathedral to lay flowers and pay tribute to the national hero. Mourner Ellie Shortall said that without the role that people such as Tutu had played in South Africa's liberation struggle, her own life would have been very different. ""I call my child a rainbow baby because we are a mixed couple. I was thinking yesterday that many years ago during apartheidwe wouldn't have been able to love each other, marry and have a baby,external,"" she told the local Times Live news site. ""We would have done it in secrecy or would never have had an opportunity to fall in love."" In honour of Tutu, the bells of the cathedral, the oldest in South Africa, will be rung daily at noon local time until Friday. His remains will be cremated the next day and his ashes will be kept at the cathedral. Officials bathed Cape Town City Hall in purple light to honour Desmond Tutu World leaders have been paying tribute. President Biden said he was ""heartbroken to learn of the passing of a true servant of God and of the people"", adding that Tutu's ""legacy transcends borders and will echo through the ages"". Former US President Barack Obama described Tutu as ""a mentor, friend and moral compass"". In a message of condolence, Queen Elizabeth II said she remembered with fondness her meetings with him, and his great warmth and humour. ""Archbishop Tutu's loss will be felt by the people of South Africa and by so many people in Great Britain, Northern Ireland and across the Commonwealth, where he was held in such high affection and esteem."" Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta said Tutu had ""inspired a generation of African leaders who embraced his non-violent approaches in the liberation struggle"". The Vatican said in a statement that Pope Francis offered ""heartfelt condolences to his family and loved ones"". ""Mindful of his service to the gospel through the promotion of racial equality and reconciliation in his native South Africa, his holiness commends his soul to the loving mercy of almighty God."" The Nelson Mandela Foundation said Tutu's ""contributions to struggles against injustice, locally and globally, are matched only by the depth of his thinking about the making of liberatory futures for human societies"". ""He was an extraordinary human being. A thinker. A leader. A shepherd."" Tutu's death comes just weeks after that of South Africa's last apartheid-era president, FW de Klerk, who died at the age of 85. It is impossible to imagine South Africa's long and tortuous journey to freedom - and beyond - without Archbishop Desmond Tutu. While other struggle leaders were killed, or forced into exile, or prison, the diminutive, defiant Anglican priest was there at every stage, exposing the hypocrisy of the apartheid state, comforting its victims, holding the liberation movement to account, and daring Western governments to do more to isolate a white-minority government that he compared, unequivocally, to the Nazis. When democracy arrived, Tutu used his moral authority to oversee the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that sought to expose the crimes of the white-minority government. Later he turned that same fierce gaze on the failings, in government, of South Africa's former liberation movement, the ANC. Many South Africans today will remember Tutu's personal courage, and the clarity of his moral fury. But as those who knew him best have so often reminded us, Tutu was always, emphatically, the voice of hope. And it is that hope, that optimism, accompanied, so often, by his trademark giggles and cackles, that seems likely to shape the way the world remembers, and celebrates, Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Known affectionately as The Arch, Tutu was instantly recognisable, with his purple clerical robes, cheery demeanour and almost constant smile. He was not afraid to show his emotions in public, including memorably laughing and dancing at the opening ceremony of the football World Cup in South Africa in 2010. Despite his popularity, though, he was not a man who was loved by all. He was very critical of the African National Congress (ANC) government in the post-apartheid era, when, at times, he felt it was misrepresenting South Africa - even warning in 2011 that he would pray for its downfall over a cancelled visit by the Dalai Lama. In response, the national police commissioner Gen Bheki Cele told Tutu to ""go home and shut up"". ""He is not a vice-Jesus Christ,"" he said. Ordained as a priest in 1960, Tutu went on to serve as bishop of Lesotho from 1976-78, assistant bishop of Johannesburg and rector of a parish in Soweto. He became Bishop of Johannesburg in 1985, and was appointed the first black Archbishop of Cape Town the following year. He used his high-profile role to speak out against oppression of black people in his home country, always saying his motives were religious and not political. After Mandela became South Africa's first black president in 1994, Tutu was appointed to a Truth and Reconciliation Commission set up to investigate crimes committed by both whites and blacks during the apartheid era. He was also credited with coining the term Rainbow Nation to describe the ethnic mix of post-apartheid South Africa, but in his latter years he expressed regret that the nation had not coalesced in the way in which he had dreamt.

"Experts say the current UK energy crisis has seen the demand for solar panels rise With energy bills soaring and the climate in crisis, you might ask why don't all new homes have solar panels to generate clean electricity for free? Gas and electricity bills have risen by about Â£400 a year on average and Ofgem, the UK's energy regulator, has warned costs willspike further next year. Ministers in Wales plan to force house builders to cut the carbon footprint of new homes by more than a third in 2022. But developers want more government help to meet new building standards. Families are bracing themselves to pay more for their energy as industry experts predict those that were paying Â£850 on average last year will see their bills rise to more than Â£1700. The energy price cap, which limits how much providers can charge for energy per unit, will rise in the spring because of the ""unprecedented""rise in gas pricesthat has seensome energy companies go bust. Energy price cap: Why are fuel bills rising? How will we heat our homes in future? What you can do to reduce emissions ""In December 2020 the average energy bill was Â£850,"" said Stephen Murray, from price comparison website Moneysupermarket. ""By April next year, if you're on a standard tariff, it will be around Â£1750 - that's over double where it was."" There are up to 25 million UK homes with gas boilers butthey are being phased out- withnone being sold after 2035- as gas heating accounts for 21% of the UK's carbon emissions. Moneysupermarket has warned families could face ""expected increases of Â£450 to Â£500 at a one-off stroke"" because of the crisis, caused by more demand and less supply. There are plans to helpsubsidise low-carbon heat pumpsin place of gas boilers in some homes in Wales and England from April 2022 but with the country in the midst of an energy crisis, shouldsolar panelsbe a new standard on all new homes? For a medium-sized house, one established installer estimates a good 4kW solar panel system from a well-respected brand would cost about Â£6,000 to Â£7,000 to install. New housing developments in Wales will have to be better for the environment Gareth Jones says his company, Carbon Zero Renewables, experienced a 1000% surge in orders for solar roof panels since the start of the energy crisis, with weekly enquiries surging from ""one or two to 25 to 30"". ""The reasons people are considering solar panels has changed from wanting to make money, to doing it to help the climate crisis,"" said Mr Jones, who is based in St Asaph, Denbighshire. ""You're not going to make much putting electricity back into the grid, but the environmental aspect is now a big driver - coupled with not getting impacted by soaring energy costs. ""And with gas being phased out, turning your home into its own electric creation station is proving attractive to some people. Plus if you have an electric car to charge too, customers like the fact all the energy they use is clean. ""Good systems aren't cheap but with energy costs rising, people think they can make their money back quicker than before - and good panels have a long lifespan."" But while having a panel on your roof might work for many households, Mr Jones is quick to stress that while families should consider seeing if the sun would be a viable and cost-effective option to power and heat your home, it won't work for everyone. ""If your house is very shaded or possibly doesn't get the sun as much as most, then perhaps it might not work for you,"" he said. Gas boilers to heat our homes are gradually being phased for cleaner options ""People need to consider amending their lifestyles too, so using electricity when the solar panels are creating energy when it's sunny. So instead of putting the dishwasher or washing machine on when it's dark, you do it in the day. ""The other things that need to be checked is if your roof is strong enough to support the panels and whether the location is appropriate - that's why it's advised to get a good and respected installer."" So with an energy crisis and anestimated average of 7,400 new homes,externalneeded in Wales every year to keep up with housing demand, are governments considering dictating to builders new clean energy standards? The Welsh government, for example, hasdeclared a climate emergencyand set steep targets tobecome net zero by 2050, so Wales' climate change minister is planning to tell developers that any new homes built from 2022 must cut emissions by 37%, compared to current standards. But Julie James plans to leave it to the individual house builder on individual developments to decide how their homes will reduce their footprint - like solar panels orheat pumps- as Ms James accepts not all renewable energy sources work everywhere. ""We don't mandate a particular technology, we're mandating a particular outcome,"" she told the BBC. One-sixth of Wales' carbon emissions come from heating and powering homes, yet new homes are still being built without clean energy consideration. Ministers in Cardiff see renewable power as a way of helping people pay their bills and reducing fuel poverty - as well as moving towardsnet zeroby 2050. ""This is a win-win situation for everyone really,"" said Ms James, the only minister in the UK whose brief is just climate change. How can you make your home eco-friendly? What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? ""This isn't just because I tend to like this kind of house, this is a climate emergency we are seeing... we see the extreme weather conditions people will have to cope with inside their houses. ""We want the house to be able to withstand those increased weather pressures."" The Welsh government is working with the construction industry to cut the carbon footprint on homes by at least 37% from next year - and to make sure as many of the supplies come from Wales to reduce any supply chain carbon footprint. How will that extra cost affect you? The organisation that represents small developers agrees climate change is the biggest threat, and that renewable energy built into new homes is the future. This video can not be played What does it take to live on renewable energy? But the Federation of Master Builders (FMB) has warned the cost could be picked up by customers, which could affect first-time buyers the most. ""There are 70,000 households in Wales on housing waiting lists and we need more homes built,"" said Ifan Glyn, FMB Wales director. ""To enable that, small builders need extra support from Welsh government to help them meet any new housing standards."" Some housing associations have already started fitting solar panels to new and existing homes after securing grants from the Welsh government - and they could provide a template for how to install panels to new homes cost-effectively that could be upscaled for major housing developments. More than 7,000 new homes are needed to be built a year in Wales to keep up with demand ""Now when architects look at a brand new site, we think 'how easy is it to walk to?'"" said Elfed Roberts, of Pobl Housing's latest development at Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taf. ""Then we analyse where the sun is, where the great views are and where does the wind come from, that is a new way of working in new-home construction."" How will Wales go green by 2050? The former coal villages turning green Action on green energy needed now, says trade body How will we heat our homes in future?

"Archbishop Desmond Tutu tirelessly championed human rights, the Queen has said, following the death on Sunday of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate who helped end apartheid in South Africa. Leading UK tributes to Tutu, who has died in Cape Town aged 90, the Queen remembered ""with fondness my meetings with him, his great warmth and humour"". The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said he had changed the world. Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised his leadership and humour. The Queen said: ""I am joined by the whole Royal Family in being deeply saddened by the news of the death of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a man who tirelessly championed human rights in South Africa and across the world."" The Duke and Duchess of Cornwall said they were ""deeply saddened"" to hear his death, saying his bravery in speaking out ""against the evil of apartheid and highlighting the threat of climate change"" was an inspiration. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex said when theyintroduced their son Archie to the archbishopin South Africa in 2019, Tutu made a joke about ""Arch and The Arch"", and his ""infectious laughter"" rang through the room and relaxed ""anyone in his presence"". ""He was an icon for racial justice and beloved across the world,"" they said. Archbishop Tutu was one of the driving forces behind the movement to end apartheid, the policy that saw racial segregation and discrimination against the black majority in South Africa by the white minority government. He was credited with coming up with the term Rainbow Nation to describe the ethnic mix of post-apartheid South Africa, but in his latter years he expressed regret that the nation had not come together as he had hoped. This video can not be played Justin Welby: Tutu just had this extraordinary, bubbly, overwhelming sense of humour The prime minister added: ""He was a critical figure in the fight against apartheid and in the struggle to create a new South Africa - and will be remembered for his spiritual leadership and irrepressible good humour."" Labour Party leader Keir Starmer described Tutu as ""a tower of a man and a leader of moral activism"" who ""dedicated his life to tackling injustice and standing up for the oppressed"". He said: ""His impact on the world crosses borders and echoes through generations."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""His was a life that made the world a better place."" Archbishop Desmond Tutu at Westminster Abbey for a celebration of Nelson Mandela's life in 2014 Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab described Archbishop Tutu as a ""truly great figure"". He said he had met him in The Hague, when the archbishop was working for victims of war crimes, and added: ""His adage, 'don't raise your voice, improve your argument', has never felt more apt."" Former cabinet minister Lord Hain, who grew up in South Africa and was a leading anti-apartheid campaigner, said Tutu was ""somebody on Nelson Mandela's level who inspired millions with his honesty, his vision, his courage and his sincerity"". At the height of the anti-apartheid struggle, Tutu ""roused the faithful, inspired people and also had a way of engaging that was soft and yet hard"", Lord Hain said, adding that he ""spoke truth to power"". Ex-president of the British Anti-Apartheid Movement and former Liberal Party leader, Lord David Steel, said: ""Desmond Tutu was a gigantic and effective opponent of apartheid"". He said Tutu's ""vital role can never be underestimated"". Former prime minister Tony Blair was ""saddened"" to hear of Tutu's death. He said the archbishop's ""spiritual leadership and willingness to take action in pursuit of peaceful change earned him the respect of millions in South Africa and the rest of the world"". Archbishop Desmond Tutu with the Queen on one of his many visits to the UK Tutu first lived in the UK in the 1960s, where he studied King's College London and received degrees in theology. He was in the country for five years and then returned in 1972, as vice-director of the Theological Education Fund of the World Council of Churches. Tutu eventually went back to South Africa to become the first African to be appointed Anglican Dean of Johannesburg. Tutu visited Birmingham in 1989 as part of the city-wide Christian Celebrations and he and his wife saw a number of establishments, including the Nelson Mandela School in Sparkbrook. When he was there, he criticised what he termed ""two-nation"" Britain, and said there were too many black people in the country's prisons. Tutu was given the freedom of Hull in 1999 after giving the annual Wilberforce lecture there, commemorating the life and achievements of anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce. And he returned to the UK yet again in 2004 as visiting professor in Post-Conflict Societies at King's College London. Archbishop Welby said Tutu - ""always known as Arch"" - was ""a prophet and priest, a man of words and action, one who embodied the hope and joy that were the foundations of his life"". He added: ""He was a man of extraordinary personal courage and bravery: when the police burst into Capetown Cathedral, he defied them by dancing down the aisle."" Tutu's love ""transformed the lives of politicians and priests, township dwellers and world leaders"", he added, saying he was a pioneer and ""a man of enormous vision"". He also spoke of his ""extraordinary, bubbly, overwhelming sense of humour"", adding ""you laughed the whole time when you met him"". Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell said ""the world itself feels a little smaller without him"". He said Tutu had been asked to chair the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in Cape Town as ""one of the few people in South Africa other than Nelson Mandela himself, who could unite the nation and carry the trust of everyone. ""In this respect, he was a giant,"" he added. The archbishop added that when he got to chapel this morning to celebrate Eucharist, he might ""dance a little jig in thankful memory of this wonderful human being"". This video can not be played Dr John Sentamu shares his memories of Desmond Tutu Former Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu said Tutu was a man of ""amazing faith"" who was ""so rooted in Christ he feared nothing"". He added: ""His feet were firmly on the ground but always looking to the horizon of hope."" Terry Waite, the Archbishop of Canterbury's envoy in the 1980s, said that Archbishop Tutu ""worked tirelessly for a free and fair South Africa and was never silent when he needed to speak out on behalf of the poor and the oppressed"".

"The prime minister is due to be briefed on the latest Covid data as he weighs whether to impose additional measures in England before the new year. After two days without published figures, Boris Johnson will hear the impact on the NHS of record infections. But the BBC understands no further Covid restrictions in England are set to be announced on Monday. Scotland and Northern Ireland have tightened up for a second day, with new restrictions for pubs and restaurants. In both nations hospitality venues have returned to table service only - while social distancing has been reintroduced in several places including gyms, cinemas and theatres in Scotland, and offices in Northern Ireland. Nightclubs have also been closed in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. Downing Street said no decisions have been taken yet on whether extra measures would be introduced in England, but it previously said it would not hesitate to act after Christmas if necessary. However, some business owners have called for clarity as they look ahead to New Year's Eve. Paul Kemp, owner of Beerd bar in Bristol, told the BBC: ""People need to know now, they've got staff that they need to put in place, they've got security that they need to book, they've got stock that they need to order. He needs to tell people now, right now so they know what they are doing."" The current guidance requires people in England to work from home, wear face coverings in shops and other public settings and present Covid passes to gain entry to large events. The measures are all part of the government's Plan B. Scotland: Nightclubs close and 1m distancing returns Northern Ireland: Table service returns and no dancing in bars Wales: FM reflects on difficult year as rules tighten The briefing by government scientists on Monday is one of a regular series of updates given to the prime minister, and he has not yet called a cabinet meeting or announced a recall of Parliament. In addition, cabinet office minister Stephen Barclay will also chair one of the regular Covid meetings on staff shortages and workplace resilience. Dr Ian Higginson, the vice president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, has told BBC Radio 4 some hospitals were experiencing ""significant staffing issues right now"" - with one department losing 50% of its nurses on Sunday night for Covid-related reasons. MPs have been promised a vote if it is decided fresh legal measures are needed, after Mr Johnson suffered the largest rebellion since he became PM over the introduction of Covid passes earlier this month. But Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, treasurer of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tories, has urged the PM to be ""very cautious"" before applying further restrictions. The Cotswolds MP said the latest figures published before Christmas showed the number of cases in hospital was ""relatively stable"". Speaking to Times Radio, he added: ""I just don't think the evidence, unless the data coming out today looks very different, is there for any further measures."" Asked whether he was concerned England was ""out of step"" with the rest of the UK in terms of Omicron restrictions, Sir Geoffrey replied: ""I think it is the other way round. I think the [other nations] are out of step with England. I think they have been overly cautious."" Dr Simon Clarke, from the University of Reading, told the BBC he thinks the government ""is going to sit tight"" and ""wait for a signal that Omicron, if indeed it is, is more severe in older people"". Meanwhile, NHS England national medical director Professor Stephen Powis has called on people to get boosted in time for the New Year. The NHS has said there are 1,551,187 vaccination slots still available to be booked between Monday and January. Ministers welcomed early findings last week that people infected with the fast-spreading Omicron variant were less likely to be admitted to hospital - although the BBC understands a range of factors will be examined when looking at the case for restrictions. Infections surged by 48.2% in the seven days before Christmas, hitting a record 122,186 confirmed cases on Friday, the last day figures were published. But the number of people admitted to hospital and deaths following a positive test have risen much more slowly so far.

"This video can not be played ""The Sun has gone down"": Watch South Africans' reactions to the death of Archbishop Desmond Tutu South Africa is holding a week of events to mark the passing of the anti-apartheid leader Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who died on Sunday aged 90. The plans include two days of lying in state before an official state funeral on 1 January in Cape Town. Tributes have been pouring in from leaders around the world, including Queen Elizabeth II, US President Joe Biden and Pope Francis. Tutu was one of the country's best known figures at home and abroad. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a statement,externalthat Tutu had helped bring about ""a liberated South Africa"". A contemporary of Nelson Mandela, Tutu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his role in the struggle to abolish the apartheid system enforced by the white minority government against the black majority in South Africa from 1948-91. Tutu - the staunch and steadfast healer of a nation Obituary: South Africa's rebellious priest In pictures: The life of Desmond Tutu Queen leads UK tributes to archbishop South Africans of all ages and backgrounds have been going to Cape Town's St George's Cathedral to lay flowers and pay tribute to the national hero. Mourner Ellie Shortall said that without the role that people such as Tutu had played in South Africa's liberation struggle, her own life would have been very different. ""I call my child a rainbow baby because we are a mixed couple. I was thinking yesterday that many years ago during apartheidwe wouldn't have been able to love each other, marry and have a baby,external,"" she told the local Times Live news site. ""We would have done it in secrecy or would never have had an opportunity to fall in love."" In honour of Tutu, the bells of the cathedral, the oldest in South Africa, will be rung daily at noon local time until Friday. His remains will be cremated the next day and his ashes will be kept at the cathedral. Officials bathed Cape Town City Hall in purple light to honour Desmond Tutu World leaders have been paying tribute. President Biden said he was ""heartbroken to learn of the passing of a true servant of God and of the people"", adding that Tutu's ""legacy transcends borders and will echo through the ages"". Former US President Barack Obama described Tutu as ""a mentor, friend and moral compass"". In a message of condolence, Queen Elizabeth II said she remembered with fondness her meetings with him, and his great warmth and humour. ""Archbishop Tutu's loss will be felt by the people of South Africa and by so many people in Great Britain, Northern Ireland and across the Commonwealth, where he was held in such high affection and esteem."" Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta said Tutu had ""inspired a generation of African leaders who embraced his non-violent approaches in the liberation struggle"". The Vatican said in a statement that Pope Francis offered ""heartfelt condolences to his family and loved ones"". ""Mindful of his service to the gospel through the promotion of racial equality and reconciliation in his native South Africa, his holiness commends his soul to the loving mercy of almighty God."" The Nelson Mandela Foundation said Tutu's ""contributions to struggles against injustice, locally and globally, are matched only by the depth of his thinking about the making of liberatory futures for human societies"". ""He was an extraordinary human being. A thinker. A leader. A shepherd."" Tutu's death comes just weeks after that of South Africa's last apartheid-era president, FW de Klerk, who died at the age of 85. It is impossible to imagine South Africa's long and tortuous journey to freedom - and beyond - without Archbishop Desmond Tutu. While other struggle leaders were killed, or forced into exile, or prison, the diminutive, defiant Anglican priest was there at every stage, exposing the hypocrisy of the apartheid state, comforting its victims, holding the liberation movement to account, and daring Western governments to do more to isolate a white-minority government that he compared, unequivocally, to the Nazis. When democracy arrived, Tutu used his moral authority to oversee the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that sought to expose the crimes of the white-minority government. Later he turned that same fierce gaze on the failings, in government, of South Africa's former liberation movement, the ANC. Many South Africans today will remember Tutu's personal courage, and the clarity of his moral fury. But as those who knew him best have so often reminded us, Tutu was always, emphatically, the voice of hope. And it is that hope, that optimism, accompanied, so often, by his trademark giggles and cackles, that seems likely to shape the way the world remembers, and celebrates, Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Known affectionately as The Arch, Tutu was instantly recognisable, with his purple clerical robes, cheery demeanour and almost constant smile. He was not afraid to show his emotions in public, including memorably laughing and dancing at the opening ceremony of the football World Cup in South Africa in 2010. Despite his popularity, though, he was not a man who was loved by all. He was very critical of the African National Congress (ANC) government in the post-apartheid era, when, at times, he felt it was misrepresenting South Africa - even warning in 2011 that he would pray for its downfall over a cancelled visit by the Dalai Lama. In response, the national police commissioner Gen Bheki Cele told Tutu to ""go home and shut up"". ""He is not a vice-Jesus Christ,"" he said. Ordained as a priest in 1960, Tutu went on to serve as bishop of Lesotho from 1976-78, assistant bishop of Johannesburg and rector of a parish in Soweto. He became Bishop of Johannesburg in 1985, and was appointed the first black Archbishop of Cape Town the following year. He used his high-profile role to speak out against oppression of black people in his home country, always saying his motives were religious and not political. After Mandela became South Africa's first black president in 1994, Tutu was appointed to a Truth and Reconciliation Commission set up to investigate crimes committed by both whites and blacks during the apartheid era. He was also credited with coining the term Rainbow Nation to describe the ethnic mix of post-apartheid South Africa, but in his latter years he expressed regret that the nation had not coalesced in the way in which he had dreamt.

"There have been more Covid-related flight cancellations globally as the week starts, capping off a miserable festive period for thousands of people. More than 2,200 flights have been scrapped on Monday, with Chinese and US destinations being the worst hit,the FlightAware data tracking website says,external. US airlines say the disruption is due to crews testing positive or isolating. Hong Kong is banning all South Korea's Korean Air flights for two weeks, after positive cases among some arrivals. In all, more than 8,000 flights have been grounded over the long Christmas weekend that began on Friday. Although the number of cancellations is a small percentage of the total, it is higher than normal and comes at a time of year when many are travelling to spend time with family and friends.

"Energy companies will face more robust financial checks from January after a host of companies failed owing to a wholesale price surge, the regulator Ofgem has announced. Bosses of firms will also undergo more stringent vetting. More than 20, mostly small, suppliers have collapsed following a spike in wholesale gas prices. Nearly four million other households have seen their supplier fail since the start of the pandemic. The regulator also said it was consulting on the future set up of the energy price cap, designed to protect customers who have not switched. It has been highlighted as part of the problem by some failed companies. Failed energy firms will hike bills - power boss Wrapping up to stay warm as energy bills rise ""I am setting out clear action so that we have robust stress testing for suppliers so they can't pass inappropriate risk to consumers,"" said Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley. ""Our priority has been, and will always be, to act in the best interests of energy consumers. The months ahead will be difficult for many, and we are working with the government and energy companies to mitigate the impact as much as we can, particularly for the most vulnerable households."" A significant rise in bills for 15 million people is inevitable in April, but Ofgem is alsoconsulting on possible changes,externalto the way tariffs are offered in the longer-term. Options include customers being tied in to a standard tariff for six months, like a fixed term mortgage. If they left early for a cheaper deal, they would be charged an exit fee, unlike now. The argument is that suppliers and remaining customers would not be left picking up the cost of their departure, although exit fees would be controversial. Other suggestions include forcing companies to offer the same price to existing customers as they do to new customers. A similar rule is being introduced for home and motor insurance in January. There might also be a charge paid by a supplier each time it takes on a new customer. The price cap may also be reviewed every three months, rather than the current six, or an interim price cap introduced if market conditions changed dramatically. When a host of energy companies collapsed, Ofgem was heavily criticised for having been asleep at the wheel, and unprepared for such a crisis. Citizens Advice, the official advocate for energy customers, recently published what it described as Ofgem's ""catalogue of errors"" in recent years, that was now ultimately leaving customers having to pick up a multi-million pound bill. That included an accusation that poor practice was rife, with many companies showing clear evidence of financial unsustainability, ""including firms run out of the owners' living rooms and kitchens"". These latest announcement by Ofgem will address some of those concerns. They include: If financial stress tests show up a weakness in a company, then an improvement plan will be drawn up with the regulator Suppliers will have to self-assess their management The regulator's assessment period before granting a new licence to operate will be extended to nine months The regulator is also consulting on whether to block firms from taking on new customers once they hit certain milestones - such as 50,000 and 200,000 accounts - until it is happy with their balance sheet strength. ""What we want to say to suppliers is either get some insurance, buy your energy ahead or have enough money in the bank to weather a storm like this,"" Mr Brearley told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Customers of collapsed firms now have to pay more for their energy, because their original tariff was not protected. Those on the price cap also saw prices rises in October. This has been a major factor in the rising cost of living, withinflation now rising at its fastest rate for a decade. Mr Brearley said that customers should brace themselves for a further significant rise in gas prices in April, when a new price cap is introduced. ""Where you have legitimate price increases and the increase in gas is legitimate then those costs need to be passed onto customers. I know that's really hard, but we do expect a significant rise in April,"" he said. He added that it was too early to give a figure and refuted that Ofgem had failed to take control of the market. ""Our job as a regulator is to make sure people pay a fair price for energy but no more than that,"" he said. Ofgem said the cap had saved consumers an estimated Â£1bn a year since its introduction. However it said the current methodology, while protecting consumers from price spikes, exposed suppliers to risks that are harder to manage at times of high energy price volatility. ""There is a risk that, if not tackled, this could lead to higher costs for consumers,"" the regulator said.

"Sandy Birtles says she is worried about rising prices When she goes in to check on him at night, Sandy Birtles says she can hardly see her teenage son for all the layers on his bed. The single mother of two says that the family do all they can to keep warm as the bills continue to rise. ""I do not have the heating on when the kids are at school,"" she said. ""If I'm not running around and clearing up, then I'm wrapping up in a coat."" She said that financial pressures mean she had been ""penny-pinching all the time"", but she said rising energy bills have added to the strain. They have to be careful not to use too much hot water, she said, and when her 15-year-old son wanted to add to his bedding she got him a double duvet. How to save energy at home and help the planet What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? She is worried that these bills will continue to rise, and a charity has predicted that she - and millions of others - will face a particularly difficult bill shock early next year. National Energy Action has predicted that when domestic energy prices rise in April, it will mean that the typical domestic gas bill will have doubled in 18 months. The charity, which campaigns for warm, dry homes, used industry data and forecasts to predict that the typical gas bill, for those on standard tariffs, is likely to have gone up from Â£466 a year in October 2020, to Â£944 in April 2022. Catherine Geddes uses blankets to stay warm Catherine Geddes, who lives on her own in Keighley, is also struggling to cover her energy costs and was worried about the likelihood of them continuing to rise sharply. She has found unusual ways to try to keep the cost down. ""I very rarely put the heating on. Basically I wrap myself up in a blanket and I will use the hairdryer to warm me up. ""My anxiety levels are so high. It is just a nightmare."" National Energy Action information on help with energy bills,external Most households pay for their gas and electricity together in a dual-fuel deal. Those who pay a standard tariff are protected by the industry regulator Ofgem's price cap. This was set at its lowest level in October 2020, owing to relatively low wholesale prices faced by suppliers. It meant the typical annual domestic energy bill for millions of households was no higher than Â£1,042 a year. However, it has increased twice since then, most recently its biggest increase to date this October, which meant those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of Â£139 to Â£1,277 a year. There is widespread expectation that owing to soaring wholesale gas prices in recent months the next price cap in April will be set at a much higher level than now. National Energy Action has predicted that this is likely to be a Â£550 a year increase for a typical standard tariff dual fuel customer. ""The cost of living in the UK is at its highest level in a decade with household energy bills the biggest driver. When the costs of essential services go up, those on lowest incomes get hit hardest,"" said Adam Scorer, the charity's chief executive. ""For people already on a budgetary knife-edge, the cost of keeping a family warm has exploded while budgets have collapsed. No amount of useful tips or savvy shopping can cope with that."" The existence of the price cap has delayed the impact of surging wholesale prices on household bills. However, it has also been blamed as creating an unmanageable market by some of the smaller energy firms which have collapsed during the current crisis. Their customers have been moved onto tariffs with other suppliers, in line with the price cap. As a result, hundreds of thousands of people who might have expected to be protected from price rises as they were on a fixed rate will now also be hit by the April price rise. In October, Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley told the BBC that the price cap was there to stop firms making unfair profits, but ""legitimate costs have to be passed through"". He said it was too early to say how much the rise in April would be or whether Ofgem would have to review the price cap more frequently in future. Energy UK, which represents the industry, has said that anyone who is struggling to pay for their energy bill should call their supplier for support. ""Suppliers have put forward more support for customers who might be struggling with their bills this year, and we are currently working with consumer groups to help raise awareness of the help that is available,"" said Emma Pinchbeck, Energy UK's chief executive.
