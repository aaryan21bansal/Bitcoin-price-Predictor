"FA chairman Greg Clarke has vowed to resign if his plans for reform are not backed by the government Football Association plans to boost the diversity of its leadership are ""wishy washy"" and ""won't make any difference"", says a leading equality campaigner. The FAannounced the proposed reformsafter criticism over the way it is run. They include more women being added to its board and 11 new members joining the FA Council to ""better reflect"" the diversity of English football. However, Lord Ouseley, chairman of diversity campaign group Kick It Out, says the changes are ""superficial"". A former chairperson of the Commission for Racial Equality and a current Institute of Race Relations council member, Lord Ouseley told BBC Radio 5 live: ""It won't add any additional power and involvement in leadership roles for black and minority ethnic people. ""In fact, there's no representation for disabled people, LGBT communities - it's very superficial. ""While it will look good and it is to be welcomed as some change, it won't make any difference about where the power is, where the control is, and quite frankly it's a bit wishy washy."" Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), was also critical of the reforms, saying they showed ""a complete disrespect for key stakeholders"" such as players, managers, referees and fans. ""We are referred to as 'not aligned' to The Professional Game or National Game, which shows a complete lack of understanding and respect for the very people who provide their income,"" he said. ""Such proposals do nothing to bring us in line with the rest of the world or alter the perception of lacking inclusion and being disconnected 'dinosaurs'."" In December, five former FA bosses asked the government to intervene and change an organisation they described as being held back by""elderly white men"". In February, MPs warned they could legislate to force the FA to reform if they had""no confidence""that the organisation would do so itself. Sports Minister Tracey Crouch has said the FA could lose Â£30m-Â£40m of public funding if it does not modernise. FA announces reform plan FA reform: Timeline on Football Association governance Richard Conway: Can the FA deliver change? FA chairman Greg Clarke reiterated that he will quit if the plans for reform do not win government support. ""This is a transformational leap forward and if the government don't accept this, I'm not sure what else we can do,"" he told BBC Sport on Monday. ""If government don't want to accept it, who am I to argue but, of course, I will resign."" BBC Radio 5 live sports news correspondent Richard Conway asked Clarke why there were no plans for dedicated black, Asian and minority ethnic background representation on the proposed new 10-member board. Clarke replied: ""What I would like to see is a path to make sure that not only are we gender diverse but ethnically diverse. What I don't want this to be is empty words. ""I want to find a way to achieve it and be accountable. I just need a bit more time to get there. ""It's really important that the FA is representative to society. Throughout the business world, diverse boards make better decisions. I think that's true in football too."" The FA is effectively run by its own parliament, the FA Council, which has 122 members. Just eight are women and only four are from ethnic minorities. More than 90 of the 122 members are aged over 60. Only eight of the 122 members of the FA Council are women The FA's proposed reforms seek to: Establish three positions on the FA board reserved for female members by 2018 Reduce the size of the board to 10 members Add 11 new members to the FA Council so it ""better reflects the inclusive and diverse nature of English football"" Limit board membership to three periods of three years Introduce term limits for FA Council membership The reforms still have to be approved by the FA Council, which will debate and vote on the recommendations on Monday, 3 April.

"Emma Watson's decision to expose part of her breasts in a Vanity Fair photoshoot has sparked a fierce debate on social media about what it means to be a feminist. ""She complains that women are sexualised and then sexualises herself in her own work. Hypocrisy,"" said radio presenter Julia Hartley-Breweron Twitter,external. Watson said she was ""confused"" by accusations she is ""anti-feminist"" and there was a real ""misunderstanding"" about what it actually means. So can you bare your breasts and still be a feminist? Women should be united in the fight for equality more than ever, says Victoria Jenkinson ""Emma Watson has done more for women and for young girls than most of us put together,"" says Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for gender equality and women's rights. ""So I don't really see that just because she's made that decision, any of us should be criticising her. ""She's an empowered woman who is posing for a very tasteful image. She's not being exploited, she doing it in a controlling position. It's a positive use of her body."" Sexist News, the team behind the campaign for the Sun to stop using topless models on Page 3, said it loved that the former Harry Potter star was ""exploring and championing feminism having grown up in the public eye"". It believes the row created by the photoshoot is ""daft"", adding: ""It is not a debate that we have about men's fashion shoots, regardless of the amounts of nipple-grazing crochet they wear. ""While no woman gets to dress herself outside of our society's patriarchal bubble, this example just shows that someone like Emma Watson is going to face an even more impossible standard than many other women."" Victoria Jenkinson, 20, a member of Girlguiding, believes the shoot has been used as a opportunity to ""stir up a frenzy"" around Watson and ""undermine"" her work promoting women's rights. ""The shoot doesn't suggest hypocrisy nor does it undermine her work as a feminist and we as women should be united in our fight for equality more than ever before,"" she said. ""I don't understand why people have an idea they can tell a woman what she can and can't do and I agree with Emma that critics have missed the point. ""A woman should be able to choose what she wants to do. This is what feminism is all about in 2017."" But Dr Finn Mackay, a feminism researcher at the University of West England, rejects the view that feminism is about giving women ""choice"" and says it is a social justice movement. ""Emma's saying feminism is about choice and the choice to do whatever you want, but that's a nonsense,"" she says. ""Some women choose terrible things, some women choose to work for parties that deny women access to abortion, access to healthcare or mothers access to welfare."" This video can not be played Emma Watson responded to claims she is anti-feminist by saying she was ""confused"" by the comments However, she does not believe that Watson's pose for Vanity Fair means she is not a feminist. ""If she self identifies as a feminist and believes in promoting women's rights, her doing her job doesn't necessarily have to undermine that. ""I think if she's trying to say being in a photoshoot and getting your breast out is a feminist act, that's a different matter."" But Dr Mackay believes promoting feminism is more effective through the voice and not the body. ""The most radical thing that women can do in this culture is keep their clothes on and open their mouths and make political points,"" she says. The controversy surrounding Watson's magazine shoot has brought into question what it means to be a feminist. But equality groups and feminists say the debate should be focused on female objectification and inequality. Ms Smethers says: ""The real issue about all of this is the pressure on young women to look a certain way, to be judged on their appearance so if we are going to focus on anything that's what I would be more concerned to be prioritised."" Dr Mackay questions why the debate has been reduced to a celebrity exposing her breasts rather than issues such as women's economic positions and cuts to women's services. ""A Hollywood celebrity flashing a bit of boob is really the least of my worries,"" she says. Campaigners marched for women's rights at a protest in London in January 2017 ""It's interesting that people only speak about it now and their real motivation seems to be to want to have a dig at feminism rather than to talk about the overall problems Hollywood has with objectifying women."" Sexist News adds: ""We really need to examine why on earth this one fashion image has caused such outrage. This is not to say that images of fashion or celebrity are unproblematic, quite the contrary. ""As ever the focus is on what a woman should or shouldn't be doing and not on how our culture presents, polices and consumes women's bodies and condemns their actions. ""We need to challenge these things, not the individual women stuck in the system."" Are you a feminist?

"Thirty years ago a ferry left dock in Belgium. Within minutes the ship was in trouble and in just 90 seconds it capsized, killing 193 people. Here is the story of the Herald of Free Enterprise - told by those whose lives were forever affected by the disaster. Gillian Lashbrooke was one of the first people to know something was wrong. She was 16 years old. Her mother, stepfather and uncle died in the accident while she and her three stepbrothers survived. ""I was outside on the deck when it started, I was looking over the rail into the water,"" she said. ""The water was getting further away, at first I thought I was imagining it. ""The ship just tilted over and I was flung backwards and was knocked unconscious for a little while and - when I came round - I was lying on the seats. But they were in the wrong place because the ship had gone on its side - so the floor was now like a wall. ""I tried to climb up the seating like a ladder but I couldn't. All I wanted to do was get back inside to my mum."" Eventually she jumped into the sea. Gillian Lashbrooke pictured at home three months before the disaster ""I was wearing long boots and a denim coat, they were so heavy they were dragging me down. I struggled to take off my boots and coat while I was still trying to swim. ""I thought I'd try to swim back to land. But it was so cold and the waves were so ferocious. I swam back to the boat and managed to hook my skirt on to a thing sticking out from the boat because the waves were dragging me down, and I needed to stay up. ""There was a woman near me, and she was holding a little girl above the water. ""Helicopters were overhead, but they couldn't see us. So I flung myself back into the sea and there was a fishing boat. The woman kept screaming 'don't leave me to die' and I shouted back I would tell rescuers where she was. ""I don't know what happened to the woman or the little girl. I tried to find out and I put out an appeal. I'm fairly sure they both died."" ""I couldn't believe I was looking at my mum. I loved her so much and she was dead in front of me."" ""People in a fishing boat rescued me. Then I was taken to land and an ambulance took me to hospital. ""That night I became an adult. I washed my clothes out in the sink and put them on a radiator to dry. I prayed for my mum, hoping I was praying for her and not speaking to her."" The following day Ms Lashbrooke and her stepbrothers were told their parents were dead. They were taken to a makeshift mortuary in a gym. ""I saw my dad as soon as I walked in. I saw children dead and laid out. They were children I'd seen alive the evening before. It didn't seem real they were dead. ""Then my brother found my mum. I couldn't believe I was looking at my mum. I loved her so much and she was dead in front of me. ""She wasn't just my mum, she was my best friend. The night before, she'd given me some money just before I went on deck and said 'get something to eat love, and I'll see you in a minute'. ""That minute never came. That was the last time I saw her."" Crew member Henry Graham was working in a kiosk in the drivers' lounge of the stricken ship. ""It all happened in the blink of an eye. I knew the ship wasn't coming back from the roll. Things slid off the tables, water came through the windows. The lights went out. There was so much noise - screaming and crashing, the world went upside down."" He managed to clamber on to the side of the ship and helped a young girl to reach a tugboat. He says his first instinct was to return to the Herald but the tug he was on had already left for shore. He couldn't go back. ""My wife was actually told I was missing presumed dead. But she then saw me on the television news, getting off a bus. ""Afterwards I went on the sick. I wasn't physically injured, it was all mental. My bosses told me I had to go back to work. I lasted two days. ""Then for nine years I didn't go anywhere near the sea. It was a mixture of fear and the memories of everyone we'd lost. But I eventually went back. I worked on the ferries again, and now I'm with the Royal Fleet Auxiliary."" The Herald of Free Enterprise was a roll-on roll-off ferry operating between Dover and Zeebrugge. That afternoon the vessel was at about 40% capacity, mostly carrying passengers from the UK. It set off without the bow doors being closed and became unstable. Vehicles rolled from port to starboard and back. The ship capsized on to its port side on a sandbank, all its lights out, in just 90 seconds. There was not enough time to send an SOS signal, nor to lower the lifeboats or deploy life jackets. In the formal inquiry that followed, blame was placed onassistant boatswain Mark Stanley for not closing the bow doors,external. First officer Leslie Sabel was also blamed for not making sure they were closed while the captain David Lewry was criticised for leaving port without checking the doors had been shut. This video can not be played It is 30 years since the Zeebrugge ferry capsized, killing 193 people Mr Stanley, who died last year, had fallen asleep in his cabin, only to wake when he was flung from his bunk as the ship listed. He always admitted his part in the tragedy and expressed great remorse. The official inquiry found he had acted with courage helping people when disaster struck. The ship's owner Townsend Thoresen was criticised for its ""staggering complacency"". New rules were brought into force, such as installing emergency lighting, CCTV to monitor critical areas of the ferry, and windows that could be broken using a hammer. The three named individuals blamed in the official inquiry: Captain David Lewry, Chief Officer Leslie Sabel, Assistant Boatswain Mark Stanley One young couple who died were Alison and Francis Gaillard. They had been married for less than two years. Alison's mother, Margaret De Rohan, was in Australia when the Herald tipped over - she had not known her daughter and son-in-law were on board until her husband mentioned they had gone on a day trip to Belgium. The De Rohans flew home, and Mrs De Rohan said she was convinced she would find her daughter alive in hospital. ""I had the strongest feeling in the world I'd find Alison, and that she'd be so badly injured she wouldn't be able to tell people who she was,"" she said. ""It's an awful thing for a mother to hope, that her daughter would be so badly hurt. ""We went to Belgium, to the hospital. We were told there were 16 unidentified bodies but Ali and Francis weren't among them. My husband insisted on going to the morgue to see for himself. He came back, kissed me on the cheek, and said 'Ali's there. Francis isn't'. ""And all our hopes were dashed. I was right, we'd found her in a hospital. I didn't realise it would be in the morgue. Francis was still on the Herald of Free Enterprise until it was refloated. It took about three and a half weeks before we got his body back. They're buried together in Windsor cemetery. ""You know, they were a young, idealistic couple. If they'd found something they really, really believed in, I could just imagine they'd sacrifice their lives for it. But not this."" Alison and Francis Gaillard had been married for 18 months when they died Bill McCrea was chaplain to the Merchant Navyand National Sea Training College and officiated at four of the funerals. ""I was on duty that evening. Several crew members of the Herald were at the college. Gradually, news came through that a British ferry was in trouble. When the men realised it was their ship they became deeply anxious."" He travelled to Dover as soon as he could and spent two weeks in the Seafarers' Centre providing practical and emotional support. He said the disaster tested his ministry to the limit. Bill McCrea (far right) during his time at the National Sea Training College in Gravesend ""It was an incredible shock to my system and I was very anxious. I have dealt with individual loss of life with seafarers' families over the years, but so many people lost their lives that night. I wanted to do the right things. Who can train you for that? You depend upon the grace of God. ""I knew some of the men who died very well, including a young fellow who was 17. It was his first posting as a seafarer. He'd only just finished his college course. ""I conducted his funeral service, comforting his family as I, too, struggled to come to terms with the devastating loss. As much as I ministered to his family, they ministered to me too."" Some of the families had to wait a long time for the recovery of their loved ones' bodies. ""One woman had to wait six weeks before they found her husband's body. I gave her all the support I could during that time. ""I also supported passengers who had survived. I met a woman on one of my hospital visits, she lost her husband that night. She told me the only reason she survived was that a truck driver helped keep her awake by pinching her. ""There were a lot of heroic acts that went on that night.""

"The shadow chancellor has issued an ""open invitation"" to MPs ""We have begun our tea offensive."" So say the team around the Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, as they emphasise the need for ""unity"" in the Labour Party. ""The biggest fear the Tories have is a united Labour Party,"" a source close to Mr McDonnell said. ""Jeremy Corbyn could be the most transformative Labour prime minister since Clement Attlee."" The shadow chancellor addressed Labour MPs at their weekly meeting in Parliament earlier on Monday. Sources said he showed ""contrition"" over an article he wrote suggesting there was a ""soft coup"" under way designed to topple Jeremy Corbyn. ""We must focus on unity,"" he told Labour MPs, singling out for praise previous critics of Mr Corbyn such as Rachel Reeves and Angela Eagle. John McDonnell has issued ""an open invitation to anyone"" in the Labour movement who would like to talk to him and have a cup of tea, but sources wouldn't say if they were dispatching invitations directly, or merely accepting requests to meet him. But not all MPs in the room were convinced. One told me he asked Mr McDonnell, in a reference to Sir John Major's speech about Brexit: ""Why is a former Tory Prime Minister more effective at attacking a Tory government than a Labour shadow chancellor?"" Another walked out 15 minutes before the end muttering ""they'll still be droning on this time tomorrow"". Mr McDonnell used his briefing to Labour MPs to set out what his priorities will be in response to Wednesday's Budget. Labour will have four themes they will question the government on: what they see as ""chronic low pay;"" a ""rigged economy in favour of the privileged few;"" social care, where ""one million people are going without the care they need"" and ""ensuring the economy works for women."" Referring to Mr Corbyn's recent publication of his most recent tax return, a source said Mr McDonnell ""has a genuine worry for democracy in this country"" since ""the prime minister and chancellor have still not published their tax returns."" ""You have a level of transparency at the top of the Labour Party that you don't have in government.""

"This video can not be played Georgina Tomassi: ""I'm 18 and in a class with 15-year-olds"" Almost 80% of pupils in England who do not achieve a C grade in GCSE maths or English fail to attain this mark during their resits. It is leaving hundreds of thousands of students stuck in a cycle of exams. ""I've failed my maths GCSE four times. It's horrible because you feel like you're stupid. ""You feel like there's something wrong with you. I'm 18, and I'm being put into a class with 15-year-olds,"" Georgina Tomassi tells theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. She is desperate to achieve a grade C in maths, after missing out by just a few marks on more than one occasion. In 2013, the government introduced a policy that said students in England who fail to get a grade C or above in GCSE maths or English should carry on studying the subject, or subjects, until the age of 18, with the aim of achieving this mark. It means hundreds of thousands of pupils like Georgina - who is also studying for A-levels in drama and health and social care - are taking resits up to twice an academic year. Figures from the Department for Education show that 77.3% of students in England do not attain a C grade in English or maths when they resit the exam post-16. ""You've got to keep going because I need it to get a job and get into university,"" she says. ""I'm so close and it's so frustrating."" At Tolworth Girls' School's sixth form, in Kingston upon Thames in south-west London, Georgina and her friends are taught resit classes, but the teachers' busy timetables mean they are limited to just a couple of hours per week. Chloe Gatt, the school's head of English, says budget strains mean it is difficult to find enough staff to cover those teaching the extra lessons. Were she not teaching the resit class, she would probably be with her Year 7 or 8 pupils, or her A-level students, she says. City College Norwich offers vocational courses to students At City College Norwich, just under half of all new students arrive without a C grade in maths or English. The college's head of school for GCSEs, English and maths, Ray Cameron-Goodman, says it has seen a 440% rise in the number of students taking a GCSE in the past few years. ""In terms of staffing resource, that comes to many hundreds of thousands of pounds every year,"" he explains. Then there is the amount spent on entering each pupil for their resit exam - usually more than Â£30 per paper - and extra, hidden costs. Because it has so many pupils retaking exams, City College Norwich has to hire Norfolk Showground, one of the largest indoor spaces in the county. The college hires Norfolk Showground for pupils to take exams ""The cost of the showground alone is about Â£50,000 - then there's the cost of the transport, the first aiders, the catering,"" Mr Cameron-Goodman explains. The Association of Colleges says that in England last year, one in five colleges planned to hire external venues to cope with the numbers. Two-thirds of colleges were forced to take on extra short-term staff to teach those taking resits, it adds. Colleges say there is no additional funding from the government to cover such costs. Josh wants to become a bricklayer For some pupils, the resits can feel like an unwelcome distraction. City College Norwich offers many vocational subjects, such as cooking, photography and hairdressing. Josh Bennett, 16, is retaking English. When he leaves education, he hopes to work as a bricklayer. ""I'm more of a hands-on sort of person.  I've got eight out of nine distinctions in this course so far. ""I find it very difficult sitting behind a desk and doing something like [studying Shakespeare]. I'd rather be outside and laying bricks, laying concrete - and I'm good at it."" Ryan is studying photography Ryan Eves, aged 20, has taken his English GCSE five times without achieving the elusive C grade. ""It's almost a slight bit of torture. They know that some people just don't get English. ""I've tried so hard just to get a letter on a piece of paper."" Ryan has now been offered an unconditional place at university, and no longer needs a C in English - a fact he describes as ""annoying"", having spent so much time on the subject. Mr Cameron-Goodman says the government's policy is ""a fantastic thing in principle"", but is calling for an alternative set of GCSE qualifications to be made available to students who are consistently unable to reach the required C grades. Ray Cameron-Goodman says the exam system is not designed for every pupil to achieve a C grade He says it is wrong to expect every pupil to achieve this mark, as the exam system is not built in this way. ""There is an expectation by the exam boards themselves that a number of students will not pass the examination, and will not pass the examination no matter how many times they resit that examination, so the two things aren't sitting well together."" A Department for Education spokesman said it was ""developing credible, high-quality options for students through reforming Functional Skills qualifications in maths and English, to make sure that they deliver the knowledge and skills that employers need, and consequently have credibility and prestige in the jobs market"".

"Tarik Hassane: One of the most recent and dangerous plotters Assistant commissioner Mark Rowley, of the Metropolitan Police, the UK's most senior counter-terrorism police officer, has used a speech to make a renewed call for public help to counter threats. He says there have been13 disrupted terror plots since 2013. It's a complex figure because there haven't been 13 specific trials before the courts in which individuals have been shown to be involved in attack planning. That doesn't, however, mean the figure is wrong - far from it. It's all to do with the difference between criminal evidence, leading to a conviction, and secret intelligence that the police and others can use to stop something from happening. Nadir Syed used encrypted online chats to share gory videos from so-called Islamic State There are prosecutions where it's really obvious what has been going on, but every now and then I and colleagues see cases where there's a whiff of something spooky in the background that we can't get to the bottom of. Those cases are usually the ones where it starts to become clear that the security services thought they were on to something but the secret intelligence assessments - perhaps from a hacked device or credible informant - couldn't be supported in open court by evidence. Sometimes the police intervene early in a case out of fear of losing track of a target. In these cases, the conviction on a lesser offence isn't regarded as a failure - it's still a ""disruption"" - and that's sometimes the most they can hope for. So, in the absence of an official list, here are some of the cases that have most concerned the police in recent years: Nadir Syed, 23, of west London, was convicted of preparing tocarry out an attack in 2014inspired by the self-styled Islamic State group, which evidence suggested would have targeted a poppy seller or someone else linked to Remembrance Sunday. The same autumn saw the arrest of two students from west London who were later jailed for plotting to kill police or soldiers ina drive-by shootingusing a moped. We also saw the conviction of a delivery driver from Luton who planned torun over a member of the US militaryoutside one of the two air bases used by its air force in Suffolk. Boy S, who cannot be identified, was sentenced to life in prison at Manchester Crown Court. One of the most serious recent cases led toBritain's youngest ever convicted terrorist- ""Boy S"", from Blackburn. When aged 14, he had attempted to incite a man in Australia to kill soldiers. In March 2015, a teenager who planned to behead a British soldier was jailed in a case thathighlighted the speed of his radicalisation. Other less complex cases included a 19-year-old jailed forgrooming a vulnerable young manto kill UK soldiers and a returnee from Syria whom the Crown Prosecution service said was""preparing or planning an act of terrorism"",external. Three operations involved intelligence that indicated either substantial research and collection of materials required for bomb-making - or testing of a potential device. A further two were complex operations in which the suspects talked about high-profile targets. And all of these cases exclude the activity of members of Northern Ireland paramilitary groups - the threat from those individuals is officially classed as ""severe"". And, separately, there is increasing concern from police in some parts of the country about the rise of extreme far-right/neo-Nazi grooming for violence.

"The Astra is made at Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port plant Vauxhall and Opel are being sold to the company that owns Peugeot and Citroen for 2.2bn euros (Â£1.9bn). We look at the logic behind the deal. In a word - profit. Or more accurately as far as GM Europe is concerned, 18 years of losses. The last time the US carmaker's European business, which houses Germany's Opel and the UK's Vauxhall, made a profit was in 1999. Although the division's boss, Karl-Thomas Neumann, pledged to return to growth in 2016, the operation ended up reporting a loss of $300m (Â£245m). Both Vauxhall and Opel have been part of General Motors for nearly 100 years. GM bought UK business Vauxhall in 1925 for $2.5m. It acquired a majority stake in Germany's Opel in 1929 and bought the remaining shares in 1931. Both brands' share of the European market has been shrinking for some time. In 1990, they held a combined 11.5%, but by 2016 this had fallen to 6.5%, according to carsalesbase.com. Carlos Tavares, chairman of PSA Group In 2012, PSA was close to collapse. Under boss Carlos Tavares it has been revitalised, and the GM Europe deal will allow him to overtake his previous employer, Renault, to become Europe's second largest carmaker. The takeover will give PSA access to the UK market where demand for its Peugeot and Citroen cars has been poor in the past. Most importantly, Mr Tavares has already said he wants to go back to the US, which Citroen left in 1974 and Peugeot exited in 1991. It is now more likely that PSA will use Opel to make the push into the US using the ""halo effect"" of German carmakers. However, it is not clear how PSA will navigate US President Donald Trump who has threatened German manufacturers with an import tax of 35%. Vauxhall has been making cars for more than 100 years Since the early 1980s, Vauxhall cars have been more or less identical to Opel but just branded differently. A large number of Vauxhall vehicles sold in the UK are made in Opel's German, Spanish and Polish factories and given the British brand. Whereas a high proportion of models made in Britain are exported overseas and rebadged as Opel. GM has kept Vauxhall in Britain ""because it is woven into the fabric of British motoring history,"" says a company spokesman, who points out that it is the country's oldest surviving carmaker. It built its first car in 1903 and continued to make vehicles throughout both world wars. GM Europe employs more than 38,000 people. Of these, 4,500 are at Vauxhall's plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton in the UK and the rest spread across Germany, Poland, Hungary, Austria, Spain and Italy. On top of that, Matthias Holweg, scientific adviser to the Automotive Council, says that every car plant job supports about seven and a half jobs in the wider supply chain. Reports suggest PSA Group will guarantee the production of the Vauxhall Astra at Ellesmere Port, which is due to run until 2021, and the Vivaro van in Luton, which is expected to be made until 2025. Following these production runs, however, there has been no comment on the medium- and long-term future of the plants. While Europe will gain a new carmaking giant - PSA will be second only to Volkswagen - the future is much less certain for the UK. Cars sales have been robust in the UK. According to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, new car registrations rose by 1.8% to 257,679 in the year to February, following record growth in 2016. Despite this, Vauxhall could feel the brunt of cost reductions under its new owner. It is cheaper to cut jobs in Britain, according to Prof John Colley from Warwick Business School, who says redundancy costs are three times more expensive in Germany. Last week, it emerged thatFord could cut more than 1,000 jobsat its Bridgend plant in Wales. And while Prime Minister Theresa May intervened to ensure that Nissan will build new Qashqai and X-trail models at its plant in Sunderland, Koji Tsuruoka, Japan's ambassador in London, has warned that car companies could leave if post-Brexit tariffs hit profitability. In Europe, vehicle registrations rose by 6.5% to 15.1 million vehicles last year, according to European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, which is the highest level since a peak in 2007. However, the association predicts growth will slow to 1% this year, with elections in Germany, France and the Netherlands adding to uncertainty.

"It's well known that soldiers can suffer from post-traumatic stress after their experiences on the battlefield - but the effect this has on their families is rarely discussed. Matthew Green describes how one woman was finally able to help her husband find effective treatment after he twice smashed up their home with an axe. When his daughter Grace sank shin-deep into the mud at Merseyside's Crosby Beach, Keith Collard seemed surprisingly reluctant to wade to her rescue. An imposing, taciturn man who had served 14 years in the army, Keith was normally fiercely protective of his family: so much so that he'd rig Grace up with a live microphone to keep track of her while she was playing outside their home near Bolton. On that summer's day, with his daughter crying out for help, Keith seemed oddly absent. It was only later that he confessed to his wife, Toni, that the scene had reawakened his memories of the 1990-1991 Gulf War. To Keith, the black strands of seaweed trailed across the beach looked like tufts of human hair. ""If he goes on the sand he is convinced there are bodies under the sand,"" says Toni. ""It's too much for him."" With a rueful smile, she adds: ""Seychelles â never going to happen."" In 2001, Keith was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a condition that can cause symptoms ranging from crippling anxiety and explosive anger to flashbacks and emotional numbing. With the right care, many survivors make good recoveries. Left untreated, people can grow so desperate that taking their own life starts to feel like the only way out. Since the Iraq invasion in 2003, the Ministry of Defence has funded large-scale studies by the King's Centre for Military Health Research to determine the extent of PTSD and other mental ill health such as anxiety, depression and alcoholism in the forces. Broadly, the results suggest that a minority of combat troops suffer from such conditions, but that they may be significantly more common than in the civilian population. Far fewer resources have been devoted to assessing the impact of war on military families, some of whom are only now starting to confront the aftershocks of years of intense operations in Afghanistan. Thousands of others are still grappling with the legacies of the Falklands, Northern Ireland, Bosnia and other deployments most of the UK has long since forgotten. As many of these families have discovered, the insidious symptoms of PTSD can corrode even the strongest relationships. Men and women who cannot switch off the vigilance and aggression that kept them alive in a war zone can seem to bear scant resemblance to the confident and resourceful soldiers their partners fell in love with. Listen toThe Enemy Within, produced by Matthew Green and Eleanor McDowall, a Radio 3 documentaryon the BBC iPlayer In families with children, couples must weigh the agonising dilemma of whether to bear the pain of separation or stay together and do their best to shield sons and daughters from the volcanic atmosphere ruling their home. Some children or teenagers may themselves suffer anxiety or start self-harming â the effects of what psychologists call ""secondary trauma"". ""Either you divorce or you get help,"" says Toni. ""There's an unwritten rule that I'm only here while he's getting treatment or he's stable. When a family and children are involved, that has to be a deal-breaker."" Like many military families confronting PTSD, Toni, Keith and 15-year-old Grace - who live in a quiet area with sweeping views of the West Pennine Moors - have taken years to reach the point where they feel comfortable in sharing their experiences publicly. They told me their story in the hope that it would shine a light on the private battles being fought by thousands of other families. Keith (right) served in the 1990-91 Gulf War When Toni and Keith first met, she had no idea of the turmoil bottled up inside him. Having left the army in 1993, he had ended up working as a security guard at a stationery shop in Manchester, where Toni was employed as a sales assistant. Toni noticed that he always seemed to be spoiling for a fight with shoplifters - he had boxed in the army - but he treated her like a perfect gentleman. ""At that point I didn't realise how bad Keith was,"" says Toni, 45, who went on to set up a successful ironing business in Bolton. ""After a while you realise there are these lows that aren't right."" Keith, 53, says it took him years to suspect that he might be suffering from the after-effects of his tours overseas. ""I just put it down to my personality: I got angry at things I shouldn't get angry at. I didn't know I was ill,"" he says. He had heard of PTSD, he says, but always associated it with Vietnam veterans and drug users. Veterans with PTSD often suffer from a condition known as hyper-vigilance â meaning their brain and nervous systems react to everyday stresses on hometown streets or in the supermarket checkout queue with the kind of hair-trigger response more suited to a firefight. Toni says Keith's permanent state of red alert, though it weighed heavily on the family, served him well in his job in the private security industry. He would go for days without sleeping then crash in their bedroom, sometimes refusing to leave the house for weeks. Toni found her life began to revolve around managing her husband's moods and steering him away from triggers that rekindled his worst memories: the smell of burning rubber, the whirr of a helicopter or walking on sand. The overriding imperative of protecting Keith forced Toni to be especially strict with Grace and her son from a previous relationship. ""I've always had to be so firm, to make sure she toes the line because we can't have the kids acting up in a PTSD house,"" Toni says. As a young child, Grace learned that if she wanted to speak to her father she had to knock on the bedroom door and open it very slowly. She had a ready-made excuse if her friends wanted to visit: Keith kept two highly trained Rottweilers named Zeus and Sky. The dogs did double duty, providing him with rare moments of solace and encouraging strangers to keep their distance. Grace: ""The whole day would be based around how Dad was feeling"" ""No matter what day I'd had at school, the whole day would be based around when I got home, how dad was feeling,"" says Grace. ""He'd sit in his room for a week, and he wouldn't even come downstairs any more. I'd come upstairs and be like: 'How are you?' and he'd not really acknowledge me. I didn't know whether to apologise or to be angry at him."" In the early 2000s, Toni managed to persuade Keith to seek help and he went on to attend several two-week residential courses at Combat Stress, a veterans' mental health charity. As they learned more about PTSD, Toni and Keith did their best to help Grace make sense of his condition by calling it ""Mr Grumpy"". ""When he needs to be left alone, when he is quite aggressive, when he is rude, I used to take Grace away and say: 'Oh, it's Mr Grumpy, we need to give him some Daddy space,'"" Toni says. The stays at Combat Stress helped, but Keith still lived in fear of losing control of his anger. Experts believe that the difficulties some people with PTSD have in managing their aggression may be linked to changes in the brain that happen as a result of psychological trauma. Viewed from this perspective, far from being ""all in the mind"", the condition is as much a physical injury as a gunshot wound, albeit one buried inside the skull. On one occasion, when Toni had managed to persuade Keith to go on a family holiday at a hotel in Turkey, he dropped Grace off at a kids' club. When he returned a few hours later to collect his daughter, she did not appear to be among the gaggle of youngsters. Gripped by panic, he started shouting at security to lock down the complex - his whole body snapping into what he calls ""action-on"" mode. Toni was powerless to calm him down until Grace was discovered shortly afterwards in a nearby bathroom. Other incidents had more serious consequences. Keith once became so furious that he grabbed an axe and began smashing up the house. Toni fled with the children until he came to his senses and called the police himself. He laid the axe on a table and opened the front door to find armed officers bearing riot shields. ""I've come home to armed response in the street,"" Toni says. ""When the police have finally let me in, my bath panel has been kicked in and my loft hatch has been ripped out because they're looking for the bodies of my children and me, because they think that he's done something. How do you explain that to the children? ""The second time, he smashed up the house after we'd gone. Everything, lovely wooden furniture - gone. When I got home, the police were at the house and he was already in the back of a police van. And a lovely policeman came up to me and said: 'He doesn't need to be in a cell, he needs a hospital, doesn't he?' And I said: 'Yeah, he does.' ""So they took him to the hospital. The hospital put him in a taxi and sent him home because there was no crisis team on to help him. ""We received a call the next day saying: 'Did I want to be seen by the domestic violence unit?' and I said: 'No, I just want some help for my husband.'"" NHS Choices,external Combat Stress,external Mind: Understanding PTSD,external In 2009, Toni reluctantly decided to give up her ironing business, which had grown to employ 13 people, because she was afraid to leave Keith by himself. She forged a second career as a self-employed actors' agent, so she wouldn't have to leave the house. Toni says one of her greatest sources of solace came from joining a network of military carers called Combat PTSD Angels, one of a number of support groups that have mushroomed across the UK. Started six years ago, the organisation now has more than 350 members, who campaign for better services and offer comfort and advice to newcomers, who often do not know where to turn. While Toni did eventually find an NHS mental health nurse who was able to help Keith, the strain began to tell on Grace. Late last year she suffered such severe bouts of anxiety and nausea that she began to miss school and was even forced temporarily to abandon her singing and acting classes - the only activities that had allowed her to push the tensions at home out of her mind. ""It felt like I was in a bubble, and everyone else was doing their own thing and I was isolated from it all,"" Grace says. ""But it wasn't a nice little bubble - it was horrible."" Grace and Keith Grace has since been feeling much better and, in calmer moments, the family is able to reflect on how their shared confrontation with PTSD has strengthened their bond. Keith acknowledges that however much he had wanted to protect his loved ones, he owes his life to Toni. By sharing his story for the first time, he hopes to encourage other ex-servicemen and women struggling as he once did to open up sooner. ""If you haven't got the support of family and friends when you're not in your right mind, you've got no chance of helping yourself,"" he says. ""At first it was very embarrassing: I used to be a roughy-toughy squaddie, I'd fight anybody and do anything. I do find it difficult to accept it, but I will speak to anybody about it."" While Keith is still not entirely comfortable around sand, the family is feeling confident enough to attempt another holiday this summer, this time in Jersey. ""I think that I've been really lucky that he's always been willing to engage with some kind of treatment and get some help. That's the biggie,"" Toni says. ""Your life changes and it comes with good and bad. There are things we can't do, but it's made him much more loveable.""

"IOC president Thomas Bach must find a way to restore credibility in the Olympic bidding process after Budapest became the fourth city to withdraw Back in September 2013 I interviewed an emotional Thomas Bach in Buenos Aires a few minutes after the German had become the most powerful man in sport. The newly elected International Olympic Committee (IOC) president confidently told me that after a successful reign by his predecessor Jacques Rogge, the Olympic movement neededmere evolution. But as we approach four years of Bach's leadership - and with fresh hosting, doping and corruption controversies affecting confidence in his organisation - the demands for an Olympic revolution are growing louder by the day. Therecent withdrawalof Budapest's bid to stage the 2024 Games - the fourth city to pull out of the race - is highly embarrassing for the IOC and seems to have left the Olympics at a crossroads, in desperate need of a new vision. And the knock-on effects of this latest blow to Bach could be extremely significant: a possible double announcement of hosts for both the 2024 and 2028 Games; and perhaps making it more likely that the IOC takes the unprecedented step of banning Russia from the next Winter Olympics, if that is deemed necessary to restore credibility at this critical time. Budapest drop bid to host 2024 Games Rio 2016 vote rig claims investigated Fireworks explode over the Arc de Triomphe to celebrate Paris' 2024 Olympic Games bid Despite reported opposition from within the IOC, it seems increasingly likely that when its members meet in Lima in September to decide which of the two remaining bidders, Los Angeles or Paris, is awarded the Games, the loser will be told it can host the following edition four years later. This assumes the runner-up for 2024 will actually want to play host in 2028 of course - or indeed be able to. Neither is certain. Plans and partnerships for both bids are based on the cities hosting the event in 2024, and delaying these by another four years may not be possible. But with the IOC now admitting that without recent reforms it could have suffered the ignominy of having no bidders, it seems sensible to try to strike some kind of two-Games deal. So, why are potential host cities turning their backs on the Games, and how much jeopardy is the Olympics really now in? Hamburg says 'no' to Olympic bid Rome withdraws 2024 bid In 2014, after six cities had decided not to bid for the 2022 Winter Games - leaving just Almaty and Beijing to choose from - Bach hailed hisAgenda 2020 reforms,externalas the answer, designed to encourage flexible and cheaper bids from more potential hosts. Yet three years on, here we are again, with just two bidders left for the 2024 summer Games. Earlier this month, a referendum in the Swiss canton of Graubuenden, which contains the cities of Davos and St Moritz, ensured there would be no bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics. The recent bleak images of Rio's abandoned and crumbling Olympic venues already falling into disrepair, just a few months after they hosted the city's iconic but chaotic Games, has reinforced fears that the size and cost of the global mega-event is out of control and places too great a burden on host cities. At the same time, in London, an investigation is now under way into the spiralling costs of the 2012 Olympic stadium, now approaching Â£800m. Meanwhile, in Tokyo, there are renewed concerns that the budget for the 2020 Games could leap to Â£21bn, four times the initial estimate, despite recent effort to rein in costs, with the city's governor, Yuriko Koike, admitting she had no idea how much money will eventually be spent on the event. No wonder, perhaps, that Boston, Hamburg, Rome and now Budapest have all rejected the chance to stage the 2024 Games. The IOC has blamed local politics for the withdrawal of the Hungarian capital, although Bach will hope to turn it to his advantage and use it to strengthen his case for more reforms. Six months after the Rio Games, the Aquatics Centre looks deserted as the specially created tapestries lay strewn across the pavement Bach's latest idea is a change to the rules to allow cities bidding for the second time to pay less than those making their first attempt. Bach told German magazineStuttgart Nachrichten,externalthat it was unfair to judge Rio's Olympic legacy so soon, and urged critics not to underestimate the transport and environmental benefits the Games had left the Brazilian city, while also reminding them of the regeneration of east London in recent years. So as they enter the final crucial few months of campaigning, which of the two remaining candidate cities are most likely to benefit from Budapest's withdrawal and get to run the first leg of a possible 2024/2028 relay? Some observers believe it has merely reinforced Paris' status as favourites. Given just how hard it clearly now is to attract bidders from Europe,sponsorship expert Tim Crow argues,externalthat it is easy to see why the IOC would be loathe to risk further alienating more potential candidates by rejecting the iconic capital for a third consecutive time - especially for 2024, which will mark 100 years since Paris last hosted the Games. Add to this the obvious consternation caused in some Olympic circles by US President Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric - and his recent travel ban - and Paris seems a logical choice. Others disagree, however.Journalist Alan Abrahamson,externalargues that the IOC must now turn away from government-backed bids based on large infrastructure or regeneration projects, where taxpayers often end up paying the price when budgets spiral out of control, and instead go for privately funded alternatives. And that, he insists, means Los Angeles. Unlike in Paris, where 1.5bn euros of public investment is being spent on the construction of an athletes' village and a new aquatics centre, 97% of the American city's major facilities are already built, the kind of sustainability that Bach's Agenda 2020 is meant to be encouraging more of. It has also not escaped attention that Etienne Thobois, the head of the Paris 2024 bid, was a key consultant for Tokyo 2020 - a bid whose original cost estimates now appear wildly optimistic. And at a time when the IOC is desperate to tackle ageing audiences, become more relevant among younger sports fans, and reboot the troubled Olympic brand, California's global reputation for digital technology and enterprise could make sense. It would also please the IOC's most lucrative broadcast partner, NBC, and its sponsors, most of which are based in the US. In what is becoming a fascinating dilemma for the IOC, there are various other factors at play. There is the possibility of anti-American resentment from some in the Olympic community at the US Anti-Doping Agency's (Usada) criticism of the IOC's failure to ban Russia from the Rio Games for state-sponsored doping. Usada is now one of the leading voices pushing for an overhaul of the anti-doping system, demanding a better resourced and independent World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) with real sanctioning powers. A US congressional hearing recently questioned the IOC's medical and scientific director Richard Budgett on anti-doping, with some wondering if the scrutiny could harm Los Angeles' chances. But could all that be offset by the possible election of far-right politician Marine le Pen in the French presidential election in May? And could the continued threat of terrorism in France also damage Paris prospects? All will be revealed in Lima in September. But before then, an even bigger decision must be taken by the IOC - on Russia. Despite recent admissions from Wada that there may not be sufficient evidence in last year's damningMcLaren reportto bring sanctions against certain Russian athletes, and the slow progress of two separate IOC investigations into the scandal, many want the IOC to now do what they failed to do last summer and ban the entire Russian team from Pyeongchang 2018. My understanding is that despite the obvious threat of a major rift with Russia if such a step is taken, the argument is finally gaining traction among the upper echelons of the IOC, and there is a growing acceptance that it could help demonstrate some leadership at a time when it desperately needs to restore credibility. This video can not be played Lord Coe tells Today that Russian athletes could be competing again 'by the end of the year' The samples of more than 100 athletes from Beijing 2008 and London 2012 have now shown up as positive in retesting, and dozens of medals have been stripped. The IOC is trying to show it has teeth after all, and it may conclude that banning Russia would be the ultimate way of proving the point. All this comes at a crucial time for the IOC, a time of both opportunity and challenge. On the one hand, it appears in rude health. Despite continuing concerns over China's human rights record, Bach recently hailed the signing of a ground-breaking six-Games partnership worth a potential $1bn with Chinese conglomerate Alibaba, another major boost to its constantly growing revenues. The Olympic channel has now been broadcasting for several months, signing deals with 47 federations to televise their sports. Last week, the Sports and Rights Alliance welcomed the IOC's decision to incorporate human rights principles in itsrevised host city contract.,external On the other, however, Bach has faced scrutiny for his organisation's role in the alleged ticket-touting scandal that saw Irish IOC executive Pat Hickey arrested in Rio and detained for five months. And now an IOC ethics committee is having to look into allegations that vote-buying helped secure the 2016 Games for Rio after a French newspaper reported that a Brazilian businessman made payments to Papa Massata Diack, son of disgraced former IOC member Lamine Diack, just before the crucial vote in 2009, and that current IOC member Frankie Fredericks also received money. Frederick denies wrongdoing, while Diack Jr has refused to comment. But with French police already investigating payments made by the Tokyo 2020 bid to an account linked to the Diacks, the list of Games tainted by allegations of corruption is growing. It is against this backdrop that the IOC is now operating - and being judged. Budapest's withdrawal from the race to stage the next Games is far from being the only headache it has to contend with right now. But at a time when the IOC's reputation is on the line, the ramifications of this latest snub could be felt well beyond its headquarters in Lausanne. And especially in Los Angeles, Paris and in Moscow.

"This week's Budget will be Philip Hammond's first Clear your diary, get the popcorn in, check you are sitting comfortably - it is almost time for one of the biggest political moments in any year. It is Budget week. Like every year, decisions the chancellor makes will have an immediate impact on people's lives and livelihoods. Tweaks to the new system of business rates will soften the impact to some firms who are hit by the steepest rises. An expected top up of a billion or so pounds for the social care system could help alleviate the worst pressure on the service that is struggling in many parts of the country. The announcements already made about money being allocated to technical education could have a significant impact on millions of young people, in the years to come. But decisions that the chancellor does not make - continuing with planned cuts and benefit freezes for example - will also affect millions of people. This Budget is also special because it is the last Spring Budget of its kind, and the chancellor's first. Philip Hammond is moving the main Budget to the autumn. There will no longer be two big fiscal events every year - no more Autumn Statement and spring Budget, just a major autumn Budget. And sources close to the chancellor suggest this Budget is not the place to look for big moves, big changes, or big radical changes. One minister told me: ""It won't be a show fest."" Another said: ""It's a smaller Budget, although smaller Budgets are actually harder."" Philip Hammond has no intention of flashing any cash, even though the levels of borrowing are expected to be slightly less scary than predicted at the Autumn Statement. Treasury sources are more optimistic now of being able to do a Brexit trade deal than some months ago. But there is still a view in Number 11 that the journey to the exit could involve economic headaches, so it makes sense not to allocate every potentially available penny - in case money is needed to ease the pain later on.

"Robert Wang and a friend came up with the idea for the product Robert Wang was hoping to make it easier for people to make a decent meal, but didn't expect his new product to attract a cult following. Last summer on Amazon Prime Day, the online retailer's global 24-hour annual sale event, one of the top-selling products in the US was a multi-function electric cooker. The item in question is called the Instant Pot, and more than 215,000 of them were snapped up in the US on that single day. The fact that this countertop appliance was outselling TVs and tablets may come as a surprise to many people, but not to its legions of dedicated fans, who express unabashed adoration. ""If you look at the Amazon reviews, one common word is 'love',"" says Mr Wang. ""Americans are very open with their emotions. Love is all over the place. Another one is that 'Instant Pot changed my life'. ""That's actually rewarding to us - understanding that we have created value for society."" The Instant Pot has built up an online fanbase First available to buy in 2010, the Instant Pot has become a veritable craze, a success built through social media word-of-mouth instead of traditional TV or print advertising. Today, the official Instant Pot Facebook group is nearly 398,000-people strong, and there are thousands of other online enthusiasts. Fans share recipes online and tips for making everything from soups, stews and chilli, to poached eggs, popcorn and cheesecake in the appliance. Mr Wang says that from the beginning the intention was to let the product speak for itself, and build up sales thanks to customer recommendations rather than pay for advertising. He describes this as the ""build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door"" marketing strategy. The Instant Pot is the brainchild of Mr Wang and his friend Yi Qin, who are both veterans of the Canadian technology sector. Mr Wang had worked for the now-defunct telecoms group Nortel, while Mr Qin had been employed by Blackberry. They were brainstorming ideas for a new project in 2008 and realised people were searching for the same solution they were - a way to cook healthy meals for a family quickly and affordably. Fans of the Instant Pot post recipes and photos online That was when their attention turned to kitchen appliances and rebooting the pressure cooker. They came up with the idea for the Instant Pot, which is a pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker, steamer, saute pan, yogurt maker, warming pot all-in-one unit. Together with three other partners, they set up a business called Double Insight in Ottawa, the Canadian capital, and the first version of Instant Pot was born in 2010. ""We have tried to automate cooking as much as possible and tried to simplify the cooker,"" says Mr Qin, who is the firm's vice president of product management. ""One press of the button can cook the meal for the family."" Yi Qin says that from day one they wanted the product to be as easy as possible to use The product was, however, not an immediate success. Mr Qin says that one problem was the ""stigma"" surrounding one of the Instant Pot's main functions: the fact that it can be used as a pressure cooker, which had long since fallen out of favour in North American kitchens. ""Most people have some concept of urban legends of exploding pressure cookers in their grandmother's kitchens,"" says Mr Qin. He says they addressed the issue by making product safety a design priority, and making the Instant Pot as foolproof to use as possible. Thanks to word of mouth, sales were growing well by 2013 when Amazon started to sell the product, and sales shot up further. ""Amazon is a very practical company,"" says Mr Qin. ""They didn't approach us until they saw that the [upward sales] trend had already formed."" The online buzz surrounding the Instant Pot has been helped by food bloggers enthusiastically talking about the product, and sharing recipes, with their followers. Some of these bloggers buy their own Instant Pot, while Double Insight gives the cookers to others to test out. One early challenge was convincing customers the Instant Pot was safer than their grandmother's pressure cooker Laura Pazzaglia, from website Hip Pressure Cooking, says that she is not surprised by the gadget's success. ""Everybody who has an Instant Pot, they tell three friends about it,"" she says. ""If you keep going like that, obviously you can't help but succeed."" Today Double Insight remains a small business with just 25 employees, contracting out the manufacture of the product to a factory in China. While the Instant Pot is facing increasing competition from rival products made by much larger appliance companies such as Breville and Black & Decker, Ms Pazzaglia says that Instant Pot's early start and vast online following gives it an edge. Food bloggers like Laura Pazzaglia helped promote the product Zeynep Arsel, associate professor of marketing at Montreal's Concordia University, says that the Instant Pot resonates with the trend towards healthy but uncomplicated food, and is boosted by ""a textbook perfect buzz marketing campaign"". She adds: ""Cooking is a social and emotional practice that creates a lot of meaning in our lives. ""So a product that takes centre stage in cooking practices also creates a sense of attachment by being an agent in our social and emotional lives."" With the Instant Pot now on to its fourth iteration, its design development has been led by feedback and ideas submitted by users. With prices starting from $80 (Â£65) for the most basic model, the top-of-the-range $180 version can be controlled remotely via your mobile phone. ""This is not so much an Instant Pot story per se, this is every user's story,"" says Mr Qin. ""Whenever you have an Instant Pot product, you have a story to tell.""

"On a ramshackle pig farm near Wuxi, in Jiangsu province, China, a foreigner gets out of a taxi. The family are surprised. Their little farm is at the end of a bumpy track through rice paddies, and they do not get many foreigners asking to use the toilet. The stranger's name is Philip Lymbery, and he runs a campaigning group called Compassion in World Farming. As he explains in his book about intensive farming, he is not there to berate the farmers about their pigs' living conditions, although sows are crammed uncomfortably into crates. Mr Lymbery is there to investigate whether pig manure is polluting the local waterways. He has tried unsuccessfully to visit local large, commercial farms, so has turned up on spec at a family farm instead. The farmer is happy to talk. Yes, they dump waste in the river. No, they are not supposed to. But they just bribe the local official. Then, Mr Lymbery notices a pile of needles for antibiotics. Have they been prescribed by a vet? No, the farmer explains. You don't need a prescription to buy antibiotics. And anyway, vets are expensive. Antibiotics are cheap. The farmer has very little money, so she injects her pigs with them routinely, hoping it will stop them getting sick. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. She is far from alone. Cramped and dirty conditions on intensive farms are breeding grounds for disease. Routine, low antibiotic doses can help to stop it spreading. Antibiotics also fatten animals, which means more money for farmers. Scientists are studying gut microbes to understand why. No wonder more antibiotics are injected into healthy animals than sick humans. In the big emerging economies - where demand for meat grows as incomes rise -  use of agricultural antibiotics is set to double in 20 years. Widespread unnecessary use of antibiotics is not restricted to agriculture. Many doctors are guilty, too. They should know better - as should regulators who let people buy antibiotics over the counter. Meanwhile, bacteria are busily evolving resistance to drugs, and public health experts fearwe are entering a post-antibiotic age. Onerecent review estimated drug-resistant bugs could kill 10 million people a year by 2050- more than currently die from cancer. It is hard to put a monetary cost on antibiotics becoming useless, but the review tried: $1tn (Â£790bn). The story of antibiotics starts with a healthy dose of serendipity. A young man named Alexander Fleming had a boring job in shipping when his uncle died, leaving him enough money to resign and enrol at St Mary's Hospital Medical School in London instead. Sir Alexander Fleming was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1945 for his work on penicillin There, he became a valued member of the rifle club. The captain of the shooting team wanted to keep Fleming when his studies finished, so found him a job. That is how Fleming became a bacteriologist. One day in 1928, Fleming failed to tidy up his petri dishes before going back home to Scotland on holiday. On his return, he noticed one dish had become mouldy in his absence, and the mould was killing the bacteria he had used the dish to cultivate. Fleming tried to investigate further by making more mould, but he was not a chemist and could not work out how to make enough. He published his observations, but nobody paid attention. A decade passed, then more serendipity. In Oxford, Ernst Chain was flicking through back copies of medical journals when he chanced upon Fleming's old article. And Chain, a Jew who had fled Nazi Germany, was a chemist - a brilliant one. Chain and his colleague Howard Florey set about isolating and purifying enough penicillin for further experiments. This required hundreds of litres of mouldy fluid. Their colleague Norman Heatley rigged up a crazy-looking Heath Robinson system involving milk churns, baths, ceramic bedpans commissioned from a local pottery company, rubber tubes, drinks bottles and a doorbell. They employed six women to operate it - the ""penicillin girls"". Women working in Distillers penicillin laboratory in Liverpool, in March 1946 The first patient given an experimental dose was a 43-year-old policeman who had scratched his cheek pruning roses and developed septicaemia. Heatley's makeshift system could not produce penicillin quickly enough, and the policeman died. But, by 1945, penicillin - the first mass-produced antibiotic - was rolling off production lines. Chain, Florey and Fleming shared a Nobel Prize. And Fleming took the opportunity to issue a warning. ""It is not difficult,"" Fleming said, ""to make microbes resistant to penicillin in the laboratory by exposing them to concentrations not sufficient to kill them."" Fleming worried an ""ignorant man"" might under-dose himself, allowing drug-resistant bacteria to evolve. But ignorance hasn't been the problem. We know the risks, but face incentives to take them anyway. The first case of an infection that can resist the antibiotic of last resort has been detected in the US Suppose I feel ill. Perhaps it is viral, meaning antibiotics are useless. Even if it is bacterial, I will probably fight it off. But if there is any chance that antibiotics might speed my recovery, my incentive is to take them. Or suppose I run a pig farm. Giving routine low doses of antibiotics to my pigs is the perfect way to breed antibiotic-resistant bacteria. But that is not my problem. My only incentive is to care about whether dosing my pigs seems to increase my revenues by more than the cost of the drugs. This is a classic example of the tragedy of the commons, where individuals rationally pursuing their own interests ultimately create a collective disaster. Until the 1970s, scientists kept discovering new antibiotics: when bacteria evolved resistance to one type, we could introduce another. But then the development pipeline dried up. It is possible new antibiotics will start coming through again. Some researchers have come up with a promising new technique to find antimicrobial compounds in soil. How the barcode changed retailing The warrior monks who invented banking Why the falling cost of light matters How Ikea's Billy bookcase took over the world Again, though, this is all about incentives. What the world really needs is new antibiotics we put on the shelf and use only in the direst emergencies. But a product that does not get used is not much of a money spinner for drug companies. We need to devise better incentives to encourage more research. One attempt to do just that is called an ""advanced market commitment"", where donors promise to pay for doses of a medicine that does not yet exist. We will also need smarter regulations as to how new antibiotics are used, by doctors and farmers alike. Denmark shows it can be done - world-famous for its bacon, it strictly controls antibiotic use in pigs. One key appears to be improving other regulations to make farm animals' living conditions less cramped and unhygienic. That makes disease less likely to spread. And recent studies suggest that when animals are kept in better conditions, routine low doses of antibiotics have very little impact on their growth. The pig farmer in Wuxi meant well. She clearly did not understand the implications of overusing antibiotics. But even if she had, she would have faced the same economic incentives to overuse them. Ultimately, that is what needs to change. Tim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economyis broadcast on the BBC World Service.

"Kwei-Armah appeared in Casualty from 1999 to 2004 You may know Kwame Kwei-Armah best as the paramedic Finlay Newton in the BBC's Casualty. But it's 13 years since he left the television series and since then he's carved a hugely successful career in the theatre. His new stage show is about the reggae legend Bob Marley. But he insists, it is ""absolutely not"" a jukebox musical, where the songs take precedence over the plot. Kwei-Armah, the writer and director of One Love, The Bob Marley Musical, says it is not ""sing-a-long-a-Bob"", but ""a play with music"". He admitted though that it was a ""delicate"" balancing act trying to keep in enough songs the audience will recognise. So hits including No Woman No Cry, Jamming, Three Little Birds and Redemption Song are among 30 tracks that feature in the show. Rehearsals are taking place for the show, which opens on 10 March But One Love is not your usual musical hero, womb to tomb story. Instead it focuses on just three years in Marley's life and career, which Kwei-Armah says are ""very significant"" in ""understanding the hero's journey of the man."" Following an assassination attempt in 1976, the singer left his home in Jamaica and went to live in London in self imposed exile. While in England he recorded two of his biggest albums: Exodus and Kaya. Kwei-Armah said he wanted to get inside the mind of the man at that time and ""show a side of Bob that we don't often speak about."" ""Bob being a political songwriter, I wanted to look at what were the years when he was tested. What were the years when he might have doubted himself? And I found these years to be that."" Marley died of cancer in 1981 at the age of 36. Bob Marley's Facebook page has more than 70 million followers But interest in him shows no sign of diminishing. It is estimated he has sold more than 50 million albums around the world. Time declared Exodus the best album of the 20th Century in 1999. The same year the BBC named One Love the song of the millennium. His Facebook page has more than 70 million fans - and Marley is in the top 15 most popular pages on the social media site. For many, Bob Marley is an idol - a civil rights activist who spoke up for the poor and oppressed. But he was not a saint. And Kwai-Armah says he does not gloss over Marley's womanising and drug use. He says he portrays him ""warts and all"". He adds: ""I don't need any hero to be an angel."" Mitchell Brunings plays Bob Marley in the musical The singer Mitchell Brunings is playing the title role. Born in Surinam, but raised in The Netherlands, he was a backing vocalist in a Marley tribute band, before entering the Dutch equivalent of the television talent show, The Voice. He sang Redemption Song and his performance went viral on YouTube. As a result, Kwai-Armah cast him in the lead role. It is his UK stage debut and he is feeling the pressure to do Marley justice. ""He has a very big following, a lot of his followers are fanatical about their devotion to him, which I understand because I am one of his followers myself. I don't want to do anything to damage his image."" Kwai-Armah says Marley is portrayed ""warts and all"" in the show Marley's family has already given the show their blessing. His daughter Cedella has said: ""Birmingham is a natural place for its UK premiere. With its great mix of cultures, it's a city where my father performed to audiences that were captivated by his presence. ""We have no doubt that telling the story through music to a new generation in Birmingham will be part of his continuing legacy.""

"It's well known that soldiers can suffer from post-traumatic stress after their experiences on the battlefield - but the effect this has on their families is rarely discussed. Matthew Green describes how one woman was finally able to help her husband find effective treatment after he twice smashed up their home with an axe. When his daughter Grace sank shin-deep into the mud at Merseyside's Crosby Beach, Keith Collard seemed surprisingly reluctant to wade to her rescue. An imposing, taciturn man who had served 14 years in the army, Keith was normally fiercely protective of his family: so much so that he'd rig Grace up with a live microphone to keep track of her while she was playing outside their home near Bolton. On that summer's day, with his daughter crying out for help, Keith seemed oddly absent. It was only later that he confessed to his wife, Toni, that the scene had reawakened his memories of the 1990-1991 Gulf War. To Keith, the black strands of seaweed trailed across the beach looked like tufts of human hair. ""If he goes on the sand he is convinced there are bodies under the sand,"" says Toni. ""It's too much for him."" With a rueful smile, she adds: ""Seychelles â never going to happen."" In 2001, Keith was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a condition that can cause symptoms ranging from crippling anxiety and explosive anger to flashbacks and emotional numbing. With the right care, many survivors make good recoveries. Left untreated, people can grow so desperate that taking their own life starts to feel like the only way out. Since the Iraq invasion in 2003, the Ministry of Defence has funded large-scale studies by the King's Centre for Military Health Research to determine the extent of PTSD and other mental ill health such as anxiety, depression and alcoholism in the forces. Broadly, the results suggest that a minority of combat troops suffer from such conditions, but that they may be significantly more common than in the civilian population. Far fewer resources have been devoted to assessing the impact of war on military families, some of whom are only now starting to confront the aftershocks of years of intense operations in Afghanistan. Thousands of others are still grappling with the legacies of the Falklands, Northern Ireland, Bosnia and other deployments most of the UK has long since forgotten. As many of these families have discovered, the insidious symptoms of PTSD can corrode even the strongest relationships. Men and women who cannot switch off the vigilance and aggression that kept them alive in a war zone can seem to bear scant resemblance to the confident and resourceful soldiers their partners fell in love with.

""There's an unwritten rule that I'm only here while he's getting treatment or he's stable. When a family and children are involved, that has to be a deal-breaker."" Like many military families confronting PTSD, Toni, Keith and 15-year-old Grace - who live in a quiet area with sweeping views of the West Pennine Moors - have taken years to reach the point where they feel comfortable in sharing their experiences publicly. They told me their story in the hope that it would shine a light on the private battles being fought by thousands of other families. Keith (right) served in the 1990-91 Gulf War When Toni and Keith first met, she had no idea of the turmoil bottled up inside him. Having left the army in 1993, he had ended up working as a security guard at a stationery shop in Manchester, where Toni was employed as a sales assistant. Toni noticed that he always seemed to be spoiling for a fight with shoplifters - he had boxed in the army - but he treated her like a perfect gentleman. ""At that point I didn't realise how bad Keith was,"" says Toni, 45, who went on to set up a successful ironing business in Bolton. ""After a while you realise there are these lows that aren't right."" Keith, 53, says it took him years to suspect that he might be suffering from the after-effects of his tours overseas. ""I just put it down to my personality: I got angry at things I shouldn't get angry at. I didn't know I was ill,"" he says. He had heard of PTSD, he says, but always associated it with Vietnam veterans and drug users. Veterans with PTSD often suffer from a condition known as hyper-vigilance â meaning their brain and nervous systems react to everyday stresses on hometown streets or in the supermarket checkout queue with the kind of hair-trigger response more suited to a firefight. Toni says Keith's permanent state of red alert, though it weighed heavily on the family, served him well in his job in the private security industry. He would go for days without sleeping then crash in their bedroom, sometimes refusing to leave the house for weeks. Toni found her life began to revolve around managing her husband's moods and steering him away from triggers that rekindled his worst memories: the smell of burning rubber, the whirr of a helicopter or walking on sand. The overriding imperative of protecting Keith forced Toni to be especially strict with Grace and her son from a previous relationship. ""I've always had to be so firm, to make sure she toes the line because we can't have the kids acting up in a PTSD house,"" Toni says. As a young child, Grace learned that if she wanted to speak to her father she had to knock on the bedroom door and open it very slowly. She had a ready-made excuse if her friends wanted to visit: Keith kept two highly trained Rottweilers named Zeus and Sky. The dogs did double duty, providing him with rare moments of solace and encouraging strangers to keep their distance. Grace: ""The whole day would be based around how Dad was feeling"" ""No matter what day I'd had at school, the whole day would be based around when I got home, how dad was feeling,"" says Grace. ""He'd sit in his room for a week, and he wouldn't even come downstairs any more. I'd come upstairs and be like: 'How are you?' and he'd not really acknowledge me. I didn't know whether to apologise or to be angry at him."" In the early 2000s, Toni managed to persuade Keith to seek help and he went on to attend several two-week residential courses at Combat Stress, a veterans' mental health charity. As they learned more about PTSD, Toni and Keith did their best to help Grace make sense of his condition by calling it ""Mr Grumpy"". ""When he needs to be left alone, when he is quite aggressive, when he is rude, I used to take Grace away and say: 'Oh, it's Mr Grumpy, we need to give him some Daddy space,'"" Toni says. The stays at Combat Stress helped, but Keith still lived in fear of losing control of his anger. Experts believe that the difficulties some people with PTSD have in managing their aggression may be linked to changes in the brain that happen as a result of psychological trauma. Viewed from this perspective, far from being ""all in the mind"", the condition is as much a physical injury as a gunshot wound, albeit one buried inside the skull. On one occasion, when Toni had managed to persuade Keith to go on a family holiday at a hotel in Turkey, he dropped Grace off at a kids' club. When he returned a few hours later to collect his daughter, she did not appear to be among the gaggle of youngsters. Gripped by panic, he started shouting at security to lock down the complex - his whole body snapping into what he calls ""action-on"" mode. Toni was powerless to calm him down until Grace was discovered shortly afterwards in a nearby bathroom. Other incidents had more serious consequences. Keith once became so furious that he grabbed an axe and began smashing up the house. Toni fled with the children until he came to his senses and called the police himself. He laid the axe on a table and opened the front door to find armed officers bearing riot shields. ""I've come home to armed response in the street,"" Toni says. ""When the police have finally let me in, my bath panel has been kicked in and my loft hatch has been ripped out because they're looking for the bodies of my children and me, because they think that he's done something. How do you explain that to the children? ""The second time, he smashed up the house after we'd gone. Everything, lovely wooden furniture - gone. When I got home, the police were at the house and he was already in the back of a police van. And a lovely policeman came up to me and said: 'He doesn't need to be in a cell, he needs a hospital, doesn't he?' And I said: 'Yeah, he does.' ""So they took him to the hospital. The hospital put him in a taxi and sent him home because there was no crisis team on to help him. ""We received a call the next day saying: 'Did I want to be seen by the domestic violence unit?' and I said: 'No, I just want some help for my husband.'"" NHS Choices,external Combat Stress,external Mind: Understanding PTSD,external In 2009, Toni reluctantly decided to give up her ironing business, which had grown to employ 13 people, because she was afraid to leave Keith by himself. She forged a second career as a self-employed actors' agent, so she wouldn't have to leave the house. Toni says one of her greatest sources of solace came from joining a network of military carers called Combat PTSD Angels, one of a number of support groups that have mushroomed across the UK. Started six years ago, the organisation now has more than 350 members, who campaign for better services and offer comfort and advice to newcomers, who often do not know where to turn. While Toni did eventually find an NHS mental health nurse who was able to help Keith, the strain began to tell on Grace. Late last year she suffered such severe bouts of anxiety and nausea that she began to miss school and was even forced temporarily to abandon her singing and acting classes - the only activities that had allowed her to push the tensions at home out of her mind. ""It felt like I was in a bubble, and everyone else was doing their own thing and I was isolated from it all,"" Grace says. ""But it wasn't a nice little bubble - it was horrible."" Grace and Keith Grace has since been feeling much better and, in calmer moments, the family is able to reflect on how their shared confrontation with PTSD has strengthened their bond. Keith acknowledges that however much he had wanted to protect his loved ones, he owes his life to Toni. By sharing his story for the first time, he hopes to encourage other ex-servicemen and women struggling as he once did to open up sooner. ""If you haven't got the support of family and friends when you're not in your right mind, you've got no chance of helping yourself,"" he says. ""At first it was very embarrassing: I used to be a roughy-toughy squaddie, I'd fight anybody and do anything. I do find it difficult to accept it, but I will speak to anybody about it."" While Keith is still not entirely comfortable around sand, the family is feeling confident enough to attempt another holiday this summer, this time in Jersey. ""I think that I've been really lucky that he's always been willing to engage with some kind of treatment and get some help. That's the biggie,"" Toni says. ""Your life changes and it comes with good and bad. There are things we can't do, but it's made him much more loveable.""

"It's well known that soldiers can suffer from post-traumatic stress after their experiences on the battlefield - but the effect this has on their families is rarely discussed. Matthew Green describes how one woman was finally able to help her husband find effective treatment after he twice smashed up their home with an axe. When his daughter Grace sank shin-deep into the mud at Merseyside's Crosby Beach, Keith Collard seemed surprisingly reluctant to wade to her rescue. An imposing, taciturn man who had served 14 years in the army, Keith was normally fiercely protective of his family: so much so that he'd rig Grace up with a live microphone to keep track of her while she was playing outside their home near Bolton. On that summer's day, with his daughter crying out for help, Keith seemed oddly absent. It was only later that he confessed to his wife, Toni, that the scene had reawakened his memories of the 1990-1991 Gulf War. To Keith, the black strands of seaweed trailed across the beach looked like tufts of human hair. ""If he goes on the sand he is convinced there are bodies under the sand,"" says Toni. ""It's too much for him."" With a rueful smile, she adds: ""Seychelles â never going to happen."" In 2001, Keith was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a condition that can cause symptoms ranging from crippling anxiety and explosive anger to flashbacks and emotional numbing. With the right care, many survivors make good recoveries. Left untreated, people can grow so desperate that taking their own life starts to feel like the only way out. Since the Iraq invasion in 2003, the Ministry of Defence has funded large-scale studies by the King's Centre for Military Health Research to determine the extent of PTSD and other mental ill health such as anxiety, depression and alcoholism in the forces.

"Logan Eddy helped to test a pollution monitor The search for solutions to the threat of polluted air is generating ideas that range from the modest to the radical to the bizarre. A London primary school may issue face-masks to its pupils. The council in Cornwall may take the extreme step of moving people out of houses beside the busiest roads. Four major cities - Paris, Athens, Mexico City and Madrid - plan to ban all diesels by 2025. Stuttgart, in Germany, has already decided to block all but the most modern diesels on polluted days. In India's capital, Delhi, often choked with dangerous air, ajet engine may be deployedin an experimental and desperate attempt to create an updraft to disperse dirty air. The World Health Organizationcalculates,externalthat as many as 92% of the world's population are exposed to dirty air - but that disguises the fact that many different forms of pollution are involved. For the rural poor, it isfumes from cooking on wood or dung indoors,external. For shanty-dwellers in booming mega-cities, it is a combination of traffic exhaust, soot and construction dust. Delhi is one of the most polluted cities in the world In developed countries, it can be a mix of exhaust gas from vehicles and ammonia carried on the wind from the spraying of industrial-scale farms. In European cities, where people have been encouraged to buy fuel-efficient diesels to help reduce carbon emissions, the hazard is from the harmful gas nitrogen dioxide and tiny specks of pollution known as particulates. The first step is to understand exactly where the air is polluted and precisely how individuals are affected - and the results can be extremely revealing. Scientists at theUniversity of Leicester,externalare trialling a portable air monitor to gather precise data at a personal scale. We watched as volunteer, Logan Eddy, 14, carried the device in a specially adapted backpack that recorded details of the air he was exposed to. Exactly where he walked was then displayed as lines on an electronic map, the colour of those lines conveying how unhealthy the air was at different points. The monitor gives a readout of pollution during a journey It was much worse than WHO guidelines where he had waited to cross a busy junction, strikingly cleaner in a side-street but then almost off the scale in a sheltered spot beside an arcade of shops where a car was parked with its engine idling. Seeing a graphic display of how pollution can vary so dramatically changed Logan's view of air, and his friends adjusted their behaviour immediately. ""The people who found out have stopped waiting right near the buses after school for their friends,"" he says. ""They've been waitingâ¦ further away from the buses. ""It's obviously had an impact on them."" The personal monitor is one of a range of devices being deployed in Leicester to build up a detailed picture of where pollution hotspots form - and when. In many cases, they can be short-lived, appearing during rush-hours when traffic jams develop. For Prof Roland Leigh, of Leicester University, understanding precisely where and when vehicles slow to a crawl or stop will help manage the flow of traffic in a way that minimises the impact on the most vulnerable people - the young and the elderly. ""One of the things we can all do is to improve our transport systems so that our congested traffic is not queued up outside of primary schools and old people's homes but instead is queued in other parts of the city where there's going to be less harm,"" he says. But what about tackling one of the main sources of the problem in the first place, the vehicles spewing out the pollutants? In Europe, under pressure from regulators, the manufacturers have progressively cleaned up their engines over the past few decades - first to trap carbon monoxide and unburned fuel, then particulates and most recently nitrogen dioxide. Bath is scrutinising vehicular pollutants The latest European standard, Euro 6, requires vehicles to emit far less pollution than older models, but trust has inevitably been eroded after the car giant VW was caught cheating - using software that activated the emissions controls only during tests. AtBath University,external, engineers use a ""rolling road"" and a robotic ""driver"" to put cars through realistic simulations of how they are normally used, to find out exactly what's released from the exhaust pipe. They are also working to understand the trade-offs involved in cleaning up an engine. For example, adding more pollution-trapping devices can add to fuel consumption, which means increased emissions of carbon dioxide, undermining efforts to tackle climate change. And however good the latest standards, they still leave vast numbers of older vehicles out on the roads. Hence the idea of anational scrappage scheme,external- to provide incentives to drivers to switch to a cleaner model. It's attracting growing support from an unlikely coalition including the Federation of Small Business, London First, Greenpeace and the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association. The challenge, as ever, is to find the money to make this happen and to agree who should pay - taxpayers through government incentives or the vehicle owners themselves. Prof Chris Brace, an automotive engineer of Bath University, says; ""Whichever way you approach it, you are asking people to spend more in taxation or more to buy new vehicles, and we need to decide whether that's something we're comfortable with as a society."" Some awkward choices lie ahead. Will the parents of an asthmatic child dig deep in their pockets to switch to a cleaner car? Will new housing developments include charging points for electric cars? Will the money saved from a fuel-efficient diesel be seen as worth sacrificing for the sake of better air for everyone? And bear in mind that these are ""First World"" questions. In the rapidly growing cities of Africa, and many parts of Asia, there is hardly any monitoring of pollution at all, let alone political will or money to tackle it.

"This week's Budget will be Philip Hammond's first Clear your diary, get the popcorn in, check you are sitting comfortably - it is almost time for one of the biggest political moments in any year. It is Budget week. Like every year, decisions the chancellor makes will have an immediate impact on people's lives and livelihoods. Tweaks to the new system of business rates will soften the impact to some firms who are hit by the steepest rises. An expected top up of a billion or so pounds for the social care system could help alleviate the worst pressure on the service that is struggling in many parts of the country. The announcements already made about money being allocated to technical education could have a significant impact on millions of young people, in the years to come. But decisions that the chancellor does not make - continuing with planned cuts and benefit freezes for example - will also affect millions of people. This Budget is also special because it is the last Spring Budget of its kind, and the chancellor's first. Philip Hammond is moving the main Budget to the autumn. There will no longer be two big fiscal events every year - no more Autumn Statement and spring Budget, just a major autumn Budget. And sources close to the chancellor suggest this Budget is not the place to look for big moves, big changes, or big radical changes. One minister told me: ""It won't be a show fest."" Another said: ""It's a smaller Budget, although smaller Budgets are actually harder."" Philip Hammond has no intention of flashing any cash, even though the levels of borrowing are expected to be slightly less scary than predicted at the Autumn Statement. Treasury sources are more optimistic now of being able to do a Brexit trade deal than some months ago. But there is still a view in Number 11 that the journey to the exit could involve economic headaches, so it makes sense not to allocate every potentially available penny - in case money is needed to ease the pain later on.

"Kwei-Armah appeared in Casualty from 1999 to 2004 You may know Kwame Kwei-Armah best as the paramedic Finlay Newton in the BBC's Casualty. But it's 13 years since he left the television series and since then he's carved a hugely successful career in the theatre. His new stage show is about the reggae legend Bob Marley. But he insists, it is ""absolutely not"" a jukebox musical, where the songs take precedence over the plot. Kwei-Armah, the writer and director of One Love, The Bob Marley Musical, says it is not ""sing-a-long-a-Bob"", but ""a play with music"". He admitted though that it was a ""delicate"" balancing act trying to keep in enough songs the audience will recognise. So hits including No Woman No Cry, Jamming, Three Little Birds and Redemption Song are among 30 tracks that feature in the show. Rehearsals are taking place for the show, which opens on 10 March But One Love is not your usual musical hero, womb to tomb story. Instead it focuses on just three years in Marley's life and career, which Kwei-Armah says are ""very significant"" in ""understanding the hero's journey of the man."" Following an assassination attempt in 1976, the singer left his home in Jamaica and went to live in London in self imposed exile. While in England he recorded two of his biggest albums: Exodus and Kaya. Kwei-Armah said he wanted to get inside the mind of the man at that time and ""show a side of Bob that we don't often speak about."" ""Bob being a political songwriter, I wanted to look at what were the years when he was tested. What were the years when he might have doubted himself? And I found these years to be that."" Marley died of cancer in 1981 at the age of 36. Bob Marley's Facebook page has more than 70 million followers But interest in him shows no sign of diminishing. It is estimated he has sold more than 50 million albums around the world. Time declared Exodus the best album of the 20th Century in 1999. The same year the BBC named One Love the song of the millennium. His Facebook page has more than 70 million fans - and Marley is in the top 15 most popular pages on the social media site. For many, Bob Marley is an idol - a civil rights activist who spoke up for the poor and oppressed. But he was not a saint. And Kwai-Armah says he does not gloss over Marley's womanising and drug use. He says he portrays him ""warts and all"". He adds: ""I don't need any hero to be an angel."" Mitchell Brunings plays Bob Marley in the musical The singer Mitchell Brunings is playing the title role. Born in Surinam, but raised in The Netherlands, he was a backing vocalist in a Marley tribute band, before entering the Dutch equivalent of the television talent show, The Voice. He sang Redemption Song and his performance went viral on YouTube. As a result, Kwai-Armah cast him in the lead role. It is his UK stage debut and he is feeling the pressure to do Marley justice. ""He has a very big following, a lot of his followers are fanatical about their devotion to him, which I understand because I am one of his followers myself. I don't want to do anything to damage his image."" Kwai-Armah says Marley is portrayed ""warts and all"" in the show Marley's family has already given the show their blessing. His daughter Cedella has said: ""Birmingham is a natural place for its UK premiere. With its great mix of cultures, it's a city where my father performed to audiences that were captivated by his presence. ""We have no doubt that telling the story through music to a new generation in Birmingham will be part of his continuing legacy.""

"Chris Harris, Matt LeBlanc and Rory Reid are hosts of the new series To say that Top Gear has had something of a difficult rebirth would be an understatement. The BBC's gamble on Chris Evans as host for the first series of the show since the departure of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May was always going to split opinion. Some felt Top Gear had departed too much from its original format - others felt it hadn't departed enough. No one really expected the same on screen chemistry as Jeremy Clarkson and co, but there was no obvious alternative TV presenting blueprint for the new team to follow either. A critical mauling and a slump in viewing figures followed - but for those that stuck with the series, there were some pleasant surprises. Matt LeBlanc turned out to be quite likeable. Rory Reid had gravitas and passion. Chris Harris overflowed with genuine motoring expertise. Sabine Schmitz proved it was possible to be both funny and German. Eddie Jordan wasâ¦ wellâ¦ Eddie Jordan. Top Gear is now returning for its 24th series - minus Evans - perhaps a little wiser, cleverer and more mature than ever before. ""I thought the last series was good,"" mulls LeBlanc. ""But we're very collaborative now. This series it feels like ideas are welcome. Things are discussed a little more openly."" Evans has said he gave the show his ""best shot"" ""I think we were in for a hard time whatever happened,"" Harris chips in. ""We went in to it knowing that. This is our dream job. We don't sit around dwelling on what's been said. I'm from the internet. If you think [the press] are harsh, try YouTube comments."" The new team seem unfazed by the inevitable comparisons to the Top Gears of old. Since the departure of Evans however, the show's producers have backtracked slightly. For the new series, the presenter dynamic will more closely resemble the lads-on-tour camaraderie of Clarkson's heyday. ""In the last series Matt was very much front and centre,"" says Reid. ""Chris [Harris] and I operated more like lone soldiers, and our films were kind of plugged in to the main thing. This year we're doing much more challenges together and having fun as a trio."" As well as having to distinguish themselves from previous incarnations of Top Gear, since the show was relaunched last year the new team must also now contend with a new rival motoring programme - The Grand Tour, fronted by Clarkson, May and Hammond. ""I've seen a couple of parts,"" sighs LeBlanc. ""It is what it is. It's those guys. They're great."" The Grand Tour was an instant hit with hardcore fans - but the elaborate set-ups and dad gags grated against some critics. The new Top Gear team saw The Grand Tour's focus on contrived humour as an opportunity to indulge in a level of vehicular geekery not seen since the days of Quentin Wilson and Tiff Needell. As part of a Grand Tour stunt, three giant heads of its presenters travelled across three continents ""The car is absolutely central to our approach,"" says Harris. ""Everything we do begins with the automobile, whether it's old, new, bizarre, weird, strange, or cool. ""We're not going out to make a comedy show, and that's great, certainly from my point of view because obviously I'm totally obsessed with cars and I don't really like people."" So will this latest series of Top Gear be entirely void of laughter? ""In my experience, in this business, if you're having fun making it, generally it's fun to watch,"" says LeBlanc. ""It's fun to find the balance between the car porn and the funny element. The jokes are as important as the cars."" The first series also featured Sabine Schmitz and Eddie Jordan And what about Top Gear's reputation as a magnet for controversy? When asked what the most offensive moment of the new series might be, the team eventually agree it's probably the accidental smashing of an Alfa Romeo windscreen - hardly a front page tabloid scandal. ""We don't want to damage cars,"" says Harris. ""People work hard and save money to buy these things."" As Top Gear continues to evolve, it will no doubt face further criticism from fans sentimental about its past. But it's a sentimental attachment to the world of cars that the new team believes aligns them with Top Gear's rich history. ""The car is such a part of our lives,"" adds LeBlanc. ""When you go off to work, when you're arrested they bang you in the back of a car, the first car you ever have, if you go on a date and you end up in the back of a car. That's why we love cars."" Since launching in 1977, Top Gear has been through many guises with many presenters. Each time the programme was reborn, it took years for its core audience of car lovers to warm to its new presenters and format. Whether or not this latest incarnation will become a fan favourite remains to be seen, but its new team are determined to make it work. ""I never thought about walking away,"" says LeBlanc. ""I believe in the show. I'm a fan of the show. And if they fire me, I'll continue to be a fan.""

"President Donald Trump has accused his predecessor Barack Obama of spying on him They were arguably Donald Trump's most striking claims to date: a series of tweets, accusing then-President Barack Obama of wire-tapping Trump Tower during the election. They were not backed up by any evidence, and Mr Obama's spokesman and former US intelligence chief James Clapper denied that any wiretap had been ordered. President Trump urged Congress to investigate, alongside its current investigations into allegations of Russian hacking during the election. But still no evidence has emerged. FBI Director James Comey for the first time on Monday confirmed to the House Intelligence Committee that the agency is investigating possible links between Russia and Mr Trump's associates as part of a broader inquiry into Moscow's interference in last year's election. He also disputed Mr Trump's wiretapping claims. ""With respect to the president's tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at him by the prior administration, I have no information that supports those tweets, and we have looked carefully inside the FBI,"" he told the panel. After Mr Trump's tweets earlier this month, the New York Times quoted unnamed senior officials reporting that Mr Comey had said the claim was false and had asked the justice department to publicly reject it. Mr Clapper said the intelligence agencies he had supervised did not wiretap Mr Trump last year, and nor did the FBI obtain a court order to monitor Mr Trump's phones. As intelligence director, he told NBC, he would have known about a ""court order on something like this"". This is a reference to the US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which can grant wiretaps on the grounds of national security. This video can not be played James Clapper says he ""can deny"" that Donald Trump's phones were tapped Several senior Republicans have rejected the allegations after congressional committees looked into them. Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Richard Burr said on 16 March there were ""no indications"" that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the US government either before or after Election Day 2016. Earlier that day, House Speaker Paul Ryan also said ""no such wiretap existed"". And the previous day, House of Representatives Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes said: ""We don't have any evidence."" ""I don't think there was an actual tap of Trump Tower,"" he told a news conference. ""Are you going to take the tweets literally?"" asked Rep Nunes. ""If so, clearly the president was wrong."" This video can not be played Trump's wiretap saga explained in two minutes It hasn't said yet. It has asked for more time to respond to the House Intelligence Committee's request that it provide evidence. But Mr Comey on Monday also said the justice department found no evidence to support the president's allegations. Yes. ""He stills stands by it"", asserted White House press secretary Sean Spicer in the wake of the congressional intelligence committees' statements. He said the congressional investigations ""have not been provided with all of the information"". However, despite the fact that one of Mr Trump's tweets specifically accused Mr Obama of tapping his phones, the subsequent White House definition of wiretap is broad. ""Wiretap covers a lot of different things. I think you're going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks,"" Mr Trump told Fox News on 16 March. Two days earlier, Mr Spicer had said: ""The president used the word wiretap in quotes to mean broadly surveillance and other activities."" Mr Spicer has cited comments made on Fox News by former judge Andrew Napolitano, who said ""three intelligence sources"" had told Fox News that President Obama had used the British spy agency GCHQ to install wiretaps. He said the White House was ""not passing judgement"" on such reports, but they needed looking into. This video can not be played The White House press secretary pointed to Fox News sources GCHQ, which does not normally comment on news reports, said the claims were ""nonsense, utterly ridiculous and should be ignored"". On Monday, National Security Agency (NSA) Director Michael Rogers also rejected the claims that British intelligence services were behind the wiretapping claims during testimony before the House committee. The allegation ""clearly frustrates a key ally of ours"", he said. Mr Obama's team say Mr Trump's tweets are ""simply false"". A warrant, if it existed, would most likely have been ordered by the Department of Justice independently of the White House. Former press secretary Josh Earnest told ABC: ""This may come as a surprise to the current occupant of the Oval Office, but the president of the United States does not have the authority to unilaterally order the wiretapping of an American citizen. ""If the FBI decided to use their wiretapping authority in the context of the counterintelligence or criminal investigation, it would require FBI investigators, officials at the Department of Justice going to a federal judge and making a case, and demonstrating probable cause to use that authority to conduct the investigation. That is a fact."" It is unclear whether the claims have any basis in fact The only way Mr Obama could have ordered surveillance without going through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (Fisa court) is if there were no US citizens involved. In this case, considering the target is allegedly Trump Tower - which definitely involves American citizens - this would have been hard to argue. The Fisa court has been described by CNN as possibly ""the most powerful court you have never heard of"". The secretive court approves surveillance warrants under Fisa against ""agents of a foreign power"", mainly to either the FBI or NSA. In this case, the reported target of the FBI's application was two Russian banks. Any application has to be approved by one of 11 sitting judges. Rumours of an order granted under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act have been circulating for some time. On 7 November - the day before the country went to the polls - former British MPLouise Mensch reported the order was approved in October,external. According to Ms Mensch, it was issued in connection with a private server and activity between two Russia banks. She also mentions - like Mr Trump in his tweets - that an earlier order had been turned down. In January, the BBC's Paul Wood - writing in the wake of claims the Russian government had compromising material on Mr Trump -said he also knew of the Fisa order. Neither Mr Trump nor his associates are mentioned in the order, our correspondent reported. The Guardianalso mentioned,externalthe order at about the same time. None of them mention wiretapping of phones. It is then seemingly not mentioned again until Mark Levin, a conservative radio host in the US, talked about it two days before Mr Trump's tweets. His show was followed up withan article in Breitbart,externalthe following day, which mentions wiretapping and ""eavesdropping"" sought by the ""Obama administration"". It is not clear how their claims were sourced. Why is Watergate in the news again?
