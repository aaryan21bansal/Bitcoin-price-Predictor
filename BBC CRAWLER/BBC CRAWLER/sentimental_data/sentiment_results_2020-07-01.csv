"Liam Gallagher, Dua Lipa and Sir Paul McCartney are among 1,500 artists who have signedan open letter,externalcalling for support for the UK's live music scene. Ed Sheeran, the Rolling Stones and Coldplay also signed the letter to the culture secretary warning of the impact of Covid-19 on venues and musicians. It says the music industry faces ""mass insolvencies"", with gigs and festivals unlikely to return until 2021. The organisers said there had already been ""hundreds of redundancies"". Job losses, across a range of connected professions, have been reported by venues, agencies and promoters, they said. The letter to Oliver Dowden reads: ""With no end to social distancing in sight or financial support from government yet agreed, the future for concerts and festivals and the hundreds of thousands of people who work in them looks bleak."" It calls for a ""clear, conditional timeline"" for reopening venues without social distancing, as well as financial support and a VAT exemption on ticket sales. Skepta was also among the signatories Eric Clapton, Beverley Knight, Little Mix and Skepta are among the other stars to have added their names to the campaign, entitled Let the Music Play. In an accompanying statement, Dua Lipa said she was ""proud"" to have worked her way up through small clubs, theatres, arenas and festivals. Why 2020 'is a write-off' for gigs and festivals Plans for UK-wide drive-in gigs announced She said: ""But the possibility for other emerging British artists to take the same path is in danger if the industry doesn't receive much needed government support in the interim period before all the various venues, festivals and promoters are ready and able to operate independently again."" Former Oasis frontman Gallagher added: ""Amazing gigs don't happen without an amazing team behind the stage, but they'll all be out of jobs unless we can get back out there doing what we love."" In response, a spokeswoman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said the government was ""already providing unprecedented financial assistance which many music organisations and artists have taken advantage of"", pointing to loans and the job retention scheme. ""We recognise that this pandemic has created major challenges for the sector and are working closely with them to develop comprehensive guidance for performances and events to return as soon as possible,"" she said. Music venues have been closed since mid-March, and the government has not given a date for the return of live performances. Writing on Twitter,,externalthe culture secretary said he was looking to provide the music industry with a ""clear roadmap back"" and fixed dates for when venues could reopen. Mr Dowden added: ""These involve v difficult decisions about the future of social distancing, which we know has saved lives."" Research carried out by Media Insight Consulting and published alongside the open letter suggested the UK music industry contributed Â£4.5bn to the UK economy in 2019 and supported 210,000 jobs. Mumford & Sons headlined Glastonbury Festival in 2013 Ben Lovett of Mumford & Sons, who also runs the Omeara and Lafayette venues in London, told BBC News that music ""defines our culture"". The multi-instrumentalist said: ""When people think about Britishness I hope that they're talking these days about Stormzy through to the Beatles. ""People kind of assume it is a just a self-fulfilling industry that doesn't really need much help - rock and grime and pop - but actually it needs help sometimes and right now it really does."" As well as being in the Brit Award-winning band, Lovett is chief executive of the Venue Group, which employs 210 people. He said he was ""sad"" and ""shocked"" to have already had conversations with people who have now decided ""they're not going to be a musician any more"". Young British artists will have less chance to forge their careers, as potential future Glastonbury headliners, if they can't gain experience and earn money playing in small venues, he warned. As the likes of Stormzy, Sheeran, Florence + the Machine, and his own band did. He said: ""Losing 2020 and not giving them support and not finding a way to protect the industry means that you fast forward to 2023, and I really think we're going to be scratching our heads being like, 'Oh, isn't this the same as we saw last year?'

"Tesla's founder Elon Musk Tesla has become the world's most valuable carmaker, overtaking Japan's Toyota, after its stock hit a record high. Shares in the electric carmaker touched $1,134 on Wednesday morning before falling back, leaving it with a market value of $209.47bn (Â£165bn). That is roughly $4bn more than Toyota's current stock market value. However, Toyota sold around 30 times more cars last year and its revenues were more than 10 times higher. Shares in Tesla have surged since the start of 2020 as investors have begun to feel more confident about the future of electric vehicles. How Elon Musk aims to revolutionise battery technology That is despite its founder Elon Musk having wiped $14bn off Tesla's value in May after tweeting that its share price was too high. After years of losses, the Californian firm has also delivered three profitable quarters in a row and maintained that momentum during the first three months of 2020 despite the coronavirus outbreak. Toyota, however, remains a far larger business in terms of sales. The Japanese company sold 10.46 million vehicles in the year to March and posted revenues of 30.2 trillion yen ($281.20bn). Tesla ended 2019 with sales of just $24.6bn, having delivered 367,200 vehicles last year. However, investors are excited by the US firm's potential, believing it could dominate the future electric car market. Analysts at the stockbroker Jefferies said the firm remained ""significantly ahead of peers in product range, capacity and technology"". In a reflection of that, the firm is also now worth around three times the combined value of US rivals General Motors and Ford. Mr Musk has said Tesla will deliver at least 500,000 vehicles in 2020, a forecast the company has not changed despite the coronavirus pandemic.

"The statue of Edward Colston was pushed into the harbour after being toppled by protesters A man has been arrested in connection with the toppling of a statue of slave trader Edward Colston. A bronze memorial to the 17th Century slave merchant was torn down in Bristol during a Black Lives Matter protest on 7 June and was dumped in the harbour. Avon and Somerset Police said it would review footage of a ""small group of people"" filmed pulling down the statue with ropes. A 24-year-old has been held on suspicion of criminal damage. The investigation remains ongoing. The statue was pulled from its plinth on 7 June Officers previously appealed for the public's help to identify 15 people they wanted to speak to. ""In the eyes of the law"", the force said, a crime had been committed and the force was ""duty-bound to investigate without fear or favour"". The statue was pulled from its plinth in the city centre and was rolled into the harbour. It was later recovered from the water and is due to be given a new home in a city museum displayed with placards from the Black Lives Matter protest.

"As Leicester becomes the first city to be subject to a local lockdown, misleading claims are being shared across social media. A number of local councils have come out on Twitter and Facebook to counter online rumours of imminent lockdowns in their areas - making it clear none have been announced. A rise in cases has been recorded in some local authority areasbut a Public Health England (PHE) spokesperson told the BBC: ""To use this data in isolation to predict which areas will see significant increases in cases is not appropriate as it does not provide a complete picture of what is happening locally."" Experts at PHE are currently looking at outbreaks in much smaller areas, rather than whole towns or cities, to inform decisions about any future local lockdowns. We've identified posts in Facebook and WhatsApp groups that may have led to some of the rumours. A number of national and local news outlets have posted lists of local authorities in England experiencing a rise in coronavirus cases. These stories have been shared by residents on local forums and fuelled misleading claims about imminent lockdowns. One local Facebook group warns: ""Oldham is rapidly speeding towards local lockdown"" accompanied by a list published in a local paper. Another group in Sheffield says ""this is getting serious"" expressing fears about a lockdown in the city. Similar claims and links are being shared in a number of WhatsApp groups in England - including in Stoke, Portsmouth, Sandwell in the West Midlands, the London Borough of Haringey and elsewhere. However, these lists are based on weekly case increases ""without any wider context"" according to Professor Kate Ardern from Wigan's Public Health department. Allow Facebook content?

Her comments were shared on Facebook by Wigan Council, which has had to counter a number of misleading claims circulating in local groups - including one called Coronavirus Concern Wigan, with over 13,000 members. In the Council's post, Professor Ardern explains that the council has ""been made aware that the media is sharing a list of places that could be next"" - which features the town in Greater Manchester. ""Last week we only recorded two new cases, compared to zero cases the week before. Our 7-day infection rate is 3.7 per 100,000 people compared to Leicester's rate of 135 per 100,000. We also currently have the sixth lowest rate of cases in Greater Manchester,"" she adds. Other councils in Doncaster, Wiltshire and Havering, have shared similar posts countering claims on social media. Public Health England has said the data featured in these lists cannot be used in isolation to predict where the next localised lockdown will happen. Bradford Council also had to counter concern online after Health Secretary Matt Hancock claimed that there had been a coronavirus outbreak in the wrong part of Yorkshire. Yesterday,Mr Hancock mixed up Keighley with Kirklees(where staff at a meat factory have tested positive for Covid-19) - leading Bradford council to take to Twitter to ""calm everyone down a bit"".

While local Facebook groups are useful places for community discussion, they can also be afertile breeding ground for misinformation- especially over local concerns when a lot of people are already feeling worried. How bad information goes viral A number of posts attributing the local lockdown in Leicester to videos of crowds of people taking part in anti-racism protests in the city centre a few weeks ago have been shared on Twitter and Facebook. These have led to racist and abusive comments directed at protesters. One post shared by a Facebook page links to an article featuring images of recent Black Lives Matter protests. It asks: ""Are scenes like these in Labour-run Leicester from a couple of weeks ago a contributing factor to why the city is back in lockdown?"" Another post shared on a Facebook group says: ""8th of June 4 thousand BLM protesters in Leicester. 20 days later, and now Leicester is on the brink of another lockdown"". A number of factors could have contributed, including gatherings of people in workplaces, schools, homes and outdoors. Often posts just claim to be ""asking questions"" or call on others to ""be the judge"" - while subtly pushing unsubstantiated claims about the complex issue of infection rates. Why has Leicester had a spike of coronavirus? Misinformation is frequently shared as a way of affirming bias or as a way of criticising political opponents. Always check the source and think about the motive for sharing claims.

"Opening the doors to the UK to as many as around 3 million people from Hong Kong is a big step. No one in Westminster tonight would expect anything like that number will move here, to escape the increasingly fraught reality of life in Hong Kong. But the decision is important, and not just for those to whom the UK may now provide sanctuary. It reflects immediate concern in the government about what has been happening on the streets in that packed, throbbing territory. But the decision was also fuelled by the legacy of British control there. This kind of citizenship was not offered, despite some calls to do so, at the time when Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997. Remember that handover took place on the basis that its partial democracy and market economy would be respected. But that's been eroded so visibly in recent years. UK makes citizenship offer to Hong Kong residents China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? Political battle looming over UK China relations It was notable not one MP in the House of Commons spoke against the next phase of Britain and Hong Kong's story being to offer a home to islanders here. Government's decisions are still affected by choices made decades ago. The decision also reflects a souring of the atmosphere around relations between the UK and China. It's not that long ago that former Prime Minister David Cameron rolled out not just the red carpet, but the Queen's golden carriage to welcome the Chinese Premier. We rarely saw the then Chancellor George Osborne happier than on visits to China extolling the virtues of trade. The balance between the opportunities of doing business and objecting to China's human rights policy was awkward then. Chinese President Xi Jinping with Queen Elizabeth II at a state banquet at Buckingham Palace in 2015 But the dilemma is more acute, not least because a group of Tory MPs, including some up and coming key figures on the backbenches, have joined forces with some of the more traditional 'awkward squad' to oppose close links with China regularly and loudly. Most prominently they have been concerned about whether the UK government should allow the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei a place in building the 5G phone network. Several of those involved in trying to change the government's minds are increasingly confident that Number 10 will soon find a way of rolling back the firm's participation in the project. As a group they have organised, and they have some strength in numbers,as a previous rebellion suggested. One of those involved in the manoeuvrings suggested the government had to be pushed to act on Hong Kong. China is a vast economic power that can't be ignored. There are areas, such as trade and climate where ministers are keen to cooperate. And the prime minister, asked just yesterday about it, said that: ""The position is very, very simple: I'm not going to get drawn into Sinophobia because I'm not a Sinophobe."" But the characteristics of the relationship between the two countries have definitely changed. In the words of one government source today, the UK approach has not hardened, but ""China's more aggressive preferences have been revealed."" A group of Conservative MPs have put pressure on the UK government about allowing the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei a place in building the 5G phone network The government's promise to Hong Kongers comes at a junction in our immigration policy. It was only yesterday that MPs backed the Immigration Bill that ends freedom of movement - the product of a referendum that was fought on the concept of controlling immigration which, for many voters meant getting the numbers down. Isn't it a contradiction therefore that the government has sent out this message to potentially several million to come to our shores? A clash for many perhaps, depending how and when people from Hong Kong arrive here. But for ministers, the decision is a testament of the principle that the UK out of the EU can make its own decisions about who arrives and who leaves.

"This video can not be played Airbus: ""Most people who live in the area, work here"" When the fortune of a town is so inextricably linked to one employer, any threat to jobs will have a ""devastating"" effect on the local community. Airbus is to Broughton what Hoover once was to Merthyr Tydfil, Ford to Bridgend and Tata Steel still is to Port Talbot. More people are employed at the Airbus factory than live in Broughton itself. So it is little wonder jobs losses are seen as a ""hammer blow"" to the area. The company said it planned to cut 15,000 jobs in total,including 1,700 in its UK sites at Flintshire and Bristol, as it dealt with the effects of the coronavirus crisis. ""The majority of people living in the area work there so [job losses] are going to be a great shame to a lot of people. I have family working there, everyone is going to impacted,"" said one resident. ""I thought I had a job for life, I'm devastated,"" said worker Ross Leeding Another added: ""It's a big part of the community, one of the main sources of jobs around here. So if anything happens it would have a big blow - devastating. On the shop floor, the mood has been ""sombre"" since the news broke. ""People are shocked and the uncertainty over numbers is only adding to that,"" said worker Daz Reynolds, of the Unite union. Plane-maker Airbus to cut 15,000 jobs Aerospace industry 'will take years' to recover ""People have families to feed and they want to know what their future looks like at Airbus. It's simple. ""This is going to have a devastating effect. There are highly-skilled workers here but also thousands of people in the supply chain in towns and villages across north-east Wales and Cheshire. Everyone knows someone who works with Airbus."" Agency worker Ross Leeding, already on furlough, added: ""I wish they would tell us if we're being made redundant or not - not maybe. It's frustrating not to know. ""I'm devastated. I was happy here and thought I had a job for life here. I'm 60 years old now, so where am I going to get a job like this? ""There are others with kids, mortgages, loans who are worse off than me. It's the bread and butter for Broughton."" Airbus employs more than 6,000 people at its site in Broughton The aftershocks from job losses are likely to ripple out across the entire region, to suppliers and the local economy that has been built around the success and size of Airbus. Ben Francis, policy chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses, said it was ""extremely worrying news"". He added: ""The importance of Airbus to the north Wales economy cannot be overstated. There are families, communities, and small businesses who rely on Airbus, as does the wider regional economy."" Thomas Smith runs the nearby New Glynne Arms inn that relies on Airbus staff for trade. Hundreds of British Airways jobs under threat Welsh aviation sector needs 'major intervention' ""We rely on passing trade so if you take away thousands of people, it's terrifying to think what might happen,"" he said. ""It's going to affect the local economy big time because so many work there. You just don't know what the future is."" Local businesses will also be badly affected, said local pub landlord Thomas Smith Wrexham MS Lesley Griffiths said the effects would be felt ""throughout"" the local supply chain and Flintshire council leader Ian Roberts said the factory was of ""immense"" importance for the county. ""It's devastating for Flintshire and the wider region - 50% of the workers come from outside the county,"" said Mr Roberts. There is concern that job losses will not only affect current staff, but young people in the area. Coleg Cambria in Connah's Quay offers engineering students an undergraduate apprenticeship with Airbus. Thousands more people are employed in the supply chain around the Broughton site David Jones, a former chief executive of the college, said the scheme was the biggest of its kind in the UK with 150 new apprentices joining each year. ""With older people and other workers that receive training, around 1,000 people are linked with Airbus training in Coleg Cambria and other colleges and universities,"" said Mr Jones. ""The goal now must be to win the contract to build a new type of wing that will be developed over the next five years. ""There are huge developments in the aerospace sector, meaning that wings will be produced in completely different ways to today. ""Whoever manages to secure that next contract, it will be hugely important regarding the long term future of wing building in north east Wales.""

Diana, Princess Of Wales, visited Thorpe Park with sons Prince William And Prince Harry in 1993 The duke singled out the work of some of the 184 children and young adults presented with the accolade this year for their social action or humanitarian efforts. One of them was James Frater, a young black boy of Caribbean descent from London who had had 300 detentions and exclusions from school before being mentored by four teachers. Now 24, he is training to become a doctor and has focused on creating initiatives to increase the representation of black students at university, particularly those in the prestigious Russell Group. Another award winner praised by Prince Harry included 23-year-old Nasra Ayub, from Bristol, an activist at Integrate UK, a youth-led charity that works towards gender and racial equality. Shanea Kerry Oldham, 19, from London, was also praised. She developed the Operation Inspire mentoring programme for young boys that were excluded internally and founded Your Life More Life, which creates safe spaces for young people impacted by violence.

"This video can not be played Simon Cheng says he was blindfolded and beaten in China A former employee of the UK's Hong Kong consulate who alleged he was tortured in China has been granted political asylum in Britain. Simon Cheng, a Hong Kong citizen, was detained on a business trip to mainland China for 15 days last August. Beijing accused Mr Cheng of inciting political unrest amid anti-government protests in Hong Kong. He denied the charges, telling the BBC he had been beaten and forced to sign false confessions while in custody. UK government sources said at the time they believed his claims were credible. Read more:Former UK consulate worker says he was tortured in China Mr Cheng, a supporter of the pro-democracy movement, says he believes it is too dangerous for him to return to Hong Kong, fearing he may be arrested and taken to mainland China once more. In June, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said China had still not provided ""an adequate response"" to the UK's questions over the incident. Mr Cheng was granted asylum on 26 June. In a press conference on Wednesday, he said he believed he was the first Hong Kong holder of the British National (Overseas) passport, known as a BNO, to receive political asylum. Mr Cheng believed his life would be in danger if he returned to Hong Kong ""I am grateful for the determination and courage shown by the UK government to rescue British nationals,"" he wrote on Facebook. ""I also hope my case can be a precedent for other HongKongers to seek for protection. ""Leaving means not an end but a beginning. We will continue the fight against the expanding totalitarianism, and be back to our hometown with true democracy and freedom."" The UK government confirmed on Wednesday thatup to three million Hong Kong residents would be offered the chance to settle in the UKand ultimately apply for citizenship in the wake of Beijing imposing a controversial new national security law. Critics say the law, brought in on Tuesday, will erode the added freedoms granted to the region under the ""one country, two systems"" policy agreed after the UK handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997. This video can not be played Hundreds have been arrested as Hong Kong's national security law kicks in The Home Office said it did not comment on individual cases. Mr Cheng was working for the UK embassy in Hong Kong, charged with generating interest in investing in Scotland among the Chinese business community. But as the 2019 protests began to grow, he also volunteered to collect information on the status of the protests for the consulate - for the purposes of observation. He went missing on 8 August after being detained at the border on the way back from the Chinese city of Shenzhen. The detention centre where Mr Cheng alleges he was held Mr Cheng says he was held for 15 days during which time he was ""shackled, blindfolded and hooded"", held in stress positions and beaten if he moved. The questioning focused on his role in the protests. He also said he saw other Hong Kong protesters during his time in custody. Later, after he had been released,China's state-run broadcaster ran a videoshowing Mr Cheng confessing to soliciting prostitutes. Mr Cheng says he was forced into making the confession.

Ian YoungsEntertainment and Arts Reporter, BBC News Gemma Sutton, Clive Rowe and Tameka Empson in Aladdin at the Hackney Empire in 2018 Oh yes it is. Oh no it isn't. The big question facing many theatres at the moment is - is panto season cancelled? Norwich Theatre Royal became one of the first to call off its pantomime this week, saying the risk was ""too great"" after three months with no income. Venues in Buxton and Welwyn Garden City have also cancelled, while Leicester Curve has scrapped its festive musical. Pantos are crucial to theatre earnings, and this Christmas could prove to be make or break for some venues' futures. Conservative MP Giles Watling, a former actor and panto dame, warned of the impact if festive shows are scrapped. ""I think many provincial theatres will go to the wall, frankly, because that's the time they can make the money,"" he told BBC News. ""It puts money in the coffers to support the rest of the cultural offer. I can see massive problems ahead if something isn't done and soon."" Read more here. Sarah CampbellBBC News/Royal Correspondent Will the Royal Family embrace life on Zoom? Three months ago when lockdown began, it was hard to see how, in isolation, the Royal Family could unite the nation as it had previously done in times of crisis. The Prince of Wales, the heir to the throne, had tested positive for Covid-19. He and the Duchess of Cornwall self-isolated in Scotland. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, both in their 90s, retreated behind Windsor Castle's walls. The institution had already been rocked by the departure of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the Duke of York ""stepping back"". Yet with each day, the death toll rose and a nation needed reassurance. Within a week Prince Charles, who suffered only mild symptoms of the virus, was able to release a video describing his ""strange, frustrating and often distressing experience"". The video was recorded at his home on the Balmoral estate. Perhaps it was the setting - the crammed bookshelves, the family photo, the teddy bear on the mantelpiece - or the heartfelt, personal delivery - but it felt intimate and set the tone for how the Royal Family went on to communicate with the nation during lockdown. See here for more from Sarah. Bar patrons in Texas Florida and Texas are among the states most affected by the huge surge in US virus cases. Here are what some of the people living there had to say. Alisha Hoath, 22 - Boca Raton, Florida There was a period when everyone began to forget about the virus. I even thought things were getting better for a while. For the most part I know I could be doing better with social distancing. I've been going to yoga classes and took a trip to a hotel in Miami for the weekend which was probably not my best decision. But we made sure to keep six feet apart and wear masks. Genesis Valbuena, 26 - Austin, Texas Some bar owners here in Austin are vocally going against what we need to do - criticising the data and suing the government for shutting them down. If we continue to do this, we are going to be shut down for the rest of the year. For me that's completely narcissistic. How certain bar owners are acting is ludicrous. The reopening should have been done less quickly.

Tamoor Tariq, a councillor for Bury Council, in Greater Manchester, is now recovering from the virus. He urged people to ""not take for granted"" the seriousness of the illness. Reality Check Peru imposed one of the earliest and strictest lockdowns in Latin America to stop the spread of coronavirus - but it now has the sixth highest number of confirmed cases in the world. Peru's President, MartÃ­n Vizcarra, says things are improving but has previously said results of the lockdown ""haven't been exactly what we expected"". So why has Peru been affected so badly? The lockdown in Peru started on 16 March - before the UK and some other European countries - and lasted until the end of June. Daily reported cases are now falling - but the number of deaths remains high. Officially, as of 30 June, around than 9,600 people had died with coronavirus in Peru. But the country hasone of the world's highest excess death rates- the number of deaths above the average in previous years - which suggests the impact far exceeds official figures. Why have measures been ineffective? Peru has reported more cases than every European country apart from the UK, despite testing only about seven people in every 1,000 - more than some countries in Latin America but far fewer than Italy, for example, which has tested about 88 in every 1,000. Experts say Peru's healthcare system was underprepared, leading to more deaths, but several other social and economic factors can help explain why Peru is struggling to contain the outbreak. Read more here Sonia KatariaBBC News Some children who live in the Leicester lockdown zone but attend school outside of the area will not be able to cross the border, the Department for Education (DfE) has confirmed. From Thursday, only vulnerable children and children of key
workers can travel across the boundary in either direction for school or
appointments with social workers. Other
children have been asked to stay at home. The DfE said: ""If you are a child or young person (other than a vulnerable child or child of a critical worker) that lives in Leicester but attends school or college outside the affected area, you must stay at home."" Some children who attend St Lukeâs Primary School in Thurnby, Leicestershire, which is outside the zone and will be open as normal tomorrow, are from within the boundary. Headteacher Paul Galvin said he was ""deeply sorry"" to the families of those affected. He said: ""It might be difficult for families who are inside the lockdown zone - as we are just outside the boundary - especially if they are not children of critical workers."" He added the school has ""adapted and will keep adapting to changes"" during the coronavirus pandemic. The school has been open since the lockdown in March for vulnerable children and children of key workers, and reopened for Reception and Year 1 in June. A ""small"" outbreak of coronavirus among workers at a bed factory in West Yorkshire has been confirmed. Eight members of staff at the Dura Beds factory in Batley have tested positive for the virus this week, a statement says. All staff - a total of 107 workers - will now be offered tests, according to the joint statement by Kirklees Council and Public Health England (PHE). The Dura Beds factory has been closed for two weeks as a safety precaution for its employees and their families, the statement adds. The firm is now ""working closely"" with the council and PHE so those who have tested positive can be followed up by the NHS Test and Trace programme and self-isolate. People who might have come into contact with an infected individual will be contacted and may be advised to self-isolate for 14 days. The statement adds: ""While the risk to residents from this outbreak is very low, everyone in Kirklees should continue to socially distance, wash hands regularly for 20 seconds with soap and water and get tested if they have symptoms."" Across the UK, the number of newly confirmed coronavirus cases each day has been falling since a peak in April. You can read morehere. Councils in England need urgent support as they face a funding gap of Â£7.4bn due to a loss of income related to coronavirus,the Local Government Association (LGA) says. Local authorities have come under increased pressure during the pandemic as demand for services such as social care has grown, while at the same time, income from local taxation and charges has dropped. James Jamieson, chairman of the LGA, which represents English councils and London boroughs, said ""further funding and flexibilities are now urgent"" if councils are to avoid taking steps such as ""in-year cuts to local services"" to cope with funding gaps. Whitehall has given Â£3.2bn funding to all English councils in two grants to help cover coronavirus costs, but the LGA says between March and June councils had already incurred costs of Â£4.8bn. Almost 44,000 people have died with coronavirus in the UK according to the latest daily government figures - which count deaths with a positive test result. But the overall total is likely to be higher. You can read morehere. Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter As Leicester, in England's East Midlands, has become the first city put under a local lockdown, misleading claims have been shared on social media. A string of local councils have posted on Twitter and Facebook to counter online rumours of imminent lockdowns in their areas - making it clear none have been announced. A rise in cases has been recorded in some local authority areasbut a Public Health England (PHE) spokesperson told the BBC that using this data to predict which areas would see significant rises in cases is ""not appropriate"" because it doesn't give a ""complete picture"" of the local situation. Meanwhile, a number of social media posts attributing the local lockdown in Leicester to videos of crowds of people taking part in anti-racism protests in the city centre a few weeks ago have led to racist and abusive comments directed at protesters. We've identified posts in Facebook groups that may have sparked some of the rumours. You can read morehere. Uganda hosts more than 400,000 refugees from DR Congo alone and many more from South Sudan Uganda has opened part of its border with the Democratic Republic of Congo to allow in thousands of people stuck in no-man's land for more than a month due to the coronavirus pandemic. At least 3,000 of them fled their homes in May after inter-communal clashes in north-eastern Ituri province. But they were unable to cross into Uganda to seek safety as the country had closed its borders in March to control the spread of coronavirus. It has been agreed the refugees will be quarantined before being settled. This will happen for 14 days at a new isolation centre, 13km (eight miles) from the border. The UN's refugee agency (UNHCR) says sample testing will be carried out on the group to see if coronavirus is present among them. This will help authorities decide when the refugees can be transferred to camps. Read more here. Simon JackBBC Business Editor The worldwide economic impact of the coronavirus has been seismic and the job losses are starting to crash on the shores of the UK with increasing frequency and severity. The 1,700 UK job losses at Airbus had a grim inevitability to them, given the destruction of demand in the aviation industry. Demand for air travel in April and May was down more than 90% and normality is not expected to return for up to three years - maybe never for the more lucrative business class travel. BA, Easyjet, Ryanair and Rolls Royce have already announced 20,000 job losses between them, so Airbus was never going to emerge unscathed. The travel wipeout has seen SSP, the owner of stalwart transport hub tenants Upper Crust and CafÃ© Ritazza, cut 5,000 posts.  We already know that the number of workers on UK payrolls shrank more than 600,000 between March and May, according to the ONS. That looks like the thin end of a very big wedge as the government's unprecedented job support scheme tapers off, with employers being asked to share the burden of the cost from the end of July to its withdrawal at the end of October.

A number of filmmakers were asked to make short films during lockdown, with no crew or budget, for the streaming service Netflix. As she tells the BBC's Alex Stanger, the end result was a very personal affair.  Matt Forward with his hawk in Trafalgar Square Whether it's nurses, carers or supermarket staff, key workers have rightly been hailed as heroes during lockdown. But behind the pandemic's front line there have also been many others who have been busy doing essential jobs. Matt Forward's job is to keep the pigeons away from Trafalgar Square, in central London. Pest management was covered in the key worker list, so throughout the lockdown Matt drove himself and his Harris hawk 45 miles (70km) to the iconic square early two mornings a week. Matt, who lives in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said he never thought of stopping his job because of lockdown. ""If someone wasn't there doing the job that we do, we'd be overrun,"" he says. Read more about how lockdown has been for Britain's unlikely key workers here Mark EastonHome editor Most of Britain is preparing for an easing of lockdown restrictions. But public
concern at the risks from coronavirus has risen to the highest level since the
end of April, a new poll conducted by Ipsos Mori this week suggests. However,
the survey also says the public is becoming more comfortable about
returning to work and sending children back to school. A month
ago, 37% of those surveyed said they were âvery concernedâ about the risks to
the country.  This new poll suggests that has risen to 50%. Concern about
the risks to individuals has also risen from 24% to 29%. The
survey asks people whether they would feel comfortable in a range of situations
if lockdown measures were lifted.  The proportion of parents who said they
would be comfortable sending their children to school has risen to 49%, up from
38% a month earlier. Two-thirds of people would be comfortable meeting friends or family outside their
household, also a rise from six weeks before. But the poll suggests around six in 10 people would be anxious going to bars or restaurants, using public
transport or lavatories and only 15% said they would be comfortable going to
large sport or music events. Ipsos MORI interviewed a representative sample of 1,078 British adults aged 18-75 online between 26-29 June 2020. Data are weighted to match the profile of the population. All polls are subject to a wide range of potential sources of error. Prof Van-Tam speaking at the government's daily news briefing on 30 May Here's some more from the government's Science and Technology committee hearing that's been going on this afternoon. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer, has said there are enough doses of remdesivir for use on hospitalised patients in the UK. It comes on the back of news that theUS had secured almost all of the forthcoming global supply of the drug, which has been shown to help people recover from Covid-19 more quickly. Prof Van-Tam said: ""Right now, there are stocks in the UK - and I judge us to have adequate stocks - of pre-licensed, as in unlicensed, clinical trial stocks of remdesivir which are available to be used through the emergency access protocol."" Remdesivir is produced by the US firm Gilead Sciences and is the first drug to have been approved by authorities in the US to be used to treat the disease. The US administration is set to receive 500,000 doses - or 100% of the company's supply production - in July, 90% of it in August and 90% in September.  ValeTodo Downtown has become the Downtown Market Peru's largest LGBT nightclub has reopened its doors as lockdown eases - as a grocery store. ValeTodo Downtown is one of the best known dance floors in the capital, Lima.

Foreign Office permanent secretary Sir Simon McDonald expressed the government's ""deep concern"" about the new law to China during a meeting with the country's ambassador Liu Xioming. The UK government has been raising concerns about the national security law and very publicly trying to pressure Beijing into a change heart. That has clearly failed - so ministers are now fulfilling their promise to allow some three million British Overseas Nationals to come to the UK. This is a significant move and the government wants to send a strong message.

By Grace Tsoi, BBC World Service, Hong Kong I was born in Hong Kong before 1997, the year when Hong Kong was handed back to Chinese rule. That means I had a British National Overseas (BNO) passport as a child. When the news broke that BNO passport holders were eligible for British citizenship after living and working in the UK for five years, and after spending another year of being granted settled status, many of my friends were excited. They say at least there's a way out for Hong Kongers after the national security law came into force. But many questions remain. Currently there are 350,000 BNO passport holders, but about three million Hong Kong residents are eligible for BNO passports - and that doesn't appear to include dependants born after 1997. Will the UK be ready to take in so many Hong Kong residents? Will there be enough jobs? Will BNO passport holders have recourse to public funds? And will they be covered by the NHS? Some also say it's good that there's a lifeboat, but do they really want to leave their home?

"Local authorities are to be given access to postcode-level data about the number of people testing positive for coronavirus in their areas after it was agreed with the Department of Health. It comes after Leicester became the first city tohave a local lockdown imposedfollowing a rise in cases. Labour leader Keir Starmer said there had been a ""lost week"" due to city officials not having full testing data. The prime minister said the figures had been shared with all local authorities. But, at Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons, Sir Keir said officials in Leicester had only received full figures on Thursday. Until now local authorities have not routinely had full access to the data on people who are tested for the virus in the community. But the agreement, signed individually with councils over the past week, now gives them access to a digital dashboard which shows test results down to a postcode level. Leicester lockdown boundary line branded 'stupid' Scots border 'cluster' of virus cases investigated Leicester's new lockdown rules at a glance Dr Jeanelle De Gruchy, president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, welcomed the news and said ""timely, high quality and consistent data"" would be key to combating local outbreaks. But Prof Azeem Majeed, from Imperial College London, said the country had been slow in areas of its Covid-19, response and said the data-sharing agreement ""should have been in place some time ago"". On Monday, it was revealed Leicester's seven-day infection rate was 135 cases per 100,000 people - three times that of the next highest city. The local authorities in England with the next highest rate in the week to 21 June was Bradford with 69 cases per 100,000 people, followed by Barnsley and Rochdale with 55 and 53 cases per 100,000 respectively. The city's mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby, also criticised the government and PHE for being slow to share testing data - saying city officials had been trying to get figures ""for weeks"". The British Medical Association, which represents doctors in the UK, said providing local leaders with up-to-date information was ""vital"" in containing outbreaks, particularly asa contact-tracing app was not yet in place. Walkers confirms 28 virus cases at site Why has action taken so long in Leicester?  Officials are also keeping a close eye on Bedford, Blackburn with Darwen, Kirklees, Oldham, Rotherham and Tameside which seen 30 to 44.9 cases per 100,000 people. Imperial College London's Prof Neil Ferguson,who used to advise the government before he resigned for breaking lockdown rules, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""inevitable"" there would be further local outbreaks adding that high rates of the virus in Bradford and Doncaster were ""clearly of concern"". The BMA's Dr Chaand Nagpaul said Prime Minister Boris Johnson's ""whack-a-mole strategy"" to tackle local outbreaks would be no use if the people leading the response were ""not given the most accurate up-to-date data"". Labour MP Yvette Cooper tweeted it was ""incomprehensible"" that health authorities in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, had also been trying to get hold of local data on swab test results of the wider population but had not been able to. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SOCIAL LIFE:When will pubs, bars and restaurants reopen? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Sir Keir also criticised the speed of the government response in Leicester, saying it took 11 days from the announcement that cases were rising for the lockdown to be tightened. Mr Johnson said the government had started taking action on 8 June, but ""unfortunately it did not prove possible to get the results seen elsewhere"", referring to another localised outbreak ata meat plant in West Yorkshire. Across the rest of England, the lockdown is set to ease further on Saturday with the reopening of bars, restaurants and hair salons, but the BMA said it wanted the government to set metric ""trigger points"" for when action will be taken to reintroduce local and national restrictions. The BMA said this metric should consider not only the regional reproductive number or R rate - the number of people that one infected person, on average, will pass the virus on to - but also the proportion of the population currently infected. A government spokesperson said it had been working closely with local partners, providing the resources and tools needed to take swift action to deal with any new local spikes in infection. It remains one of the most baffling aspects of the current approach. Local authorities have not routinely been given information about their residents who test positive. Even though they are intrinsically involved in the system as the local arm of the contact tracing service, councils have only been getting what the national system deems appropriate. They have been asked to chase up the so-called complex cases - where people test positive in care homes, prisons or schools - so they get that information quickly. But they have not been given real-time information about individual residents who test positive. Local directors of public health say it has hampered their ability to look for patterns and clusters developing. In theory, the national system should do this, but why not have a second pair of eyes? Especially one that knows the local situation much better? This is beginning to change - data sharing agreements have just been signed with local authorities and Public Health England has now set up a system that should do this in a comprehensive and speedy manner from now on. But the fact it has not already and the experience of those on the ground in Leicester - where cases were going up for a number of weeks - suggests local outbreaks developing in the community may not yet have been spotted as quickly as they should. Under the local lockdown, announced on Monday evening, non-essential shops in Leicester have been forced to shut and schools have closed, except for vulnerable pupils and children of ""critical workers"". People are also being advised not to travel in or out of the city. The measures will last until at least 18 July and apply to the city centre and a number of suburbs. New laws are not planned ""at this stage"" to stop people entering or leaving Leicester, Downing Street said, as local police weigh options for enforcing the lockdown. Leicestershire Police Chief Constable Simon Cole said people would have to be ""pretty daft"" to leave the lockdown area for a pint of beer when pubs reopened elsewhere. ""This is a serious public health risk. Do you want to bring that illness into contact with your mates or your family?"" he asked. ""Certainly I wouldn't want to do that. We do work really closely with all the neighbouring forces - we've been communicating with them so they can understand."" He added: ""I'd really implore people - some of the leading health experts in the country are saying stay at home and that seems pretty shrewd advice to me."" Meanwhile, the UK death toll rose by 176, to 43,906, according to the latest figures from the Department for Health and Social Care.

"This video can not be played Simon Cheng says he was blindfolded and beaten in China A former employee of the UK's Hong Kong consulate who alleged he was tortured in China has been granted political asylum in Britain. Simon Cheng, a Hong Kong citizen, was detained on a business trip to mainland China for 15 days last August. Beijing accused Mr Cheng of inciting political unrest amid anti-government protests in Hong Kong. He denied the charges, telling the BBC he had been beaten and forced to sign false confessions while in custody. UK government sources said at the time they believed his claims were credible. Read more:Former UK consulate worker says he was tortured in China Mr Cheng, a supporter of the pro-democracy movement, says he believes it is too dangerous for him to return to Hong Kong, fearing he may be arrested and taken to mainland China once more. In June, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said China had still not provided ""an adequate response"" to the UK's questions over the incident. Mr Cheng was granted asylum on 26 June. In a press conference on Wednesday, he said he believed he was the first Hong Kong holder of the British National (Overseas) passport, known as a BNO, to receive political asylum. Mr Cheng believed his life would be in danger if he returned to Hong Kong ""I am grateful for the determination and courage shown by the UK government to rescue British nationals,"" he wrote on Facebook. ""I also hope my case can be a precedent for other HongKongers to seek for protection. ""Leaving means not an end but a beginning. We will continue the fight against the expanding totalitarianism, and be back to our hometown with true democracy and freedom."" The UK government confirmed on Wednesday thatup to three million Hong Kong residents would be offered the chance to settle in the UKand ultimately apply for citizenship in the wake of Beijing imposing a controversial new national security law. Critics say the law, brought in on Tuesday, will erode the added freedoms granted to the region under the ""one country, two systems"" policy agreed after the UK handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997. This video can not be played Hundreds have been arrested as Hong Kong's national security law kicks in The Home Office said it did not comment on individual cases. Mr Cheng was working for the UK embassy in Hong Kong, charged with generating interest in investing in Scotland among the Chinese business community. But as the 2019 protests began to grow, he also volunteered to collect information on the status of the protests for the consulate - for the purposes of observation. He went missing on 8 August after being detained at the border on the way back from the Chinese city of Shenzhen. The detention centre where Mr Cheng alleges he was held Mr Cheng says he was held for 15 days during which time he was ""shackled, blindfolded and hooded"", held in stress positions and beaten if he moved. The questioning focused on his role in the protests. He also said he saw other Hong Kong protesters during his time in custody. Later, after he had been released,China's state-run broadcaster ran a videoshowing Mr Cheng confessing to soliciting prostitutes. Mr Cheng says he was forced into making the confession.

"More than 12,000 people in the UK are set to lose their jobs after a raft of firms announced cuts in the past 48 hours. The cuts are mainly being made by High Street retailers and in aviation - two of the sectors hardest hit by the coronavirus lockdown. John Lewis has said it will close stores but has not confirmed how many jobs will go. Topshop owner Arcadia and Harrods said they planned a total of 1,180 job cuts. Other lay-offs that have been announced include: Up to 5,000 job cutsat Upper Crust owner SSP Group Up to 700 jobs at Harrods About 600 workersat shirtmaker TM Lewin Up to 900 cuts at management consulting firm Accenture 300 staff cuts across Virgin Money, Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank 1,700 UK jobsat plane-maker Airbus And1,300 crew and 727 pilotsat EasyJet Have you recently been made redundant? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. WH Smith, Bensons for Beds, Wrights Pies, tableware-maker Steelite International, the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool and Norwich Theatre Royal have also announced plans to reduce staff. Businesses have been hit hard since the UK went into lockdown on 23 March, and even though restrictions are gradually being eased, consumer demand remains depressed. The government's furlough scheme will also start to be pared back from August, and firms are cutting jobs to control their costs. James Phillips could be made redundant James Phillips, a mechanical engineer, told the BBC he fears he could be made redundant. He has been on furlough since March but has now been asked to attend a redundancy consultation meeting with his employer. He said: ""I'm three months away from having a baby, and I was about to sign for a mortgage this week on a new property, so it's impacted me massively, really. Everything's been put on hold."" Sue Hudson lost her job as a legal secretary at a solicitors in Bournemouth in April and has not found a job since. ""There are too many people chasing too few jobs,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""It's very disheartening."" For most businesses, staffing is the highest cost, and many have been using the government's furlough schemes to keep workers on. But the programme - which is paying 80% of the wages of more than 9 million workers - will start to be pared back from next month and will end in October. Upper Crust owner SSP has announced 5,000 job cuts As firms have to consult for 30-45 days when making redundancies, some will feel that now is the time to act. ""There is already a cost to the employer from just a month's time,"" said BBC business correspondent Simon Gompertz. ""Larger employers, planning bigger layoffs, will be eyeing that escalating wage bill and maybe thinking the sooner they move the better."" In an email to staff, Harrods' managing director Michael Ward said the department store was making its cuts with a heavy heart.

"The worldwide economic impact of the coronavirus has been seismic and the job losses are starting to crash on the shores of the UK with increasing frequency and severity. The 1,700 job losses at Airbus had a grim inevitability to them, given the destruction of demand in the aviation industry. Demand for air travel in April and May was down more than 90% and normality is not expected to return for up to three years - maybe never for the more lucrative business class travel. BA, Easyjet, Ryanair and Rolls Royce have already announced 20,000 job losses between them, so Airbus was never going to emerge unscathed. The travel wipeout has seen SSP, the owner of stalwart transport hub tenants Upper Crust and CafÃ© Ritazza, cut 5,000 posts. We already know that the number of workers on UK payrolls shrank more than 600,000 between March and May, according to the ONS. That looks like the thin end of a very big wedge as the government's unprecedented job support scheme tapers off, with employers being asked to share the burden of the cost from the end of July to its withdrawal at the end of October. The European head of a large investment bank told me this morning that one of their key concerns was the ""fraying of the social fabric in the UK"", thanks to a toxic cocktail of mass redundancies which will hit the low-wage jobs the UK has excelled in creating. Employers are discovering that with increased use of technology, they can do many things with fewer people. The march towards a more automated world has been accelerated by the virus - and the UK, with its high levels of employment in lower-skilled work, has further to fall compared to others, he said. The divide between the digital skills ""haves"" and ""have-nots"" will widen. The chief economist of the Bank of England, Andy Haldane, has provided some relief to the gloom by saying the hit will not be as bad as expected and the recovery faster, but it's fair to say that his is not a mainstream view. The reason the government has thrown tens of billions of pounds at trying to hold back the waves of unemployment is they realise that it does long-lasting damage to demand in the economy.

"More than 12,000 people in the UK are set to lose their jobs after a raft of firms announced cuts in the past 48 hours. The cuts are mainly being made by High Street retailers and in aviation - two of the sectors hardest hit by the coronavirus lockdown. John Lewis has said it will close stores but has not confirmed how many jobs will go. Topshop owner Arcadia and Harrods said they planned a total of 1,180 job cuts. Other lay-offs that have been announced include: Up to 5,000 job cutsat Upper Crust owner SSP Group Up to 700 jobs at Harrods About 600 workersat shirtmaker TM Lewin Up to 900 cuts at management consulting firm Accenture 300 staff cuts across Virgin Money, Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank 1,700 UK jobsat plane-maker Airbus And1,300 crew and 727 pilotsat EasyJet Have you recently been made redundant? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. WH Smith, Bensons for Beds, Wrights Pies, tableware-maker Steelite International, the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool and Norwich Theatre Royal have also announced plans to reduce staff. Businesses have been hit hard since the UK went into lockdown on 23 March, and even though restrictions are gradually being eased, consumer demand remains depressed. The government's furlough scheme will also start to be pared back from August, and firms are cutting jobs to control their costs. James Phillips could be made redundant James Phillips, a mechanical engineer, told the BBC he fears he could be made redundant. He has been on furlough since March but has now been asked to attend a redundancy consultation meeting with his employer. He said: ""I'm three months away from having a baby, and I was about to sign for a mortgage this week on a new property, so it's impacted me massively, really. Everything's been put on hold."" Sue Hudson lost her job as a legal secretary at a solicitors in Bournemouth in April and has not found a job since. ""There are too many people chasing too few jobs,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""It's very disheartening."" For most businesses, staffing is the highest cost, and many have been using the government's furlough schemes to keep workers on. But the programme - which is paying 80% of the wages of more than 9 million workers - will start to be pared back from next month and will end in October. Upper Crust owner SSP has announced 5,000 job cuts As firms have to consult for 30-45 days when making redundancies, some will feel that now is the time to act. ""There is already a cost to the employer from just a month's time,"" said BBC business correspondent Simon Gompertz. ""Larger employers, planning bigger layoffs, will be eyeing that escalating wage bill and maybe thinking the sooner they move the better."" In an email to staff, Harrods' managing director Michael Ward said the department store was making its cuts with a heavy heart. ""Due to the ongoing impacts of this pandemic, we as a business will need to make reductions to our workforce."" He said it would take a ""drastic improvement in external conditions"" for Harrods to recover and return to growth.

"This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson says the new law ""violates Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy"" Up to three million Hong Kong residents are to be offered the chance to settle in the UK and ultimately apply for citizenship, Boris Johnson has said. The PM said Hong Kong's freedoms were being violated by a new security law and those affected would be offered a ""route"" out of the former UK colony. About 350,000 UK passport holders, and 2.6 million others eligible, will be able to come to the UK for five years. And after a further year, they will be able to apply for citizenship. British National Overseas Passport holders in Hong Kong were granted special status in the 1980s but currently have restricted rights and are only entitled to visa-free access to the UK for six months. Under the government's plans, all British Overseas Nationals and their dependants will be given right to remain in the UK, including the right to work and study, for five years. At this point, they will be able to apply for settled status, and after a further year, seek citizenship. UK asylum for consulate worker 'tortured in China' HK arrests dozens as 'anti-protest' law kicks in Political battle looming over UK China relations China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? The PM said Tuesday's passing of a new security law by the Hong Kong authorities was a ""clear and serious breach"" of the 1985 Sino-British joint declaration - a legally binding agreement which set out how certain freedoms would be protected for the 50 years after China assumed sovereignty in 1997. ""It violates Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and threatens the freedoms and rights protected by the joint declaration,"" he said. ""We made clear that if China continued down this path we would introduce a new route for those with British National (Overseas) status to enter the UK, granting them limited leave to remain with the ability to live and work in the UK and thereafter to apply for citizenship. And that is precisely what we will do now."" Foreign Office permanent secretary Sir Simon McDonald expressed the government's ""deep concern"" about the new law to China during a meeting with the country's ambassador Liu Xioming. The UK government has been raising concerns about the national security law and very publicly trying to pressure Beijing into a change heart. That has clearly failed - so ministers are now fulfilling their promise to allow some three million British Overseas Nationals to come to the UK. This is a significant move and the government wants to send a strong message. But there will be more pressure now to rethink other elements of our relationship with China - not least the deal to allow Huawei to build parts of the UK's 5G structures. Many Tory MPs have been lobbying against that for some time - and this will only add to their concern. Updating MPs on the details, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said there would be no limit on numbers or quotas and the application process would be simple. ""This is a special, bespoke, set of arrangements developed for the unique circumstances we face and in light of our historic commitment to the people of Hong Kong,"" he said. Speaking to ITV's Peston programme, Mr Raab acknowledged there ""would be little we could do toâ¦cohesively force"" China to allow British Overseas Nationals to come to the UK. What is a BNO passport? The background you need on Hong Kong's protests What is behind the Hong Kong citizenship offer? Downing Street said further details of the scheme will be detailed ""in due course"". In the meantime, British National Overseas Passport holders in Hong Kong will be able to travel to the UK immediately, subject to standard immigration checks, the prime minister's official spokesman said. They will also will not face salary thresholds to gain their visas, he added. Hong Kong's new national security law, which targets secession, subversion and terrorism with punishments up to life in prison, came into effect on Tuesday. By Grace Tsoi, BBC World Service, Hong Kong I was born in Hong Kong before 1997, the year when Hong Kong was handed back to Chinese rule. That means I had a British National Overseas (BNO) passport as a child. When the news broke that BNO passport holders were eligible for British citizenship after living and working in the UK for five years, and after spending another year of being granted settled status, many of my friends were excited. They say at least there's a way out for Hong Kongers after the national security law came into force. But many questions remain. Currently there are 350,000 BNO passport holders, but about three million Hong Kong residents are eligible for BNO passports - and that doesn't appear to include dependants born after 1997. Will the UK be ready to take in so many Hong Kong residents? Will there be enough jobs? Will BNO passport holders have recourse to public funds? And will they be covered by the NHS? Some also say it's good that there's a lifeboat, but do they really want to leave their home? Several people have already been arrested under the new powers, including a man carrying a pro-independence flag as police used pepper spray to disperse some protesters gathered to mark 23 years since British rule ended. Critics say it effectively puts an end to the ""one country, two systems"" principle enshrined in the Joint Declaration. China has rejected criticism of its actions, saying they are internal matters. British National Overseas Passports do not confer nationality or the automatic right to live and work in the UK The UK government has come under growing pressure to take a firm line with Beijing from MPs, who are worried about China's increasingly assertive role regionally and the security implications of Chinese firm Huawei's involvement in the UK's 5G network. This video can not be played Hong Kong residents on controversial security law Mr Raab said he wanted a positive relationship with China but Beijing had ""broken its promise"" to the people of Hong Kong through its ""flagrant assault"" on freedom of speech and right of peaceful assembly. Labour said it welcomed the government's action but said there must be no discrimination on those allowed into the UK on the basis of income or other factors. Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said the UK also had a responsibility to consider the welfare of those who were not able to re-locate or who wished to stay in Hong Kong. She urged the government to work with its international partners, through the UN, to force an inquiry into police brutality in Hong Kong and also called for the UK to re-examine its commercial relationship with China. ""For too long in relation to China we've had no strategy at home and no strategy abroad. I hope he can give us a commitment today that this marks the start of a very different era,"" she said.

"National Records of Scotland figures say 35 deaths were linked to Covid-19 in the seven days to 28 June The figure is down 14 on the previous week, and is the ninth weekly reduction in a row The total number of weekly deaths has fallen below the five-year average for the first time since March First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the figures show that ""real and sustained"" progress is being made A cross-border cluster has been identified, with nine cases in the Gretna and Annan area BBC Scotland News That's all from us here at the live page on Wednesday 1 July. Here are the headlines from today: Both Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson have confirmed there have been no talks about local quarantine restrictions within the UK The outbreak involves the Annan and Gretna areas The cross-border ""cluster"" of coronavirus cases around Dumfries and the north west of England ""continues to illustrate the challenge we face with this virus"", according to Scotland's national clinical director. Professor Jason Leitch goes on to tell Radio Scotland: ""This will be, unfortunately, the new normal, for a little while, of these outbreaks and containing them."" NHS Dumfries and Gallowayconfirmed there had been nine new cases of Covid-19 in the Gretna and Annan areas since Monday. Prof Leitch says if the group of positive cases can be contained and contact and trace works as it should, then ""you can close down that cluster without too much more trouble"". The danger is if the contacts can't be traced then potentially something more severe might have to be done, he adds. Prof Leitch hopes that will not happen and he says the incident management team on both sides of the border is meeting now and he is confident the process will work. The national clinical director stresses that people must organise a test if they have the symptoms and tell the truth regarding their movements, so that their contacts can be traced to close down the chain of transmission.

He thinks the UK government has a duty to provide for each and every business. And it should not expect to see the money back. This is not a conventional recession and I don't think we should address it with conventional approaches - increased government spending soft loans lower interest rates etc. I think this is more akin to disaster relief that's required. Every company in Scotland small or big is a national asset. It employs people, pays taxes. contributes to the national wellbeing and it's essential we provide the ability for each and every company however small to survive so it can come again.

The UK missed out on the chance to take part in EU schemes to source medical equipment during the coronavirus outbreak because the information was sent to an outdated email address, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said.

The EU started to co-ordinate the purchasing of personal protective equipment, testing kits and ventilators in February. In a letter to the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, Raab said: ""The relevant EU committee, the Joint Procurement Agreement Steering Committee [JPASC], was relaunched by the European Commission in September 2019, after three years of not meeting.

Both Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson have confirmed there have been no talks about local quarantine restrictions within the UK The idea of quarantining visitors entering Scotland from other parts of the UK is ""astonishing and shameful"", Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.

However both leaders said there had been no talks about the potential for new travel restrictions to be imposed. Ms Sturgeon said it would be ""frankly disgraceful"" to politicise the issue. She said if advisors told her that a quarantine rule would be ""a necessary measure to protect people"" then she would be ""failing in my duty not to consider it"". Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Deaths in Scotland from all causes are below the average for this time of the year for the first time since lockdown. But coronavirus has not gone away and we will have to deal with local outbreaks like the cross-border cluster revealed earlier today between Dumfries and Galloway and the North West of England. Professor Jason Leitch, Scotland's national clinical director, and George
Mathewson, former chair of the Royal Bank of Scotland, are among today's guests. The programme also looks at the phenomenal success of the couch-to-5K fitness initiative and the postponement of the Up Helly Aa fire festival. Allow Twitter content?

Two people have tested positive for coronavirus at RAF Lossiemouth in Moray. They are believed to be non-airforce staff, working for the contractor Volker Fitzpatrick at the base. Those involved were not showing any symptoms of Covid-19 but were picked up during regular testing of the Volker Fitzpatrick workforce. RAF officials said the work of the base had not been affected but that all necessary measures were being taken. Â© 2025 BBC.

Ian YoungsEntertainment and Arts Reporter, BBC News Gemma Sutton, Clive Rowe and Tameka Empson in Aladdin at the Hackney Empire in 2018 Oh yes it is. Oh no it isn't. The big question facing many theatres at the moment is - is panto season cancelled? Norwich Theatre Royal became one of the first to call off its pantomime this week, saying the risk was ""too great"" after three months with no income. Venues in Buxton and Welwyn Garden City have also cancelled, while Leicester Curve has scrapped its festive musical. Pantos are crucial to theatre earnings, and this Christmas could prove to be make or break for some venues' futures. Conservative MP Giles Watling, a former actor and panto dame, warned of the impact if festive shows are scrapped. ""I think many provincial theatres will go to the wall, frankly, because that's the time they can make the money,"" he told BBC News. ""It puts money in the coffers to support the rest of the cultural offer. I can see massive problems ahead if something isn't done and soon."" Read more here. Sarah CampbellBBC News/Royal Correspondent Will the Royal Family embrace life on Zoom? Three months ago when lockdown began, it was hard to see how, in isolation, the Royal Family could unite the nation as it had previously done in times of crisis. The Prince of Wales, the heir to the throne, had tested positive for Covid-19. He and the Duchess of Cornwall self-isolated in Scotland. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, both in their 90s, retreated behind Windsor Castle's walls. The institution had already been rocked by the departure of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the Duke of York ""stepping back"". Yet with each day, the death toll rose and a nation needed reassurance. Within a week Prince Charles, who suffered only mild symptoms of the virus, was able to release a video describing his ""strange, frustrating and often distressing experience"". The video was recorded at his home on the Balmoral estate. Perhaps it was the setting - the crammed bookshelves, the family photo, the teddy bear on the mantelpiece - or the heartfelt, personal delivery - but it felt intimate and set the tone for how the Royal Family went on to communicate with the nation during lockdown. See here for more from Sarah. Bar patrons in Texas Florida and Texas are among the states most affected by the huge surge in US virus cases. Here are what some of the people living there had to say. Alisha Hoath, 22 - Boca Raton, Florida There was a period when everyone began to forget about the virus. I even thought things were getting better for a while. For the most part I know I could be doing better with social distancing. I've been going to yoga classes and took a trip to a hotel in Miami for the weekend which was probably not my best decision. But we made sure to keep six feet apart and wear masks. Genesis Valbuena, 26 - Austin, Texas Some bar owners here in Austin are vocally going against what we need to do - criticising the data and suing the government for shutting them down. If we continue to do this, we are going to be shut down for the rest of the year. For me that's completely narcissistic. How certain bar owners are acting is ludicrous. The reopening should have been done less quickly.

Tamoor Tariq, a councillor for Bury Council, in Greater Manchester, is now recovering from the virus. He urged people to ""not take for granted"" the seriousness of the illness. Reality Check Peru imposed one of the earliest and strictest lockdowns in Latin America to stop the spread of coronavirus - but it now has the sixth highest number of confirmed cases in the world. Peru's President, MartÃ­n Vizcarra, says things are improving but has previously said results of the lockdown ""haven't been exactly what we expected"". So why has Peru been affected so badly? The lockdown in Peru started on 16 March - before the UK and some other European countries - and lasted until the end of June. Daily reported cases are now falling - but the number of deaths remains high. Officially, as of 30 June, around than 9,600 people had died with coronavirus in Peru. But the country hasone of the world's highest excess death rates- the number of deaths above the average in previous years - which suggests the impact far exceeds official figures. Why have measures been ineffective? Peru has reported more cases than every European country apart from the UK, despite testing only about seven people in every 1,000 - more than some countries in Latin America but far fewer than Italy, for example, which has tested about 88 in every 1,000. Experts say Peru's healthcare system was underprepared, leading to more deaths, but several other social and economic factors can help explain why Peru is struggling to contain the outbreak. Read more here Sonia KatariaBBC News Some children who live in the Leicester lockdown zone but attend school outside of the area will not be able to cross the border, the Department for Education (DfE) has confirmed. From Thursday, only vulnerable children and children of key
workers can travel across the boundary in either direction for school or
appointments with social workers. Other
children have been asked to stay at home. The DfE said: ""If you are a child or young person (other than a vulnerable child or child of a critical worker) that lives in Leicester but attends school or college outside the affected area, you must stay at home."" Some children who attend St Lukeâs Primary School in Thurnby, Leicestershire, which is outside the zone and will be open as normal tomorrow, are from within the boundary. Headteacher Paul Galvin said he was ""deeply sorry"" to the families of those affected. He said: ""It might be difficult for families who are inside the lockdown zone - as we are just outside the boundary - especially if they are not children of critical workers."" He added the school has ""adapted and will keep adapting to changes"" during the coronavirus pandemic. The school has been open since the lockdown in March for vulnerable children and children of key workers, and reopened for Reception and Year 1 in June. A ""small"" outbreak of coronavirus among workers at a bed factory in West Yorkshire has been confirmed. Eight members of staff at the Dura Beds factory in Batley have tested positive for the virus this week, a statement says. All staff - a total of 107 workers - will now be offered tests, according to the joint statement by Kirklees Council and Public Health England (PHE). The Dura Beds factory has been closed for two weeks as a safety precaution for its employees and their families, the statement adds. The firm is now ""working closely"" with the council and PHE so those who have tested positive can be followed up by the NHS Test and Trace programme and self-isolate. People who might have come into contact with an infected individual will be contacted and may be advised to self-isolate for 14 days. The statement adds: ""While the risk to residents from this outbreak is very low, everyone in Kirklees should continue to socially distance, wash hands regularly for 20 seconds with soap and water and get tested if they have symptoms."" Across the UK, the number of newly confirmed coronavirus cases each day has been falling since a peak in April. You can read morehere. Councils in England need urgent support as they face a funding gap of Â£7.4bn due to a loss of income related to coronavirus,the Local Government Association (LGA) says. Local authorities have come under increased pressure during the pandemic as demand for services such as social care has grown, while at the same time, income from local taxation and charges has dropped. James Jamieson, chairman of the LGA, which represents English councils and London boroughs, said ""further funding and flexibilities are now urgent"" if councils are to avoid taking steps such as ""in-year cuts to local services"" to cope with funding gaps. Whitehall has given Â£3.2bn funding to all English councils in two grants to help cover coronavirus costs, but the LGA says between March and June councils had already incurred costs of Â£4.8bn. Almost 44,000 people have died with coronavirus in the UK according to the latest daily government figures - which count deaths with a positive test result. But the overall total is likely to be higher. You can read morehere. Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter As Leicester, in England's East Midlands, has become the first city put under a local lockdown, misleading claims have been shared on social media. A string of local councils have posted on Twitter and Facebook to counter online rumours of imminent lockdowns in their areas - making it clear none have been announced. A rise in cases has been recorded in some local authority areasbut a Public Health England (PHE) spokesperson told the BBC that using this data to predict which areas would see significant rises in cases is ""not appropriate"" because it doesn't give a ""complete picture"" of the local situation. Meanwhile, a number of social media posts attributing the local lockdown in Leicester to videos of crowds of people taking part in anti-racism protests in the city centre a few weeks ago have led to racist and abusive comments directed at protesters. We've identified posts in Facebook groups that may have sparked some of the rumours. You can read morehere. Uganda hosts more than 400,000 refugees from DR Congo alone and many more from South Sudan Uganda has opened part of its border with the Democratic Republic of Congo to allow in thousands of people stuck in no-man's land for more than a month due to the coronavirus pandemic. At least 3,000 of them fled their homes in May after inter-communal clashes in north-eastern Ituri province. But they were unable to cross into Uganda to seek safety as the country had closed its borders in March to control the spread of coronavirus. It has been agreed the refugees will be quarantined before being settled. This will happen for 14 days at a new isolation centre, 13km (eight miles) from the border. The UN's refugee agency (UNHCR) says sample testing will be carried out on the group to see if coronavirus is present among them. This will help authorities decide when the refugees can be transferred to camps. Read more here. Simon JackBBC Business Editor The worldwide economic impact of the coronavirus has been seismic and the job losses are starting to crash on the shores of the UK with increasing frequency and severity. The 1,700 UK job losses at Airbus had a grim inevitability to them, given the destruction of demand in the aviation industry. Demand for air travel in April and May was down more than 90% and normality is not expected to return for up to three years - maybe never for the more lucrative business class travel. BA, Easyjet, Ryanair and Rolls Royce have already announced 20,000 job losses between them, so Airbus was never going to emerge unscathed. The travel wipeout has seen SSP, the owner of stalwart transport hub tenants Upper Crust and CafÃ© Ritazza, cut 5,000 posts.  We already know that the number of workers on UK payrolls shrank more than 600,000 between March and May, according to the ONS. That looks like the thin end of a very big wedge as the government's unprecedented job support scheme tapers off, with employers being asked to share the burden of the cost from the end of July to its withdrawal at the end of October.

A number of filmmakers were asked to make short films during lockdown, with no crew or budget, for the streaming service Netflix. As she tells the BBC's Alex Stanger, the end result was a very personal affair.  Matt Forward with his hawk in Trafalgar Square Whether it's nurses, carers or supermarket staff, key workers have rightly been hailed as heroes during lockdown. But behind the pandemic's front line there have also been many others who have been busy doing essential jobs. Matt Forward's job is to keep the pigeons away from Trafalgar Square, in central London. Pest management was covered in the key worker list, so throughout the lockdown Matt drove himself and his Harris hawk 45 miles (70km) to the iconic square early two mornings a week. Matt, who lives in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said he never thought of stopping his job because of lockdown. ""If someone wasn't there doing the job that we do, we'd be overrun,"" he says. Read more about how lockdown has been for Britain's unlikely key workers here Mark EastonHome editor Most of Britain is preparing for an easing of lockdown restrictions. But public
concern at the risks from coronavirus has risen to the highest level since the
end of April, a new poll conducted by Ipsos Mori this week suggests. However,
the survey also says the public is becoming more comfortable about
returning to work and sending children back to school. A month
ago, 37% of those surveyed said they were âvery concernedâ about the risks to
the country.  This new poll suggests that has risen to 50%. Concern about
the risks to individuals has also risen from 24% to 29%. The
survey asks people whether they would feel comfortable in a range of situations
if lockdown measures were lifted.  The proportion of parents who said they
would be comfortable sending their children to school has risen to 49%, up from
38% a month earlier. Two-thirds of people would be comfortable meeting friends or family outside their
household, also a rise from six weeks before. But the poll suggests around six in 10 people would be anxious going to bars or restaurants, using public
transport or lavatories and only 15% said they would be comfortable going to
large sport or music events. Ipsos MORI interviewed a representative sample of 1,078 British adults aged 18-75 online between 26-29 June 2020. Data are weighted to match the profile of the population. All polls are subject to a wide range of potential sources of error. Prof Van-Tam speaking at the government's daily news briefing on 30 May Here's some more from the government's Science and Technology committee hearing that's been going on this afternoon. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer, has said there are enough doses of remdesivir for use on hospitalised patients in the UK. It comes on the back of news that theUS had secured almost all of the forthcoming global supply of the drug, which has been shown to help people recover from Covid-19 more quickly. Prof Van-Tam said: ""Right now, there are stocks in the UK - and I judge us to have adequate stocks - of pre-licensed, as in unlicensed, clinical trial stocks of remdesivir which are available to be used through the emergency access protocol."" Remdesivir is produced by the US firm Gilead Sciences and is the first drug to have been approved by authorities in the US to be used to treat the disease. The US administration is set to receive 500,000 doses - or 100% of the company's supply production - in July, 90% of it in August and 90% in September.  ValeTodo Downtown has become the Downtown Market Peru's largest LGBT nightclub has reopened its doors as lockdown eases - as a grocery store. ValeTodo Downtown is one of the best known dance floors in the capital, Lima. But the club's famed drag queens will now be serving milk, fruit and bread rather than cocktails as nightclubs are still not permitted to open. Times have been tough for the club's 120 employees since the pandemic hit. ""I was very depressed because I have been doing this art for years, but you have to adapt to new challenges for the future,"" Belaluh McQueen, who is identified by her stage name, told Reuters news agency. ""We have a new job opportunity,"" she added, standing in the newly named Downtown Market in a sequined suit, high heels and a mask. ""Before, I used to come here to dance and have a good time, but now we come to buy,"" said Alexandra Herrera, a regular attendee of the club. ""The thing is to reinvent yourself.""

"More than 12,000 people in the UK are set to lose their jobs after a raft of firms announced cuts in the past 48 hours. The cuts are mainly being made by High Street retailers and in aviation - two of the sectors hardest hit by the coronavirus lockdown. John Lewis has said it will close stores but has not confirmed how many jobs will go. Topshop owner Arcadia and Harrods said they planned a total of 1,180 job cuts. Other lay-offs that have been announced include: Up to 5,000 job cutsat Upper Crust owner SSP Group Up to 700 jobs at Harrods About 600 workersat shirtmaker TM Lewin Up to 900 cuts at management consulting firm Accenture 300 staff cuts across Virgin Money, Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank 1,700 UK jobsat plane-maker Airbus And1,300 crew and 727 pilotsat EasyJet Have you recently been made redundant? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. WH Smith, Bensons for Beds, Wrights Pies, tableware-maker Steelite International, the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool and Norwich Theatre Royal have also announced plans to reduce staff. Businesses have been hit hard since the UK went into lockdown on 23 March, and even though restrictions are gradually being eased, consumer demand remains depressed. The government's furlough scheme will also start to be pared back from August, and firms are cutting jobs to control their costs. James Phillips could be made redundant James Phillips, a mechanical engineer, told the BBC he fears he could be made redundant. He has been on furlough since March but has now been asked to attend a redundancy consultation meeting with his employer. He said: ""I'm three months away from having a baby, and I was about to sign for a mortgage this week on a new property, so it's impacted me massively, really. Everything's been put on hold."" Sue Hudson lost her job as a legal secretary at a solicitors in Bournemouth in April and has not found a job since. ""There are too many people chasing too few jobs,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""It's very disheartening."" For most businesses, staffing is the highest cost, and many have been using the government's furlough schemes to keep workers on. But the programme - which is paying 80% of the wages of more than 9 million workers - will start to be pared back from next month and will end in October. Upper Crust owner SSP has announced 5,000 job cuts As firms have to consult for 30-45 days when making redundancies, some will feel that now is the time to act. ""There is already a cost to the employer from just a month's time,"" said BBC business correspondent Simon Gompertz. ""Larger employers, planning bigger layoffs, will be eyeing that escalating wage bill and maybe thinking the sooner they move the better."" In an email to staff, Harrods' managing director Michael Ward said the department store was making its cuts with a heavy heart. ""Due to the ongoing impacts of this pandemic, we as a business will need to make reductions to our workforce."" He said it would take a ""drastic improvement in external conditions"" for Harrods to recover and return to growth. John Lewis, which was already looking to ""right size"" its business before the crisis, said it had not decided which shops would close. ""The reality is that we have too much store space for the way people want to shop now,"" the company said in a statement. Topshop owner Arcadia, which is slashing a fifth of its head office staff, also blamed the pandemic for its cuts. ""Due to the impact of Covid-19 on our business including the closure for over three months of all our stores and head offices, we have today informed staff of the need to restructure our head offices,"" it said. The reason the government has thrown tens of billions of pounds at trying to hold back the waves of unemployment is they realise that it does long-lasting damage to demand in the economy. There is no doubt that the furlough scheme helped delay the impact, but this barrage of job cut announcements suggests the government is now struggling to turn the tide. Boris Johnson described the virus as ""still circling like a shark in our waters"". It was an odd metaphor to use, considering the PM has previously praised the Mayor in Jaws for keeping the beaches open. One thing seems certain: to combat the huge economic shock whose repercussions are being felt in airlines, factories and now high streets, the government will need a bigger boat than the Â£5bn of previously announced spending accelerated yesterday. The pressure is now on Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Read more Harrods said the ""devastation in international travel"" had meant it had lost ""key customers"" Retailers were already struggling before the coronavirus due to changes in shopping habits as consumers buy more online, as well as rising wages and business rates. But the coronavirus crisis has placed huge pressure on an already weakened sector. The vast majority of shops were told to shut in March when the UK went into lockdown, prompting a sharp fall in sales. And while demand rebounded 12% in May,retail it remains well below pre-lockdown levels. Demand for air travel in April and May was down more than 90%, as airlines were hit hard by global lockdown measures and travel restrictions. And normal levels of demand are not expected to return for up to three years. While planes aren't flying, airlines aren't making money, but they still have funds flying out of the door. And firms that rely on airlines flying, such as commercial aerospace businesses, have decreased production. Along with cuts at Airbus, Ryanair and EasyJet, British Airways has announced plans to slash 12,000 jobs - almost a quarter of its workforce. Meanwhile, engineering giant Rolls-Royce, which makes jet engines, will cut 3,000 jobs across the UK.

"Wings for all the Airbus commercial planes are made in Wales Plans to cut 1,700 UK Airbus jobs have been described as ""utterly devastating"" by a Welsh minister. Economy, Transport and North Wales Minister Ken Skates called on the UK government to take ""decisive action"" to support the flight sector. Mr Skates said a ""significant share"" of the job losses were expected at Broughton, in Flintshire. The company said it planned to cut 15,000 jobs in total as it dealt with the effects of the coronavirus crisis. The site in Broughton makes wings forthe Airbus A380, which is the world's largest passenger plane. Mr Skates said ""compulsory action"" at the Broughton site, which employs 6,000, could not be ruled out. He said within the next three weeks he would be convening a high level summit to discuss the future of the aerospace, automotive and manufacturing sector and he would be pressing the UK government to take part. The minister added it was ""vital"" the UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak ""takes the lead"", calling for an ""evolution"" of the furlough scheme to support a shorter working week. Ken Skates called on the UK government to take ""decisive action"" to save jobs at Airbus in Broughton ""Nobody should be under any illusion about the impact covid is having on aerospace, a critical part of the Welsh economy,"" Mr Skates said. ""The sector is in crisis and the UK government needs to take swift and decisive action now to save the industry and its supply chain. ""The alarm bells have been sounding for weeks and we need urgent steps at a UK level to prevent this crisis becoming even worse."" Allow Twitter content?

""There is a role for Welsh Government in this too, don't forget they protect their devolved areas very carefullyâ¦ I'm looking forward to hearing what the first minister is going to do, what Ken Skates is going to do and what their role is in this rather than complain about the UK."" Meanwhile, at Prime Minister's Questions in Westminster, Cardiff South and Penarth MP Stephen Doughty asked what Boris Johnson was doing to help workers who ""don't want to hear slogans"". The prime minister said there was a ""Â£600bn plan for investment"" in jobs. This video can not be played Airbus: ""Most people who live in the area, work here"" At the Welsh Government's daily coronavirus briefing on Wednesday, Mr Skates said ministers would not ""abandon"" Airbus workers and would do all they could to help.

Flintshire council leader Ian Roberts said he would ""like to hear assurances that there will be a two-government approach to this"". He told BBC Radio Wales: ""Too often governments blame each other."" First Minister Mark Drakeford responded, saying he would ""definitely agree that all levels of government will need to work together very closely"".

Plane-maker Airbus to cut 15,000 jobs Airbus furloughs 3,200 staff Airbus settles corruption probe for â¬3.6bn Unite Wales Regional Secretary Peter Hughes urged the UK government to act: ""If the UK government does not step in now to ensure the support is there for Airbus to get through this crisis, the consequences for Wales could be catastrophic."" He said the union would ""not accept any proposal that involves compulsory redundancy for our members"". He called on Airbus to ""hold their nerve and step back from implementing their plan"". More details of the job losses and how they will break down between the two giant factories will come at the end of the week after talks with unions. The firm expects to make the cuts by summer 2021, but hopes the majority of redundancies will be voluntary or through early retirement of staff. Mr Skates said his thoughts were with workers and their families. ""As a Welsh Government we will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the company, its workforce, the unions and the communities impacted by this,"" he said. Airbus employs more than 6,000 people at its site in Broughton Plaid Cymru's Llyr Gruffydd warned two-thirds of the 1,700 job losses could be in Broughton. The Member of the Senedd for North Wales said workers had told him that they expected to potentially lose 1,100 jobs. He said Airbus supported another three local jobs for every one at the firm. ""We are talking about 25,000 dependent on Airbus in Broughton for their work,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Airbus: ""Most people who live in the area, work here"" When the fortune of a town is so inextricably linked to one employer, any threat to jobs will have a ""devastating"" effect on the local community. Airbus is to Broughton what Hoover once was to Merthyr Tydfil, Ford to Bridgend and Tata Steel still is to Port Talbot. More people are employed at the Airbus factory than live in Broughton itself. So it is little wonder jobs losses are seen as a ""hammer blow"" to the area. The company said it planned to cut 15,000 jobs in total,including 1,700 in its UK sites at Flintshire and Bristol, as it dealt with the effects of the coronavirus crisis. ""The majority of people living in the area work there so [job losses] are going to be a great shame to a lot of people. I have family working there, everyone is going to impacted,"" said one resident. ""I thought I had a job for life, I'm devastated,"" said worker Ross Leeding Another added: ""It's a big part of the community, one of the main sources of jobs around here. So if anything happens it would have a big blow - devastating. On the shop floor, the mood has been ""sombre"" since the news broke. ""People are shocked and the uncertainty over numbers is only adding to that,"" said worker Daz Reynolds, of the Unite union. Plane-maker Airbus to cut 15,000 jobs Aerospace industry 'will take years' to recover ""People have families to feed and they want to know what their future looks like at Airbus. It's simple. ""This is going to have a devastating effect. There are highly-skilled workers here but also thousands of people in the supply chain in towns and villages across north-east Wales and Cheshire. Everyone knows someone who works with Airbus."" Agency worker Ross Leeding, already on furlough, added: ""I wish they would tell us if we're being made redundant or not - not maybe. It's frustrating not to know. ""I'm devastated. I was happy here and thought I had a job for life here. I'm 60 years old now, so where am I going to get a job like this? ""There are others with kids, mortgages, loans who are worse off than me. It's the bread and butter for Broughton."" Airbus employs more than 6,000 people at its site in Broughton The aftershocks from job losses are likely to ripple out across the entire region, to suppliers and the local economy that has been built around the success and size of Airbus. Ben Francis, policy chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses, said it was ""extremely worrying news"". He added: ""The importance of Airbus to the north Wales economy cannot be overstated. There are families, communities, and small businesses who rely on Airbus, as does the wider regional economy."" Thomas Smith runs the nearby New Glynne Arms inn that relies on Airbus staff for trade. Hundreds of British Airways jobs under threat Welsh aviation sector needs 'major intervention' ""We rely on passing trade so if you take away thousands of people, it's terrifying to think what might happen,"" he said. ""It's going to affect the local economy big time because so many work there. You just don't know what the future is."" Local businesses will also be badly affected, said local pub landlord Thomas Smith Wrexham MS Lesley Griffiths said the effects would be felt ""throughout"" the local supply chain and Flintshire council leader Ian Roberts said the factory was of ""immense"" importance for the county. ""It's devastating for Flintshire and the wider region - 50% of the workers come from outside the county,"" said Mr Roberts. There is concern that job losses will not only affect current staff, but young people in the area. Coleg Cambria in Connah's Quay offers engineering students an undergraduate apprenticeship with Airbus. Thousands more people are employed in the supply chain around the Broughton site David Jones, a former chief executive of the college, said the scheme was the biggest of its kind in the UK with 150 new apprentices joining each year. ""With older people and other workers that receive training, around 1,000 people are linked with Airbus training in Coleg Cambria and other colleges and universities,"" said Mr Jones. ""The goal now must be to win the contract to build a new type of wing that will be developed over the next five years. ""There are huge developments in the aerospace sector, meaning that wings will be produced in completely different ways to today. ""Whoever manages to secure that next contract, it will be hugely important regarding the long term future of wing building in north east Wales.""

"Hong Kong police make their first arrests under a new ""anti-protest"" law imposed by Beijing The legislation comes into effect as the city marks 23 years since the end of British rule Police fire water cannon and detain hundreds of people at demonstrations marking the anniversary The new security law targets secession, subversion and terrorism with punishments up to life in prison Critics say it erodes freedoms that were meant to be guaranteed by China for at least 50 years from 1997 China rejects criticism from foreign countries, saying it will not allow interference in its domestic affairs Up to three million Hong Kong residents are to be offered the chance to settle in the UK Edited by Robert Greenall We are ending our live updates of Wednesday's protests in Hong Kong that follow the introduction of a controversial new security law imposed by Beijing. Thank you for being with us. Here's a recap of the day's main events: Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The central Chinese government has been striving to promote the necessity of the new Hong Kong bill today, and its media have been highlighting the multiple arrests that have already taken place today. But at the same time, mainland-based outlets have been nervous about showing footage of these arrests themselves, because of the presence of pro-democracy slogans. Media have either pixelated these or avoided showing today's demonstrations altogether, because they don't want mainlanders to see them. Generally, broadcasters in the country have shied from showing fresh demonstrations today, instead showing footage of senior officials voicing their support for the law, emphasising that it is necessary for the island, and does not violate the âone country two systemsâ policy. In footage of demonstrators that is shown, people in mainland China are seeing blurred images of flags and t-shirts over slogans like âHong Kong independenceâ and âliberate Hong Kongâ. Critics have called the national security law ""the end of Hong Kong"" - so what do we know, and what do people fear the most? Hong Kong was always meant to have a security law, but the government failed to pass it because it was so unpopular. So this is about China stepping in to ensure the city has a legal framework to deal with what it sees as serious challenges to its authority. The details of the law were kept secret until after it was passed. They include:  You can read more about what the law says, and what it means,in this explainer from our reporters Grace Tsoi and Lam Cho Wai.  Martin YipBBC Chinese Some pro-democracy activists have held up their BNO passports at protests Over the years people have looked at their British National Overseas (BNO) and Hong Kong SAR (Chinese Hong Kong) passports in a mainly economic perspective. The Chinese Hong Kong passport is cheaper - HK$370 ($47.74; Â£38.87) for 32 pages for 10 years, while a 34-page BNO passport costs Â£105.86. Both can take you to a good number of countries visa-free, including, until now, a six-month stay in the UK. 

But oddities like being able to apply for an Australian electronic visa using a Chinese Hong Kong passport, and the type of consulate protection you could get in some less developed countries, does affect Hong Kong peopleâs perception of the two passports. Now Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has revealed more details of Downing Streetâs offer. BNOs might feel safer as the exit door is cleared up. But that need not mean full peace of mind. Many issues remain. How to get a job in the UK to begin with, when the whole world is in deep economic trouble thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic. Many in Hong Kong might feel greater restrictions by Beijing will force them to leave Also, as former prime minister Theresa May once said, âBrexit means Brexitâ. Many Brexiteers donât like migrants. How the British public greets an influx of Hong Kongers could well affect whether they feel comfortable to move there. China might also retaliate. A pro-Beijing tabloid threatened earlier that China could void BNOs' Hong Kong residency, Chinese citizenship, and most importantly, voting rights. If that turns out to be the case, it would be unnerving. This video can not be played Hong Kong police clash with protesters opposing new security law Images from earlier today show police clashing with demonstrators, firing tear gas and making arrests. Police say 370 people have been detained - 10 of them under the new national security law. In an interview with Associated Press, media tycoon Jimmy Lai has said the territory's new security law has rendered Hong Kong ""dead"". ""It's worse than the worst scenario imagined. Hong Kong is totally subdued, totally under control,"" he said. Mr Lai, 72, is the founder of clothing retailer Giordano and tabloid newspaper Apple Daily. He supported the Tiananmen Square protesters in 1989 and has since become an outspoken advocate for greater democracy in China. Mr Lai said he will continue to fight for democracy, but in a ""very different way"". He and 14 other pro-democracy figures are already facing charges for taking part in anti-government protests last year, but he says he is unfazed by the prospect of prison. ""I cannot worry, because you never know what kind of measures they will take against me,"" said Mr Lai. ""It won't be something I can worry about, I'll just relax and do what I have to do."" Hong Kong Police have updated their tally of arrests, saying 370 people were detained during today's protests - 10 of them for breaching the new national security law. Seven police officers were also injured during the day, including one who was allegedly stabbed by a ""rioter"". Earlier today, police said the stabbing suspects had fled while onlookers stood by.

Helier CheungBBC News Supporters of the law have argued that it will only affect
a small number of people â and is essential to restore stability to Hong Kong. Starry Lee â from the pro-Beijing DAB party, said the
national security law would âgive Hong Kong a new chanceâ¦ to leave behind the
violence haze of the past year and start againâ. Meanwhile, legislator Regina Ip â who was Hong Kongâs security
chief back in 2003, when the government last attempted to introduce national
security legislation - said she welcomed the passing of the law because it
filled a âlegal gap in Hong Kongâs national securityâ. âAs part of the country [China], of course Hong Kong has a
duty to protect the nationâs security,â she said. She added that since Beijing
announced the national security law in May, some activists who supported
independence for Hong Kong had left the territory, or quit political
organisations. âFrom this, you can see that the national security law does have
a deterrent effect â and I believe this will help to calm down the riots of the
past year.â Hong Kong saw sustained anti-government protests â many of which
turned violent â in 2019 as demonstrators protested against a law that would
have allowed extraditions to mainland China, and demanded democratic reform and
an independent investigation into alleged police brutality. Polls conducted by Reuters news agency,externalsuggest that a majority of people in Hong Kong (56%) are opposed to the national
security law, but that support for pro-democracy protests has slipped from 59%
in December 2019 to 51% in June. Analysts have suggested this could in part be
because the new legislation means people no longer see the protesters' demands as practical. Regina Ip (centre) at an event celebrating Hong Kong's handover on Tuesday This video can not be played Former UK consulate worker says he was tortured in China Simon Cheng, a former employee of the UK's consulate in Hong Kong who says he was tortured by the Chinese police, has been granted political asylum in Britain. Mr Cheng, a Hong Kong citizen, was detained for 15 days while on a trip to mainland China in August 2019.

During that time he says he was tortured and accused of inciting political unrest in Hong Kong. You can read the full story here.  Climate campaigner Greta Thunberg has send a message of support for the protests - and in return received thanks from a leading pro-democracy activist. On Twitter, Ms Thunberg said: ""My thoughts are with the people of Hong Kong."" She retweeted a post by pro-democracy campaigner Joshua Wong which showed scenes from Wednesday's protests. In reply, Mr Wong said her support meant a lot ""during such a difficult time and critical moment"", adding: ""Together we are one loud voice that cannot be silenced."" Allow Twitter content?

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said the US is ""deeply concerned"" about sweeping provisions under Hong Kong's new national security law, and about ""the safety of everyone living in the territory, including Americans"". Speaking in Washington, he called Article 38 of the new national law ""an affront to all nations"". The article allows foreigners to be arrested on arrival in Hong Kong if they are suspected of breaking the law. ""On Monday we announced we would end defence equipment and dual use technology exports of US origin going to the territory. We will continue to implement [US] President Trump's directive to end Hong Kong's special status,"" Mr Pompeo added. Helier CheungBBC News One of the most significant developments of the new law is
the fact Beijing will establish a new security office in Hong Kong, with its
own law enforcement personnel â whose operations will not fall under Hong Kongâs
jurisdiction. Their vehicles will also be exempt from searches by Hong
Kong police. Until now, mainland Chinese police were not expected to operate in
Hong Kong. The law also requires the government to âpromote national
security educationâ and âstrengthenâ¦ regulation over matters concerning
national securityâ in schools, universities, the media and the internet â sparking
some concerns over academic and media freedom. In cases that concern national security or state secrets, trials
can be held without a jury, or be closed to the media and the public â and the
government can issue a binding decision on whether a particular act involves
national security, or the evidence involves state secrets. Eric Cheung Tat-ming, a legal scholar from the University of
Hong Kong, wrote online that the law was âeven worse than the
worst-case-scenario Iâd imaginedâ. The text of the law was full of mainland Chinese legal characteristics
that were âvery different from the spirit and letter of Hong Kongâs common lawâ,
he added. Students have previously held pro-democracy protests outside their schools Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive, has been criticised for her support of the new law China's new national security law, passed yesterday, gives Beijing powers to shape life in Hong Kong it has never had before. Critics say it effectively curtails freedom of speech and other freedoms enshrined in Hong Kong's mini constitution, known as the Basic Law. China says it will return stability. There are reports of people deleting Facebook posts, and concerns that candidates opposing the national security law will be disqualified from running in elections. Many are also afraid Hong Kong's judicial independence will be eroded and its judicial system will look increasingly similar to mainland China's. The city is the only common law jurisdiction in China. Some pro-democracy activists - such as Joshua Wong - have been lobbying foreign governments to help their cause. Such campaigning could become a crime in the future. He has now quit his Demosisto party. People also worry that a threat to Hong Kong's liberties could affect its attractiveness as a leading global business hub and economic powerhouse. Grace TsoiBBC World Service, Hong Kong I was born in Hong Kong before 1997, the year when Hong Kong was handed back to Chinese rule. That means I had a British National Overseas (BNO) passport as a child. After years of using the HKSAR passport, I renewed my long-expired BNO passport last year when the city was embroiled in months-long protests. I wasnât exactly sure what to expect from renewing the BNO passport, which had always been seen as another travel document available for Hong Kong residents. When the news broke that BNO passport holders are eligible for British citizenship after living and working in the UK for five years, and after spending another year of being granted settled status, many of my friends were excited. They say at least thereâs a way out for Hong Kongers after the national security law came into force. But many questions remain. Currently there are 350,000 BNO passport holders, but about three million Hong Kong residents are eligible for BNO passports â and that doesnât appear to include dependants born after 1997. Will the UK be ready to take in so many Hong Kong residents? Will there be enough jobs? Will BNO passport holders have recourse to public funds? And will they be covered by the NHS? Some also say itâs good that thereâs a lifeboat, but do they really want to leave their home? Lord Christopher Patten - Hong Kong's final British governor before the 1997 handover - has described China's new national security law as Orwellian. He told BBC Radio 4's World At One that it ""drives a coach and horses through the international treaty that China has signedâ. âThe big game starts now,"" said Lord Patten. ""What weâve seen from China is a doubling down in their aggressive and loutish behaviour all around the world and weâve really got to workâ¦ with allies, not to start a cold war but to form a group of countries who will say âif you behave in this appalling fashion, China, weâre going to call you outâ.â âYou can lock up people, you canât lock up ideas,"" he added. ""I still believe that the belief in freedom and the rule of law is going to have a longer lifespan than Xi Jinpingâs extremely unpleasant, dictatorial, totalitarian communism.â Helier CheungBBC News The new law is seen as wide-reaching, and several elements
have left Hong Kongers â even those outside the territory â deeply concerned. Article 38 of the law specifies that the law applies to
offences committed outside of Hong Kong â including by people who are not Hong
Kong residents. One British Hong Konger, who asked not to be identified,
said she had started deleting posts critical of the government on social media,
as she feared she could be targeted next time she travelled to Hong Kong. âWith the new law I feel I have to self-censor everything
now. The law is written quite subjectively â you donât have any idea of what
you may do that may break the law.â âIt feels more oppressive than it used to be â especially because
my family members are still in Hong Kong and Iâm afraid it may affect them as
well.â Meanwhile, a Hong Kong American told me: âI decided to change
my Facebook name and switch to Signal after reading the details of the new law.â âSince it was written in such a way that could apply to my
actions abroad, I feel like it was wise to make it more difficult for people to
trace my criticism of China and the Hong Kong government back to me,
particularly if I were to return to Hong Kong to visit.â Hundreds have been arrested at protests in Hong Kong - and many abroad are now also fearful This video can not be played UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab tells MPs that China has enacted the new security law in ""a clear and serious breach of the Joint Declaration"" between China and Britain. Hong Kong Police have shared images of documents scattered by protesters around Times Square mall, which they say contain personal information on local officers. They said they ""regret"" the action by demonstrators, stressed that a court order banning the doxxing of officers and their families still stands. They also criticised media outlets for publishing images of the documents, saying it was ""tantamount to adding more harm to the police."" Grace TsoiBBC World Service, Hong Kong Hong Kong remains defiant after the national security law took effect. It was difficult to count how many turned up to the protests in different parts of Hong Kong Island, as most  donned neither black clothing, nor  gas mask or helmet. They stood in the open streets, near shopping malls and at Victoria Park, but sporadic chanting of slogans ranging from âwe will fight until the last breathâ to âHong Kongers, build a nationâ were heard â despite the heavy police presence. However, the chilling effect of the  national security law was felt while we were reporting on the ground. We were trying to talk to some protesters on the streets. Even though we made guarantees that their faces wouldnât be shown, we were rejected multiple times â it was much more difficult than before. We finally got lucky with a protester who was wearing a black t-shirt with the words âbeing born in uncertain times, carries certain responsibilitiesâ and holding a banner over his face. âI am protesting because I am very angry,"" he said. ""I am angry at the breach of the Basic Law. I am angry at the breach of  'one country, two systems'. And I am angry with the disrespect for human rights this national security law brings.â But after we were done with the interview, he said he was wondering whether he could be arrested for talking to foreign media â whether this would constitute collusion with foreign forces. Nathan Law, a founding member of pro-democracy group Demosisto, is expected to start speaking at a hearing of the US Foreign Affairs Committee about now. In a statement on Facebook, Mr Law said he will be discussing the impact of the new national security law on Hong Kong. He added that he risks personal repercussions from the Chinese government for speaking out, but hopes his testimony will raise international awareness of the law and what it means for Hong Kong residents. ""If we lose sight of it at the international level, Hong Kongâs resistance will fall into a more passive situation,"" said Mr Law. ""At the same time, the international community will lack a window to understand the rule of the CCPâs authoritarian system."" You can watch the proceedings here.,external Â© 2025 BBC.

"More than 12,000 people in the UK are set to lose their jobs after a raft of firms announced cuts in the past 48 hours. The cuts are mainly being made by High Street retailers and in aviation - two of the sectors hardest hit by the coronavirus lockdown. John Lewis has said it will close stores but has not confirmed how many jobs will go. Topshop owner Arcadia and Harrods said they planned a total of 1,180 job cuts. Other lay-offs that have been announced include: Up to 5,000 job cutsat Upper Crust owner SSP Group Up to 700 jobs at Harrods About 600 workersat shirtmaker TM Lewin Up to 900 cuts at management consulting firm Accenture 300 staff cuts across Virgin Money, Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank 1,700 UK jobsat plane-maker Airbus And1,300 crew and 727 pilotsat EasyJet Have you recently been made redundant? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. WH Smith, Bensons for Beds, Wrights Pies, tableware-maker Steelite International, the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool and Norwich Theatre Royal have also announced plans to reduce staff. Businesses have been hit hard since the UK went into lockdown on 23 March, and even though restrictions are gradually being eased, consumer demand remains depressed. The government's furlough scheme will also start to be pared back from August, and firms are cutting jobs to control their costs. James Phillips could be made redundant James Phillips, a mechanical engineer, told the BBC he fears he could be made redundant. He has been on furlough since March but has now been asked to attend a redundancy consultation meeting with his employer. He said: ""I'm three months away from having a baby, and I was about to sign for a mortgage this week on a new property, so it's impacted me massively, really. Everything's been put on hold."" Sue Hudson lost her job as a legal secretary at a solicitors in Bournemouth in April and has not found a job since. ""There are too many people chasing too few jobs,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""It's very disheartening."" For most businesses, staffing is the highest cost, and many have been using the government's furlough schemes to keep workers on. But the programme - which is paying 80% of the wages of more than 9 million workers - will start to be pared back from next month and will end in October. Upper Crust owner SSP has announced 5,000 job cuts As firms have to consult for 30-45 days when making redundancies, some will feel that now is the time to act. ""There is already a cost to the employer from just a month's time,"" said BBC business correspondent Simon Gompertz. ""Larger employers, planning bigger layoffs, will be eyeing that escalating wage bill and maybe thinking the sooner they move the better."" In an email to staff, Harrods' managing director Michael Ward said the department store was making its cuts with a heavy heart. ""Due to the ongoing impacts of this pandemic, we as a business will need to make reductions to our workforce."" He said it would take a ""drastic improvement in external conditions"" for Harrods to recover and return to growth. John Lewis, which was already looking to ""right size"" its business before the crisis, said it had not decided which shops would close. ""The reality is that we have too much store space for the way people want to shop now,"" the company said in a statement. Topshop owner Arcadia, which is slashing a fifth of its head office staff, also blamed the pandemic for its cuts. ""Due to the impact of Covid-19 on our business including the closure for over three months of all our stores and head offices, we have today informed staff of the need to restructure our head offices,"" it said. The reason the government has thrown tens of billions of pounds at trying to hold back the waves of unemployment is they realise that it does long-lasting damage to demand in the economy. There is no doubt that the furlough scheme helped delay the impact, but this barrage of job cut announcements suggests the government is now struggling to turn the tide. Boris Johnson described the virus as ""still circling like a shark in our waters"". It was an odd metaphor to use, considering the PM has previously praised the Mayor in Jaws for keeping the beaches open. One thing seems certain: to combat the huge economic shock whose repercussions are being felt in airlines, factories and now high streets, the government will need a bigger boat than the Â£5bn of previously announced spending accelerated yesterday. The pressure is now on Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Read more Harrods said the ""devastation in international travel"" had meant it had lost ""key customers"" Retailers were already struggling before the coronavirus due to changes in shopping habits as consumers buy more online, as well as rising wages and business rates. But the coronavirus crisis has placed huge pressure on an already weakened sector. The vast majority of shops were told to shut in March when the UK went into lockdown, prompting a sharp fall in sales. And while demand rebounded 12% in May,retail it remains well below pre-lockdown levels. Demand for air travel in April and May was down more than 90%, as airlines were hit hard by global lockdown measures and travel restrictions. And normal levels of demand are not expected to return for up to three years. While planes aren't flying, airlines aren't making money, but they still have funds flying out of the door. And firms that rely on airlines flying, such as commercial aerospace businesses, have decreased production. Along with cuts at Airbus, Ryanair and EasyJet, British Airways has announced plans to slash 12,000 jobs - almost a quarter of its workforce. Meanwhile, engineering giant Rolls-Royce, which makes jet engines, will cut 3,000 jobs across the UK.

"As Leicester becomes the first city to be subject to a local lockdown, misleading claims are being shared across social media. A number of local councils have come out on Twitter and Facebook to counter online rumours of imminent lockdowns in their areas - making it clear none have been announced. A rise in cases has been recorded in some local authority areasbut a Public Health England (PHE) spokesperson told the BBC: ""To use this data in isolation to predict which areas will see significant increases in cases is not appropriate as it does not provide a complete picture of what is happening locally."" Experts at PHE are currently looking at outbreaks in much smaller areas, rather than whole towns or cities, to inform decisions about any future local lockdowns. We've identified posts in Facebook and WhatsApp groups that may have led to some of the rumours. A number of national and local news outlets have posted lists of local authorities in England experiencing a rise in coronavirus cases. These stories have been shared by residents on local forums and fuelled misleading claims about imminent lockdowns. One local Facebook group warns: ""Oldham is rapidly speeding towards local lockdown"" accompanied by a list published in a local paper. Another group in Sheffield says ""this is getting serious"" expressing fears about a lockdown in the city. Similar claims and links are being shared in a number of WhatsApp groups in England - including in Stoke, Portsmouth, Sandwell in the West Midlands, the London Borough of Haringey and elsewhere. However, these lists are based on weekly case increases ""without any wider context"" according to Professor Kate Ardern from Wigan's Public Health department. Allow Facebook content?

Her comments were shared on Facebook by Wigan Council, which has had to counter a number of misleading claims circulating in local groups - including one called Coronavirus Concern Wigan, with over 13,000 members. In the Council's post, Professor Ardern explains that the council has ""been made aware that the media is sharing a list of places that could be next"" - which features the town in Greater Manchester. ""Last week we only recorded two new cases, compared to zero cases the week before. Our 7-day infection rate is 3.7 per 100,000 people compared to Leicester's rate of 135 per 100,000. We also currently have the sixth lowest rate of cases in Greater Manchester,"" she adds. Other councils in Doncaster, Wiltshire and Havering, have shared similar posts countering claims on social media. Public Health England has said the data featured in these lists cannot be used in isolation to predict where the next localised lockdown will happen. Bradford Council also had to counter concern online after Health Secretary Matt Hancock claimed that there had been a coronavirus outbreak in the wrong part of Yorkshire. Yesterday,Mr Hancock mixed up Keighley with Kirklees(where staff at a meat factory have tested positive for Covid-19) - leading Bradford council to take to Twitter to ""calm everyone down a bit"".

While local Facebook groups are useful places for community discussion, they can also be afertile breeding ground for misinformation- especially over local concerns when a lot of people are already feeling worried. How bad information goes viral A number of posts attributing the local lockdown in Leicester to videos of crowds of people taking part in anti-racism protests in the city centre a few weeks ago have been shared on Twitter and Facebook. These have led to racist and abusive comments directed at protesters. One post shared by a Facebook page links to an article featuring images of recent Black Lives Matter protests. It asks: ""Are scenes like these in Labour-run Leicester from a couple of weeks ago a contributing factor to why the city is back in lockdown?"" Another post shared on a Facebook group says: ""8th of June 4 thousand BLM protesters in Leicester. 20 days later, and now Leicester is on the brink of another lockdown"". A number of factors could have contributed, including gatherings of people in workplaces, schools, homes and outdoors. Often posts just claim to be ""asking questions"" or call on others to ""be the judge"" - while subtly pushing unsubstantiated claims about the complex issue of infection rates. Why has Leicester had a spike of coronavirus? Misinformation is frequently shared as a way of affirming bias or as a way of criticising political opponents. Always check the source and think about the motive for sharing claims.

"Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry had been celebrating Ms Henry's birthday before they were reported missing An 18-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering two sisters in a park in London. The bodies ofNicole Smallman, 27, and Bibaa Henry, 46,were found at Fryent Gardens in Wembley on 7 June, two days after a birthday party in the park. Post-mortem tests revealed they died from multiple stab wounds. Their family has been told in person about the arrest, the Met said. The arrested man from south-London was taken into custody where he remains. The sisters had met friends in the park at about 19:00 BST on 5 June to celebrate Ms Henry's birthday. The group had been in an area of Fryent Gardens which was about a five-minute walk from the Valley Drive entrance. Images recovered from their phones - which were found in a pond - showed the sisters dancing with fairy lights hours before they were killed Ms Smallman and Ms Henry are thought to have ended up alone by about 12:30 on 6 June. Police said they were in ""good spirits"" and ""taking selfie pictures, listening to music and dancing with fairy lights"" until at least 01:13. Calls to them from family at 02:30 went unanswered, police said. Extensive forensic work has finished at the park but smaller searches in outer areas continue, police said. More than 1,000 exhibits including property belonging to Ms Smallman and Ms Henry have been recovered and hours of CCTV collected, the Met said. Extensive forensic work in the park has concluded, though smaller searches will continue Det Ch Insp Simon Harding, said: ""Given the significance of this development, we visited the family in person today to inform them of the arrest. ""Our thoughts remain with them at this very difficult time."" The arrest comes aftertwo Met Police officers were suspendedafter ""inappropriate photos"" were taken of the crime scene. Nicole Smallman's body was found by her boyfriend after she was reported missing The unnamed officers were arrested by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) on 22 June and have since been bailed. Talking to the BBC last week, the girls' mother Mina Smallmansaid the pictures ""dehumanised"" her children. The IOPC said the pictures were allegedly ""shared with a small number of others"", adding the Met was ""handling matters involving those members of the public who may have received those images"".

The charity was set up in memory of the princess who was killed in a car crash in 1997 when Harry was just 12 and William 15. Diana, Princess Of Wales, visited Thorpe Park with sons Prince William And Prince Harry in 1993 The duke singled out the work of some of the 184 children and young adults presented with the accolade this year for their social action or humanitarian efforts. One of them was James Frater, a young black boy of Caribbean descent from London who had had 300 detentions and exclusions from school before being mentored by four teachers. Now 24, he is training to become a doctor and has focused on creating initiatives to increase the representation of black students at university, particularly those in the prestigious Russell Group. Another award winner praised by Prince Harry included 23-year-old Nasra Ayub, from Bristol, an activist at Integrate UK, a youth-led charity that works towards gender and racial equality. Shanea Kerry Oldham, 19, from London, was also praised. She developed the Operation Inspire mentoring programme for young boys that were excluded internally and founded Your Life More Life, which creates safe spaces for young people impacted by violence.

Mr Floyd died after a white police officer in Minneapolis knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes on 25 May. His death sparked a wave of global Black Lives Matter protests, including in the UK. Hundreds of anti-racism activists gathered for demonstrations in cities including London, Coventry and Newcastle, despite the coronavirus lockdown. There were alsocalls for public tributes to proponents of slavery or racist views to be removed, with a statue ofslave trader Edward Colston ripped down and thrown into Bristol harbour by protesters.

"Wigan Athletic won the FA Cup in 2013 - the same year in which they most recently played in the Premier League Wigan Athletic have gone into administration, becoming the first English professional club to do so since the coronavirus pandemic began. The English Football League has said Wigan will be deducted 12 points. The sanction will be applied at the end of this season if the Latics, 14th in the Championship, finish outside the bottom three after 46 games. Should Wigan finish in the relegation zone, the penalty will be applied during the 2020-21 season instead. Wigan have won all three of their league games since the resumption of the Championship season on 20 June and are eight points clear of the drop zone with six matches left to play. Boyce hopes Wigan players 'keep focus' Until 2018, the club was owned by Dave Whelan, who steered them from the fourth tier of English football to the Premier League in 2005, and they also won the FA Cup in 2013. Whelan sold the club to Hong Kong-based International Entertainment Corporation in November 2018 and there was a further change of ownership in May when Next Leader Fund took control. Paul Stanley, Gerald Krasner and Dean Watson of Begbies Traynor have been appointed as joint administrators. Krasner said in a statement that the suspension of the Championship season because of the coronavirus pandemic has had a ""significant impact on the recent fortunes of the club"". However, when asked by BBC Radio Manchester how big an impact the coronavirus pandemic has had on the situation, Stanley said: ""I don't think it's played a massive part in terms of the way the club's been run, because the club's been run very well. ""The funding that was due to come in from the owners didn't come in. I've had no contact with the owners and I don't know why the funding didn't come in. It might be coronavirus-related, I just don't know."" Stanley also confirmed that the administrators have control over Wigan's DW Stadium and training ground as well as the club itself. Wigan beat Stoke 3-0 on Tuesday to move eight points clear of the relegation zone in the Championship Meanwhile, former Leeds United chairman Krasner told BBC Sport he is ""optimistic"" that the situation will be resolved. He said: ""We are dealing with some proper people here and I have a lot more information on the situation than I did this morning. ""There are two objectives; firstly to make sure we get to the end of the season, otherwise the club is finished, then to find a buyer. ""All I can really say at this moment is that we have spoken to the EFL and the PFA (Professional Footballers' Association). We intend to speak to the local MP and also the supporters, who we have not managed to speak to yet. I have spoken to the manager (Paul Cook). ""I have been involved at other clubs - Leeds, Bournemouth and Port Vale - although I didn't have the additional problem of a pandemic. ""We need some money really quickly to deal with the situation. I think I have organised that, which will give us some breathing space. ""I have put my neck on the block a few times, particularly at Leeds, but I have not lost a club yet and I am optimistic we will resolve the problem."" The administrators say there have been expressions of interest, while Whelan has said he will see if he can ""help in any way"". He told Talksport: ""I'll have to stick my nose in a little and have a look, to see if I can find out what's caused it. ""I'll have to just try because the people of Wigan will be in absolute shock, because I am. ""Wigan is Wigan and I built the stadium, so I am going to have to see if I can help in any way, shape or form."" In May, EFL chairman Rick Parry told the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee thatclubs were facing a Â£200m financial hole by Septemberand were ""stacking up creditors"". EFL matches were suspended in March and, while Championship fixtures resumed on 20 June, League One and Two clubs voted to curtail their seasons early, with many pinpointing financial implications as one of the reasons against returning. Simon Stone, BBC Sport Wigan are the first, but the big question is how many more clubs will enter administration when the full financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic starts to be felt? When I interviewed Huddersfield owner Phil Hodgkinsonin May, his bleak assessment was that ""50 or 60"" clubs could go bust. That view was felt to be extreme. However, the brutal truth is football is being played without fans at present. That means clubs such as Manchester United are losing Â£5m worth of income per game. They, at least, have a massive TV deal to support them. As you go down the pyramid, the TV income reduces massively. Can League One, League Two and the National Leagues really play to no fans? These are all full-time clubs, many of whom used the government's furlough scheme to shield themselves. But that option will not exist shortly. Wigan may not be alone.

"The pub has asked for suggestions for a new name A pub named after 17th Century slave trader Edward Colston has covered over its sign amid plans for a name change. The Colston Arms in Kingsdown, Bristol, has hung up a temporary banner calling it ""Ye olde Pubby Mcdrunkface"" and asked people to suggest new names. The sign outside the pub reads ""We are listening. Black Lives Matter."" A statue of Colston in the city centre was torn down and thrown into the harbour during anti-racism protests last month. The pub's banner reads: ""The Clearly Temporarily Named Ye olde Pubby Mcdrunkface. Suggestions welcome (Obviously)."" Landlord Paul Frost said it was ""just a bit of fun to draw attention to the issue"". ""It's not me that's keen to make the name change, I just want to make sure the debate happens,"" he said. ""The point I'm making is that it's not my voice that needs to be heard. I'm a white middle aged man, it's the people, the community around Bristol. ""It is a serious issue, however the banner suggests a little levity about the matter.  It's just get engaged, learn about the whole era and make suggestions on Facebook really."" Admiral Taverns, which owns the pub, said it was supporting Mr Frost. ""We will be listening carefully to the feedback from the local community before deciding on the pub's new name,"" a spokesperson said. Since the Colston statue was pulled down there have been several other protests calling for monuments celebrating controversial figures in the UK to be taken down or amended. Bristol's Colston Hall removed his name from the building last month ahead of a name change later this year. The Diocese of Bristol has also formally applied to remove a plaque and part of a stained glass window in the north transept of Bristol Cathedral that commemorates Colston's life. Parts of the window, which was installed in 1890,were covered up last month.

The big question facing many theatres at the moment is - is panto season cancelled? Norwich Theatre Royal became one of the first to call off its pantomime this week, saying the risk was ""too great"" after three months with no income. Venues in Buxton and Welwyn Garden City have also cancelled, while Leicester Curve has scrapped its festive musical. Pantos are crucial to theatre earnings, and this Christmas could prove to be make or break for some venues' futures. Conservative MP Giles Watling, a former actor and panto dame, warned of the impact if festive shows are scrapped. ""I think many provincial theatres will go to the wall, frankly, because that's the time they can make the money,"" he told BBC News. ""It puts money in the coffers to support the rest of the cultural offer. I can see massive problems ahead if something isn't done and soon."" Read more here. Sarah CampbellBBC News/Royal Correspondent Will the Royal Family embrace life on Zoom? Three months ago when lockdown began, it was hard to see how, in isolation, the Royal Family could unite the nation as it had previously done in times of crisis. The Prince of Wales, the heir to the throne, had tested positive for Covid-19. He and the Duchess of Cornwall self-isolated in Scotland. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, both in their 90s, retreated behind Windsor Castle's walls. The institution had already been rocked by the departure of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the Duke of York ""stepping back"". Yet with each day, the death toll rose and a nation needed reassurance. Within a week Prince Charles, who suffered only mild symptoms of the virus, was able to release a video describing his ""strange, frustrating and often distressing experience"". The video was recorded at his home on the Balmoral estate. Perhaps it was the setting - the crammed bookshelves, the family photo, the teddy bear on the mantelpiece - or the heartfelt, personal delivery - but it felt intimate and set the tone for how the Royal Family went on to communicate with the nation during lockdown. See here for more from Sarah. Bar patrons in Texas Florida and Texas are among the states most affected by the huge surge in US virus cases. Here are what some of the people living there had to say. Alisha Hoath, 22 - Boca Raton, Florida There was a period when everyone began to forget about the virus. I even thought things were getting better for a while. For the most part I know I could be doing better with social distancing. I've been going to yoga classes and took a trip to a hotel in Miami for the weekend which was probably not my best decision. But we made sure to keep six feet apart and wear masks. Genesis Valbuena, 26 - Austin, Texas Some bar owners here in Austin are vocally going against what we need to do - criticising the data and suing the government for shutting them down.

Tamoor Tariq, a councillor for Bury Council, in Greater Manchester, is now recovering from the virus. He urged people to ""not take for granted"" the seriousness of the illness. Reality Check Peru imposed one of the earliest and strictest lockdowns in Latin America to stop the spread of coronavirus - but it now has the sixth highest number of confirmed cases in the world. Peru's President, MartÃ­n Vizcarra, says things are improving but has previously said results of the lockdown ""haven't been exactly what we expected"". So why has Peru been affected so badly? The lockdown in Peru started on 16 March - before the UK and some other European countries - and lasted until the end of June. Daily reported cases are now falling - but the number of deaths remains high. Officially, as of 30 June, around than 9,600 people had died with coronavirus in Peru. But the country hasone of the world's highest excess death rates- the number of deaths above the average in previous years - which suggests the impact far exceeds official figures. Why have measures been ineffective? Peru has reported more cases than every European country apart from the UK, despite testing only about seven people in every 1,000 - more than some countries in Latin America but far fewer than Italy, for example, which has tested about 88 in every 1,000. Experts say Peru's healthcare system was underprepared, leading to more deaths, but several other social and economic factors can help explain why Peru is struggling to contain the outbreak. Read more here Sonia KatariaBBC News Some children who live in the Leicester lockdown zone but attend school outside of the area will not be able to cross the border, the Department for Education (DfE) has confirmed. From Thursday, only vulnerable children and children of key
workers can travel across the boundary in either direction for school or
appointments with social workers. Other
children have been asked to stay at home. The DfE said: ""If you are a child or young person (other than a vulnerable child or child of a critical worker) that lives in Leicester but attends school or college outside the affected area, you must stay at home."" Some children who attend St Lukeâs Primary School in Thurnby, Leicestershire, which is outside the zone and will be open as normal tomorrow, are from within the boundary. Headteacher Paul Galvin said he was ""deeply sorry"" to the families of those affected. He said: ""It might be difficult for families who are inside the lockdown zone - as we are just outside the boundary - especially if they are not children of critical workers."" He added the school has ""adapted and will keep adapting to changes"" during the coronavirus pandemic. The school has been open since the lockdown in March for vulnerable children and children of key workers, and reopened for Reception and Year 1 in June. A ""small"" outbreak of coronavirus among workers at a bed factory in West Yorkshire has been confirmed. Eight members of staff at the Dura Beds factory in Batley have tested positive for the virus this week, a statement says. All staff - a total of 107 workers - will now be offered tests, according to the joint statement by Kirklees Council and Public Health England (PHE). The Dura Beds factory has been closed for two weeks as a safety precaution for its employees and their families, the statement adds. The firm is now ""working closely"" with the council and PHE so those who have tested positive can be followed up by the NHS Test and Trace programme and self-isolate. People who might have come into contact with an infected individual will be contacted and may be advised to self-isolate for 14 days. The statement adds: ""While the risk to residents from this outbreak is very low, everyone in Kirklees should continue to socially distance, wash hands regularly for 20 seconds with soap and water and get tested if they have symptoms."" Across the UK, the number of newly confirmed coronavirus cases each day has been falling since a peak in April. You can read morehere. Councils in England need urgent support as they face a funding gap of Â£7.4bn due to a loss of income related to coronavirus,the Local Government Association (LGA) says. Local authorities have come under increased pressure during the pandemic as demand for services such as social care has grown, while at the same time, income from local taxation and charges has dropped. James Jamieson, chairman of the LGA, which represents English councils and London boroughs, said ""further funding and flexibilities are now urgent"" if councils are to avoid taking steps such as ""in-year cuts to local services"" to cope with funding gaps. Whitehall has given Â£3.2bn funding to all English councils in two grants to help cover coronavirus costs, but the LGA says between March and June councils had already incurred costs of Â£4.8bn. Almost 44,000 people have died with coronavirus in the UK according to the latest daily government figures - which count deaths with a positive test result. But the overall total is likely to be higher. You can read morehere. Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter As Leicester, in England's East Midlands, has become the first city put under a local lockdown, misleading claims have been shared on social media. A string of local councils have posted on Twitter and Facebook to counter online rumours of imminent lockdowns in their areas - making it clear none have been announced. A rise in cases has been recorded in some local authority areasbut a Public Health England (PHE) spokesperson told the BBC that using this data to predict which areas would see significant rises in cases is ""not appropriate"" because it doesn't give a ""complete picture"" of the local situation. Meanwhile, a number of social media posts attributing the local lockdown in Leicester to videos of crowds of people taking part in anti-racism protests in the city centre a few weeks ago have led to racist and abusive comments directed at protesters. We've identified posts in Facebook groups that may have sparked some of the rumours. You can read morehere. Uganda hosts more than 400,000 refugees from DR Congo alone and many more from South Sudan Uganda has opened part of its border with the Democratic Republic of Congo to allow in thousands of people stuck in no-man's land for more than a month due to the coronavirus pandemic. At least 3,000 of them fled their homes in May after inter-communal clashes in north-eastern Ituri province. But they were unable to cross into Uganda to seek safety as the country had closed its borders in March to control the spread of coronavirus. It has been agreed the refugees will be quarantined before being settled. This will happen for 14 days at a new isolation centre, 13km (eight miles) from the border. The UN's refugee agency (UNHCR) says sample testing will be carried out on the group to see if coronavirus is present among them. This will help authorities decide when the refugees can be transferred to camps. Read more here. Simon JackBBC Business Editor The worldwide economic impact of the coronavirus has been seismic and the job losses are starting to crash on the shores of the UK with increasing frequency and severity. The 1,700 UK job losses at Airbus had a grim inevitability to them, given the destruction of demand in the aviation industry. Demand for air travel in April and May was down more than 90% and normality is not expected to return for up to three years - maybe never for the more lucrative business class travel. BA, Easyjet, Ryanair and Rolls Royce have already announced 20,000 job losses between them, so Airbus was never going to emerge unscathed. The travel wipeout has seen SSP, the owner of stalwart transport hub tenants Upper Crust and CafÃ© Ritazza, cut 5,000 posts.  We already know that the number of workers on UK payrolls shrank more than 600,000 between March and May, according to the ONS. That looks like the thin end of a very big wedge as the government's unprecedented job support scheme tapers off, with employers being asked to share the burden of the cost from the end of July to its withdrawal at the end of October.

Pest management was covered in the key worker list, so throughout the lockdown Matt drove himself and his Harris hawk 45 miles (70km) to the iconic square early two mornings a week.

Read more about how lockdown has been for Britain's unlikely key workers here Mark EastonHome editor Most of Britain is preparing for an easing of lockdown restrictions. But public
concern at the risks from coronavirus has risen to the highest level since the
end of April, a new poll conducted by Ipsos Mori this week suggests. However,
the survey also says the public is becoming more comfortable about
returning to work and sending children back to school. A month
ago, 37% of those surveyed said they were âvery concernedâ about the risks to
the country.  This new poll suggests that has risen to 50%. Concern about
the risks to individuals has also risen from 24% to 29%. The
survey asks people whether they would feel comfortable in a range of situations
if lockdown measures were lifted.  The proportion of parents who said they
would be comfortable sending their children to school has risen to 49%, up from
38% a month earlier. Two-thirds of people would be comfortable meeting friends or family outside their
household, also a rise from six weeks before. But the poll suggests around six in 10 people would be anxious going to bars or restaurants, using public
transport or lavatories and only 15% said they would be comfortable going to
large sport or music events. Ipsos MORI interviewed a representative sample of 1,078 British adults aged 18-75 online between 26-29 June 2020. Data are weighted to match the profile of the population. All polls are subject to a wide range of potential sources of error. Prof Van-Tam speaking at the government's daily news briefing on 30 May Here's some more from the government's Science and Technology committee hearing that's been going on this afternoon. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer, has said there are enough doses of remdesivir for use on hospitalised patients in the UK. It comes on the back of news that theUS had secured almost all of the forthcoming global supply of the drug, which has been shown to help people recover from Covid-19 more quickly. Prof Van-Tam said: ""Right now, there are stocks in the UK - and I judge us to have adequate stocks - of pre-licensed, as in unlicensed, clinical trial stocks of remdesivir which are available to be used through the emergency access protocol."" Remdesivir is produced by the US firm Gilead Sciences and is the first drug to have been approved by authorities in the US to be used to treat the disease. The US administration is set to receive 500,000 doses - or 100% of the company's supply production - in July, 90% of it in August and 90% in September.  ValeTodo Downtown has become the Downtown Market Peru's largest LGBT nightclub has reopened its doors as lockdown eases - as a grocery store. ValeTodo Downtown is one of the best known dance floors in the capital, Lima. But the club's famed drag queens will now be serving milk, fruit and bread rather than cocktails as nightclubs are still not permitted to open. Times have been tough for the club's 120 employees since the pandemic hit. ""I was very depressed because I have been doing this art for years, but you have to adapt to new challenges for the future,"" Belaluh McQueen, who is identified by her stage name, told Reuters news agency. ""We have a new job opportunity,"" she added, standing in the newly named Downtown Market in a sequined suit, high heels and a mask. ""Before, I used to come here to dance and have a good time, but now we come to buy,"" said Alexandra Herrera, a regular attendee of the club. ""The thing is to reinvent yourself.""

Ian YoungsEntertainment and Arts Reporter, BBC News Gemma Sutton, Clive Rowe and Tameka Empson in Aladdin at the Hackney Empire in 2018 Oh yes it is. Oh no it isn't. The big question facing many theatres at the moment is - is panto season cancelled? Norwich Theatre Royal became one of the first to call off its pantomime this week, saying the risk was ""too great"" after three months with no income. Venues in Buxton and Welwyn Garden City have also cancelled, while Leicester Curve has scrapped its festive musical. Pantos are crucial to theatre earnings, and this Christmas could prove to be make or break for some venues' futures. Conservative MP Giles Watling, a former actor and panto dame, warned of the impact if festive shows are scrapped. ""I think many provincial theatres will go to the wall, frankly, because that's the time they can make the money,"" he told BBC News. ""It puts money in the coffers to support the rest of the cultural offer. I can see massive problems ahead if something isn't done and soon."" Read more here. Sarah CampbellBBC News/Royal Correspondent Will the Royal Family embrace life on Zoom? Three months ago when lockdown began, it was hard to see how, in isolation, the Royal Family could unite the nation as it had previously done in times of crisis. The Prince of Wales, the heir to the throne, had tested positive for Covid-19. He and the Duchess of Cornwall self-isolated in Scotland. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, both in their 90s, retreated behind Windsor Castle's walls. The institution had already been rocked by the departure of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the Duke of York ""stepping back"". Yet with each day, the death toll rose and a nation needed reassurance. Within a week Prince Charles, who suffered only mild symptoms of the virus, was able to release a video describing his ""strange, frustrating and often distressing experience"". The video was recorded at his home on the Balmoral estate. Perhaps it was the setting - the crammed bookshelves, the family photo, the teddy bear on the mantelpiece - or the heartfelt, personal delivery - but it felt intimate and set the tone for how the Royal Family went on to communicate with the nation during lockdown.

Alisha Hoath, 22 - Boca Raton, Florida There was a period when everyone began to forget about the virus. I even thought things were getting better for a while. For the most part I know I could be doing better with social distancing. I've been going to yoga classes and took a trip to a hotel in Miami for the weekend which was probably not my best decision. But we made sure to keep six feet apart and wear masks. Genesis Valbuena, 26 - Austin, Texas Some bar owners here in Austin are vocally going against what we need to do - criticising the data and suing the government for shutting them down. If we continue to do this, we are going to be shut down for the rest of the year. For me that's completely narcissistic. How certain bar owners are acting is ludicrous.

"Local authorities are to be given access to postcode-level data about the number of people testing positive for coronavirus in their areas after it was agreed with the Department of Health. It comes after Leicester became the first city tohave a local lockdown imposedfollowing a rise in cases. Labour leader Keir Starmer said there had been a ""lost week"" due to city officials not having full testing data. The prime minister said the figures had been shared with all local authorities. But, at Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons, Sir Keir said officials in Leicester had only received full figures on Thursday. Until now local authorities have not routinely had full access to the data on people who are tested for the virus in the community. But the agreement, signed individually with councils over the past week, now gives them access to a digital dashboard which shows test results down to a postcode level. Leicester lockdown boundary line branded 'stupid' Scots border 'cluster' of virus cases investigated Leicester's new lockdown rules at a glance Dr Jeanelle De Gruchy, president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, welcomed the news and said ""timely, high quality and consistent data"" would be key to combating local outbreaks. But Prof Azeem Majeed, from Imperial College London, said the country had been slow in areas of its Covid-19, response and said the data-sharing agreement ""should have been in place some time ago"". On Monday, it was revealed Leicester's seven-day infection rate was 135 cases per 100,000 people - three times that of the next highest city. The local authorities in England with the next highest rate in the week to 21 June was Bradford with 69 cases per 100,000 people, followed by Barnsley and Rochdale with 55 and 53 cases per 100,000 respectively. The city's mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby, also criticised the government and PHE for being slow to share testing data - saying city officials had been trying to get figures ""for weeks"". The British Medical Association, which represents doctors in the UK, said providing local leaders with up-to-date information was ""vital"" in containing outbreaks, particularly asa contact-tracing app was not yet in place. Walkers confirms 28 virus cases at site Why has action taken so long in Leicester?  Officials are also keeping a close eye on Bedford, Blackburn with Darwen, Kirklees, Oldham, Rotherham and Tameside which seen 30 to 44.9 cases per 100,000 people. Imperial College London's Prof Neil Ferguson,who used to advise the government before he resigned for breaking lockdown rules, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""inevitable"" there would be further local outbreaks adding that high rates of the virus in Bradford and Doncaster were ""clearly of concern"". The BMA's Dr Chaand Nagpaul said Prime Minister Boris Johnson's ""whack-a-mole strategy"" to tackle local outbreaks would be no use if the people leading the response were ""not given the most accurate up-to-date data"". Labour MP Yvette Cooper tweeted it was ""incomprehensible"" that health authorities in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, had also been trying to get hold of local data on swab test results of the wider population but had not been able to. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SOCIAL LIFE:When will pubs, bars and restaurants reopen? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Sir Keir also criticised the speed of the government response in Leicester, saying it took 11 days from the announcement that cases were rising for the lockdown to be tightened. Mr Johnson said the government had started taking action on 8 June, but ""unfortunately it did not prove possible to get the results seen elsewhere"", referring to another localised outbreak ata meat plant in West Yorkshire. Across the rest of England, the lockdown is set to ease further on Saturday with the reopening of bars, restaurants and hair salons, but the BMA said it wanted the government to set metric ""trigger points"" for when action will be taken to reintroduce local and national restrictions. The BMA said this metric should consider not only the regional reproductive number or R rate - the number of people that one infected person, on average, will pass the virus on to - but also the proportion of the population currently infected. A government spokesperson said it had been working closely with local partners, providing the resources and tools needed to take swift action to deal with any new local spikes in infection. It remains one of the most baffling aspects of the current approach. Local authorities have not routinely been given information about their residents who test positive. Even though they are intrinsically involved in the system as the local arm of the contact tracing service, councils have only been getting what the national system deems appropriate. They have been asked to chase up the so-called complex cases - where people test positive in care homes, prisons or schools - so they get that information quickly. But they have not been given real-time information about individual residents who test positive. Local directors of public health say it has hampered their ability to look for patterns and clusters developing. In theory, the national system should do this, but why not have a second pair of eyes? Especially one that knows the local situation much better? This is beginning to change - data sharing agreements have just been signed with local authorities and Public Health England has now set up a system that should do this in a comprehensive and speedy manner from now on. But the fact it has not already and the experience of those on the ground in Leicester - where cases were going up for a number of weeks - suggests local outbreaks developing in the community may not yet have been spotted as quickly as they should. Under the local lockdown, announced on Monday evening, non-essential shops in Leicester have been forced to shut and schools have closed, except for vulnerable pupils and children of ""critical workers"". People are also being advised not to travel in or out of the city. The measures will last until at least 18 July and apply to the city centre and a number of suburbs. New laws are not planned ""at this stage"" to stop people entering or leaving Leicester, Downing Street said, as local police weigh options for enforcing the lockdown. Leicestershire Police Chief Constable Simon Cole said people would have to be ""pretty daft"" to leave the lockdown area for a pint of beer when pubs reopened elsewhere. ""This is a serious public health risk. Do you want to bring that illness into contact with your mates or your family?"" he asked. ""Certainly I wouldn't want to do that. We do work really closely with all the neighbouring forces - we've been communicating with them so they can understand."" He added: ""I'd really implore people - some of the leading health experts in the country are saying stay at home and that seems pretty shrewd advice to me.""

"Gemma Sutton, Clive Rowe and Tameka Empson in Aladdin at the Hackney Empire in 2018 Oh yes it is. Oh no it isn't. The big question facing many theatres at the moment is - is panto season cancelled? Norwich Theatre Royal became one of the first to call off its pantomime this week, saying the risk was ""too great"" after three months with no income. Venues in Buxton and Welwyn Garden City have also cancelled, while Leicester Curve has scrapped its festive musical. Pantos are crucial to theatre earnings, and this Christmas could prove to be make or break for some venues' futures. Conservative MP Giles Watling, a former actor and panto dame, warned of the impact if festive shows are scrapped. ""I think many provincial theatres will go to the wall, frankly, because that's the time they can make the money,"" he told BBC News. ""It puts money in the coffers to support the rest of the cultural offer. I can see massive problems ahead if something isn't done and soon."" Norwich Theatre said more than half of its workforce is at risk of redundancy Theatres have been shut since March because of the coronavirus pandemic, and the government hasn't given a date for the return of live performances. The UK's biggest pantomime producer Qdos has set a deadline of 3 August to decide whether its 34 shows - in cities from Bristol to Birmingham and Bradford - can go ahead. Qdos managing director Michael Harrison told BBC News there could be ""a lot of redundancies"" in regional theatres if Aladdin, Snow White and Dick Whittington fall victim to live entertainment's extended lockdown. ""If Christmas is cancelled - or if pantomime is cancelled - then the theatres will be left with no choice,"" he said. ""And I'm afraid that if it gets to 3 August and we haven't got clarity from the government, we will then have to begin the process of unravelling the season."" Theatres are waiting for a timetable for reopening He wants an official date for the theatres to reopen, but said pantos will only be able to go ahead if social distancing is put behind us. ""Commercial theatre can't operate on anything less than 100% capacity. It's no good saying you can sell every other row,"" he said. ""How can you social distance actors on stage? How can you social distance dancers who have to touch each other? How do you social distance somebody who has to do a quick costume change? There's all of those things to take into consideration. ""We can adapt if we have some clarity about what the position might be. But we do need to know in advance to set those ideas and plans in motion."" John Barrowman is due to star in Snow White at the Bristol Hippodrome Although social distancing in the audience may make shows unviable, The Elgiva theatre in Chesham, Buckinghamshire, recently switched from Snow White to Sleeping Beauty to reduce the number of performers backstage. Manager David Cooper said,external: ""Sleeping Beauty means fewer people backstage, as there won't be any dwarfs, so we can ensure the cast has the proper social distancing."" Last week, the government published a five-step roadmap for restarting live performance, butwere widely criticisedfor not attaching a timetable or financial support. Regional theatre group faces huge job losses Will Santa have to social distance this year? Why panto is 'the hardest job in showbusiness' Earlier this month, Julian Bird, chief executive of the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre,told MPs,externalthat Christmas shows were economically ""vital"" for theatres. He said: ""It is the time when theatres, being blunt, make the most profit, and that profit they need for the rest of the year to invest in everything they do and all the other types of productions."" John Barrowman, who is due to star in Snow White at Bristol Hippodrome this winter, told ITV's Good Morning Britain that if Christmas shows are scrapped, ""70% of theatres around the UK are going to be gone"". Not all theatres stage traditional pantos - seasonal musicals are also under threat. Last week, Leicester Curve called off The Wizard of Oz, saying such productions ""take months of preparation"". In the US, Broadway theatres have confirmed they will stay shut until 2021. On Wednesday, Norwich Theatre, which runs the city's Theatre Royal, Playhouse and Stage Two, announced that 113 of its 217 jobs are at risk, with a further 59 employees on zero hours contracts told they won't get any more work. Chief executive Stephen Crocker said: ""I remain shocked and angry that the government is standing idle as an industry that has delivered so much to this country and is so vital to its recovery is being allowed to fade into dust."" Mr Watling, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Theatre, has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson pointing out how vital theatres are, ""not just for the arts offer, but for UK plc"". He said: ""I used to tour the world, taking the theatre to every corner of the world, and we are highly regarded because of our massive and very important theatre offer."" A government spokesperson said: ""We are clear that we want to get the performing arts fully back up and running safely as soon as possible and are working closely with the sector on a phased approach, guided by public health and medical experts."" They said the government was also ""considering ways in which we may be able to support"" the theatre industry on top of the ""unprecedented financial assistance"" from the loans, grants and furlough scheme open to businesses, plus a Â£160m Arts Council England emergency package. Mr Watling called for more information and help before more theatres are forced to cancel Christmas. He said: ""Theatre Royal Norwich losing its pantomime is indicative of the way the whole thing could go like a pack of cards."" Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"Local authorities are to be given access to postcode-level data about the number of people testing positive for coronavirus in their areas after it was agreed with the Department of Health. It comes after Leicester became the first city tohave a local lockdown imposedfollowing a rise in cases. Labour leader Keir Starmer said there had been a ""lost week"" due to city officials not having full testing data. The prime minister said the figures had been shared with all local authorities. But, at Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons, Sir Keir said officials in Leicester had only received full figures on Thursday. Until now local authorities have not routinely had full access to the data on people who are tested for the virus in the community. But the agreement, signed individually with councils over the past week, now gives them access to a digital dashboard which shows test results down to a postcode level. Leicester lockdown boundary line branded 'stupid' Scots border 'cluster' of virus cases investigated Leicester's new lockdown rules at a glance Dr Jeanelle De Gruchy, president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, welcomed the news and said ""timely, high quality and consistent data"" would be key to combating local outbreaks. But Prof Azeem Majeed, from Imperial College London, said the country had been slow in areas of its Covid-19, response and said the data-sharing agreement ""should have been in place some time ago"". On Monday, it was revealed Leicester's seven-day infection rate was 135 cases per 100,000 people - three times that of the next highest city. The local authorities in England with the next highest rate in the week to 21 June was Bradford with 69 cases per 100,000 people, followed by Barnsley and Rochdale with 55 and 53 cases per 100,000 respectively. The city's mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby, also criticised the government and PHE for being slow to share testing data - saying city officials had been trying to get figures ""for weeks"". The British Medical Association, which represents doctors in the UK, said providing local leaders with up-to-date information was ""vital"" in containing outbreaks, particularly asa contact-tracing app was not yet in place. Walkers confirms 28 virus cases at site Why has action taken so long in Leicester?  Officials are also keeping a close eye on Bedford, Blackburn with Darwen, Kirklees, Oldham, Rotherham and Tameside which seen 30 to 44.9 cases per 100,000 people. Imperial College London's Prof Neil Ferguson,who used to advise the government before he resigned for breaking lockdown rules, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""inevitable"" there would be further local outbreaks adding that high rates of the virus in Bradford and Doncaster were ""clearly of concern"". The BMA's Dr Chaand Nagpaul said Prime Minister Boris Johnson's ""whack-a-mole strategy"" to tackle local outbreaks would be no use if the people leading the response were ""not given the most accurate up-to-date data"". Labour MP Yvette Cooper tweeted it was ""incomprehensible"" that health authorities in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, had also been trying to get hold of local data on swab test results of the wider population but had not been able to. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SOCIAL LIFE:When will pubs, bars and restaurants reopen? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"More than 12,000 people in the UK are set to lose their jobs after a raft of firms announced cuts in the past 48 hours. The cuts are mainly being made by High Street retailers and in aviation - two of the sectors hardest hit by the coronavirus lockdown. John Lewis has said it will close stores but has not confirmed how many jobs will go. Topshop owner Arcadia and Harrods said they planned a total of 1,180 job cuts. Other lay-offs that have been announced include: Up to 5,000 job cutsat Upper Crust owner SSP Group Up to 700 jobs at Harrods About 600 workersat shirtmaker TM Lewin Up to 900 cuts at management consulting firm Accenture 300 staff cuts across Virgin Money, Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank 1,700 UK jobsat plane-maker Airbus And1,300 crew and 727 pilotsat EasyJet Have you recently been made redundant? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. WH Smith, Bensons for Beds, Wrights Pies, tableware-maker Steelite International, the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool and Norwich Theatre Royal have also announced plans to reduce staff. Businesses have been hit hard since the UK went into lockdown on 23 March, and even though restrictions are gradually being eased, consumer demand remains depressed. The government's furlough scheme will also start to be pared back from August, and firms are cutting jobs to control their costs. James Phillips could be made redundant James Phillips, a mechanical engineer, told the BBC he fears he could be made redundant. He has been on furlough since March but has now been asked to attend a redundancy consultation meeting with his employer. He said: ""I'm three months away from having a baby, and I was about to sign for a mortgage this week on a new property, so it's impacted me massively, really. Everything's been put on hold."" Sue Hudson lost her job as a legal secretary at a solicitors in Bournemouth in April and has not found a job since. ""There are too many people chasing too few jobs,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""It's very disheartening."" For most businesses, staffing is the highest cost, and many have been using the government's furlough schemes to keep workers on. But the programme - which is paying 80% of the wages of more than 9 million workers - will start to be pared back from next month and will end in October. Upper Crust owner SSP has announced 5,000 job cuts As firms have to consult for 30-45 days when making redundancies, some will feel that now is the time to act. ""There is already a cost to the employer from just a month's time,"" said BBC business correspondent Simon Gompertz. ""Larger employers, planning bigger layoffs, will be eyeing that escalating wage bill and maybe thinking the sooner they move the better."" In an email to staff, Harrods' managing director Michael Ward said the department store was making its cuts with a heavy heart. ""Due to the ongoing impacts of this pandemic, we as a business will need to make reductions to our workforce."" He said it would take a ""drastic improvement in external conditions"" for Harrods to recover and return to growth. John Lewis, which was already looking to ""right size"" its business before the crisis, said it had not decided which shops would close. ""The reality is that we have too much store space for the way people want to shop now,"" the company said in a statement. Topshop owner Arcadia, which is slashing a fifth of its head office staff, also blamed the pandemic for its cuts. ""Due to the impact of Covid-19 on our business including the closure for over three months of all our stores and head offices, we have today informed staff of the need to restructure our head offices,"" it said. The reason the government has thrown tens of billions of pounds at trying to hold back the waves of unemployment is they realise that it does long-lasting damage to demand in the economy. There is no doubt that the furlough scheme helped delay the impact, but this barrage of job cut announcements suggests the government is now struggling to turn the tide. Boris Johnson described the virus as ""still circling like a shark in our waters"". It was an odd metaphor to use, considering the PM has previously praised the Mayor in Jaws for keeping the beaches open. One thing seems certain: to combat the huge economic shock whose repercussions are being felt in airlines, factories and now high streets, the government will need a bigger boat than the Â£5bn of previously announced spending accelerated yesterday. The pressure is now on Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Read more Harrods said the ""devastation in international travel"" had meant it had lost ""key customers"" Retailers were already struggling before the coronavirus due to changes in shopping habits as consumers buy more online, as well as rising wages and business rates. But the coronavirus crisis has placed huge pressure on an already weakened sector. The vast majority of shops were told to shut in March when the UK went into lockdown, prompting a sharp fall in sales. And while demand rebounded 12% in May,retail it remains well below pre-lockdown levels. Demand for air travel in April and May was down more than 90%, as airlines were hit hard by global lockdown measures and travel restrictions. And normal levels of demand are not expected to return for up to three years. While planes aren't flying, airlines aren't making money, but they still have funds flying out of the door. And firms that rely on airlines flying, such as commercial aerospace businesses, have decreased production. Along with cuts at Airbus, Ryanair and EasyJet, British Airways has announced plans to slash 12,000 jobs - almost a quarter of its workforce. Meanwhile, engineering giant Rolls-Royce, which makes jet engines, will cut 3,000 jobs across the UK.

"This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson says the new law ""violates Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy"" Up to three million Hong Kong residents are to be offered the chance to settle in the UK and ultimately apply for citizenship, Boris Johnson has said. The PM said Hong Kong's freedoms were being violated by a new security law and those affected would be offered a ""route"" out of the former UK colony. About 350,000 UK passport holders, and 2.6 million others eligible, will be able to come to the UK for five years. And after a further year, they will be able to apply for citizenship. British National Overseas Passport holders in Hong Kong were granted special status in the 1980s but currently have restricted rights and are only entitled to visa-free access to the UK for six months. Under the government's plans, all British Overseas Nationals and their dependants will be given right to remain in the UK, including the right to work and study, for five years. At this point, they will be able to apply for settled status, and after a further year, seek citizenship. UK asylum for consulate worker 'tortured in China' HK arrests dozens as 'anti-protest' law kicks in Political battle looming over UK China relations China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? The PM said Tuesday's passing of a new security law by the Hong Kong authorities was a ""clear and serious breach"" of the 1985 Sino-British joint declaration - a legally binding agreement which set out how certain freedoms would be protected for the 50 years after China assumed sovereignty in 1997. ""It violates Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and threatens the freedoms and rights protected by the joint declaration,"" he said. ""We made clear that if China continued down this path we would introduce a new route for those with British National (Overseas) status to enter the UK, granting them limited leave to remain with the ability to live and work in the UK and thereafter to apply for citizenship. And that is precisely what we will do now."" Foreign Office permanent secretary Sir Simon McDonald expressed the government's ""deep concern"" about the new law to China during a meeting with the country's ambassador Liu Xioming. The UK government has been raising concerns about the national security law and very publicly trying to pressure Beijing into a change heart. That has clearly failed - so ministers are now fulfilling their promise to allow some three million British Overseas Nationals to come to the UK. This is a significant move and the government wants to send a strong message. But there will be more pressure now to rethink other elements of our relationship with China - not least the deal to allow Huawei to build parts of the UK's 5G structures. Many Tory MPs have been lobbying against that for some time - and this will only add to their concern. Updating MPs on the details, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said there would be no limit on numbers or quotas and the application process would be simple. ""This is a special, bespoke, set of arrangements developed for the unique circumstances we face and in light of our historic commitment to the people of Hong Kong,"" he said. Speaking to ITV's Peston programme, Mr Raab acknowledged there ""would be little we could do toâ¦cohesively force"" China to allow British Overseas Nationals to come to the UK. What is a BNO passport? The background you need on Hong Kong's protests What is behind the Hong Kong citizenship offer? Downing Street said further details of the scheme will be detailed ""in due course"". In the meantime, British National Overseas Passport holders in Hong Kong will be able to travel to the UK immediately, subject to standard immigration checks, the prime minister's official spokesman said. They will also will not face salary thresholds to gain their visas, he added. Hong Kong's new national security law, which targets secession, subversion and terrorism with punishments up to life in prison, came into effect on Tuesday. By Grace Tsoi, BBC World Service, Hong Kong I was born in Hong Kong before 1997, the year when Hong Kong was handed back to Chinese rule. That means I had a British National Overseas (BNO) passport as a child. When the news broke that BNO passport holders were eligible for British citizenship after living and working in the UK for five years, and after spending another year of being granted settled status, many of my friends were excited. They say at least there's a way out for Hong Kongers after the national security law came into force. But many questions remain. Currently there are 350,000 BNO passport holders, but about three million Hong Kong residents are eligible for BNO passports - and that doesn't appear to include dependants born after 1997. Will the UK be ready to take in so many Hong Kong residents? Will there be enough jobs? Will BNO passport holders have recourse to public funds? And will they be covered by the NHS? Some also say it's good that there's a lifeboat, but do they really want to leave their home? Several people have already been arrested under the new powers, including a man carrying a pro-independence flag as police used pepper spray to disperse some protesters gathered to mark 23 years since British rule ended. Critics say it effectively puts an end to the ""one country, two systems"" principle enshrined in the Joint Declaration. China has rejected criticism of its actions, saying they are internal matters. British National Overseas Passports do not confer nationality or the automatic right to live and work in the UK The UK government has come under growing pressure to take a firm line with Beijing from MPs, who are worried about China's increasingly assertive role regionally and the security implications of Chinese firm Huawei's involvement in the UK's 5G network.

Labour said it welcomed the government's action but said there must be no discrimination on those allowed into the UK on the basis of income or other factors. Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said the UK also had a responsibility to consider the welfare of those who were not able to re-locate or who wished to stay in Hong Kong. She urged the government to work with its international partners, through the UN, to force an inquiry into police brutality in Hong Kong and also called for the UK to re-examine its commercial relationship with China. ""For too long in relation to China we've had no strategy at home and no strategy abroad. I hope he can give us a commitment today that this marks the start of a very different era,"" she said.

"Upper Crust owner SSP Group says up to 5,000 jobs could be cut across its UK outlets and head office, as it struggles with the reduction in passenger travel. The firm said global sales in April and May were 95% below the previous year's. SSP operates 580 food and drink outlets across the UK, mostly at railway stations and airports, but fewer than 10 are currently open. The company expects only one-fifth of its UK stores to be open by the autumn. SSP employs around 39,000 staff worldwide across 2,800 outlets.  Last month, it said it had suffered ""extremely low sales"" after the coronavirus pandemic forced it to shut branches. As well as Upper Crust bakeries, the company also owns the CaffÃ¨ Ritazza chain, deli operator Camden Food Co. and luxury bar chain Cabin. SSP joins a growing list of companies slashing jobs as the UK economy suffers its worst contraction in 41 years. In the past few days, a number of firms have announced UK job cuts: Aerospace giant Airbus has said itwants to cut 1,700 jobs in the UK, as part of plans to shed 15,000 posts across the whole company Cutbacks at EasyJet meannearly 1,300 UK crew members and 727 pilots are at risk of losing their jobsat the airline, unions say About 600 workers at shirtmaker TM Lewin will lose their jobsas the firm's 66 stores are closed Royal Mail has said it isto cut 2,000 management jobs ""Covid-19 continues to have an unprecedented impact on the travel industry and on SSP's businesses in all geographies,"" said SSP Group chief executive Simon Smith. ""We are beginning to see early signs of recovery in some parts of the world and are starting to open units as passenger demand picks up. However, in the UK the pace of the recovery continues to be slow,"" he said. The company added: ""If the pace of the recovery continues at the current level, this could lead to up to c. 5,000 roles becoming redundant from within the head office and UK operations."" What went wrong for retail giant Intu? 'We are battered, bruised, but wiser' While SSP operates across more than 30 countries, including the US, India and China, the job cuts are only being made at its UK business. At this time of year, the company would normally employ about 9,000 people across the UK. Staff have been enrolled on the government-paid furlough scheme throughout the coronavirus crisis. The company said it had planned to reopen UK outlets as passenger demand returned, adding: ""The reality is that passenger numbers still remain at very low levels."" Mr Smith said the firm would swiftly reopen UK units if there were improved sales over the summer. In a statement, the company said it had access to around Â£750m in liquidity and it was confident it had sufficient funds to allow it to operate ""throughout even its most pessimistic scenario"".

"Wigan Athletic won the FA Cup in 2013 - the same year in which they most recently played in the Premier League Wigan Athletic have gone into administration, becoming the first English professional club to do so since the coronavirus pandemic began. The English Football League has said Wigan will be deducted 12 points. The sanction will be applied at the end of this season if the Latics, 14th in the Championship, finish outside the bottom three after 46 games. Should Wigan finish in the relegation zone, the penalty will be applied during the 2020-21 season instead. Wigan have won all three of their league games since the resumption of the Championship season on 20 June and are eight points clear of the drop zone with six matches left to play. Boyce hopes Wigan players 'keep focus' Until 2018, the club was owned by Dave Whelan, who steered them from the fourth tier of English football to the Premier League in 2005, and they also won the FA Cup in 2013. Whelan sold the club to Hong Kong-based International Entertainment Corporation in November 2018 and there was a further change of ownership in May when Next Leader Fund took control. Paul Stanley, Gerald Krasner and Dean Watson of Begbies Traynor have been appointed as joint administrators. Krasner said in a statement that the suspension of the Championship season because of the coronavirus pandemic has had a ""significant impact on the recent fortunes of the club"". However, when asked by BBC Radio Manchester how big an impact the coronavirus pandemic has had on the situation, Stanley said: ""I don't think it's played a massive part in terms of the way the club's been run, because the club's been run very well. ""The funding that was due to come in from the owners didn't come in. I've had no contact with the owners and I don't know why the funding didn't come in. It might be coronavirus-related, I just don't know."" Stanley also confirmed that the administrators have control over Wigan's DW Stadium and training ground as well as the club itself. Wigan beat Stoke 3-0 on Tuesday to move eight points clear of the relegation zone in the Championship Meanwhile, former Leeds United chairman Krasner told BBC Sport he is ""optimistic"" that the situation will be resolved. He said: ""We are dealing with some proper people here and I have a lot more information on the situation than I did this morning. ""There are two objectives; firstly to make sure we get to the end of the season, otherwise the club is finished, then to find a buyer. ""All I can really say at this moment is that we have spoken to the EFL and the PFA (Professional Footballers' Association). We intend to speak to the local MP and also the supporters, who we have not managed to speak to yet. I have spoken to the manager (Paul Cook). ""I have been involved at other clubs - Leeds, Bournemouth and Port Vale - although I didn't have the additional problem of a pandemic. ""We need some money really quickly to deal with the situation. I think I have organised that, which will give us some breathing space. ""I have put my neck on the block a few times, particularly at Leeds, but I have not lost a club yet and I am optimistic we will resolve the problem."" The administrators say there have been expressions of interest, while Whelan has said he will see if he can ""help in any way"". He told Talksport: ""I'll have to stick my nose in a little and have a look, to see if I can find out what's caused it. ""I'll have to just try because the people of Wigan will be in absolute shock, because I am. ""Wigan is Wigan and I built the stadium, so I am going to have to see if I can help in any way, shape or form."" In May, EFL chairman Rick Parry told the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee thatclubs were facing a Â£200m financial hole by Septemberand were ""stacking up creditors"". EFL matches were suspended in March and, while Championship fixtures resumed on 20 June, League One and Two clubs voted to curtail their seasons early, with many pinpointing financial implications as one of the reasons against returning. Simon Stone, BBC Sport Wigan are the first, but the big question is how many more clubs will enter administration when the full financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic starts to be felt? When I interviewed Huddersfield owner Phil Hodgkinsonin May, his bleak assessment was that ""50 or 60"" clubs could go bust. That view was felt to be extreme. However, the brutal truth is football is being played without fans at present. That means clubs such as Manchester United are losing Â£5m worth of income per game. They, at least, have a massive TV deal to support them. As you go down the pyramid, the TV income reduces massively. Can League One, League Two and the National Leagues really play to no fans? These are all full-time clubs, many of whom used the government's furlough scheme to shield themselves. But that option will not exist shortly. Wigan may not be alone.

Ian YoungsEntertainment and Arts Reporter, BBC News Gemma Sutton, Clive Rowe and Tameka Empson in Aladdin at the Hackney Empire in 2018 Oh yes it is. Oh no it isn't. The big question facing many theatres at the moment is - is panto season cancelled? Norwich Theatre Royal became one of the first to call off its pantomime this week, saying the risk was ""too great"" after three months with no income. Venues in Buxton and Welwyn Garden City have also cancelled, while Leicester Curve has scrapped its festive musical. Pantos are crucial to theatre earnings, and this Christmas could prove to be make or break for some venues' futures. Conservative MP Giles Watling, a former actor and panto dame, warned of the impact if festive shows are scrapped. ""I think many provincial theatres will go to the wall, frankly, because that's the time they can make the money,"" he told BBC News. ""It puts money in the coffers to support the rest of the cultural offer. I can see massive problems ahead if something isn't done and soon."" Read more here. Sarah CampbellBBC News/Royal Correspondent Will the Royal Family embrace life on Zoom? Three months ago when lockdown began, it was hard to see how, in isolation, the Royal Family could unite the nation as it had previously done in times of crisis. The Prince of Wales, the heir to the throne, had tested positive for Covid-19. He and the Duchess of Cornwall self-isolated in Scotland. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, both in their 90s, retreated behind Windsor Castle's walls. The institution had already been rocked by the departure of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the Duke of York ""stepping back"". Yet with each day, the death toll rose and a nation needed reassurance. Within a week Prince Charles, who suffered only mild symptoms of the virus, was able to release a video describing his ""strange, frustrating and often distressing experience"". The video was recorded at his home on the Balmoral estate. Perhaps it was the setting - the crammed bookshelves, the family photo, the teddy bear on the mantelpiece - or the heartfelt, personal delivery - but it felt intimate and set the tone for how the Royal Family went on to communicate with the nation during lockdown. See here for more from Sarah. Bar patrons in Texas Florida and Texas are among the states most affected by the huge surge in US virus cases. Here are what some of the people living there had to say. Alisha Hoath, 22 - Boca Raton, Florida There was a period when everyone began to forget about the virus. I even thought things were getting better for a while. For the most part I know I could be doing better with social distancing. I've been going to yoga classes and took a trip to a hotel in Miami for the weekend which was probably not my best decision. But we made sure to keep six feet apart and wear masks. Genesis Valbuena, 26 - Austin, Texas Some bar owners here in Austin are vocally going against what we need to do - criticising the data and suing the government for shutting them down. If we continue to do this, we are going to be shut down for the rest of the year. For me that's completely narcissistic. How certain bar owners are acting is ludicrous. The reopening should have been done less quickly.

Tamoor Tariq, a councillor for Bury Council, in Greater Manchester, is now recovering from the virus. He urged people to ""not take for granted"" the seriousness of the illness. Reality Check Peru imposed one of the earliest and strictest lockdowns in Latin America to stop the spread of coronavirus - but it now has the sixth highest number of confirmed cases in the world. Peru's President, MartÃ­n Vizcarra, says things are improving but has previously said results of the lockdown ""haven't been exactly what we expected"". So why has Peru been affected so badly? The lockdown in Peru started on 16 March - before the UK and some other European countries - and lasted until the end of June. Daily reported cases are now falling - but the number of deaths remains high. Officially, as of 30 June, around than 9,600 people had died with coronavirus in Peru. But the country hasone of the world's highest excess death rates- the number of deaths above the average in previous years - which suggests the impact far exceeds official figures. Why have measures been ineffective? Peru has reported more cases than every European country apart from the UK, despite testing only about seven people in every 1,000 - more than some countries in Latin America but far fewer than Italy, for example, which has tested about 88 in every 1,000. Experts say Peru's healthcare system was underprepared, leading to more deaths, but several other social and economic factors can help explain why Peru is struggling to contain the outbreak. Read more here Sonia KatariaBBC News Some children who live in the Leicester lockdown zone but attend school outside of the area will not be able to cross the border, the Department for Education (DfE) has confirmed. From Thursday, only vulnerable children and children of key
workers can travel across the boundary in either direction for school or
appointments with social workers. Other
children have been asked to stay at home. The DfE said: ""If you are a child or young person (other than a vulnerable child or child of a critical worker) that lives in Leicester but attends school or college outside the affected area, you must stay at home."" Some children who attend St Lukeâs Primary School in Thurnby, Leicestershire, which is outside the zone and will be open as normal tomorrow, are from within the boundary. Headteacher Paul Galvin said he was ""deeply sorry"" to the families of those affected. He said: ""It might be difficult for families who are inside the lockdown zone - as we are just outside the boundary - especially if they are not children of critical workers."" He added the school has ""adapted and will keep adapting to changes"" during the coronavirus pandemic. The school has been open since the lockdown in March for vulnerable children and children of key workers, and reopened for Reception and Year 1 in June. A ""small"" outbreak of coronavirus among workers at a bed factory in West Yorkshire has been confirmed. Eight members of staff at the Dura Beds factory in Batley have tested positive for the virus this week, a statement says. All staff - a total of 107 workers - will now be offered tests, according to the joint statement by Kirklees Council and Public Health England (PHE). The Dura Beds factory has been closed for two weeks as a safety precaution for its employees and their families, the statement adds. The firm is now ""working closely"" with the council and PHE so those who have tested positive can be followed up by the NHS Test and Trace programme and self-isolate. People who might have come into contact with an infected individual will be contacted and may be advised to self-isolate for 14 days. The statement adds: ""While the risk to residents from this outbreak is very low, everyone in Kirklees should continue to socially distance, wash hands regularly for 20 seconds with soap and water and get tested if they have symptoms."" Across the UK, the number of newly confirmed coronavirus cases each day has been falling since a peak in April. You can read morehere. Councils in England need urgent support as they face a funding gap of Â£7.4bn due to a loss of income related to coronavirus,the Local Government Association (LGA) says. Local authorities have come under increased pressure during the pandemic as demand for services such as social care has grown, while at the same time, income from local taxation and charges has dropped. James Jamieson, chairman of the LGA, which represents English councils and London boroughs, said ""further funding and flexibilities are now urgent"" if councils are to avoid taking steps such as ""in-year cuts to local services"" to cope with funding gaps. Whitehall has given Â£3.2bn funding to all English councils in two grants to help cover coronavirus costs, but the LGA says between March and June councils had already incurred costs of Â£4.8bn. Almost 44,000 people have died with coronavirus in the UK according to the latest daily government figures - which count deaths with a positive test result. But the overall total is likely to be higher. You can read morehere. Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter As Leicester, in England's East Midlands, has become the first city put under a local lockdown, misleading claims have been shared on social media. A string of local councils have posted on Twitter and Facebook to counter online rumours of imminent lockdowns in their areas - making it clear none have been announced. A rise in cases has been recorded in some local authority areasbut a Public Health England (PHE) spokesperson told the BBC that using this data to predict which areas would see significant rises in cases is ""not appropriate"" because it doesn't give a ""complete picture"" of the local situation. Meanwhile, a number of social media posts attributing the local lockdown in Leicester to videos of crowds of people taking part in anti-racism protests in the city centre a few weeks ago have led to racist and abusive comments directed at protesters. We've identified posts in Facebook groups that may have sparked some of the rumours. You can read morehere. Uganda hosts more than 400,000 refugees from DR Congo alone and many more from South Sudan Uganda has opened part of its border with the Democratic Republic of Congo to allow in thousands of people stuck in no-man's land for more than a month due to the coronavirus pandemic. At least 3,000 of them fled their homes in May after inter-communal clashes in north-eastern Ituri province. But they were unable to cross into Uganda to seek safety as the country had closed its borders in March to control the spread of coronavirus. It has been agreed the refugees will be quarantined before being settled. This will happen for 14 days at a new isolation centre, 13km (eight miles) from the border. The UN's refugee agency (UNHCR) says sample testing will be carried out on the group to see if coronavirus is present among them. This will help authorities decide when the refugees can be transferred to camps. Read more here. Simon JackBBC Business Editor The worldwide economic impact of the coronavirus has been seismic and the job losses are starting to crash on the shores of the UK with increasing frequency and severity. The 1,700 UK job losses at Airbus had a grim inevitability to them, given the destruction of demand in the aviation industry. Demand for air travel in April and May was down more than 90% and normality is not expected to return for up to three years - maybe never for the more lucrative business class travel. BA, Easyjet, Ryanair and Rolls Royce have already announced 20,000 job losses between them, so Airbus was never going to emerge unscathed. The travel wipeout has seen SSP, the owner of stalwart transport hub tenants Upper Crust and CafÃ© Ritazza, cut 5,000 posts.  We already know that the number of workers on UK payrolls shrank more than 600,000 between March and May, according to the ONS. That looks like the thin end of a very big wedge as the government's unprecedented job support scheme tapers off, with employers being asked to share the burden of the cost from the end of July to its withdrawal at the end of October.

As she tells the BBC's Alex Stanger, the end result was a very personal affair.  Matt Forward with his hawk in Trafalgar Square Whether it's nurses, carers or supermarket staff, key workers have rightly been hailed as heroes during lockdown. But behind the pandemic's front line there have also been many others who have been busy doing essential jobs. Matt Forward's job is to keep the pigeons away from Trafalgar Square, in central London. Pest management was covered in the key worker list, so throughout the lockdown Matt drove himself and his Harris hawk 45 miles (70km) to the iconic square early two mornings a week. Matt, who lives in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said he never thought of stopping his job because of lockdown. ""If someone wasn't there doing the job that we do, we'd be overrun,"" he says. Read more about how lockdown has been for Britain's unlikely key workers here Mark EastonHome editor Most of Britain is preparing for an easing of lockdown restrictions. But public
concern at the risks from coronavirus has risen to the highest level since the
end of April, a new poll conducted by Ipsos Mori this week suggests. However,
the survey also says the public is becoming more comfortable about
returning to work and sending children back to school. A month
ago, 37% of those surveyed said they were âvery concernedâ about the risks to
the country.  This new poll suggests that has risen to 50%. Concern about
the risks to individuals has also risen from 24% to 29%. The
survey asks people whether they would feel comfortable in a range of situations
if lockdown measures were lifted.  The proportion of parents who said they
would be comfortable sending their children to school has risen to 49%, up from
38% a month earlier. Two-thirds of people would be comfortable meeting friends or family outside their
household, also a rise from six weeks before. But the poll suggests around six in 10 people would be anxious going to bars or restaurants, using public
transport or lavatories and only 15% said they would be comfortable going to
large sport or music events. Ipsos MORI interviewed a representative sample of 1,078 British adults aged 18-75 online between 26-29 June 2020. Data are weighted to match the profile of the population. All polls are subject to a wide range of potential sources of error. Prof Van-Tam speaking at the government's daily news briefing on 30 May Here's some more from the government's Science and Technology committee hearing that's been going on this afternoon. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer, has said there are enough doses of remdesivir for use on hospitalised patients in the UK. It comes on the back of news that theUS had secured almost all of the forthcoming global supply of the drug, which has been shown to help people recover from Covid-19 more quickly. Prof Van-Tam said: ""Right now, there are stocks in the UK - and I judge us to have adequate stocks - of pre-licensed, as in unlicensed, clinical trial stocks of remdesivir which are available to be used through the emergency access protocol."" Remdesivir is produced by the US firm Gilead Sciences and is the first drug to have been approved by authorities in the US to be used to treat the disease. The US administration is set to receive 500,000 doses - or 100% of the company's supply production - in July, 90% of it in August and 90% in September.  ValeTodo Downtown has become the Downtown Market Peru's largest LGBT nightclub has reopened its doors as lockdown eases - as a grocery store. ValeTodo Downtown is one of the best known dance floors in the capital, Lima. But the club's famed drag queens will now be serving milk, fruit and bread rather than cocktails as nightclubs are still not permitted to open. Times have been tough for the club's 120 employees since the pandemic hit. ""I was very depressed because I have been doing this art for years, but you have to adapt to new challenges for the future,"" Belaluh McQueen, who is identified by her stage name, told Reuters news agency. ""We have a new job opportunity,"" she added, standing in the newly named Downtown Market in a sequined suit, high heels and a mask. ""Before, I used to come here to dance and have a good time, but now we come to buy,"" said Alexandra Herrera, a regular attendee of the club. ""The thing is to reinvent yourself."" More than 9,500 people have died of Covid-19 in Peru. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0

I think I have organised that, which will give us some breathing space. ""I have put my neck on the block a few times, particularly at Leeds, but I have not lost a club yet and I am optimistic we will resolve the problem."" The administrators say there have been expressions of interest, while Whelan has said he will see if he can ""help in any way"". He told Talksport: ""I'll have to stick my nose in a little and have a look, to see if I can find out what's caused it. ""I'll have to just try because the people of Wigan will be in absolute shock, because I am. ""Wigan is Wigan and I built the stadium, so I am going to have to see if I can help in any way, shape or form."" In May, EFL chairman Rick Parry told the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee thatclubs were facing a Â£200m financial hole by Septemberand were ""stacking up creditors"". EFL matches were suspended in March and, while Championship fixtures resumed on 20 June, League One and Two clubs voted to curtail their seasons early, with many pinpointing financial implications as one of the reasons against returning. Simon Stone, BBC Sport Wigan are the first, but the big question is how many more clubs will enter administration when the full financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic starts to be felt? When I interviewed Huddersfield owner Phil Hodgkinsonin May, his bleak assessment was that ""50 or 60"" clubs could go bust. That view was felt to be extreme. However, the brutal truth is football is being played without fans at present. That means clubs such as Manchester United are losing Â£5m worth of income per game. They, at least, have a massive TV deal to support them. As you go down the pyramid, the TV income reduces massively. Can League One, League Two and the National Leagues really play to no fans? These are all full-time clubs, many of whom used the government's furlough scheme to shield themselves. But that option will not exist shortly. Wigan may not be alone.

"Upper Crust owner SSP Group says up to 5,000 jobs could be cut across its UK outlets and head office, as it struggles with the reduction in passenger travel. The firm said global sales in April and May were 95% below the previous year's. SSP operates 580 food and drink outlets across the UK, mostly at railway stations and airports, but fewer than 10 are currently open. The company expects only one-fifth of its UK stores to be open by the autumn. SSP employs around 39,000 staff worldwide across 2,800 outlets.  Last month, it said it had suffered ""extremely low sales"" after the coronavirus pandemic forced it to shut branches. As well as Upper Crust bakeries, the company also owns the CaffÃ¨ Ritazza chain, deli operator Camden Food Co. and luxury bar chain Cabin. SSP joins a growing list of companies slashing jobs as the UK economy suffers its worst contraction in 41 years. In the past few days, a number of firms have announced UK job cuts: Aerospace giant Airbus has said itwants to cut 1,700 jobs in the UK, as part of plans to shed 15,000 posts across the whole company Cutbacks at EasyJet meannearly 1,300 UK crew members and 727 pilots are at risk of losing their jobsat the airline, unions say About 600 workers at shirtmaker TM Lewin will lose their jobsas the firm's 66 stores are closed Royal Mail has said it isto cut 2,000 management jobs ""Covid-19 continues to have an unprecedented impact on the travel industry and on SSP's businesses in all geographies,"" said SSP Group chief executive Simon Smith. ""We are beginning to see early signs of recovery in some parts of the world and are starting to open units as passenger demand picks up. However, in the UK the pace of the recovery continues to be slow,"" he said. The company added: ""If the pace of the recovery continues at the current level, this could lead to up to c. 5,000 roles becoming redundant from within the head office and UK operations."" What went wrong for retail giant Intu? 'We are battered, bruised, but wiser' While SSP operates across more than 30 countries, including the US, India and China, the job cuts are only being made at its UK business. At this time of year, the company would normally employ about 9,000 people across the UK. Staff have been enrolled on the government-paid furlough scheme throughout the coronavirus crisis. The company said it had planned to reopen UK outlets as passenger demand returned, adding: ""The reality is that passenger numbers still remain at very low levels."" Mr Smith said the firm would swiftly reopen UK units if there were improved sales over the summer. In a statement, the company said it had access to around Â£750m in liquidity and it was confident it had sufficient funds to allow it to operate ""throughout even its most pessimistic scenario"".

He said that there were 22,000 weekly cases in England but only 5,000 were asked to provide details. But his first number is drawn from a survey. Each week the Office for National Statistics tests a sample of people and then forms an estimate for the population as a whole based on the percentage who are positive. It is an estimate and not people who have actually been tested, so therefore the teams could not trace that many people. In reality, the latest week in the figures (11-17 June) saw 6,100 people actually test positive for coronavirus. Of these, the government was able to reach 4,869 people. Reality Check Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised Prime Minister Boris Johnson's ""build, build, build"" speech yesterday as offering âinvestment equivalent to less than Â£100 per person across the UKâ. Sir Kier has taken the Â£5bn of infrastructure spending allocated and divided it by the UK population of 66.7 million to get to less than Â£100 per person. The prime minister responded by talking about a Â£600bn overall package of investment. This figure was used in the government's Spring Budget in March in the context of its plans for infrastructure spending over the course of the whole parliament. You can read ourfact-check of Boris Johnsonâs economic speechhere. House of CommonsParliament The main story from this week's PMQs was confirmation from Boris Johnson that people withBritish National Overseas status from Hong Kong will get limited leave to remain in the UK. The Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer also questioned the PM about the government's handling of anoutbreak of coronavirus in Leicester, which has led to the city going back in to lockdown from Thursday. Sir Keir said there had been a ""lost week"" when the city didn't have the details of testing data in the community. The prime minister said Sir Keir was mistaken, and that data had been shared. Boris Johnson was also questioned about his'new deal' plan for economic recovery.Sir Keir said Tuesday's announcement was worth less than Â£100 per person.

"Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer go head to head for weekly PMQs People with British National Overseas status from Hong Kong to get limited leave to remain in the UK Foreign Secretary to make a statement on China's new 'anti-protest' law in Hong Kong Doctors call for coronavirus data to be shared more quickly to local authorities Leicester prepares to go back into lockdown on Thursday due to spike in virus infections England's local authorities say funding gap has grown to Â£7.4bn due to Covid-19 Gavin Stamp, Paul Seddon and Richard Morris Reality Check Labour leader Keir Starmer saidthree quarters of people with Covid-19 are not being reached by test and trace teams,external. He said that there were 22,000 weekly cases in England but only 5,000 were asked to provide details. But his first number is drawn from a survey. Each week the Office for National Statistics tests a sample of people and then forms an estimate for the population as a whole based on the percentage who are positive. It is an estimate and not people who have actually been tested, so therefore the teams could not trace that many people. In reality, the latest week in the figures (11-17 June) saw 6,100 people actually test positive for coronavirus. Of these, the government was able to reach 4,869 people. Reality Check Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised Prime Minister Boris Johnson's ""build, build, build"" speech yesterday as offering âinvestment equivalent to less than Â£100 per person across the UKâ. Sir Kier has taken the Â£5bn of infrastructure spending allocated and divided it by the UK population of 66.7 million to get to less than Â£100 per person. The prime minister responded by talking about a Â£600bn overall package of investment. This figure was used in the government's Spring Budget in March in the context of its plans for infrastructure spending over the course of the whole parliament. You can read ourfact-check of Boris Johnsonâs economic speechhere. House of CommonsParliament The main story from this week's PMQs was confirmation from Boris Johnson that people withBritish National Overseas status from Hong Kong will get limited leave to remain in the UK. The Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer also questioned the PM about the government's handling of anoutbreak of coronavirus in Leicester, which has led to the city going back in to lockdown from Thursday. Sir Keir said there had been a ""lost week"" when the city didn't have the details of testing data in the community. The prime minister said Sir Keir was mistaken, and that data had been shared. Boris Johnson was also questioned about his'new deal' plan for economic recovery.Sir Keir said Tuesday's announcement was worth less than Â£100 per person. The PM said the overall the package is worth Â£600bn and accused the opposition of equivocating. ""We are the builders, they are the blockers"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

"Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry had been celebrating Ms Henry's birthday before they were reported missing An 18-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering two sisters in a park in London. The bodies ofNicole Smallman, 27, and Bibaa Henry, 46,were found at Fryent Gardens in Wembley on 7 June, two days after a birthday party in the park. Post-mortem tests revealed they died from multiple stab wounds. Their family has been told in person about the arrest, the Met said. The arrested man from south-London was taken into custody where he remains. The sisters had met friends in the park at about 19:00 BST on 5 June to celebrate Ms Henry's birthday. The group had been in an area of Fryent Gardens which was about a five-minute walk from the Valley Drive entrance. Images recovered from their phones - which were found in a pond - showed the sisters dancing with fairy lights hours before they were killed Ms Smallman and Ms Henry are thought to have ended up alone by about 12:30 on 6 June. Police said they were in ""good spirits"" and ""taking selfie pictures, listening to music and dancing with fairy lights"" until at least 01:13. Calls to them from family at 02:30 went unanswered, police said. Extensive forensic work has finished at the park but smaller searches in outer areas continue, police said. More than 1,000 exhibits including property belonging to Ms Smallman and Ms Henry have been recovered and hours of CCTV collected, the Met said. Extensive forensic work in the park has concluded, though smaller searches will continue Det Ch Insp Simon Harding, said: ""Given the significance of this development, we visited the family in person today to inform them of the arrest. ""Our thoughts remain with them at this very difficult time."" The arrest comes aftertwo Met Police officers were suspendedafter ""inappropriate photos"" were taken of the crime scene. Nicole Smallman's body was found by her boyfriend after she was reported missing The unnamed officers were arrested by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) on 22 June and have since been bailed. Talking to the BBC last week, the girls' mother Mina Smallmansaid the pictures ""dehumanised"" her children. The IOPC said the pictures were allegedly ""shared with a small number of others"", adding the Met was ""handling matters involving those members of the public who may have received those images"". The police watchdog is also separately investigating how the Met handled calls from worried family and friends of the sisters after they went missing.

"More than 12,000 people in the UK are set to lose their jobs after a raft of firms announced cuts in the past 48 hours. The cuts are mainly being made by High Street retailers and in aviation - two of the sectors hardest hit by the coronavirus lockdown. John Lewis has said it will close stores but has not confirmed how many jobs will go. Topshop owner Arcadia and Harrods said they planned a total of 1,180 job cuts. Other lay-offs that have been announced include: Up to 5,000 job cutsat Upper Crust owner SSP Group Up to 700 jobs at Harrods About 600 workersat shirtmaker TM Lewin Up to 900 cuts at management consulting firm Accenture 300 staff cuts across Virgin Money, Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank 1,700 UK jobsat plane-maker Airbus And1,300 crew and 727 pilotsat EasyJet Have you recently been made redundant? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. WH Smith, Bensons for Beds, Wrights Pies, tableware-maker Steelite International, the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool and Norwich Theatre Royal have also announced plans to reduce staff. Businesses have been hit hard since the UK went into lockdown on 23 March, and even though restrictions are gradually being eased, consumer demand remains depressed. The government's furlough scheme will also start to be pared back from August, and firms are cutting jobs to control their costs. James Phillips could be made redundant James Phillips, a mechanical engineer, told the BBC he fears he could be made redundant. He has been on furlough since March but has now been asked to attend a redundancy consultation meeting with his employer. He said: ""I'm three months away from having a baby, and I was about to sign for a mortgage this week on a new property, so it's impacted me massively, really. Everything's been put on hold."" Sue Hudson lost her job as a legal secretary at a solicitors in Bournemouth in April and has not found a job since. ""There are too many people chasing too few jobs,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""It's very disheartening."" For most businesses, staffing is the highest cost, and many have been using the government's furlough schemes to keep workers on. But the programme - which is paying 80% of the wages of more than 9 million workers - will start to be pared back from next month and will end in October. Upper Crust owner SSP has announced 5,000 job cuts As firms have to consult for 30-45 days when making redundancies, some will feel that now is the time to act. ""There is already a cost to the employer from just a month's time,"" said BBC business correspondent Simon Gompertz. ""Larger employers, planning bigger layoffs, will be eyeing that escalating wage bill and maybe thinking the sooner they move the better."" In an email to staff, Harrods' managing director Michael Ward said the department store was making its cuts with a heavy heart. ""Due to the ongoing impacts of this pandemic, we as a business will need to make reductions to our workforce."" He said it would take a ""drastic improvement in external conditions"" for Harrods to recover and return to growth. John Lewis, which was already looking to ""right size"" its business before the crisis, said it had not decided which shops would close. ""The reality is that we have too much store space for the way people want to shop now,"" the company said in a statement. Topshop owner Arcadia, which is slashing a fifth of its head office staff, also blamed the pandemic for its cuts. ""Due to the impact of Covid-19 on our business including the closure for over three months of all our stores and head offices, we have today informed staff of the need to restructure our head offices,"" it said. The reason the government has thrown tens of billions of pounds at trying to hold back the waves of unemployment is they realise that it does long-lasting damage to demand in the economy. There is no doubt that the furlough scheme helped delay the impact, but this barrage of job cut announcements suggests the government is now struggling to turn the tide. Boris Johnson described the virus as ""still circling like a shark in our waters"". It was an odd metaphor to use, considering the PM has previously praised the Mayor in Jaws for keeping the beaches open. One thing seems certain: to combat the huge economic shock whose repercussions are being felt in airlines, factories and now high streets, the government will need a bigger boat than the Â£5bn of previously announced spending accelerated yesterday. The pressure is now on Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Read more Harrods said the ""devastation in international travel"" had meant it had lost ""key customers"" Retailers were already struggling before the coronavirus due to changes in shopping habits as consumers buy more online, as well as rising wages and business rates.

The vast majority of shops were told to shut in March when the UK went into lockdown, prompting a sharp fall in sales. And while demand rebounded 12% in May,retail it remains well below pre-lockdown levels. Demand for air travel in April and May was down more than 90%, as airlines were hit hard by global lockdown measures and travel restrictions. And normal levels of demand are not expected to return for up to three years. While planes aren't flying, airlines aren't making money, but they still have funds flying out of the door. And firms that rely on airlines flying, such as commercial aerospace businesses, have decreased production.

"Local authorities are to be given access to postcode-level data about the number of people testing positive for coronavirus in their areas after it was agreed with the Department of Health. It comes after Leicester became the first city tohave a local lockdown imposedfollowing a rise in cases. Labour leader Keir Starmer said there had been a ""lost week"" due to city officials not having full testing data. The prime minister said the figures had been shared with all local authorities. But, at Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons, Sir Keir said officials in Leicester had only received full figures on Thursday. Until now local authorities have not routinely had full access to the data on people who are tested for the virus in the community. But the agreement, signed individually with councils over the past week, now gives them access to a digital dashboard which shows test results down to a postcode level. Leicester lockdown boundary line branded 'stupid' Scots border 'cluster' of virus cases investigated Leicester's new lockdown rules at a glance Dr Jeanelle De Gruchy, president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, welcomed the news and said ""timely, high quality and consistent data"" would be key to combating local outbreaks. But Prof Azeem Majeed, from Imperial College London, said the country had been slow in areas of its Covid-19, response and said the data-sharing agreement ""should have been in place some time ago"". On Monday, it was revealed Leicester's seven-day infection rate was 135 cases per 100,000 people - three times that of the next highest city. The local authorities in England with the next highest rate in the week to 21 June was Bradford with 69 cases per 100,000 people, followed by Barnsley and Rochdale with 55 and 53 cases per 100,000 respectively. The city's mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby, also criticised the government and PHE for being slow to share testing data - saying city officials had been trying to get figures ""for weeks"". The British Medical Association, which represents doctors in the UK, said providing local leaders with up-to-date information was ""vital"" in containing outbreaks, particularly asa contact-tracing app was not yet in place. Walkers confirms 28 virus cases at site Why has action taken so long in Leicester?  Officials are also keeping a close eye on Bedford, Blackburn with Darwen, Kirklees, Oldham, Rotherham and Tameside which seen 30 to 44.9 cases per 100,000 people. Imperial College London's Prof Neil Ferguson,who used to advise the government before he resigned for breaking lockdown rules, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""inevitable"" there would be further local outbreaks adding that high rates of the virus in Bradford and Doncaster were ""clearly of concern"". The BMA's Dr Chaand Nagpaul said Prime Minister Boris Johnson's ""whack-a-mole strategy"" to tackle local outbreaks would be no use if the people leading the response were ""not given the most accurate up-to-date data"". Labour MP Yvette Cooper tweeted it was ""incomprehensible"" that health authorities in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, had also been trying to get hold of local data on swab test results of the wider population but had not been able to. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SOCIAL LIFE:When will pubs, bars and restaurants reopen? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Sir Keir also criticised the speed of the government response in Leicester, saying it took 11 days from the announcement that cases were rising for the lockdown to be tightened. Mr Johnson said the government had started taking action on 8 June, but ""unfortunately it did not prove possible to get the results seen elsewhere"", referring to another localised outbreak ata meat plant in West Yorkshire. Across the rest of England, the lockdown is set to ease further on Saturday with the reopening of bars, restaurants and hair salons, but the BMA said it wanted the government to set metric ""trigger points"" for when action will be taken to reintroduce local and national restrictions. The BMA said this metric should consider not only the regional reproductive number or R rate - the number of people that one infected person, on average, will pass the virus on to - but also the proportion of the population currently infected. A government spokesperson said it had been working closely with local partners, providing the resources and tools needed to take swift action to deal with any new local spikes in infection. It remains one of the most baffling aspects of the current approach. Local authorities have not routinely been given information about their residents who test positive. Even though they are intrinsically involved in the system as the local arm of the contact tracing service, councils have only been getting what the national system deems appropriate. They have been asked to chase up the so-called complex cases - where people test positive in care homes, prisons or schools - so they get that information quickly. But they have not been given real-time information about individual residents who test positive. Local directors of public health say it has hampered their ability to look for patterns and clusters developing. In theory, the national system should do this, but why not have a second pair of eyes? Especially one that knows the local situation much better? This is beginning to change - data sharing agreements have just been signed with local authorities and Public Health England has now set up a system that should do this in a comprehensive and speedy manner from now on. But the fact it has not already and the experience of those on the ground in Leicester - where cases were going up for a number of weeks - suggests local outbreaks developing in the community may not yet have been spotted as quickly as they should. Under the local lockdown, announced on Monday evening, non-essential shops in Leicester have been forced to shut and schools have closed, except for vulnerable pupils and children of ""critical workers"". People are also being advised not to travel in or out of the city. The measures will last until at least 18 July and apply to the city centre and a number of suburbs. New laws are not planned ""at this stage"" to stop people entering or leaving Leicester, Downing Street said, as local police weigh options for enforcing the lockdown. Leicestershire Police Chief Constable Simon Cole said people would have to be ""pretty daft"" to leave the lockdown area for a pint of beer when pubs reopened elsewhere. ""This is a serious public health risk. Do you want to bring that illness into contact with your mates or your family?"" he asked. ""Certainly I wouldn't want to do that. We do work really closely with all the neighbouring forces - we've been communicating with them so they can understand."" He added: ""I'd really implore people - some of the leading health experts in the country are saying stay at home and that seems pretty shrewd advice to me."" Meanwhile, the UK death toll rose by 176, to 43,906, according to the latest figures from the Department for Health and Social Care.

"National Records of Scotland figures say 35 deaths were linked to Covid-19 in the seven days to 28 June The figure is down 14 on the previous week, and is the ninth weekly reduction in a row The total number of weekly deaths has fallen below the five-year average for the first time since March First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the figures show that ""real and sustained"" progress is being made A cross-border cluster has been identified, with nine cases in the Gretna and Annan area BBC Scotland News That's all from us here at the live page on Wednesday 1 July. Here are the headlines from today: Both Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson have confirmed there have been no talks about local quarantine restrictions within the UK The outbreak involves the Annan and Gretna areas The cross-border ""cluster"" of coronavirus cases around Dumfries and the north west of England ""continues to illustrate the challenge we face with this virus"", according to Scotland's national clinical director. Professor Jason Leitch goes on to tell Radio Scotland: ""This will be, unfortunately, the new normal, for a little while, of these outbreaks and containing them."" NHS Dumfries and Gallowayconfirmed there had been nine new cases of Covid-19 in the Gretna and Annan areas since Monday. Prof Leitch says if the group of positive cases can be contained and contact and trace works as it should, then ""you can close down that cluster without too much more trouble"". The danger is if the contacts can't be traced then potentially something more severe might have to be done, he adds. Prof Leitch hopes that will not happen and he says the incident management team on both sides of the border is meeting now and he is confident the process will work. The national clinical director stresses that people must organise a test if they have the symptoms and tell the truth regarding their movements, so that their contacts can be traced to close down the chain of transmission. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Stand-up comedian Gary Faulds says his career was ""flying"" before the coronavirus crisis but he was forced to declare himself homeless last week, without any income. ""It has been tough but the system is amazing,"" he tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""I could not have been helped any more. As a former soldier, father-of-four Gary was given assistance by charity Glasgow Helping Heroes and says the staff at the hotel he stayed in briefly were excellent. ""You shouldn't be afraid to ask for help, the help is there,"" adds the comic, who now been set up with a council flat in Baillieston. ""The hotels are a real mix of people, some with addictions, but everyone talks to each other - while keeping socially distanced - and there was a breakfast every morning. ""The amount of help I've been offered has been unbelievable, from food, couches to carpets. Covid has made people dig deep and focus on their communities.

The National Records of Scotland (NRS) said a total of 1,006 people died between 22 and 28 June. This was actually slightly lower than the average of 1,026 deaths recorded in the same week over the past five years. The figures reflect the continuing fall in the number of coronavirus deaths in Scotland. There were 35 deaths linked to the virus last week - the lowest number since the middle of March.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Sir George Mathewson was chair of the Royal Bank of Scotland and of the council of Scottish economic advisors Former Royal Bank of Scotland chairman Sir George Mathewson thinks every single company should be saved by the government and allowed to rebuild and come back. The financial expert says the economic situation in the UK at the moment is less of a recession and more of a natural disaster. He thinks the UK government has a duty to provide for each and every business. And it should not expect to see the money back. This is not a conventional recession and I don't think we should address it with conventional approaches - increased government spending soft loans lower interest rates etc. I think this is more akin to disaster relief that's required. Every company in Scotland small or big is a national asset. It employs people, pays taxes. contributes to the national wellbeing and it's essential we provide the ability for each and every company however small to survive so it can come again.

""We will always have new cases coming in, but we need to keep on top of it and keep the numbers down as low as possible,"" Dr Lamberton says. ""It is paramount that those contacted isolate even if they don't have symptoms."" The UK missed out on the chance to take part in EU schemes to source medical equipment during the coronavirus outbreak because the information was sent to an outdated email address, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said. He suggested that a failure by EU officials to update their records might have been to blame for the situation. The EU started to co-ordinate the purchasing of personal protective equipment, testing kits and ventilators in February. In a letter to the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, Raab said: ""The relevant EU committee, the Joint Procurement Agreement Steering Committee [JPASC], was relaunched by the European Commission in September 2019, after three years of not meeting. As the government's furlough scheme starts to wind up, the real impact of the pandemic is being felt. A further 176 people have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community in the UK, according to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). This brings the total to 43,906 as of 17:00 BST on Tuesday. The government figures do not include all deaths involving Covid-19 across the UK. Here in Scotland the weekly NRS figures showed there were 35 deaths linked to the virus last week - the lowest number since the middle of March. The total number of people who are dying from all causes in Scotland has returned to normal levels,according to the official figures,external. Both Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson have confirmed there have been no talks about local quarantine restrictions within the UK The idea of quarantining visitors entering Scotland from other parts of the UK is ""astonishing and shameful"", Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said ""all options"" must remain open should coronavirus infection rates ""diverge"" between different parts of the country. However both leaders said there had been no talks about the potential for new travel restrictions to be imposed. Ms Sturgeon said it would be ""frankly disgraceful"" to politicise the issue. She said if advisors told her that a quarantine rule would be ""a necessary measure to protect people"" then she would be ""failing in my duty not to consider it"". Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Deaths in Scotland from all causes are below the average for this time of the year for the first time since lockdown. But coronavirus has not gone away and we will have to deal with local outbreaks like the cross-border cluster revealed earlier today between Dumfries and Galloway and the North West of England.

"Local authorities are to be given access to postcode-level data about the number of people testing positive for coronavirus in their areas after it was agreed with the Department of Health. It comes after Leicester became the first city tohave a local lockdown imposedfollowing a rise in cases. Labour leader Keir Starmer said there had been a ""lost week"" due to city officials not having full testing data. The prime minister said the figures had been shared with all local authorities. But, at Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons, Sir Keir said officials in Leicester had only received full figures on Thursday. Until now local authorities have not routinely had full access to the data on people who are tested for the virus in the community. But the agreement, signed individually with councils over the past week, now gives them access to a digital dashboard which shows test results down to a postcode level. Leicester lockdown boundary line branded 'stupid' Scots border 'cluster' of virus cases investigated Leicester's new lockdown rules at a glance Dr Jeanelle De Gruchy, president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, welcomed the news and said ""timely, high quality and consistent data"" would be key to combating local outbreaks. But Prof Azeem Majeed, from Imperial College London, said the country had been slow in areas of its Covid-19, response and said the data-sharing agreement ""should have been in place some time ago"". On Monday, it was revealed Leicester's seven-day infection rate was 135 cases per 100,000 people - three times that of the next highest city. The local authorities in England with the next highest rate in the week to 21 June was Bradford with 69 cases per 100,000 people, followed by Barnsley and Rochdale with 55 and 53 cases per 100,000 respectively. The city's mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby, also criticised the government and PHE for being slow to share testing data - saying city officials had been trying to get figures ""for weeks"". The British Medical Association, which represents doctors in the UK, said providing local leaders with up-to-date information was ""vital"" in containing outbreaks, particularly asa contact-tracing app was not yet in place. Walkers confirms 28 virus cases at site Why has action taken so long in Leicester?

"Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry had been celebrating Ms Henry's birthday before they were reported missing An 18-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering two sisters in a park in London. The bodies ofNicole Smallman, 27, and Bibaa Henry, 46,were found at Fryent Gardens in Wembley on 7 June, two days after a birthday party in the park. Post-mortem tests revealed they died from multiple stab wounds. Their family has been told in person about the arrest, the Met said. The arrested man from south-London was taken into custody where he remains. The sisters had met friends in the park at about 19:00 BST on 5 June to celebrate Ms Henry's birthday. The group had been in an area of Fryent Gardens which was about a five-minute walk from the Valley Drive entrance. Images recovered from their phones - which were found in a pond - showed the sisters dancing with fairy lights hours before they were killed Ms Smallman and Ms Henry are thought to have ended up alone by about 12:30 on 6 June. Police said they were in ""good spirits"" and ""taking selfie pictures, listening to music and dancing with fairy lights"" until at least 01:13. Calls to them from family at 02:30 went unanswered, police said. Extensive forensic work has finished at the park but smaller searches in outer areas continue, police said. More than 1,000 exhibits including property belonging to Ms Smallman and Ms Henry have been recovered and hours of CCTV collected, the Met said. Extensive forensic work in the park has concluded, though smaller searches will continue Det Ch Insp Simon Harding, said: ""Given the significance of this development, we visited the family in person today to inform them of the arrest. ""Our thoughts remain with them at this very difficult time."" The arrest comes aftertwo Met Police officers were suspendedafter ""inappropriate photos"" were taken of the crime scene. Nicole Smallman's body was found by her boyfriend after she was reported missing The unnamed officers were arrested by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) on 22 June and have since been bailed. Talking to the BBC last week, the girls' mother Mina Smallmansaid the pictures ""dehumanised"" her children. The IOPC said the pictures were allegedly ""shared with a small number of others"", adding the Met was ""handling matters involving those members of the public who may have received those images"". The police watchdog is also separately investigating how the Met handled calls from worried family and friends of the sisters after they went missing.

"Gemma Sutton, Clive Rowe and Tameka Empson in Aladdin at the Hackney Empire in 2018 Oh yes it is. Oh no it isn't. The big question facing many theatres at the moment is - is panto season cancelled? Norwich Theatre Royal became one of the first to call off its pantomime this week, saying the risk was ""too great"" after three months with no income. Venues in Buxton and Welwyn Garden City have also cancelled, while Leicester Curve has scrapped its festive musical. Pantos are crucial to theatre earnings, and this Christmas could prove to be make or break for some venues' futures. Conservative MP Giles Watling, a former actor and panto dame, warned of the impact if festive shows are scrapped. ""I think many provincial theatres will go to the wall, frankly, because that's the time they can make the money,"" he told BBC News. ""It puts money in the coffers to support the rest of the cultural offer. I can see massive problems ahead if something isn't done and soon."" Norwich Theatre said more than half of its workforce is at risk of redundancy Theatres have been shut since March because of the coronavirus pandemic, and the government hasn't given a date for the return of live performances. The UK's biggest pantomime producer Qdos has set a deadline of 3 August to decide whether its 34 shows - in cities from Bristol to Birmingham and Bradford - can go ahead. Qdos managing director Michael Harrison told BBC News there could be ""a lot of redundancies"" in regional theatres if Aladdin, Snow White and Dick Whittington fall victim to live entertainment's extended lockdown. ""If Christmas is cancelled - or if pantomime is cancelled - then the theatres will be left with no choice,"" he said. ""And I'm afraid that if it gets to 3 August and we haven't got clarity from the government, we will then have to begin the process of unravelling the season."" Theatres are waiting for a timetable for reopening He wants an official date for the theatres to reopen, but said pantos will only be able to go ahead if social distancing is put behind us. ""Commercial theatre can't operate on anything less than 100% capacity. It's no good saying you can sell every other row,"" he said. ""How can you social distance actors on stage? How can you social distance dancers who have to touch each other? How do you social distance somebody who has to do a quick costume change? There's all of those things to take into consideration. ""We can adapt if we have some clarity about what the position might be. But we do need to know in advance to set those ideas and plans in motion."" John Barrowman is due to star in Snow White at the Bristol Hippodrome Although social distancing in the audience may make shows unviable, The Elgiva theatre in Chesham, Buckinghamshire, recently switched from Snow White to Sleeping Beauty to reduce the number of performers backstage. Manager David Cooper said,external: ""Sleeping Beauty means fewer people backstage, as there won't be any dwarfs, so we can ensure the cast has the proper social distancing."" Last week, the government published a five-step roadmap for restarting live performance, butwere widely criticisedfor not attaching a timetable or financial support. Regional theatre group faces huge job losses Will Santa have to social distance this year? Why panto is 'the hardest job in showbusiness' Earlier this month, Julian Bird, chief executive of the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre,told MPs,externalthat Christmas shows were economically ""vital"" for theatres. He said: ""It is the time when theatres, being blunt, make the most profit, and that profit they need for the rest of the year to invest in everything they do and all the other types of productions."" John Barrowman, who is due to star in Snow White at Bristol Hippodrome this winter, told ITV's Good Morning Britain that if Christmas shows are scrapped, ""70% of theatres around the UK are going to be gone"". Not all theatres stage traditional pantos - seasonal musicals are also under threat. Last week, Leicester Curve called off The Wizard of Oz, saying such productions ""take months of preparation"". In the US, Broadway theatres have confirmed they will stay shut until 2021. On Wednesday, Norwich Theatre, which runs the city's Theatre Royal, Playhouse and Stage Two, announced that 113 of its 217 jobs are at risk, with a further 59 employees on zero hours contracts told they won't get any more work. Chief executive Stephen Crocker said: ""I remain shocked and angry that the government is standing idle as an industry that has delivered so much to this country and is so vital to its recovery is being allowed to fade into dust."" Mr Watling, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Theatre, has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson pointing out how vital theatres are, ""not just for the arts offer, but for UK plc"". He said: ""I used to tour the world, taking the theatre to every corner of the world, and we are highly regarded because of our massive and very important theatre offer."" A government spokesperson said: ""We are clear that we want to get the performing arts fully back up and running safely as soon as possible and are working closely with the sector on a phased approach, guided by public health and medical experts."" They said the government was also ""considering ways in which we may be able to support"" the theatre industry on top of the ""unprecedented financial assistance"" from the loans, grants and furlough scheme open to businesses, plus a Â£160m Arts Council England emergency package. Mr Watling called for more information and help before more theatres are forced to cancel Christmas. He said: ""Theatre Royal Norwich losing its pantomime is indicative of the way the whole thing could go like a pack of cards."" Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"The pub has asked for suggestions for a new name A pub named after 17th Century slave trader Edward Colston has covered over its sign amid plans for a name change. The Colston Arms in Kingsdown, Bristol, has hung up a temporary banner calling it ""Ye olde Pubby Mcdrunkface"" and asked people to suggest new names. The sign outside the pub reads ""We are listening. Black Lives Matter."" A statue of Colston in the city centre was torn down and thrown into the harbour during anti-racism protests last month. The pub's banner reads: ""The Clearly Temporarily Named Ye olde Pubby Mcdrunkface. Suggestions welcome (Obviously)."" Landlord Paul Frost said it was ""just a bit of fun to draw attention to the issue"". ""It's not me that's keen to make the name change, I just want to make sure the debate happens,"" he said. ""The point I'm making is that it's not my voice that needs to be heard. I'm a white middle aged man, it's the people, the community around Bristol. ""It is a serious issue, however the banner suggests a little levity about the matter.  It's just get engaged, learn about the whole era and make suggestions on Facebook really."" Admiral Taverns, which owns the pub, said it was supporting Mr Frost. ""We will be listening carefully to the feedback from the local community before deciding on the pub's new name,"" a spokesperson said. Since the Colston statue was pulled down there have been several other protests calling for monuments celebrating controversial figures in the UK to be taken down or amended. Bristol's Colston Hall removed his name from the building last month ahead of a name change later this year. The Diocese of Bristol has also formally applied to remove a plaque and part of a stained glass window in the north transept of Bristol Cathedral that commemorates Colston's life. Parts of the window, which was installed in 1890,were covered up last month.

"Upper Crust owner SSP Group says up to 5,000 jobs could be cut across its UK outlets and head office, as it struggles with the reduction in passenger travel. The firm said global sales in April and May were 95% below the previous year's. SSP operates 580 food and drink outlets across the UK, mostly at railway stations and airports, but fewer than 10 are currently open. The company expects only one-fifth of its UK stores to be open by the autumn. SSP employs around 39,000 staff worldwide across 2,800 outlets.  Last month, it said it had suffered ""extremely low sales"" after the coronavirus pandemic forced it to shut branches. As well as Upper Crust bakeries, the company also owns the CaffÃ¨ Ritazza chain, deli operator Camden Food Co. and luxury bar chain Cabin. SSP joins a growing list of companies slashing jobs as the UK economy suffers its worst contraction in 41 years. In the past few days, a number of firms have announced UK job cuts: Aerospace giant Airbus has said itwants to cut 1,700 jobs in the UK, as part of plans to shed 15,000 posts across the whole company Cutbacks at EasyJet meannearly 1,300 UK crew members and 727 pilots are at risk of losing their jobsat the airline, unions say About 600 workers at shirtmaker TM Lewin will lose their jobsas the firm's 66 stores are closed Royal Mail has said it isto cut 2,000 management jobs ""Covid-19 continues to have an unprecedented impact on the travel industry and on SSP's businesses in all geographies,"" said SSP Group chief executive Simon Smith. ""We are beginning to see early signs of recovery in some parts of the world and are starting to open units as passenger demand picks up. However, in the UK the pace of the recovery continues to be slow,"" he said. The company added: ""If the pace of the recovery continues at the current level, this could lead to up to c. 5,000 roles becoming redundant from within the head office and UK operations."" What went wrong for retail giant Intu? 'We are battered, bruised, but wiser' While SSP operates across more than 30 countries, including the US, India and China, the job cuts are only being made at its UK business. At this time of year, the company would normally employ about 9,000 people across the UK. Staff have been enrolled on the government-paid furlough scheme throughout the coronavirus crisis. The company said it had planned to reopen UK outlets as passenger demand returned, adding: ""The reality is that passenger numbers still remain at very low levels."" Mr Smith said the firm would swiftly reopen UK units if there were improved sales over the summer. In a statement, the company said it had access to around Â£750m in liquidity and it was confident it had sufficient funds to allow it to operate ""throughout even its most pessimistic scenario"".

"Jack Leslie played for Plymouth Argyle in the 1920s A campaign is being launched to erect a statue of a footballer dropped by England when selectors found out he was black. Picked in 1925, Jack Leslie would have been the first black player to play for England, 53 years before Viv Anderson. By the time he died, in 1988 at the age of 88, there were many more black players at top levels of the game. Leslie was born in Canning Town, in London's docklands, in 1900, to an English mother and a Jamaican father. A gifted athlete, he played for Barking Town, where his prolific scoring record attracted the attention of Plymouth Argyle, then a third-division club. Jack Leslie (third from right) was Plymouth Argyle's top goal scorer He joined them in the 1921-22 season and stayed for 14 years, making 401 appearances and scoring 137 goals, a feat made all the more impressive because of the racial abuse he experienced at the hands of both crowds and opponents. He is remembered as a great attacking inside left but also a utility player who could fill in as a central defender. In 1925, Argyle's manager, Bob Jack, called his star striker into his office and gave him some thrilling news - Jack Leslie had been selected to play for England against Ireland. It was a great achievement for the player and an honour for third-division Plymouth. His selection was the talk of the club and the town - but some days later, when the newspapers published the team, Billy Walker, of Aston Villa, was in the starting line-up and Leslie was named as a travelling reserve. He never did travel with the England team to Belfast. Instead, while England struggled to a 0-0 draw, he scored twice, as Plymouth trounced Bournemouth 7-2 at home. ""I believe that the manager sent in his request, saying: 'I've got a brilliant player here, he should play for England,'"" his granddaughter, Lesley Hiscott, said. Lesley Hiscott (left) and Lyn Davies have fond memories of their grandfather ""So then someone came down to watch him. ""They weren't watching his football. ""They were looking at the colour of his skin. ""And because of that, he was denied the chance of playing for his country."" Leslie later suggested finding out he was black, for the selectors, must have been ""like finding out I was foreign"". But he accepted what had happened and, according to his granddaughters, never expressed any bitterness. They remember him as a kind and loving grandfather. He had married their grandmother, Lavinia, in 1925, at a time when it was unusual for a black man to marry a white woman. And as a consequence, some of the family, and Lavinia in particular, experienced racial abuse. Lyn Davies said: ""If I walked down the street with my friends and he was coming the other way, he would cross to the other side of the road so I could pretend that I didn't know him, so I didn't suffer. ""But I'd run across and say, 'Hello Granddad.'"" Despite helping Plymouth gain promotion, a top-four finish in division two, captaining the club and, in 1931-32, scoring 21 goals in 43 games, Leslie was never again picked for England. Viv Anderson was picked for England in 1978 Anderson, picked to play for England against Czechoslovakia at Wembley in 1978, went on to win 30 caps. ""I'd never heard of Jack Leslie until up to two weeks ago,"" he told BBC News. ""And that's a crying shame, because what he achieved and what he did should be paramount in every black person's mind. ""It's a crying shame but hopefully the statue they are trying to get erected will carry on his legacy."" Argyle have already honoured Leslie with a mural and renamed their boardroom after him. And now a group of fansare campaigning,externalfor a statue. ""At a time when some statues are being pulled down, we want to put one of Jack Leslie up to commemorate his amazing achievements and to remember the injustice that he suffered,"" campaign co-founder Greg Foxsmith says. Jack Leslie is already honoured in a mural at the club The campaign hopes to raise Â£100,000. And supporters include Anderson and the club itself. How many statues of black people does the UK have? ""Having a statue promoted by our fans and funded by fans is a statement by them that they are joining the fight against racism in football,"" Plymouth chairman Simon Hallett told BBC News. ""History has been written by the winners and I think we are now trying to pay more attention to some of the victims of those victories."" Bill Hern co-author of the upcoming book Football's Black Pioneers said: ""Jack Leslie should have been a major figure in the history of British football and society. ""Everyone needs a role model and young black footballers didn't have that major role model in the 30s, 40s and 50s. ""Had he played for England, as he should have, he would have fired the aspirations of generations of young black players."" Leslie's playing days came to an end after he sustained an injury when a lace from a leather ball flew into his eye. He and his family returned to east London and he resumed his trade as a boilermaker. Following his retirement and with time on his hands, Lavinia urged him to go to West Ham and ask the club if there was any work he could do. He met manager Ron Greenwood, who immediately recognised and remembered him as a great player. Greenwood offered him a job in the boot room, where, somewhat poignantly, he cleaned mud from the boots of England stars Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst, Martin Peters, and Trevor Brooking. In a further ironic twist to his story, Leslie also cleaned the boots of West Ham's black striker Clyde Best, who, in the late 1960s and 1970s, was still one of only a tiny number of black players in top-flight English football. Leslie loved the work and being around footballers but it was hardly fitting for a man who should have occupied a unique place in football history - and now, perhaps, will. ""Stories like this are incredibly sad. Discrimination in the game, in any form or from any time period, is unacceptable,"" said FA chairman Greg Clarke, adding that English football had made ""huge strides"" in diversity, although there was still more to do. He said the FA backed the campaign for a statue to recognise Leslie as a pioneer.

"More than 12,000 people in the UK are set to lose their jobs after a raft of firms announced cuts in the past 48 hours. The cuts are mainly being made by High Street retailers and in aviation - two of the sectors hardest hit by the coronavirus lockdown. John Lewis has said it will close stores but has not confirmed how many jobs will go. Topshop owner Arcadia and Harrods said they planned a total of 1,180 job cuts. Other lay-offs that have been announced include: Up to 5,000 job cutsat Upper Crust owner SSP Group Up to 700 jobs at Harrods About 600 workersat shirtmaker TM Lewin Up to 900 cuts at management consulting firm Accenture 300 staff cuts across Virgin Money, Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank 1,700 UK jobsat plane-maker Airbus And1,300 crew and 727 pilotsat EasyJet Have you recently been made redundant? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. WH Smith, Bensons for Beds, Wrights Pies, tableware-maker Steelite International, the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool and Norwich Theatre Royal have also announced plans to reduce staff. Businesses have been hit hard since the UK went into lockdown on 23 March, and even though restrictions are gradually being eased, consumer demand remains depressed. The government's furlough scheme will also start to be pared back from August, and firms are cutting jobs to control their costs. James Phillips could be made redundant James Phillips, a mechanical engineer, told the BBC he fears he could be made redundant. He has been on furlough since March but has now been asked to attend a redundancy consultation meeting with his employer. He said: ""I'm three months away from having a baby, and I was about to sign for a mortgage this week on a new property, so it's impacted me massively, really. Everything's been put on hold."" Sue Hudson lost her job as a legal secretary at a solicitors in Bournemouth in April and has not found a job since. ""There are too many people chasing too few jobs,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""It's very disheartening."" For most businesses, staffing is the highest cost, and many have been using the government's furlough schemes to keep workers on. But the programme - which is paying 80% of the wages of more than 9 million workers - will start to be pared back from next month and will end in October. Upper Crust owner SSP has announced 5,000 job cuts As firms have to consult for 30-45 days when making redundancies, some will feel that now is the time to act. ""There is already a cost to the employer from just a month's time,"" said BBC business correspondent Simon Gompertz. ""Larger employers, planning bigger layoffs, will be eyeing that escalating wage bill and maybe thinking the sooner they move the better."" In an email to staff, Harrods' managing director Michael Ward said the department store was making its cuts with a heavy heart. ""Due to the ongoing impacts of this pandemic, we as a business will need to make reductions to our workforce."" He said it would take a ""drastic improvement in external conditions"" for Harrods to recover and return to growth. John Lewis, which was already looking to ""right size"" its business before the crisis, said it had not decided which shops would close. ""The reality is that we have too much store space for the way people want to shop now,"" the company said in a statement. Topshop owner Arcadia, which is slashing a fifth of its head office staff, also blamed the pandemic for its cuts. ""Due to the impact of Covid-19 on our business including the closure for over three months of all our stores and head offices, we have today informed staff of the need to restructure our head offices,"" it said. The reason the government has thrown tens of billions of pounds at trying to hold back the waves of unemployment is they realise that it does long-lasting damage to demand in the economy. There is no doubt that the furlough scheme helped delay the impact, but this barrage of job cut announcements suggests the government is now struggling to turn the tide. Boris Johnson described the virus as ""still circling like a shark in our waters"". It was an odd metaphor to use, considering the PM has previously praised the Mayor in Jaws for keeping the beaches open. One thing seems certain: to combat the huge economic shock whose repercussions are being felt in airlines, factories and now high streets, the government will need a bigger boat than the Â£5bn of previously announced spending accelerated yesterday. The pressure is now on Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Read more Harrods said the ""devastation in international travel"" had meant it had lost ""key customers"" Retailers were already struggling before the coronavirus due to changes in shopping habits as consumers buy more online, as well as rising wages and business rates. But the coronavirus crisis has placed huge pressure on an already weakened sector. The vast majority of shops were told to shut in March when the UK went into lockdown, prompting a sharp fall in sales. And while demand rebounded 12% in May,retail it remains well below pre-lockdown levels. Demand for air travel in April and May was down more than 90%, as airlines were hit hard by global lockdown measures and travel restrictions. And normal levels of demand are not expected to return for up to three years. While planes aren't flying, airlines aren't making money, but they still have funds flying out of the door. And firms that rely on airlines flying, such as commercial aerospace businesses, have decreased production. Along with cuts at Airbus, Ryanair and EasyJet, British Airways has announced plans to slash 12,000 jobs - almost a quarter of its workforce. Meanwhile, engineering giant Rolls-Royce, which makes jet engines, will cut 3,000 jobs across the UK.

"The lockdown has added to delays to court cases (stock image) The coronavirus lockdown has added thousands more cases to the backlog faced by courts in England and Wales. It could take up to 10 years to clear this backlog, a new report says. So how does this affect people already tied up in the criminal justice system? Emma describes herself as stubborn. She says it's the reason why she hasn't given up on the justice system. It's been nearly three years since she went to the police to allege she'd been raped. The suspect was arrested soon afterwards but it would be another two years before he was charged. She says the police have been incredibly supportive throughout but she still doesn't understand why the investigation has taken so long. ""It's never been explained. Just that they're very busy."" Her trial, which was finally due to start in June, has now been adjourned as a result of the pandemic, and she's been warned it might not start for another year. ""It's really difficult. How are we supposed to move on when it's never finished? And it's not just me, it's my family and friends. It affects others."" Through it all Emma has been supported by the charity Solace Women's Aid. They say there's nothing unusual about the delays she has faced. Even before the pandemic, government figures show that it's been taking, on average, 511 days to complete a case. For rape, robbery and fraud it's been taking on average even longer. When asked what she would like to say to those who might be in a position to do something to speed up the system, Emma starts to cry and says: ""Please don't forget about us."" John describes himself as a composed, professional person. But after three years of being tangled up in the courts system, he says he felt battered and calls the system broken. John's barrister nicknamed his case ""the zombie case"". John was charged with actual bodily harm in 2016. Having never been in trouble with the law before, he was desperate to get to court and clear his name. He was told to be on standby for a trial in March 2017. It didn't happen. Then he was put on standby for a trial the following month. Again it didn't happen. Then it got postponed for a whole year but it didn't happen in 2018 either. ""I asked my barrister, is this normal? And he said, 'sadly, yes'. It was astonishing really,"" he says. Trial backlog 'adding to risk of mob justice' 'Growing backlog' of court cases causing distress Coronavirus could see huge changes to jury trials The delays in John's case caused him so much stress that he thought about pleading guilty to a lesser offence. ""I seriously considered it, even though I was innocent, just to end the matter."" He was finally acquitted late last year, three years after the legal process began. In total his trial was postponed eight times. On seven occasions it was because of a lack of court time. He says each time he would build himself up for a court date. ""There is anxiety, as you can imagine, and to have to do that nine times over, it brings unnecessary stress upon yourself and your family."" The pandemic has exacerbated existing delays in the courts - even before it struck there were some 37,000 cases waiting to be heard in the crown courts and nearly 400,000 were in the queue for the magistrates' courts. Thousands more trials than usual have been delayed since the UK went into lockdown on 23 March. Anda report by the watchdog,external, Her Majesty's CPS Inspectorate, says social distancing measures in courtrooms ""will not allow"" the existing backlog to be reduced. ""Some estimates show that the current scale of increase in the backlog would take 10 years to clear at pre-pandemic rates,"" the report adds. The Criminal Bar Association, which represents criminal barristers, says that some trial delays have been caused by government cuts to the court budget which forced court rooms to stay shut last year. But the Ministry of Justice points out that the court backlog is not exceptional and has fallen markedly in the crown courts over the past 10 years. They also say that they planned before the pandemic to increase the number of days the courts sit. Matthew hasn't been able to go to work in his public-sector job for the last three years because he's being investigated for allegedly committing a serious offence. He was arrested in 2017 but rather than being released on bail, which is time limited, he was released under investigation or RUI, which isn't. He then waited two-and-a-half years before being charged. He says that his mental health has drastically suffered as a result of what he calls an abusive process. The government is currently reviewing the use of RUIs. Matthew's lawyers fear that his trial, due in the autumn, will get postponed to next year as a result of the pandemic.

"The pub has asked for suggestions for a new name A pub named after 17th Century slave trader Edward Colston has covered over its sign amid plans for a name change. The Colston Arms in Kingsdown, Bristol, has hung up a temporary banner calling it ""Ye olde Pubby Mcdrunkface"" and asked people to suggest new names. The sign outside the pub reads ""We are listening. Black Lives Matter."" A statue of Colston in the city centre was torn down and thrown into the harbour during anti-racism protests last month. The pub's banner reads: ""The Clearly Temporarily Named Ye olde Pubby Mcdrunkface. Suggestions welcome (Obviously)."" Landlord Paul Frost said it was ""just a bit of fun to draw attention to the issue"". ""It's not me that's keen to make the name change, I just want to make sure the debate happens,"" he said. ""The point I'm making is that it's not my voice that needs to be heard. I'm a white middle aged man, it's the people, the community around Bristol. ""It is a serious issue, however the banner suggests a little levity about the matter.  It's just get engaged, learn about the whole era and make suggestions on Facebook really."" Admiral Taverns, which owns the pub, said it was supporting Mr Frost. ""We will be listening carefully to the feedback from the local community before deciding on the pub's new name,"" a spokesperson said. Since the Colston statue was pulled down there have been several other protests calling for monuments celebrating controversial figures in the UK to be taken down or amended. Bristol's Colston Hall removed his name from the building last month ahead of a name change later this year. The Diocese of Bristol has also formally applied to remove a plaque and part of a stained glass window in the north transept of Bristol Cathedral that commemorates Colston's life. Parts of the window, which was installed in 1890,were covered up last month.

Sarah CampbellBBC News/Royal Correspondent Will the Royal Family embrace life on Zoom? Three months ago when lockdown began, it was hard to see how, in isolation, the Royal Family could unite the nation as it had previously done in times of crisis. The Prince of Wales, the heir to the throne, had tested positive for Covid-19. He and the Duchess of Cornwall self-isolated in Scotland. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, both in their 90s, retreated behind Windsor Castle's walls. The institution had already been rocked by the departure of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the Duke of York ""stepping back"". Yet with each day, the death toll rose and a nation needed reassurance. Within a week Prince Charles, who suffered only mild symptoms of the virus, was able to release a video describing his ""strange, frustrating and often distressing experience"". The video was recorded at his home on the Balmoral estate. Perhaps it was the setting - the crammed bookshelves, the family photo, the teddy bear on the mantelpiece - or the heartfelt, personal delivery - but it felt intimate and set the tone for how the Royal Family went on to communicate with the nation during lockdown. See here for more from Sarah. Bar patrons in Texas Florida and Texas are among the states most affected by the huge surge in US virus cases. Here are what some of the people living there had to say. Alisha Hoath, 22 - Boca Raton, Florida There was a period when everyone began to forget about the virus. I even thought things were getting better for a while. For the most part I know I could be doing better with social distancing. I've been going to yoga classes and took a trip to a hotel in Miami for the weekend which was probably not my best decision. But we made sure to keep six feet apart and wear masks. Genesis Valbuena, 26 - Austin, Texas Some bar owners here in Austin are vocally going against what we need to do - criticising the data and suing the government for shutting them down. If we continue to do this, we are going to be shut down for the rest of the year. For me that's completely narcissistic. How certain bar owners are acting is ludicrous. The reopening should have been done less quickly.

Tamoor Tariq, a councillor for Bury Council, in Greater Manchester, is now recovering from the virus. He urged people to ""not take for granted"" the seriousness of the illness. Reality Check Peru imposed one of the earliest and strictest lockdowns in Latin America to stop the spread of coronavirus - but it now has the sixth highest number of confirmed cases in the world. Peru's President, MartÃ­n Vizcarra, says things are improving but has previously said results of the lockdown ""haven't been exactly what we expected"". So why has Peru been affected so badly? The lockdown in Peru started on 16 March - before the UK and some other European countries - and lasted until the end of June. Daily reported cases are now falling - but the number of deaths remains high. Officially, as of 30 June, around than 9,600 people had died with coronavirus in Peru. But the country hasone of the world's highest excess death rates- the number of deaths above the average in previous years - which suggests the impact far exceeds official figures. Why have measures been ineffective? Peru has reported more cases than every European country apart from the UK, despite testing only about seven people in every 1,000 - more than some countries in Latin America but far fewer than Italy, for example, which has tested about 88 in every 1,000. Experts say Peru's healthcare system was underprepared, leading to more deaths, but several other social and economic factors can help explain why Peru is struggling to contain the outbreak. Read more here Sonia KatariaBBC News Some children who live in the Leicester lockdown zone but attend school outside of the area will not be able to cross the border, the Department for Education (DfE) has confirmed. From Thursday, only vulnerable children and children of key
workers can travel across the boundary in either direction for school or
appointments with social workers. Other
children have been asked to stay at home. The DfE said: ""If you are a child or young person (other than a vulnerable child or child of a critical worker) that lives in Leicester but attends school or college outside the affected area, you must stay at home."" Some children who attend St Lukeâs Primary School in Thurnby, Leicestershire, which is outside the zone and will be open as normal tomorrow, are from within the boundary. Headteacher Paul Galvin said he was ""deeply sorry"" to the families of those affected. He said: ""It might be difficult for families who are inside the lockdown zone - as we are just outside the boundary - especially if they are not children of critical workers."" He added the school has ""adapted and will keep adapting to changes"" during the coronavirus pandemic. The school has been open since the lockdown in March for vulnerable children and children of key workers, and reopened for Reception and Year 1 in June. A ""small"" outbreak of coronavirus among workers at a bed factory in West Yorkshire has been confirmed. Eight members of staff at the Dura Beds factory in Batley have tested positive for the virus this week, a statement says. All staff - a total of 107 workers - will now be offered tests, according to the joint statement by Kirklees Council and Public Health England (PHE). The Dura Beds factory has been closed for two weeks as a safety precaution for its employees and their families, the statement adds. The firm is now ""working closely"" with the council and PHE so those who have tested positive can be followed up by the NHS Test and Trace programme and self-isolate. People who might have come into contact with an infected individual will be contacted and may be advised to self-isolate for 14 days. The statement adds: ""While the risk to residents from this outbreak is very low, everyone in Kirklees should continue to socially distance, wash hands regularly for 20 seconds with soap and water and get tested if they have symptoms."" Across the UK, the number of newly confirmed coronavirus cases each day has been falling since a peak in April. You can read morehere. Councils in England need urgent support as they face a funding gap of Â£7.4bn due to a loss of income related to coronavirus,the Local Government Association (LGA) says. Local authorities have come under increased pressure during the pandemic as demand for services such as social care has grown, while at the same time, income from local taxation and charges has dropped. James Jamieson, chairman of the LGA, which represents English councils and London boroughs, said ""further funding and flexibilities are now urgent"" if councils are to avoid taking steps such as ""in-year cuts to local services"" to cope with funding gaps. Whitehall has given Â£3.2bn funding to all English councils in two grants to help cover coronavirus costs, but the LGA says between March and June councils had already incurred costs of Â£4.8bn. Almost 44,000 people have died with coronavirus in the UK according to the latest daily government figures - which count deaths with a positive test result. But the overall total is likely to be higher. You can read morehere. Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter As Leicester, in England's East Midlands, has become the first city put under a local lockdown, misleading claims have been shared on social media. A string of local councils have posted on Twitter and Facebook to counter online rumours of imminent lockdowns in their areas - making it clear none have been announced. A rise in cases has been recorded in some local authority areasbut a Public Health England (PHE) spokesperson told the BBC that using this data to predict which areas would see significant rises in cases is ""not appropriate"" because it doesn't give a ""complete picture"" of the local situation. Meanwhile, a number of social media posts attributing the local lockdown in Leicester to videos of crowds of people taking part in anti-racism protests in the city centre a few weeks ago have led to racist and abusive comments directed at protesters. We've identified posts in Facebook groups that may have sparked some of the rumours. You can read morehere. Uganda hosts more than 400,000 refugees from DR Congo alone and many more from South Sudan Uganda has opened part of its border with the Democratic Republic of Congo to allow in thousands of people stuck in no-man's land for more than a month due to the coronavirus pandemic. At least 3,000 of them fled their homes in May after inter-communal clashes in north-eastern Ituri province. But they were unable to cross into Uganda to seek safety as the country had closed its borders in March to control the spread of coronavirus. It has been agreed the refugees will be quarantined before being settled. This will happen for 14 days at a new isolation centre, 13km (eight miles) from the border. The UN's refugee agency (UNHCR) says sample testing will be carried out on the group to see if coronavirus is present among them. This will help authorities decide when the refugees can be transferred to camps. Read more here. Simon JackBBC Business Editor The worldwide economic impact of the coronavirus has been seismic and the job losses are starting to crash on the shores of the UK with increasing frequency and severity. The 1,700 UK job losses at Airbus had a grim inevitability to them, given the destruction of demand in the aviation industry. Demand for air travel in April and May was down more than 90% and normality is not expected to return for up to three years - maybe never for the more lucrative business class travel. BA, Easyjet, Ryanair and Rolls Royce have already announced 20,000 job losses between them, so Airbus was never going to emerge unscathed. The travel wipeout has seen SSP, the owner of stalwart transport hub tenants Upper Crust and CafÃ© Ritazza, cut 5,000 posts.  We already know that the number of workers on UK payrolls shrank more than 600,000 between March and May, according to the ONS. That looks like the thin end of a very big wedge as the government's unprecedented job support scheme tapers off, with employers being asked to share the burden of the cost from the end of July to its withdrawal at the end of October.

A number of filmmakers were asked to make short films during lockdown, with no crew or budget, for the streaming service Netflix. As she tells the BBC's Alex Stanger, the end result was a very personal affair.  Matt Forward with his hawk in Trafalgar Square Whether it's nurses, carers or supermarket staff, key workers have rightly been hailed as heroes during lockdown. But behind the pandemic's front line there have also been many others who have been busy doing essential jobs. Matt Forward's job is to keep the pigeons away from Trafalgar Square, in central London. Pest management was covered in the key worker list, so throughout the lockdown Matt drove himself and his Harris hawk 45 miles (70km) to the iconic square early two mornings a week. Matt, who lives in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said he never thought of stopping his job because of lockdown. ""If someone wasn't there doing the job that we do, we'd be overrun,"" he says. Read more about how lockdown has been for Britain's unlikely key workers here Mark EastonHome editor Most of Britain is preparing for an easing of lockdown restrictions. But public
concern at the risks from coronavirus has risen to the highest level since the
end of April, a new poll conducted by Ipsos Mori this week suggests. However,
the survey also says the public is becoming more comfortable about
returning to work and sending children back to school. A month
ago, 37% of those surveyed said they were âvery concernedâ about the risks to
the country.  This new poll suggests that has risen to 50%. Concern about
the risks to individuals has also risen from 24% to 29%. The
survey asks people whether they would feel comfortable in a range of situations
if lockdown measures were lifted.  The proportion of parents who said they
would be comfortable sending their children to school has risen to 49%, up from
38% a month earlier. Two-thirds of people would be comfortable meeting friends or family outside their
household, also a rise from six weeks before. But the poll suggests around six in 10 people would be anxious going to bars or restaurants, using public
transport or lavatories and only 15% said they would be comfortable going to
large sport or music events. Ipsos MORI interviewed a representative sample of 1,078 British adults aged 18-75 online between 26-29 June 2020. Data are weighted to match the profile of the population. All polls are subject to a wide range of potential sources of error. Prof Van-Tam speaking at the government's daily news briefing on 30 May Here's some more from the government's Science and Technology committee hearing that's been going on this afternoon. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer, has said there are enough doses of remdesivir for use on hospitalised patients in the UK. It comes on the back of news that theUS had secured almost all of the forthcoming global supply of the drug, which has been shown to help people recover from Covid-19 more quickly. Prof Van-Tam said: ""Right now, there are stocks in the UK - and I judge us to have adequate stocks - of pre-licensed, as in unlicensed, clinical trial stocks of remdesivir which are available to be used through the emergency access protocol."" Remdesivir is produced by the US firm Gilead Sciences and is the first drug to have been approved by authorities in the US to be used to treat the disease. The US administration is set to receive 500,000 doses - or 100% of the company's supply production - in July, 90% of it in August and 90% in September.  ValeTodo Downtown has become the Downtown Market Peru's largest LGBT nightclub has reopened its doors as lockdown eases - as a grocery store. ValeTodo Downtown is one of the best known dance floors in the capital, Lima. But the club's famed drag queens will now be serving milk, fruit and bread rather than cocktails as nightclubs are still not permitted to open. Times have been tough for the club's 120 employees since the pandemic hit. ""I was very depressed because I have been doing this art for years, but you have to adapt to new challenges for the future,"" Belaluh McQueen, who is identified by her stage name, told Reuters news agency. ""We have a new job opportunity,"" she added, standing in the newly named Downtown Market in a sequined suit, high heels and a mask. ""Before, I used to come here to dance and have a good time, but now we come to buy,"" said Alexandra Herrera, a regular attendee of the club. ""The thing is to reinvent yourself."" More than 9,500 people have died of Covid-19 in Peru. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0

This will help authorities decide when the refugees can be transferred to camps. Read more here. Simon JackBBC Business Editor The worldwide economic impact of the coronavirus has been seismic and the job losses are starting to crash on the shores of the UK with increasing frequency and severity. The 1,700 UK job losses at Airbus had a grim inevitability to them, given the destruction of demand in the aviation industry. Demand for air travel in April and May was down more than 90% and normality is not expected to return for up to three years - maybe never for the more lucrative business class travel. BA, Easyjet, Ryanair and Rolls Royce have already announced 20,000 job losses between them, so Airbus was never going to emerge unscathed. The travel wipeout has seen SSP, the owner of stalwart transport hub tenants Upper Crust and CafÃ© Ritazza, cut 5,000 posts.  We already know that the number of workers on UK payrolls shrank more than 600,000 between March and May, according to the ONS. That looks like the thin end of a very big wedge as the government's unprecedented job support scheme tapers off, with employers being asked to share the burden of the cost from the end of July to its withdrawal at the end of October.

A number of filmmakers were asked to make short films during lockdown, with no crew or budget, for the streaming service Netflix. As she tells the BBC's Alex Stanger, the end result was a very personal affair.  Matt Forward with his hawk in Trafalgar Square Whether it's nurses, carers or supermarket staff, key workers have rightly been hailed as heroes during lockdown. But behind the pandemic's front line there have also been many others who have been busy doing essential jobs. Matt Forward's job is to keep the pigeons away from Trafalgar Square, in central London. Pest management was covered in the key worker list, so throughout the lockdown Matt drove himself and his Harris hawk 45 miles (70km) to the iconic square early two mornings a week. Matt, who lives in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said he never thought of stopping his job because of lockdown. ""If someone wasn't there doing the job that we do, we'd be overrun,"" he says. Read more about how lockdown has been for Britain's unlikely key workers here Mark EastonHome editor Most of Britain is preparing for an easing of lockdown restrictions. But public
concern at the risks from coronavirus has risen to the highest level since the
end of April, a new poll conducted by Ipsos Mori this week suggests. However,
the survey also says the public is becoming more comfortable about
returning to work and sending children back to school. A month
ago, 37% of those surveyed said they were âvery concernedâ about the risks to
the country.  This new poll suggests that has risen to 50%. Concern about
the risks to individuals has also risen from 24% to 29%. The
survey asks people whether they would feel comfortable in a range of situations
if lockdown measures were lifted.  The proportion of parents who said they
would be comfortable sending their children to school has risen to 49%, up from
38% a month earlier. Two-thirds of people would be comfortable meeting friends or family outside their
household, also a rise from six weeks before. But the poll suggests around six in 10 people would be anxious going to bars or restaurants, using public
transport or lavatories and only 15% said they would be comfortable going to
large sport or music events. Ipsos MORI interviewed a representative sample of 1,078 British adults aged 18-75 online between 26-29 June 2020. Data are weighted to match the profile of the population. All polls are subject to a wide range of potential sources of error. Prof Van-Tam speaking at the government's daily news briefing on 30 May Here's some more from the government's Science and Technology committee hearing that's been going on this afternoon. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer, has said there are enough doses of remdesivir for use on hospitalised patients in the UK. It comes on the back of news that theUS had secured almost all of the forthcoming global supply of the drug, which has been shown to help people recover from Covid-19 more quickly. Prof Van-Tam said: ""Right now, there are stocks in the UK - and I judge us to have adequate stocks - of pre-licensed, as in unlicensed, clinical trial stocks of remdesivir which are available to be used through the emergency access protocol."" Remdesivir is produced by the US firm Gilead Sciences and is the first drug to have been approved by authorities in the US to be used to treat the disease. The US administration is set to receive 500,000 doses - or 100% of the company's supply production - in July, 90% of it in August and 90% in September.  ValeTodo Downtown has become the Downtown Market Peru's largest LGBT nightclub has reopened its doors as lockdown eases - as a grocery store. ValeTodo Downtown is one of the best known dance floors in the capital, Lima. But the club's famed drag queens will now be serving milk, fruit and bread rather than cocktails as nightclubs are still not permitted to open. Times have been tough for the club's 120 employees since the pandemic hit. ""I was very depressed because I have been doing this art for years, but you have to adapt to new challenges for the future,"" Belaluh McQueen, who is identified by her stage name, told Reuters news agency. ""We have a new job opportunity,"" she added, standing in the newly named Downtown Market in a sequined suit, high heels and a mask. ""Before, I used to come here to dance and have a good time, but now we come to buy,"" said Alexandra Herrera, a regular attendee of the club. ""The thing is to reinvent yourself.""

"Hong Kong police make their first arrests under a new ""anti-protest"" law imposed by Beijing The legislation comes into effect as the city marks 23 years since the end of British rule Police fire water cannon and detain hundreds of people at demonstrations marking the anniversary The new security law targets secession, subversion and terrorism with punishments up to life in prison Critics say it erodes freedoms that were meant to be guaranteed by China for at least 50 years from 1997 China rejects criticism from foreign countries, saying it will not allow interference in its domestic affairs Up to three million Hong Kong residents are to be offered the chance to settle in the UK Edited by Robert Greenall We are ending our live updates of Wednesday's protests in Hong Kong that follow the introduction of a controversial new security law imposed by Beijing. Thank you for being with us. Here's a recap of the day's main events: Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The central Chinese government has been striving to promote the necessity of the new Hong Kong bill today, and its media have been highlighting the multiple arrests that have already taken place today. But at the same time, mainland-based outlets have been nervous about showing footage of these arrests themselves, because of the presence of pro-democracy slogans. Media have either pixelated these or avoided showing today's demonstrations altogether, because they don't want mainlanders to see them. Generally, broadcasters in the country have shied from showing fresh demonstrations today, instead showing footage of senior officials voicing their support for the law, emphasising that it is necessary for the island, and does not violate the âone country two systemsâ policy. In footage of demonstrators that is shown, people in mainland China are seeing blurred images of flags and t-shirts over slogans like âHong Kong independenceâ and âliberate Hong Kongâ. Critics have called the national security law ""the end of Hong Kong"" - so what do we know, and what do people fear the most? Hong Kong was always meant to have a security law, but the government failed to pass it because it was so unpopular. So this is about China stepping in to ensure the city has a legal framework to deal with what it sees as serious challenges to its authority. The details of the law were kept secret until after it was passed. They include:  You can read more about what the law says, and what it means,in this explainer from our reporters Grace Tsoi and Lam Cho Wai.  Martin YipBBC Chinese Some pro-democracy activists have held up their BNO passports at protests Over the years people have looked at their British National Overseas (BNO) and Hong Kong SAR (Chinese Hong Kong) passports in a mainly economic perspective. The Chinese Hong Kong passport is cheaper - HK$370 ($47.74; Â£38.87) for 32 pages for 10 years, while a 34-page BNO passport costs Â£105.86. Both can take you to a good number of countries visa-free, including, until now, a six-month stay in the UK. 

But oddities like being able to apply for an Australian electronic visa using a Chinese Hong Kong passport, and the type of consulate protection you could get in some less developed countries, does affect Hong Kong peopleâs perception of the two passports. Now Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has revealed more details of Downing Streetâs offer. BNOs might feel safer as the exit door is cleared up. But that need not mean full peace of mind. Many issues remain. How to get a job in the UK to begin with, when the whole world is in deep economic trouble thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic. Many in Hong Kong might feel greater restrictions by Beijing will force them to leave Also, as former prime minister Theresa May once said, âBrexit means Brexitâ. Many Brexiteers donât like migrants. How the British public greets an influx of Hong Kongers could well affect whether they feel comfortable to move there. China might also retaliate. A pro-Beijing tabloid threatened earlier that China could void BNOs' Hong Kong residency, Chinese citizenship, and most importantly, voting rights. If that turns out to be the case, it would be unnerving. This video can not be played Hong Kong police clash with protesters opposing new security law Images from earlier today show police clashing with demonstrators, firing tear gas and making arrests. Police say 370 people have been detained - 10 of them under the new national security law. In an interview with Associated Press, media tycoon Jimmy Lai has said the territory's new security law has rendered Hong Kong ""dead"". ""It's worse than the worst scenario imagined. Hong Kong is totally subdued, totally under control,"" he said. Mr Lai, 72, is the founder of clothing retailer Giordano and tabloid newspaper Apple Daily. He supported the Tiananmen Square protesters in 1989 and has since become an outspoken advocate for greater democracy in China. Mr Lai said he will continue to fight for democracy, but in a ""very different way"". He and 14 other pro-democracy figures are already facing charges for taking part in anti-government protests last year, but he says he is unfazed by the prospect of prison. ""I cannot worry, because you never know what kind of measures they will take against me,"" said Mr Lai. ""It won't be something I can worry about, I'll just relax and do what I have to do."" Hong Kong Police have updated their tally of arrests, saying 370 people were detained during today's protests - 10 of them for breaching the new national security law. Seven police officers were also injured during the day, including one who was allegedly stabbed by a ""rioter"". Earlier today, police said the stabbing suspects had fled while onlookers stood by.

Helier CheungBBC News Supporters of the law have argued that it will only affect
a small number of people â and is essential to restore stability to Hong Kong. Starry Lee â from the pro-Beijing DAB party, said the
national security law would âgive Hong Kong a new chanceâ¦ to leave behind the
violence haze of the past year and start againâ. Meanwhile, legislator Regina Ip â who was Hong Kongâs security
chief back in 2003, when the government last attempted to introduce national
security legislation - said she welcomed the passing of the law because it
filled a âlegal gap in Hong Kongâs national securityâ. âAs part of the country [China], of course Hong Kong has a
duty to protect the nationâs security,â she said. She added that since Beijing
announced the national security law in May, some activists who supported
independence for Hong Kong had left the territory, or quit political
organisations. âFrom this, you can see that the national security law does have
a deterrent effect â and I believe this will help to calm down the riots of the
past year.â Hong Kong saw sustained anti-government protests â many of which
turned violent â in 2019 as demonstrators protested against a law that would
have allowed extraditions to mainland China, and demanded democratic reform and
an independent investigation into alleged police brutality. Polls conducted by Reuters news agency,externalsuggest that a majority of people in Hong Kong (56%) are opposed to the national
security law, but that support for pro-democracy protests has slipped from 59%
in December 2019 to 51% in June. Analysts have suggested this could in part be
because the new legislation means people no longer see the protesters' demands as practical. Regina Ip (centre) at an event celebrating Hong Kong's handover on Tuesday This video can not be played Former UK consulate worker says he was tortured in China Simon Cheng, a former employee of the UK's consulate in Hong Kong who says he was tortured by the Chinese police, has been granted political asylum in Britain. Mr Cheng, a Hong Kong citizen, was detained for 15 days while on a trip to mainland China in August 2019.

During that time he says he was tortured and accused of inciting political unrest in Hong Kong. You can read the full story here.  Climate campaigner Greta Thunberg has send a message of support for the protests - and in return received thanks from a leading pro-democracy activist. On Twitter, Ms Thunberg said: ""My thoughts are with the people of Hong Kong."" She retweeted a post by pro-democracy campaigner Joshua Wong which showed scenes from Wednesday's protests. In reply, Mr Wong said her support meant a lot ""during such a difficult time and critical moment"", adding: ""Together we are one loud voice that cannot be silenced."" Allow Twitter content?

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said the US is ""deeply concerned"" about sweeping provisions under Hong Kong's new national security law, and about ""the safety of everyone living in the territory, including Americans"". Speaking in Washington, he called Article 38 of the new national law ""an affront to all nations"". The article allows foreigners to be arrested on arrival in Hong Kong if they are suspected of breaking the law. ""On Monday we announced we would end defence equipment and dual use technology exports of US origin going to the territory. We will continue to implement [US] President Trump's directive to end Hong Kong's special status,"" Mr Pompeo added. Helier CheungBBC News One of the most significant developments of the new law is
the fact Beijing will establish a new security office in Hong Kong, with its
own law enforcement personnel â whose operations will not fall under Hong Kongâs
jurisdiction. Their vehicles will also be exempt from searches by Hong
Kong police. Until now, mainland Chinese police were not expected to operate in
Hong Kong. The law also requires the government to âpromote national
security educationâ and âstrengthenâ¦ regulation over matters concerning
national securityâ in schools, universities, the media and the internet â sparking
some concerns over academic and media freedom. In cases that concern national security or state secrets, trials
can be held without a jury, or be closed to the media and the public â and the
government can issue a binding decision on whether a particular act involves
national security, or the evidence involves state secrets. Eric Cheung Tat-ming, a legal scholar from the University of
Hong Kong, wrote online that the law was âeven worse than the
worst-case-scenario Iâd imaginedâ. The text of the law was full of mainland Chinese legal characteristics
that were âvery different from the spirit and letter of Hong Kongâs common lawâ,
he added. Students have previously held pro-democracy protests outside their schools Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive, has been criticised for her support of the new law China's new national security law, passed yesterday, gives Beijing powers to shape life in Hong Kong it has never had before. Critics say it effectively curtails freedom of speech and other freedoms enshrined in Hong Kong's mini constitution, known as the Basic Law. China says it will return stability. There are reports of people deleting Facebook posts, and concerns that candidates opposing the national security law will be disqualified from running in elections. Many are also afraid Hong Kong's judicial independence will be eroded and its judicial system will look increasingly similar to mainland China's. The city is the only common law jurisdiction in China. Some pro-democracy activists - such as Joshua Wong - have been lobbying foreign governments to help their cause. Such campaigning could become a crime in the future. He has now quit his Demosisto party. People also worry that a threat to Hong Kong's liberties could affect its attractiveness as a leading global business hub and economic powerhouse. Grace TsoiBBC World Service, Hong Kong I was born in Hong Kong before 1997, the year when Hong Kong was handed back to Chinese rule. That means I had a British National Overseas (BNO) passport as a child. After years of using the HKSAR passport, I renewed my long-expired BNO passport last year when the city was embroiled in months-long protests. I wasnât exactly sure what to expect from renewing the BNO passport, which had always been seen as another travel document available for Hong Kong residents. When the news broke that BNO passport holders are eligible for British citizenship after living and working in the UK for five years, and after spending another year of being granted settled status, many of my friends were excited. They say at least thereâs a way out for Hong Kongers after the national security law came into force. But many questions remain. Currently there are 350,000 BNO passport holders, but about three million Hong Kong residents are eligible for BNO passports â and that doesnât appear to include dependants born after 1997. Will the UK be ready to take in so many Hong Kong residents? Will there be enough jobs? Will BNO passport holders have recourse to public funds? And will they be covered by the NHS? Some also say itâs good that thereâs a lifeboat, but do they really want to leave their home? Lord Christopher Patten - Hong Kong's final British governor before the 1997 handover - has described China's new national security law as Orwellian. He told BBC Radio 4's World At One that it ""drives a coach and horses through the international treaty that China has signedâ. âThe big game starts now,"" said Lord Patten. ""What weâve seen from China is a doubling down in their aggressive and loutish behaviour all around the world and weâve really got to workâ¦ with allies, not to start a cold war but to form a group of countries who will say âif you behave in this appalling fashion, China, weâre going to call you outâ.â âYou can lock up people, you canât lock up ideas,"" he added. ""I still believe that the belief in freedom and the rule of law is going to have a longer lifespan than Xi Jinpingâs extremely unpleasant, dictatorial, totalitarian communism.â Helier CheungBBC News The new law is seen as wide-reaching, and several elements
have left Hong Kongers â even those outside the territory â deeply concerned. Article 38 of the law specifies that the law applies to
offences committed outside of Hong Kong â including by people who are not Hong
Kong residents. One British Hong Konger, who asked not to be identified,
said she had started deleting posts critical of the government on social media,
as she feared she could be targeted next time she travelled to Hong Kong. âWith the new law I feel I have to self-censor everything
now. The law is written quite subjectively â you donât have any idea of what
you may do that may break the law.â âIt feels more oppressive than it used to be â especially because
my family members are still in Hong Kong and Iâm afraid it may affect them as
well.â Meanwhile, a Hong Kong American told me: âI decided to change
my Facebook name and switch to Signal after reading the details of the new law.â âSince it was written in such a way that could apply to my
actions abroad, I feel like it was wise to make it more difficult for people to
trace my criticism of China and the Hong Kong government back to me,
particularly if I were to return to Hong Kong to visit.â Hundreds have been arrested at protests in Hong Kong - and many abroad are now also fearful This video can not be played UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab tells MPs that China has enacted the new security law in ""a clear and serious breach of the Joint Declaration"" between China and Britain. Hong Kong Police have shared images of documents scattered by protesters around Times Square mall, which they say contain personal information on local officers. They said they ""regret"" the action by demonstrators, stressed that a court order banning the doxxing of officers and their families still stands. They also criticised media outlets for publishing images of the documents, saying it was ""tantamount to adding more harm to the police."" Grace TsoiBBC World Service, Hong Kong Hong Kong remains defiant after the national security law took effect. It was difficult to count how many turned up to the protests in different parts of Hong Kong Island, as most  donned neither black clothing, nor  gas mask or helmet. They stood in the open streets, near shopping malls and at Victoria Park, but sporadic chanting of slogans ranging from âwe will fight until the last breathâ to âHong Kongers, build a nationâ were heard â despite the heavy police presence. However, the chilling effect of the  national security law was felt while we were reporting on the ground. We were trying to talk to some protesters on the streets. Even though we made guarantees that their faces wouldnât be shown, we were rejected multiple times â it was much more difficult than before. We finally got lucky with a protester who was wearing a black t-shirt with the words âbeing born in uncertain times, carries certain responsibilitiesâ and holding a banner over his face. âI am protesting because I am very angry,"" he said. ""I am angry at the breach of the Basic Law. I am angry at the breach of  'one country, two systems'. And I am angry with the disrespect for human rights this national security law brings.â But after we were done with the interview, he said he was wondering whether he could be arrested for talking to foreign media â whether this would constitute collusion with foreign forces. Nathan Law, a founding member of pro-democracy group Demosisto, is expected to start speaking at a hearing of the US Foreign Affairs Committee about now. In a statement on Facebook, Mr Law said he will be discussing the impact of the new national security law on Hong Kong. He added that he risks personal repercussions from the Chinese government for speaking out, but hopes his testimony will raise international awareness of the law and what it means for Hong Kong residents. ""If we lose sight of it at the international level, Hong Kongâs resistance will fall into a more passive situation,"" said Mr Law. ""At the same time, the international community will lack a window to understand the rule of the CCPâs authoritarian system."" You can watch the proceedings here.,external Â© 2025 BBC.

"The lockdown has added to delays to court cases (stock image) The coronavirus lockdown has added thousands more cases to the backlog faced by courts in England and Wales. It could take up to 10 years to clear this backlog, a new report says. So how does this affect people already tied up in the criminal justice system? Emma describes herself as stubborn. She says it's the reason why she hasn't given up on the justice system. It's been nearly three years since she went to the police to allege she'd been raped. The suspect was arrested soon afterwards but it would be another two years before he was charged. She says the police have been incredibly supportive throughout but she still doesn't understand why the investigation has taken so long. ""It's never been explained. Just that they're very busy."" Her trial, which was finally due to start in June, has now been adjourned as a result of the pandemic, and she's been warned it might not start for another year. ""It's really difficult. How are we supposed to move on when it's never finished? And it's not just me, it's my family and friends. It affects others."" Through it all Emma has been supported by the charity Solace Women's Aid. They say there's nothing unusual about the delays she has faced. Even before the pandemic, government figures show that it's been taking, on average, 511 days to complete a case. For rape, robbery and fraud it's been taking on average even longer. When asked what she would like to say to those who might be in a position to do something to speed up the system, Emma starts to cry and says: ""Please don't forget about us."" John describes himself as a composed, professional person. But after three years of being tangled up in the courts system, he says he felt battered and calls the system broken. John's barrister nicknamed his case ""the zombie case"". John was charged with actual bodily harm in 2016. Having never been in trouble with the law before, he was desperate to get to court and clear his name. He was told to be on standby for a trial in March 2017. It didn't happen. Then he was put on standby for a trial the following month. Again it didn't happen. Then it got postponed for a whole year but it didn't happen in 2018 either. ""I asked my barrister, is this normal? And he said, 'sadly, yes'. It was astonishing really,"" he says. Trial backlog 'adding to risk of mob justice' 'Growing backlog' of court cases causing distress Coronavirus could see huge changes to jury trials The delays in John's case caused him so much stress that he thought about pleading guilty to a lesser offence. ""I seriously considered it, even though I was innocent, just to end the matter."" He was finally acquitted late last year, three years after the legal process began. In total his trial was postponed eight times. On seven occasions it was because of a lack of court time. He says each time he would build himself up for a court date. ""There is anxiety, as you can imagine, and to have to do that nine times over, it brings unnecessary stress upon yourself and your family."" The pandemic has exacerbated existing delays in the courts - even before it struck there were some 37,000 cases waiting to be heard in the crown courts and nearly 400,000 were in the queue for the magistrates' courts. Thousands more trials than usual have been delayed since the UK went into lockdown on 23 March. Anda report by the watchdog,external, Her Majesty's CPS Inspectorate, says social distancing measures in courtrooms ""will not allow"" the existing backlog to be reduced. ""Some estimates show that the current scale of increase in the backlog would take 10 years to clear at pre-pandemic rates,"" the report adds. The Criminal Bar Association, which represents criminal barristers, says that some trial delays have been caused by government cuts to the court budget which forced court rooms to stay shut last year. But the Ministry of Justice points out that the court backlog is not exceptional and has fallen markedly in the crown courts over the past 10 years. They also say that they planned before the pandemic to increase the number of days the courts sit. Matthew hasn't been able to go to work in his public-sector job for the last three years because he's being investigated for allegedly committing a serious offence. He was arrested in 2017 but rather than being released on bail, which is time limited, he was released under investigation or RUI, which isn't. He then waited two-and-a-half years before being charged. He says that his mental health has drastically suffered as a result of what he calls an abusive process. The government is currently reviewing the use of RUIs. Matthew's lawyers fear that his trial, due in the autumn, will get postponed to next year as a result of the pandemic. But he is desperate to clear his name and get back to work. ""Prior to the false allegation, my life was built around helping others in any way I could.

"Jack Leslie played for Plymouth Argyle in the 1920s A campaign is being launched to erect a statue of a footballer dropped by England when selectors found out he was black. Picked in 1925, Jack Leslie would have been the first black player to play for England, 53 years before Viv Anderson. By the time he died, in 1988 at the age of 88, there were many more black players at top levels of the game. Leslie was born in Canning Town, in London's docklands, in 1900, to an English mother and a Jamaican father. A gifted athlete, he played for Barking Town, where his prolific scoring record attracted the attention of Plymouth Argyle, then a third-division club. Jack Leslie (third from right) was Plymouth Argyle's top goal scorer He joined them in the 1921-22 season and stayed for 14 years, making 401 appearances and scoring 137 goals, a feat made all the more impressive because of the racial abuse he experienced at the hands of both crowds and opponents. He is remembered as a great attacking inside left but also a utility player who could fill in as a central defender. In 1925, Argyle's manager, Bob Jack, called his star striker into his office and gave him some thrilling news - Jack Leslie had been selected to play for England against Ireland. It was a great achievement for the player and an honour for third-division Plymouth. His selection was the talk of the club and the town - but some days later, when the newspapers published the team, Billy Walker, of Aston Villa, was in the starting line-up and Leslie was named as a travelling reserve. He never did travel with the England team to Belfast. Instead, while England struggled to a 0-0 draw, he scored twice, as Plymouth trounced Bournemouth 7-2 at home. ""I believe that the manager sent in his request, saying: 'I've got a brilliant player here, he should play for England,'"" his granddaughter, Lesley Hiscott, said. Lesley Hiscott (left) and Lyn Davies have fond memories of their grandfather ""So then someone came down to watch him. ""They weren't watching his football. ""They were looking at the colour of his skin. ""And because of that, he was denied the chance of playing for his country."" Leslie later suggested finding out he was black, for the selectors, must have been ""like finding out I was foreign"". But he accepted what had happened and, according to his granddaughters, never expressed any bitterness. They remember him as a kind and loving grandfather. He had married their grandmother, Lavinia, in 1925, at a time when it was unusual for a black man to marry a white woman. And as a consequence, some of the family, and Lavinia in particular, experienced racial abuse. Lyn Davies said: ""If I walked down the street with my friends and he was coming the other way, he would cross to the other side of the road so I could pretend that I didn't know him, so I didn't suffer. ""But I'd run across and say, 'Hello Granddad.'"" Despite helping Plymouth gain promotion, a top-four finish in division two, captaining the club and, in 1931-32, scoring 21 goals in 43 games, Leslie was never again picked for England. Viv Anderson was picked for England in 1978 Anderson, picked to play for England against Czechoslovakia at Wembley in 1978, went on to win 30 caps. ""I'd never heard of Jack Leslie until up to two weeks ago,"" he told BBC News. ""And that's a crying shame, because what he achieved and what he did should be paramount in every black person's mind. ""It's a crying shame but hopefully the statue they are trying to get erected will carry on his legacy."" Argyle have already honoured Leslie with a mural and renamed their boardroom after him. And now a group of fansare campaigning,externalfor a statue. ""At a time when some statues are being pulled down, we want to put one of Jack Leslie up to commemorate his amazing achievements and to remember the injustice that he suffered,"" campaign co-founder Greg Foxsmith says. Jack Leslie is already honoured in a mural at the club The campaign hopes to raise Â£100,000. And supporters include Anderson and the club itself. How many statues of black people does the UK have? ""Having a statue promoted by our fans and funded by fans is a statement by them that they are joining the fight against racism in football,"" Plymouth chairman Simon Hallett told BBC News. ""History has been written by the winners and I think we are now trying to pay more attention to some of the victims of those victories."" Bill Hern co-author of the upcoming book Football's Black Pioneers said: ""Jack Leslie should have been a major figure in the history of British football and society. ""Everyone needs a role model and young black footballers didn't have that major role model in the 30s, 40s and 50s. ""Had he played for England, as he should have, he would have fired the aspirations of generations of young black players."" Leslie's playing days came to an end after he sustained an injury when a lace from a leather ball flew into his eye. He and his family returned to east London and he resumed his trade as a boilermaker. Following his retirement and with time on his hands, Lavinia urged him to go to West Ham and ask the club if there was any work he could do. He met manager Ron Greenwood, who immediately recognised and remembered him as a great player. Greenwood offered him a job in the boot room, where, somewhat poignantly, he cleaned mud from the boots of England stars Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst, Martin Peters, and Trevor Brooking. In a further ironic twist to his story, Leslie also cleaned the boots of West Ham's black striker Clyde Best, who, in the late 1960s and 1970s, was still one of only a tiny number of black players in top-flight English football. Leslie loved the work and being around footballers but it was hardly fitting for a man who should have occupied a unique place in football history - and now, perhaps, will. ""Stories like this are incredibly sad. Discrimination in the game, in any form or from any time period, is unacceptable,"" said FA chairman Greg Clarke, adding that English football had made ""huge strides"" in diversity, although there was still more to do. He said the FA backed the campaign for a statue to recognise Leslie as a pioneer.

"This video can not be played Michelle O'Neill: 'I believe in the regulations' Northern Ireland's deputy first minister has said criticism of her presence at the funeral of republican Bobby Storey is ""political point-scoring"". Earlier First Minister Arlene Foster called for Michelle O'Neill to apologise for her actions. Ms O'Neill was one of several senior Sinn FÃ©in politicians who was present, along with hundreds of other mourners. On Wednesday two other parties in the NI executive said she should resign. Current coronavirus regulations state a maximum of 30 people are allowed to gather together outdoors. There has beenwidespread criticism of Ms O'Neill and her party colleagues, including leader Mary Lou McDonald and former leader Gerry Adams, who attended the funeral of Mr Storey, who was considered  the head of intelligence of the IRA for a period from the mid-1990s. All of the other parties which make up Northern Ireland's devolved government along with Sinn FÃ©in - the DUP, UUP, SDLP and Alliance - have criticised Ms O'Neill, with the UUP and Alliance calling for her to resign. Mrs Foster said she had ""undermined"" the executive. Ms O'Neill said a picture taken at the funeral happened in the ""blink of an eye"" and should not have happened Mrs Foster, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), said on Wednesday: ""It is quite intolerable now that people think that there are some people to whom the law doesn't apply and that indeed there are some politicians who are saying: 'Do as I say but not as I do'. ""That undermines everything that we have been trying to do. ""She needs to apologise, she needs to recognise the wrong that has been done and she absolutely needs to make amends for what has happened."" This video can not be played Foster calls for O'Neill apology for attending funeral Speaking to the Executive Committee at Stormont on Wednesday, Ms O'Neill said: ""I am satisfied that my actions are within the regulations and the public health guidance. My actions I stand over. ""I think it is unfortunate that a lot of the charges being levelled towards me are political point-scoring, as opposed to actually being about the rules."" The Sinn FÃ©in vice-president added that she would encourage ""anybody to stick within the regulations and the guidance as we have set out. ""We are not out of the woods yet."" However, she did say a photograph that was taken of her and two others at the funeral ""shouldn't have happened"". ""I'm absolutely okay to say that,"" she said She said it happened in the ""blink of an eye"". A large number of mourners turned out for the funeral Earlier, shetold the Irish News the cortege had a ""maximum of 30 people in it"",externaland that the service at St Agnes's Church had been ""exemplary"" in relation to social distancing and hygiene. Inside the church only three mourners shared a pew, she said. The BBC understands about 120 mourners were inside the church The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said on Tuesday it would review footage of the funeral and ""consider any suspected breaches of the Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) Regulations NI 2020"". Stormont's Finance Minister Conor Murphy and Northern Ireland Assembly members (MLAs) Gerry Kelly and Martina Anderson also attended the funeral. Sources within the local churches have expressed concern about the deputy first minister's claim that the arrangements for the funeral service for Bobby Storey within St Agnes's Church in West Belfast were ""exemplary"". It's understood that in a call last Wednesday with the chief medical officer, chief scientific adviser and two junior ministers, church representatives were told that the change in rules enabling social distancing at regular religious services did not apply to funerals, weddings and baptisms. Aletter published on the executive website summarised the latest guidance on social distancing for places of worship,externalpassed on to the faith leaders. However the letter states that ""weddings, baptisms and funerals are not covered by the advice below. The executive will consider this further early next week."" It's understood the churches then advised other families planning funerals for this week that the maximum attendance for funerals of 10 people remained in place. After the TV pictures of Bobby Storey's funeral emerged, it's believed the Bishop of Down and Connor Noel Treanor sought clarity from the executive. It's believed church leaders were sent new guidance last night, marked ""draft"" which extends the social distancing rule to funeral services. However this guidance was not communicated to the churches prior to Bobby Storey's funeral and its status remains uncertain. Gerry Kelly and Gerry Adams (centre and second from right) carried Mr Storey's coffin Justice Minister Naomi Long, leader of the Alliance Party, said on Wednesday: ""In any other system of government the deputy first minister's position would be untenable. ""She should reflect on her position, as she has undermined the authority of her office by doing huge damage to the respect people have for the rules."" On Tuesday, NI Health Minister Robin Swann said no-one was exempt from the regulations. Mr Swann said he hoped ""this isn't the Dominic Cummings effect in Northern Ireland because quite frankly our health service can't afford it to be"". ""There is no person, or position, or point of privilege that is above the guidance we had laid down, no one is immune from it,"" he said. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: ""Today's [Tuesday's] display showed a blatant disregard for the sacrifices made by so many."" In the assembly, Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister said the executive's credibility had been undermined by the appearance of the deputy first minister and other MLAs ""in flagrant breach, it would appear, of some of those regulations"". A large crowd also attended the cemetery There have been a number of events which have been criticised for attracting crowds during the Covid-19 pandemic. In May,a senior police officer said there had been social-distancing breaches at funeralsin both the unionist and nationalist communities. Earlier in June,protestors at Black Lives Matter rallies in Belfast and Londonderry were fined, whileseveral hundred people took part in a ""save our statues"" rallyat Belfast City Hall. Bobby Storey was previously chairman of Sinn FÃ©in and a close friend of Gerry Adams Mr Storey died at the age of 64following a period of illness.

"Upper Crust owner SSP Group says up to 5,000 jobs could be cut across its UK outlets and head office, as it struggles with the reduction in passenger travel. The firm said global sales in April and May were 95% below the previous year's. SSP operates 580 food and drink outlets across the UK, mostly at railway stations and airports, but fewer than 10 are currently open. The company expects only one-fifth of its UK stores to be open by the autumn. SSP employs around 39,000 staff worldwide across 2,800 outlets.  Last month, it said it had suffered ""extremely low sales"" after the coronavirus pandemic forced it to shut branches. As well as Upper Crust bakeries, the company also owns the CaffÃ¨ Ritazza chain, deli operator Camden Food Co. and luxury bar chain Cabin. SSP joins a growing list of companies slashing jobs as the UK economy suffers its worst contraction in 41 years. In the past few days, a number of firms have announced UK job cuts: Aerospace giant Airbus has said itwants to cut 1,700 jobs in the UK, as part of plans to shed 15,000 posts across the whole company Cutbacks at EasyJet meannearly 1,300 UK crew members and 727 pilots are at risk of losing their jobsat the airline, unions say About 600 workers at shirtmaker TM Lewin will lose their jobsas the firm's 66 stores are closed Royal Mail has said it isto cut 2,000 management jobs ""Covid-19 continues to have an unprecedented impact on the travel industry and on SSP's businesses in all geographies,"" said SSP Group chief executive Simon Smith. ""We are beginning to see early signs of recovery in some parts of the world and are starting to open units as passenger demand picks up. However, in the UK the pace of the recovery continues to be slow,"" he said. The company added: ""If the pace of the recovery continues at the current level, this could lead to up to c. 5,000 roles becoming redundant from within the head office and UK operations."" What went wrong for retail giant Intu? 'We are battered, bruised, but wiser' While SSP operates across more than 30 countries, including the US, India and China, the job cuts are only being made at its UK business. At this time of year, the company would normally employ about 9,000 people across the UK. Staff have been enrolled on the government-paid furlough scheme throughout the coronavirus crisis. The company said it had planned to reopen UK outlets as passenger demand returned, adding: ""The reality is that passenger numbers still remain at very low levels."" Mr Smith said the firm would swiftly reopen UK units if there were improved sales over the summer. In a statement, the company said it had access to around Â£750m in liquidity and it was confident it had sufficient funds to allow it to operate ""throughout even its most pessimistic scenario"".

"Thousands of people celebrated the end of coronavirus in the city of Prague on Tuesday The World Health Organization (WHO) warned this week that the pandemic was not even close to being over, but in the Czech Republic, a party has been held to give the coronavirus a ""symbolic farewell"". Thousands of guests sat at a 500 metre-long (1640ft) table on the Charles Bridge in Prague on Tuesday sharing food and drinks they had brought from home. Guests were encouraged to share with their neighbours and there was no social distancing, something people in countries under lockdown will find hard to relate to. There have been fewer than 12,000 infections in the Czech Republic, a country of 10 million. About 350 people have died. The event's organiser said the celebration was possible due to a lack of tourists in the famously charming city. How is Europe's lockdown being lifted? Tracking the global spread of the pandemic People sat closely together, drinking and watching local performers Spaces for the event, which had to be reserved, were fully booked Guests were entertained by local musicians during the party Ondrej Kobza, organiser of the party and owner of a cafe in the city, told the AFP news agency: ""We want to celebrate the end of the coronavirus crisis by letting people meet and show they are not afraid to meet, that they are not afraid to take a piece of a sandwich from their neighbour."" Spaces for the event, which had to be reserved, were fully booked. The celebration comes as the Czech Republic continues to loosen its lockdown restrictions One attendee, Galina Khomchenko-Krejcikova, said she found the event on Facebook and ""thought it was interesting"". ""I just finished a night shift so I didn't have time to prepare anything,"" she said. ""But we brought some wine and snacks we found at home."" People were told to bring food and drinks from home and share them with people around them The Czech Republic was quick to enforce a lockdown and has managed to avoid the worst of the pandemic. Last week, the government permitted public gatherings of up to 1,000 people. Swimming pools, museums, zoos and castles can now open without limits on the number of visitors. Restaurants, bars and pubs have been allowed to serve people indoors for a month now. Rob Cameron, BBC Prague correspondent Above the music and the clinking of cutlery one heard a most unusual sound for this iconic landmark: people speaking Czech. Largely free of foreign tourists, Charles Bridge was transformed on this gloriously sunny evening into one long dining table - as people gathered to mark what organisers described as the end of a period of crisis, although everyone here freely admitted that such celebrations might well turn out to be premature. Certainly however there is a sense here that through swift and decisive action Czechs have dodged a bullet. Relaxing the lockdown has not sent the numbers soaring; there are several local outbreaks far from Prague, which is only recording around 15 infections a day. There was a palpable sense of optimism on the bridge this evening as people remembered what it was likeâ¦ to live again. Lockdown spares Czech women an Easter whipping Fancy a pint?

"Local authorities are to be given access to postcode-level data about the number of people testing positive for coronavirus in their areas after it was agreed with the Department of Health. It comes after Leicester became the first city tohave a local lockdown imposedfollowing a rise in cases. Labour leader Keir Starmer said there had been a ""lost week"" due to city officials not having full testing data. The prime minister said the figures had been shared with all local authorities. But, at Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons, Sir Keir said officials in Leicester had only received full figures on Thursday. Until now local authorities have not routinely had full access to the data on people who are tested for the virus in the community. But the agreement, signed individually with councils over the past week, now gives them access to a digital dashboard which shows test results down to a postcode level. Leicester lockdown boundary line branded 'stupid' Scots border 'cluster' of virus cases investigated Leicester's new lockdown rules at a glance Dr Jeanelle De Gruchy, president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, welcomed the news and said ""timely, high quality and consistent data"" would be key to combating local outbreaks. But Prof Azeem Majeed, from Imperial College London, said the country had been slow in areas of its Covid-19, response and said the data-sharing agreement ""should have been in place some time ago"". On Monday, it was revealed Leicester's seven-day infection rate was 135 cases per 100,000 people - three times that of the next highest city. The local authorities in England with the next highest rate in the week to 21 June was Bradford with 69 cases per 100,000 people, followed by Barnsley and Rochdale with 55 and 53 cases per 100,000 respectively. The city's mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby, also criticised the government and PHE for being slow to share testing data - saying city officials had been trying to get figures ""for weeks"". The British Medical Association, which represents doctors in the UK, said providing local leaders with up-to-date information was ""vital"" in containing outbreaks, particularly asa contact-tracing app was not yet in place. Walkers confirms 28 virus cases at site Why has action taken so long in Leicester?  Officials are also keeping a close eye on Bedford, Blackburn with Darwen, Kirklees, Oldham, Rotherham and Tameside which seen 30 to 44.9 cases per 100,000 people. Imperial College London's Prof Neil Ferguson,who used to advise the government before he resigned for breaking lockdown rules, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""inevitable"" there would be further local outbreaks adding that high rates of the virus in Bradford and Doncaster were ""clearly of concern"". The BMA's Dr Chaand Nagpaul said Prime Minister Boris Johnson's ""whack-a-mole strategy"" to tackle local outbreaks would be no use if the people leading the response were ""not given the most accurate up-to-date data"". Labour MP Yvette Cooper tweeted it was ""incomprehensible"" that health authorities in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, had also been trying to get hold of local data on swab test results of the wider population but had not been able to. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SOCIAL LIFE:When will pubs, bars and restaurants reopen? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Sir Keir also criticised the speed of the government response in Leicester, saying it took 11 days from the announcement that cases were rising for the lockdown to be tightened. Mr Johnson said the government had started taking action on 8 June, but ""unfortunately it did not prove possible to get the results seen elsewhere"", referring to another localised outbreak ata meat plant in West Yorkshire. Across the rest of England, the lockdown is set to ease further on Saturday with the reopening of bars, restaurants and hair salons, but the BMA said it wanted the government to set metric ""trigger points"" for when action will be taken to reintroduce local and national restrictions. The BMA said this metric should consider not only the regional reproductive number or R rate - the number of people that one infected person, on average, will pass the virus on to - but also the proportion of the population currently infected. A government spokesperson said it had been working closely with local partners, providing the resources and tools needed to take swift action to deal with any new local spikes in infection. It remains one of the most baffling aspects of the current approach. Local authorities have not routinely been given information about their residents who test positive. Even though they are intrinsically involved in the system as the local arm of the contact tracing service, councils have only been getting what the national system deems appropriate. They have been asked to chase up the so-called complex cases - where people test positive in care homes, prisons or schools - so they get that information quickly. But they have not been given real-time information about individual residents who test positive. Local directors of public health say it has hampered their ability to look for patterns and clusters developing. In theory, the national system should do this, but why not have a second pair of eyes? Especially one that knows the local situation much better? This is beginning to change - data sharing agreements have just been signed with local authorities and Public Health England has now set up a system that should do this in a comprehensive and speedy manner from now on. But the fact it has not already and the experience of those on the ground in Leicester - where cases were going up for a number of weeks - suggests local outbreaks developing in the community may not yet have been spotted as quickly as they should. Under the local lockdown, announced on Monday evening, non-essential shops in Leicester have been forced to shut and schools have closed, except for vulnerable pupils and children of ""critical workers"". People are also being advised not to travel in or out of the city. The measures will last until at least 18 July and apply to the city centre and a number of suburbs. New laws are not planned ""at this stage"" to stop people entering or leaving Leicester, Downing Street said, as local police weigh options for enforcing the lockdown. Leicestershire Police Chief Constable Simon Cole said people would have to be ""pretty daft"" to leave the lockdown area for a pint of beer when pubs reopened elsewhere. ""This is a serious public health risk. Do you want to bring that illness into contact with your mates or your family?"" he asked. ""Certainly I wouldn't want to do that. We do work really closely with all the neighbouring forces - we've been communicating with them so they can understand."" He added: ""I'd really implore people - some of the leading health experts in the country are saying stay at home and that seems pretty shrewd advice to me."" Meanwhile, the UK death toll rose by 176, to 43,906, according to the latest figures from the Department for Health and Social Care.

"Wings for all the Airbus commercial planes are made in Wales Plans to cut 1,700 UK Airbus jobs have been described as ""utterly devastating"" by a Welsh minister. Economy, Transport and North Wales Minister Ken Skates called on the UK government to take ""decisive action"" to support the flight sector. Mr Skates said a ""significant share"" of the job losses were expected at Broughton, in Flintshire. The company said it planned to cut 15,000 jobs in total as it dealt with the effects of the coronavirus crisis. The site in Broughton makes wings forthe Airbus A380, which is the world's largest passenger plane. Mr Skates said ""compulsory action"" at the Broughton site, which employs 6,000, could not be ruled out. He said within the next three weeks he would be convening a high level summit to discuss the future of the aerospace, automotive and manufacturing sector and he would be pressing the UK government to take part. The minister added it was ""vital"" the UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak ""takes the lead"", calling for an ""evolution"" of the furlough scheme to support a shorter working week. Ken Skates called on the UK government to take ""decisive action"" to save jobs at Airbus in Broughton ""Nobody should be under any illusion about the impact covid is having on aerospace, a critical part of the Welsh economy,"" Mr Skates said. ""The sector is in crisis and the UK government needs to take swift and decisive action now to save the industry and its supply chain.

He said the union would ""not accept any proposal that involves compulsory redundancy for our members"". He called on Airbus to ""hold their nerve and step back from implementing their plan"". More details of the job losses and how they will break down between the two giant factories will come at the end of the week after talks with unions. The firm expects to make the cuts by summer 2021, but hopes the majority of redundancies will be voluntary or through early retirement of staff. Mr Skates said his thoughts were with workers and their families. ""As a Welsh Government we will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the company, its workforce, the unions and the communities impacted by this,"" he said. Airbus employs more than 6,000 people at its site in Broughton Plaid Cymru's Llyr Gruffydd warned two-thirds of the 1,700 job losses could be in Broughton. The Member of the Senedd for North Wales said workers had told him that they expected to potentially lose 1,100 jobs. He said Airbus supported another three local jobs for every one at the firm. ""We are talking about 25,000 dependent on Airbus in Broughton for their work,"" he said. In a joint statement, a group of Conservative MPs with constituencies in north Wales said the announcement was ""immensely worrying for local employees"". Wrexham MP Sarah Atherton, Clwyd South MP Simon Baynes, Ynys Mon MP Virginia Crosbie, Vale of Clwyd MP James Davies, Clwyd West MP David Jones, Aberconwy MP Robin Millar and Delyn MP Rob Roberts said: ""We have spoken to Airbus and will continue to work closely with the company, trade unions and both the UK and Welsh governments to do everything we can to support Airbus' workers, their families and the wider community."" They said the UK government had provided ""significant support to help Airbus face the challenges that have emerged as a result of this pandemic"".

"Upper Crust owner SSP Group says up to 5,000 jobs could be cut across its UK outlets and head office, as it struggles with the reduction in passenger travel. The firm said global sales in April and May were 95% below the previous year's. SSP operates 580 food and drink outlets across the UK, mostly at railway stations and airports, but fewer than 10 are currently open. The company expects only one-fifth of its UK stores to be open by the autumn. SSP employs around 39,000 staff worldwide across 2,800 outlets.  Last month, it said it had suffered ""extremely low sales"" after the coronavirus pandemic forced it to shut branches. As well as Upper Crust bakeries, the company also owns the CaffÃ¨ Ritazza chain, deli operator Camden Food Co. and luxury bar chain Cabin. SSP joins a growing list of companies slashing jobs as the UK economy suffers its worst contraction in 41 years. In the past few days, a number of firms have announced UK job cuts: Aerospace giant Airbus has said itwants to cut 1,700 jobs in the UK, as part of plans to shed 15,000 posts across the whole company Cutbacks at EasyJet meannearly 1,300 UK crew members and 727 pilots are at risk of losing their jobsat the airline, unions say About 600 workers at shirtmaker TM Lewin will lose their jobsas the firm's 66 stores are closed Royal Mail has said it isto cut 2,000 management jobs ""Covid-19 continues to have an unprecedented impact on the travel industry and on SSP's businesses in all geographies,"" said SSP Group chief executive Simon Smith. ""We are beginning to see early signs of recovery in some parts of the world and are starting to open units as passenger demand picks up. However, in the UK the pace of the recovery continues to be slow,"" he said. The company added: ""If the pace of the recovery continues at the current level, this could lead to up to c. 5,000 roles becoming redundant from within the head office and UK operations."" What went wrong for retail giant Intu? 'We are battered, bruised, but wiser' While SSP operates across more than 30 countries, including the US, India and China, the job cuts are only being made at its UK business. At this time of year, the company would normally employ about 9,000 people across the UK. Staff have been enrolled on the government-paid furlough scheme throughout the coronavirus crisis. The company said it had planned to reopen UK outlets as passenger demand returned, adding: ""The reality is that passenger numbers still remain at very low levels."" Mr Smith said the firm would swiftly reopen UK units if there were improved sales over the summer. In a statement, the company said it had access to around Â£750m in liquidity and it was confident it had sufficient funds to allow it to operate ""throughout even its most pessimistic scenario"".

is simply not the case. ""We urge all residents to continue to follow the
guidelines around staying at home as much as possible, social distancing,
washing hands frequently and ensuring they self-isolate and get tested if
they, or anyone in their household, develop any symptoms. ""We must all

a plane wears face masks it ââeliminates the risk of the spread of Covid-19 by
upwards of 90%ââ. Mr OâLeary, whose
airline will operate almost 1,000 flights today, on the proviso that all
passengers wear face masks, has made similar claims before. In May, he told the BBC
Radio 4's Today programme that wearing them wouldcut the
risk of spreading coronavirus ââby about 98.5%''. He said the figure was
from a study by Dublinâs Mater Hospital, but was unable to produce it. The airline later directed us to a tweet from the hospital of a graphic suggesting that if two people wear face masks, the risk of transmission is cut to 1.5%. The next day, the hospital posted a reply to the tweet saying: ""The cartoon is, of course, a gross oversimplification."" UEAâs Prof Paul Hunter, who has conducted a review into mask studies, told us in May that he could ''find no valid data to support the claims,'' adding that his ''best guess'' would be that wearing face masks would cut transmission by 10% to 15%.

"This video can not be played Michelle O'Neill: 'I believe in the regulations' Northern Ireland's deputy first minister has said criticism of her presence at the funeral of republican Bobby Storey is ""political point-scoring"". Earlier First Minister Arlene Foster called for Michelle O'Neill to apologise for her actions. Ms O'Neill was one of several senior Sinn FÃ©in politicians who was present, along with hundreds of other mourners. On Wednesday two other parties in the NI executive said she should resign. Current coronavirus regulations state a maximum of 30 people are allowed to gather together outdoors. There has beenwidespread criticism of Ms O'Neill and her party colleagues, including leader Mary Lou McDonald and former leader Gerry Adams, who attended the funeral of Mr Storey, who was considered  the head of intelligence of the IRA for a period from the mid-1990s. All of the other parties which make up Northern Ireland's devolved government along with Sinn FÃ©in - the DUP, UUP, SDLP and Alliance - have criticised Ms O'Neill, with the UUP and Alliance calling for her to resign. Mrs Foster said she had ""undermined"" the executive. Ms O'Neill said a picture taken at the funeral happened in the ""blink of an eye"" and should not have happened Mrs Foster, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), said on Wednesday: ""It is quite intolerable now that people think that there are some people to whom the law doesn't apply and that indeed there are some politicians who are saying: 'Do as I say but not as I do'. ""That undermines everything that we have been trying to do. ""She needs to apologise, she needs to recognise the wrong that has been done and she absolutely needs to make amends for what has happened."" This video can not be played Foster calls for O'Neill apology for attending funeral Speaking to the Executive Committee at Stormont on Wednesday, Ms O'Neill said: ""I am satisfied that my actions are within the regulations and the public health guidance. My actions I stand over. ""I think it is unfortunate that a lot of the charges being levelled towards me are political point-scoring, as opposed to actually being about the rules."" The Sinn FÃ©in vice-president added that she would encourage ""anybody to stick within the regulations and the guidance as we have set out. ""We are not out of the woods yet."" However, she did say a photograph that was taken of her and two others at the funeral ""shouldn't have happened"". ""I'm absolutely okay to say that,"" she said She said it happened in the ""blink of an eye"". A large number of mourners turned out for the funeral Earlier, shetold the Irish News the cortege had a ""maximum of 30 people in it"",externaland that the service at St Agnes's Church had been ""exemplary"" in relation to social distancing and hygiene. Inside the church only three mourners shared a pew, she said. The BBC understands about 120 mourners were inside the church The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said on Tuesday it would review footage of the funeral and ""consider any suspected breaches of the Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) Regulations NI 2020"". Stormont's Finance Minister Conor Murphy and Northern Ireland Assembly members (MLAs) Gerry Kelly and Martina Anderson also attended the funeral. Sources within the local churches have expressed concern about the deputy first minister's claim that the arrangements for the funeral service for Bobby Storey within St Agnes's Church in West Belfast were ""exemplary"". It's understood that in a call last Wednesday with the chief medical officer, chief scientific adviser and two junior ministers, church representatives were told that the change in rules enabling social distancing at regular religious services did not apply to funerals, weddings and baptisms. Aletter published on the executive website summarised the latest guidance on social distancing for places of worship,externalpassed on to the faith leaders. However the letter states that ""weddings, baptisms and funerals are not covered by the advice below. The executive will consider this further early next week."" It's understood the churches then advised other families planning funerals for this week that the maximum attendance for funerals of 10 people remained in place. After the TV pictures of Bobby Storey's funeral emerged, it's believed the Bishop of Down and Connor Noel Treanor sought clarity from the executive. It's believed church leaders were sent new guidance last night, marked ""draft"" which extends the social distancing rule to funeral services. However this guidance was not communicated to the churches prior to Bobby Storey's funeral and its status remains uncertain. Gerry Kelly and Gerry Adams (centre and second from right) carried Mr Storey's coffin Justice Minister Naomi Long, leader of the Alliance Party, said on Wednesday: ""In any other system of government the deputy first minister's position would be untenable. ""She should reflect on her position, as she has undermined the authority of her office by doing huge damage to the respect people have for the rules."" On Tuesday, NI Health Minister Robin Swann said no-one was exempt from the regulations. Mr Swann said he hoped ""this isn't the Dominic Cummings effect in Northern Ireland because quite frankly our health service can't afford it to be"". ""There is no person, or position, or point of privilege that is above the guidance we had laid down, no one is immune from it,"" he said. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: ""Today's [Tuesday's] display showed a blatant disregard for the sacrifices made by so many."" In the assembly, Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister said the executive's credibility had been undermined by the appearance of the deputy first minister and other MLAs ""in flagrant breach, it would appear, of some of those regulations"". A large crowd also attended the cemetery There have been a number of events which have been criticised for attracting crowds during the Covid-19 pandemic. In May,a senior police officer said there had been social-distancing breaches at funeralsin both the unionist and nationalist communities. Earlier in June,protestors at Black Lives Matter rallies in Belfast and Londonderry were fined, whileseveral hundred people took part in a ""save our statues"" rallyat Belfast City Hall.

"Upper Crust owner SSP Group says up to 5,000 jobs could be cut across its UK outlets and head office, as it struggles with the reduction in passenger travel. The firm said global sales in April and May were 95% below the previous year's. SSP operates 580 food and drink outlets across the UK, mostly at railway stations and airports, but fewer than 10 are currently open. The company expects only one-fifth of its UK stores to be open by the autumn. SSP employs around 39,000 staff worldwide across 2,800 outlets.  Last month, it said it had suffered ""extremely low sales"" after the coronavirus pandemic forced it to shut branches. As well as Upper Crust bakeries, the company also owns the CaffÃ¨ Ritazza chain, deli operator Camden Food Co. and luxury bar chain Cabin. SSP joins a growing list of companies slashing jobs as the UK economy suffers its worst contraction in 41 years. In the past few days, a number of firms have announced UK job cuts: Aerospace giant Airbus has said itwants to cut 1,700 jobs in the UK, as part of plans to shed 15,000 posts across the whole company Cutbacks at EasyJet meannearly 1,300 UK crew members and 727 pilots are at risk of losing their jobsat the airline, unions say About 600 workers at shirtmaker TM Lewin will lose their jobsas the firm's 66 stores are closed Royal Mail has said it isto cut 2,000 management jobs ""Covid-19 continues to have an unprecedented impact on the travel industry and on SSP's businesses in all geographies,"" said SSP Group chief executive Simon Smith. ""We are beginning to see early signs of recovery in some parts of the world and are starting to open units as passenger demand picks up. However, in the UK the pace of the recovery continues to be slow,"" he said. The company added: ""If the pace of the recovery continues at the current level, this could lead to up to c. 5,000 roles becoming redundant from within the head office and UK operations."" What went wrong for retail giant Intu? 'We are battered, bruised, but wiser' While SSP operates across more than 30 countries, including the US, India and China, the job cuts are only being made at its UK business. At this time of year, the company would normally employ about 9,000 people across the UK. Staff have been enrolled on the government-paid furlough scheme throughout the coronavirus crisis. The company said it had planned to reopen UK outlets as passenger demand returned, adding: ""The reality is that passenger numbers still remain at very low levels."" Mr Smith said the firm would swiftly reopen UK units if there were improved sales over the summer. In a statement, the company said it had access to around Â£750m in liquidity and it was confident it had sufficient funds to allow it to operate ""throughout even its most pessimistic scenario"".

"Wings for all the Airbus commercial planes are made in Wales Plans to cut 1,700 UK Airbus jobs have been described as ""utterly devastating"" by a Welsh minister. Economy, Transport and North Wales Minister Ken Skates called on the UK government to take ""decisive action"" to support the flight sector. Mr Skates said a ""significant share"" of the job losses were expected at Broughton, in Flintshire. The company said it planned to cut 15,000 jobs in total as it dealt with the effects of the coronavirus crisis. The site in Broughton makes wings forthe Airbus A380, which is the world's largest passenger plane. Mr Skates said ""compulsory action"" at the Broughton site, which employs 6,000, could not be ruled out. He said within the next three weeks he would be convening a high level summit to discuss the future of the aerospace, automotive and manufacturing sector and he would be pressing the UK government to take part. The minister added it was ""vital"" the UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak ""takes the lead"", calling for an ""evolution"" of the furlough scheme to support a shorter working week. Ken Skates called on the UK government to take ""decisive action"" to save jobs at Airbus in Broughton ""Nobody should be under any illusion about the impact covid is having on aerospace, a critical part of the Welsh economy,"" Mr Skates said. ""The sector is in crisis and the UK government needs to take swift and decisive action now to save the industry and its supply chain. ""The alarm bells have been sounding for weeks and we need urgent steps at a UK level to prevent this crisis becoming even worse."" Allow Twitter content?

Meanwhile, Secretary of State for Wales Simon Hart told Radio Wales: ""There's this idea that there hasn't been much UK government involvement, but there has been Â£10bn worth so far [in the aviation industry] and we'll keep doing that because we want it to surviveâ¦ ""I spoke to [Airbus] yesterday or the day before and I have done throughout this crisisâ¦. ""There is a role for Welsh Government in this too, don't forget they protect their devolved areas very carefullyâ¦ I'm looking forward to hearing what the first minister is going to do, what Ken Skates is going to do and what their role is in this rather than complain about the UK."" Meanwhile, at Prime Minister's Questions in Westminster, Cardiff South and Penarth MP Stephen Doughty asked what Boris Johnson was doing to help workers who ""don't want to hear slogans"". The prime minister said there was a ""Â£600bn plan for investment"" in jobs. This video can not be played Airbus: ""Most people who live in the area, work here"" At the Welsh Government's daily coronavirus briefing on Wednesday, Mr Skates said ministers would not ""abandon"" Airbus workers and would do all they could to help. ""This cannot - and will not - be the beginning of the end for Airbus at Broughton,"" he added. Flintshire council leader Ian Roberts said he would ""like to hear assurances that there will be a two-government approach to this"". He told BBC Radio Wales: ""Too often governments blame each other."" First Minister Mark Drakeford responded, saying he would ""definitely agree that all levels of government will need to work together very closely"". He said it was what happened whenFord announced it was closing its engine plant in Bridgendlast year. ""We will need to mobilise exactly the same sort of effort,"" he said. Plane-maker Airbus to cut 15,000 jobs Airbus furloughs 3,200 staff Airbus settles corruption probe for â¬3.6bn Unite Wales Regional Secretary Peter Hughes urged the UK government to act: ""If the UK government does not step in now to ensure the support is there for Airbus to get through this crisis, the consequences for Wales could be catastrophic."" He said the union would ""not accept any proposal that involves compulsory redundancy for our members"". He called on Airbus to ""hold their nerve and step back from implementing their plan"". More details of the job losses and how they will break down between the two giant factories will come at the end of the week after talks with unions. The firm expects to make the cuts by summer 2021, but hopes the majority of redundancies will be voluntary or through early retirement of staff. Mr Skates said his thoughts were with workers and their families. ""As a Welsh Government we will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the company, its workforce, the unions and the communities impacted by this,"" he said. Airbus employs more than 6,000 people at its site in Broughton Plaid Cymru's Llyr Gruffydd warned two-thirds of the 1,700 job losses could be in Broughton. The Member of the Senedd for North Wales said workers had told him that they expected to potentially lose 1,100 jobs. He said Airbus supported another three local jobs for every one at the firm. ""We are talking about 25,000 dependent on Airbus in Broughton for their work,"" he said. In a joint statement, a group of Conservative MPs with constituencies in north Wales said the announcement was ""immensely worrying for local employees"". Wrexham MP Sarah Atherton, Clwyd South MP Simon Baynes, Ynys Mon MP Virginia Crosbie, Vale of Clwyd MP James Davies, Clwyd West MP David Jones, Aberconwy MP Robin Millar and Delyn MP Rob Roberts said: ""We have spoken to Airbus and will continue to work closely with the company, trade unions and both the UK and Welsh governments to do everything we can to support Airbus' workers, their families and the wider community."" They said the UK government had provided ""significant support to help Airbus face the challenges that have emerged as a result of this pandemic"".

The big question facing many theatres at the moment is - is panto season cancelled? Norwich Theatre Royal became one of the first to call off its pantomime this week, saying the risk was ""too great"" after three months with no income. Venues in Buxton and Welwyn Garden City have also cancelled, while Leicester Curve has scrapped its festive musical. Pantos are crucial to theatre earnings, and this Christmas could prove to be make or break for some venues' futures. Conservative MP Giles Watling, a former actor and panto dame, warned of the impact if festive shows are scrapped. ""I think many provincial theatres will go to the wall, frankly, because that's the time they can make the money,"" he told BBC News. ""It puts money in the coffers to support the rest of the cultural offer. I can see massive problems ahead if something isn't done and soon."" Read more here. Sarah CampbellBBC News/Royal Correspondent Will the Royal Family embrace life on Zoom? Three months ago when lockdown began, it was hard to see how, in isolation, the Royal Family could unite the nation as it had previously done in times of crisis. The Prince of Wales, the heir to the throne, had tested positive for Covid-19. He and the Duchess of Cornwall self-isolated in Scotland. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, both in their 90s, retreated behind Windsor Castle's walls. The institution had already been rocked by the departure of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the Duke of York ""stepping back"". Yet with each day, the death toll rose and a nation needed reassurance. Within a week Prince Charles, who suffered only mild symptoms of the virus, was able to release a video describing his ""strange, frustrating and often distressing experience"". The video was recorded at his home on the Balmoral estate. Perhaps it was the setting - the crammed bookshelves, the family photo, the teddy bear on the mantelpiece - or the heartfelt, personal delivery - but it felt intimate and set the tone for how the Royal Family went on to communicate with the nation during lockdown. See here for more from Sarah. Bar patrons in Texas Florida and Texas are among the states most affected by the huge surge in US virus cases. Here are what some of the people living there had to say. Alisha Hoath, 22 - Boca Raton, Florida There was a period when everyone began to forget about the virus. I even thought things were getting better for a while. For the most part I know I could be doing better with social distancing. I've been going to yoga classes and took a trip to a hotel in Miami for the weekend which was probably not my best decision. But we made sure to keep six feet apart and wear masks. Genesis Valbuena, 26 - Austin, Texas Some bar owners here in Austin are vocally going against what we need to do - criticising the data and suing the government for shutting them down. If we continue to do this, we are going to be shut down for the rest of the year. For me that's completely narcissistic. How certain bar owners are acting is ludicrous. The reopening should have been done less quickly.

Tamoor Tariq, a councillor for Bury Council, in Greater Manchester, is now recovering from the virus. He urged people to ""not take for granted"" the seriousness of the illness. Reality Check Peru imposed one of the earliest and strictest lockdowns in Latin America to stop the spread of coronavirus - but it now has the sixth highest number of confirmed cases in the world. Peru's President, MartÃ­n Vizcarra, says things are improving but has previously said results of the lockdown ""haven't been exactly what we expected"". So why has Peru been affected so badly? The lockdown in Peru started on 16 March - before the UK and some other European countries - and lasted until the end of June. Daily reported cases are now falling - but the number of deaths remains high. Officially, as of 30 June, around than 9,600 people had died with coronavirus in Peru. But the country hasone of the world's highest excess death rates- the number of deaths above the average in previous years - which suggests the impact far exceeds official figures. Why have measures been ineffective? Peru has reported more cases than every European country apart from the UK, despite testing only about seven people in every 1,000 - more than some countries in Latin America but far fewer than Italy, for example, which has tested about 88 in every 1,000. Experts say Peru's healthcare system was underprepared, leading to more deaths, but several other social and economic factors can help explain why Peru is struggling to contain the outbreak. Read more here Sonia KatariaBBC News Some children who live in the Leicester lockdown zone but attend school outside of the area will not be able to cross the border, the Department for Education (DfE) has confirmed. From Thursday, only vulnerable children and children of key
workers can travel across the boundary in either direction for school or
appointments with social workers. Other
children have been asked to stay at home. The DfE said: ""If you are a child or young person (other than a vulnerable child or child of a critical worker) that lives in Leicester but attends school or college outside the affected area, you must stay at home."" Some children who attend St Lukeâs Primary School in Thurnby, Leicestershire, which is outside the zone and will be open as normal tomorrow, are from within the boundary. Headteacher Paul Galvin said he was ""deeply sorry"" to the families of those affected. He said: ""It might be difficult for families who are inside the lockdown zone - as we are just outside the boundary - especially if they are not children of critical workers."" He added the school has ""adapted and will keep adapting to changes"" during the coronavirus pandemic. The school has been open since the lockdown in March for vulnerable children and children of key workers, and reopened for Reception and Year 1 in June. A ""small"" outbreak of coronavirus among workers at a bed factory in West Yorkshire has been confirmed. Eight members of staff at the Dura Beds factory in Batley have tested positive for the virus this week, a statement says. All staff - a total of 107 workers - will now be offered tests, according to the joint statement by Kirklees Council and Public Health England (PHE). The Dura Beds factory has been closed for two weeks as a safety precaution for its employees and their families, the statement adds. The firm is now ""working closely"" with the council and PHE so those who have tested positive can be followed up by the NHS Test and Trace programme and self-isolate. People who might have come into contact with an infected individual will be contacted and may be advised to self-isolate for 14 days. The statement adds: ""While the risk to residents from this outbreak is very low, everyone in Kirklees should continue to socially distance, wash hands regularly for 20 seconds with soap and water and get tested if they have symptoms."" Across the UK, the number of newly confirmed coronavirus cases each day has been falling since a peak in April. You can read morehere. Councils in England need urgent support as they face a funding gap of Â£7.4bn due to a loss of income related to coronavirus,the Local Government Association (LGA) says. Local authorities have come under increased pressure during the pandemic as demand for services such as social care has grown, while at the same time, income from local taxation and charges has dropped. James Jamieson, chairman of the LGA, which represents English councils and London boroughs, said ""further funding and flexibilities are now urgent"" if councils are to avoid taking steps such as ""in-year cuts to local services"" to cope with funding gaps. Whitehall has given Â£3.2bn funding to all English councils in two grants to help cover coronavirus costs, but the LGA says between March and June councils had already incurred costs of Â£4.8bn. Almost 44,000 people have died with coronavirus in the UK according to the latest daily government figures - which count deaths with a positive test result. But the overall total is likely to be higher. You can read morehere. Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter As Leicester, in England's East Midlands, has become the first city put under a local lockdown, misleading claims have been shared on social media. A string of local councils have posted on Twitter and Facebook to counter online rumours of imminent lockdowns in their areas - making it clear none have been announced. A rise in cases has been recorded in some local authority areasbut a Public Health England (PHE) spokesperson told the BBC that using this data to predict which areas would see significant rises in cases is ""not appropriate"" because it doesn't give a ""complete picture"" of the local situation. Meanwhile, a number of social media posts attributing the local lockdown in Leicester to videos of crowds of people taking part in anti-racism protests in the city centre a few weeks ago have led to racist and abusive comments directed at protesters. We've identified posts in Facebook groups that may have sparked some of the rumours. You can read morehere. Uganda hosts more than 400,000 refugees from DR Congo alone and many more from South Sudan Uganda has opened part of its border with the Democratic Republic of Congo to allow in thousands of people stuck in no-man's land for more than a month due to the coronavirus pandemic. At least 3,000 of them fled their homes in May after inter-communal clashes in north-eastern Ituri province. But they were unable to cross into Uganda to seek safety as the country had closed its borders in March to control the spread of coronavirus. It has been agreed the refugees will be quarantined before being settled. This will happen for 14 days at a new isolation centre, 13km (eight miles) from the border. The UN's refugee agency (UNHCR) says sample testing will be carried out on the group to see if coronavirus is present among them. This will help authorities decide when the refugees can be transferred to camps. Read more here. Simon JackBBC Business Editor The worldwide economic impact of the coronavirus has been seismic and the job losses are starting to crash on the shores of the UK with increasing frequency and severity. The 1,700 UK job losses at Airbus had a grim inevitability to them, given the destruction of demand in the aviation industry. Demand for air travel in April and May was down more than 90% and normality is not expected to return for up to three years - maybe never for the more lucrative business class travel. BA, Easyjet, Ryanair and Rolls Royce have already announced 20,000 job losses between them, so Airbus was never going to emerge unscathed. The travel wipeout has seen SSP, the owner of stalwart transport hub tenants Upper Crust and CafÃ© Ritazza, cut 5,000 posts.  We already know that the number of workers on UK payrolls shrank more than 600,000 between March and May, according to the ONS. That looks like the thin end of a very big wedge as the government's unprecedented job support scheme tapers off, with employers being asked to share the burden of the cost from the end of July to its withdrawal at the end of October.

A number of filmmakers were asked to make short films during lockdown, with no crew or budget, for the streaming service Netflix. As she tells the BBC's Alex Stanger, the end result was a very personal affair.  Matt Forward with his hawk in Trafalgar Square Whether it's nurses, carers or supermarket staff, key workers have rightly been hailed as heroes during lockdown. But behind the pandemic's front line there have also been many others who have been busy doing essential jobs. Matt Forward's job is to keep the pigeons away from Trafalgar Square, in central London. Pest management was covered in the key worker list, so throughout the lockdown Matt drove himself and his Harris hawk 45 miles (70km) to the iconic square early two mornings a week. Matt, who lives in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said he never thought of stopping his job because of lockdown. ""If someone wasn't there doing the job that we do, we'd be overrun,"" he says. Read more about how lockdown has been for Britain's unlikely key workers here Mark EastonHome editor Most of Britain is preparing for an easing of lockdown restrictions. But public
concern at the risks from coronavirus has risen to the highest level since the
end of April, a new poll conducted by Ipsos Mori this week suggests. However,
the survey also says the public is becoming more comfortable about
returning to work and sending children back to school. A month
ago, 37% of those surveyed said they were âvery concernedâ about the risks to
the country.  This new poll suggests that has risen to 50%. Concern about
the risks to individuals has also risen from 24% to 29%. The
survey asks people whether they would feel comfortable in a range of situations
if lockdown measures were lifted.  The proportion of parents who said they
would be comfortable sending their children to school has risen to 49%, up from
38% a month earlier. Two-thirds of people would be comfortable meeting friends or family outside their
household, also a rise from six weeks before. But the poll suggests around six in 10 people would be anxious going to bars or restaurants, using public
transport or lavatories and only 15% said they would be comfortable going to
large sport or music events. Ipsos MORI interviewed a representative sample of 1,078 British adults aged 18-75 online between 26-29 June 2020. Data are weighted to match the profile of the population. All polls are subject to a wide range of potential sources of error. Prof Van-Tam speaking at the government's daily news briefing on 30 May Here's some more from the government's Science and Technology committee hearing that's been going on this afternoon. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer, has said there are enough doses of remdesivir for use on hospitalised patients in the UK. It comes on the back of news that theUS had secured almost all of the forthcoming global supply of the drug, which has been shown to help people recover from Covid-19 more quickly. Prof Van-Tam said: ""Right now, there are stocks in the UK - and I judge us to have adequate stocks - of pre-licensed, as in unlicensed, clinical trial stocks of remdesivir which are available to be used through the emergency access protocol."" Remdesivir is produced by the US firm Gilead Sciences and is the first drug to have been approved by authorities in the US to be used to treat the disease. The US administration is set to receive 500,000 doses - or 100% of the company's supply production - in July, 90% of it in August and 90% in September.

But the club's famed drag queens will now be serving milk, fruit and bread rather than cocktails as nightclubs are still not permitted to open. Times have been tough for the club's 120 employees since the pandemic hit. ""I was very depressed because I have been doing this art for years, but you have to adapt to new challenges for the future,"" Belaluh McQueen, who is identified by her stage name, told Reuters news agency. ""We have a new job opportunity,"" she added, standing in the newly named Downtown Market in a sequined suit, high heels and a mask. ""Before, I used to come here to dance and have a good time, but now we come to buy,"" said Alexandra Herrera, a regular attendee of the club. ""The thing is to reinvent yourself.""

Sarah CampbellBBC News/Royal Correspondent Will the Royal Family embrace life on Zoom? Three months ago when lockdown began, it was hard to see how, in isolation, the Royal Family could unite the nation as it had previously done in times of crisis. The Prince of Wales, the heir to the throne, had tested positive for Covid-19. He and the Duchess of Cornwall self-isolated in Scotland. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, both in their 90s, retreated behind Windsor Castle's walls. The institution had already been rocked by the departure of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the Duke of York ""stepping back"". Yet with each day, the death toll rose and a nation needed reassurance. Within a week Prince Charles, who suffered only mild symptoms of the virus, was able to release a video describing his ""strange, frustrating and often distressing experience"". The video was recorded at his home on the Balmoral estate. Perhaps it was the setting - the crammed bookshelves, the family photo, the teddy bear on the mantelpiece - or the heartfelt, personal delivery - but it felt intimate and set the tone for how the Royal Family went on to communicate with the nation during lockdown. See here for more from Sarah. Bar patrons in Texas Florida and Texas are among the states most affected by the huge surge in US virus cases. Here are what some of the people living there had to say. Alisha Hoath, 22 - Boca Raton, Florida There was a period when everyone began to forget about the virus. I even thought things were getting better for a while. For the most part I know I could be doing better with social distancing. I've been going to yoga classes and took a trip to a hotel in Miami for the weekend which was probably not my best decision. But we made sure to keep six feet apart and wear masks. Genesis Valbuena, 26 - Austin, Texas Some bar owners here in Austin are vocally going against what we need to do - criticising the data and suing the government for shutting them down. If we continue to do this, we are going to be shut down for the rest of the year. For me that's completely narcissistic. How certain bar owners are acting is ludicrous. The reopening should have been done less quickly.

Tamoor Tariq, a councillor for Bury Council, in Greater Manchester, is now recovering from the virus. He urged people to ""not take for granted"" the seriousness of the illness. Reality Check Peru imposed one of the earliest and strictest lockdowns in Latin America to stop the spread of coronavirus - but it now has the sixth highest number of confirmed cases in the world. Peru's President, MartÃ­n Vizcarra, says things are improving but has previously said results of the lockdown ""haven't been exactly what we expected"". So why has Peru been affected so badly? The lockdown in Peru started on 16 March - before the UK and some other European countries - and lasted until the end of June. Daily reported cases are now falling - but the number of deaths remains high. Officially, as of 30 June, around than 9,600 people had died with coronavirus in Peru. But the country hasone of the world's highest excess death rates- the number of deaths above the average in previous years - which suggests the impact far exceeds official figures. Why have measures been ineffective? Peru has reported more cases than every European country apart from the UK, despite testing only about seven people in every 1,000 - more than some countries in Latin America but far fewer than Italy, for example, which has tested about 88 in every 1,000. Experts say Peru's healthcare system was underprepared, leading to more deaths, but several other social and economic factors can help explain why Peru is struggling to contain the outbreak. Read more here Sonia KatariaBBC News Some children who live in the Leicester lockdown zone but attend school outside of the area will not be able to cross the border, the Department for Education (DfE) has confirmed. From Thursday, only vulnerable children and children of key
workers can travel across the boundary in either direction for school or
appointments with social workers. Other
children have been asked to stay at home. The DfE said: ""If you are a child or young person (other than a vulnerable child or child of a critical worker) that lives in Leicester but attends school or college outside the affected area, you must stay at home."" Some children who attend St Lukeâs Primary School in Thurnby, Leicestershire, which is outside the zone and will be open as normal tomorrow, are from within the boundary. Headteacher Paul Galvin said he was ""deeply sorry"" to the families of those affected. He said: ""It might be difficult for families who are inside the lockdown zone - as we are just outside the boundary - especially if they are not children of critical workers."" He added the school has ""adapted and will keep adapting to changes"" during the coronavirus pandemic. The school has been open since the lockdown in March for vulnerable children and children of key workers, and reopened for Reception and Year 1 in June. A ""small"" outbreak of coronavirus among workers at a bed factory in West Yorkshire has been confirmed. Eight members of staff at the Dura Beds factory in Batley have tested positive for the virus this week, a statement says. All staff - a total of 107 workers - will now be offered tests, according to the joint statement by Kirklees Council and Public Health England (PHE). The Dura Beds factory has been closed for two weeks as a safety precaution for its employees and their families, the statement adds. The firm is now ""working closely"" with the council and PHE so those who have tested positive can be followed up by the NHS Test and Trace programme and self-isolate. People who might have come into contact with an infected individual will be contacted and may be advised to self-isolate for 14 days. The statement adds: ""While the risk to residents from this outbreak is very low, everyone in Kirklees should continue to socially distance, wash hands regularly for 20 seconds with soap and water and get tested if they have symptoms."" Across the UK, the number of newly confirmed coronavirus cases each day has been falling since a peak in April. You can read morehere. Councils in England need urgent support as they face a funding gap of Â£7.4bn due to a loss of income related to coronavirus,the Local Government Association (LGA) says. Local authorities have come under increased pressure during the pandemic as demand for services such as social care has grown, while at the same time, income from local taxation and charges has dropped. James Jamieson, chairman of the LGA, which represents English councils and London boroughs, said ""further funding and flexibilities are now urgent"" if councils are to avoid taking steps such as ""in-year cuts to local services"" to cope with funding gaps. Whitehall has given Â£3.2bn funding to all English councils in two grants to help cover coronavirus costs, but the LGA says between March and June councils had already incurred costs of Â£4.8bn. Almost 44,000 people have died with coronavirus in the UK according to the latest daily government figures - which count deaths with a positive test result. But the overall total is likely to be higher. You can read morehere. Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter As Leicester, in England's East Midlands, has become the first city put under a local lockdown, misleading claims have been shared on social media. A string of local councils have posted on Twitter and Facebook to counter online rumours of imminent lockdowns in their areas - making it clear none have been announced. A rise in cases has been recorded in some local authority areasbut a Public Health England (PHE) spokesperson told the BBC that using this data to predict which areas would see significant rises in cases is ""not appropriate"" because it doesn't give a ""complete picture"" of the local situation. Meanwhile, a number of social media posts attributing the local lockdown in Leicester to videos of crowds of people taking part in anti-racism protests in the city centre a few weeks ago have led to racist and abusive comments directed at protesters. We've identified posts in Facebook groups that may have sparked some of the rumours. You can read morehere. Uganda hosts more than 400,000 refugees from DR Congo alone and many more from South Sudan Uganda has opened part of its border with the Democratic Republic of Congo to allow in thousands of people stuck in no-man's land for more than a month due to the coronavirus pandemic. At least 3,000 of them fled their homes in May after inter-communal clashes in north-eastern Ituri province. But they were unable to cross into Uganda to seek safety as the country had closed its borders in March to control the spread of coronavirus. It has been agreed the refugees will be quarantined before being settled. This will happen for 14 days at a new isolation centre, 13km (eight miles) from the border. The UN's refugee agency (UNHCR) says sample testing will be carried out on the group to see if coronavirus is present among them. This will help authorities decide when the refugees can be transferred to camps. Read more here. Simon JackBBC Business Editor The worldwide economic impact of the coronavirus has been seismic and the job losses are starting to crash on the shores of the UK with increasing frequency and severity. The 1,700 UK job losses at Airbus had a grim inevitability to them, given the destruction of demand in the aviation industry. Demand for air travel in April and May was down more than 90% and normality is not expected to return for up to three years - maybe never for the more lucrative business class travel. BA, Easyjet, Ryanair and Rolls Royce have already announced 20,000 job losses between them, so Airbus was never going to emerge unscathed. The travel wipeout has seen SSP, the owner of stalwart transport hub tenants Upper Crust and CafÃ© Ritazza, cut 5,000 posts.  We already know that the number of workers on UK payrolls shrank more than 600,000 between March and May, according to the ONS. That looks like the thin end of a very big wedge as the government's unprecedented job support scheme tapers off, with employers being asked to share the burden of the cost from the end of July to its withdrawal at the end of October.

As she tells the BBC's Alex Stanger, the end result was a very personal affair.  Matt Forward with his hawk in Trafalgar Square Whether it's nurses, carers or supermarket staff, key workers have rightly been hailed as heroes during lockdown. But behind the pandemic's front line there have also been many others who have been busy doing essential jobs. Matt Forward's job is to keep the pigeons away from Trafalgar Square, in central London. Pest management was covered in the key worker list, so throughout the lockdown Matt drove himself and his Harris hawk 45 miles (70km) to the iconic square early two mornings a week. Matt, who lives in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said he never thought of stopping his job because of lockdown. ""If someone wasn't there doing the job that we do, we'd be overrun,"" he says. Read more about how lockdown has been for Britain's unlikely key workers here Mark EastonHome editor Most of Britain is preparing for an easing of lockdown restrictions. But public
concern at the risks from coronavirus has risen to the highest level since the
end of April, a new poll conducted by Ipsos Mori this week suggests. However,
the survey also says the public is becoming more comfortable about
returning to work and sending children back to school. A month
ago, 37% of those surveyed said they were âvery concernedâ about the risks to
the country.  This new poll suggests that has risen to 50%. Concern about
the risks to individuals has also risen from 24% to 29%. The
survey asks people whether they would feel comfortable in a range of situations
if lockdown measures were lifted.  The proportion of parents who said they
would be comfortable sending their children to school has risen to 49%, up from
38% a month earlier. Two-thirds of people would be comfortable meeting friends or family outside their
household, also a rise from six weeks before. But the poll suggests around six in 10 people would be anxious going to bars or restaurants, using public
transport or lavatories and only 15% said they would be comfortable going to
large sport or music events. Ipsos MORI interviewed a representative sample of 1,078 British adults aged 18-75 online between 26-29 June 2020. Data are weighted to match the profile of the population. All polls are subject to a wide range of potential sources of error. Prof Van-Tam speaking at the government's daily news briefing on 30 May Here's some more from the government's Science and Technology committee hearing that's been going on this afternoon. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer, has said there are enough doses of remdesivir for use on hospitalised patients in the UK. It comes on the back of news that theUS had secured almost all of the forthcoming global supply of the drug, which has been shown to help people recover from Covid-19 more quickly. Prof Van-Tam said: ""Right now, there are stocks in the UK - and I judge us to have adequate stocks - of pre-licensed, as in unlicensed, clinical trial stocks of remdesivir which are available to be used through the emergency access protocol."" Remdesivir is produced by the US firm Gilead Sciences and is the first drug to have been approved by authorities in the US to be used to treat the disease. The US administration is set to receive 500,000 doses - or 100% of the company's supply production - in July, 90% of it in August and 90% in September.

Prof Van-Tam said: ""Right now, there are stocks in the UK - and I judge us to have adequate stocks - of pre-licensed, as in unlicensed, clinical trial stocks of remdesivir which are available to be used through the emergency access protocol."" Remdesivir is produced by the US firm Gilead Sciences and is the first drug to have been approved by authorities in the US to be used to treat the disease. The US administration is set to receive 500,000 doses - or 100% of the company's supply production - in July, 90% of it in August and 90% in September.  ValeTodo Downtown has become the Downtown Market Peru's largest LGBT nightclub has reopened its doors as lockdown eases - as a grocery store. ValeTodo Downtown is one of the best known dance floors in the capital, Lima. But the club's famed drag queens will now be serving milk, fruit and bread rather than cocktails as nightclubs are still not permitted to open. Times have been tough for the club's 120 employees since the pandemic hit. ""I was very depressed because I have been doing this art for years, but you have to adapt to new challenges for the future,"" Belaluh McQueen, who is identified by her stage name, told Reuters news agency. ""We have a new job opportunity,"" she added, standing in the newly named Downtown Market in a sequined suit, high heels and a mask. ""Before, I used to come here to dance and have a good time, but now we come to buy,"" said Alexandra Herrera, a regular attendee of the club. ""The thing is to reinvent yourself.""

"Jack Leslie played for Plymouth Argyle in the 1920s A campaign is being launched to erect a statue of a footballer dropped by England when selectors found out he was black. Picked in 1925, Jack Leslie would have been the first black player to play for England, 53 years before Viv Anderson. By the time he died, in 1988 at the age of 88, there were many more black players at top levels of the game. Leslie was born in Canning Town, in London's docklands, in 1900, to an English mother and a Jamaican father. A gifted athlete, he played for Barking Town, where his prolific scoring record attracted the attention of Plymouth Argyle, then a third-division club. Jack Leslie (third from right) was Plymouth Argyle's top goal scorer He joined them in the 1921-22 season and stayed for 14 years, making 401 appearances and scoring 137 goals, a feat made all the more impressive because of the racial abuse he experienced at the hands of both crowds and opponents. He is remembered as a great attacking inside left but also a utility player who could fill in as a central defender. In 1925, Argyle's manager, Bob Jack, called his star striker into his office and gave him some thrilling news - Jack Leslie had been selected to play for England against Ireland. It was a great achievement for the player and an honour for third-division Plymouth. His selection was the talk of the club and the town - but some days later, when the newspapers published the team, Billy Walker, of Aston Villa, was in the starting line-up and Leslie was named as a travelling reserve. He never did travel with the England team to Belfast. Instead, while England struggled to a 0-0 draw, he scored twice, as Plymouth trounced Bournemouth 7-2 at home. ""I believe that the manager sent in his request, saying: 'I've got a brilliant player here, he should play for England,'"" his granddaughter, Lesley Hiscott, said. Lesley Hiscott (left) and Lyn Davies have fond memories of their grandfather ""So then someone came down to watch him. ""They weren't watching his football. ""They were looking at the colour of his skin. ""And because of that, he was denied the chance of playing for his country."" Leslie later suggested finding out he was black, for the selectors, must have been ""like finding out I was foreign"". But he accepted what had happened and, according to his granddaughters, never expressed any bitterness. They remember him as a kind and loving grandfather. He had married their grandmother, Lavinia, in 1925, at a time when it was unusual for a black man to marry a white woman. And as a consequence, some of the family, and Lavinia in particular, experienced racial abuse. Lyn Davies said: ""If I walked down the street with my friends and he was coming the other way, he would cross to the other side of the road so I could pretend that I didn't know him, so I didn't suffer. ""But I'd run across and say, 'Hello Granddad.'"" Despite helping Plymouth gain promotion, a top-four finish in division two, captaining the club and, in 1931-32, scoring 21 goals in 43 games, Leslie was never again picked for England. Viv Anderson was picked for England in 1978 Anderson, picked to play for England against Czechoslovakia at Wembley in 1978, went on to win 30 caps. ""I'd never heard of Jack Leslie until up to two weeks ago,"" he told BBC News. ""And that's a crying shame, because what he achieved and what he did should be paramount in every black person's mind. ""It's a crying shame but hopefully the statue they are trying to get erected will carry on his legacy."" Argyle have already honoured Leslie with a mural and renamed their boardroom after him. And now a group of fansare campaigning,externalfor a statue. ""At a time when some statues are being pulled down, we want to put one of Jack Leslie up to commemorate his amazing achievements and to remember the injustice that he suffered,"" campaign co-founder Greg Foxsmith says. Jack Leslie is already honoured in a mural at the club The campaign hopes to raise Â£100,000. And supporters include Anderson and the club itself. How many statues of black people does the UK have? ""Having a statue promoted by our fans and funded by fans is a statement by them that they are joining the fight against racism in football,"" Plymouth chairman Simon Hallett told BBC News. ""History has been written by the winners and I think we are now trying to pay more attention to some of the victims of those victories."" Bill Hern co-author of the upcoming book Football's Black Pioneers said: ""Jack Leslie should have been a major figure in the history of British football and society. ""Everyone needs a role model and young black footballers didn't have that major role model in the 30s, 40s and 50s. ""Had he played for England, as he should have, he would have fired the aspirations of generations of young black players."" Leslie's playing days came to an end after he sustained an injury when a lace from a leather ball flew into his eye. He and his family returned to east London and he resumed his trade as a boilermaker. Following his retirement and with time on his hands, Lavinia urged him to go to West Ham and ask the club if there was any work he could do. He met manager Ron Greenwood, who immediately recognised and remembered him as a great player. Greenwood offered him a job in the boot room, where, somewhat poignantly, he cleaned mud from the boots of England stars Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst, Martin Peters, and Trevor Brooking. In a further ironic twist to his story, Leslie also cleaned the boots of West Ham's black striker Clyde Best, who, in the late 1960s and 1970s, was still one of only a tiny number of black players in top-flight English football. Leslie loved the work and being around footballers but it was hardly fitting for a man who should have occupied a unique place in football history - and now, perhaps, will. ""Stories like this are incredibly sad. Discrimination in the game, in any form or from any time period, is unacceptable,"" said FA chairman Greg Clarke, adding that English football had made ""huge strides"" in diversity, although there was still more to do. He said the FA backed the campaign for a statue to recognise Leslie as a pioneer.

"Leicester has become the first part of the UKto experience a local lockdown. While the rest of the country is seeing restrictions easing, the city has gone into reverse. Shops are shutting and schools will follow suit on Thursday. How did this happen? And what does it tell us about how well the virus is under control in the UK? The first major public sign that there was a growing problem with coronavirus in Leicester was on Monday 8 June. In the east of the city, Humberstone Academy, which runs an infant and junior school, closed its doors with the head teacher explaining it was linked to positive tests for coronavirus. They briefly re-opened the following day, before being closed again. The schools have not reopened since. Over the next two weeks, over 900 confirmed cases were recorded - one in 16 of all the positive tests seen in the UK. So what has caused this? In short, the virus still being present and not enough social distancing. Some have pointed to the Black Lives Matter protest - Leicester saw hundreds of people take to the streets in early June. Clearly mass gatherings are not helpful in containing the spread of the virus, but many people wore masks, it was outside and some appeared to try to keep a little distance between themselves and others where possible. It is also worth pointing out there were plenty of these marches in other cities that have not seen a spike. Instead, health officials on the ground believe there are likely to have been many factors which contributed to the spread in Leicester. The east of the city appears to be the epicentre of this local outbreak - although cases are now being seen in other parts of the city. The area includes streets with tightly packed terraced housing, and has a high proportion of ethnic minority families where multi-generational living is more common. Indeed, Leicester as a whole is one of the most culturally diverse areas in the country, with about half of its residents from ethnic minority groups. Latest updates: Leicester reacts to tightened lockdown measures  What are Leicester's new lockdown restrictions? Leicester local lockdown shows virus risk not gone Density of population is bound to be factor, but other issues are at play too. There seems to be signs of transmission in workplaces, suggesting social distancing guidelines are not been adhered to as well as they should, and also transient workers passing through. In short, there is nothing necessarily unique to Leicester that could be pointed to a single stand-out cause as restrictions have eased. But it is certainly on quite different scale to other local flare-ups that have happened so far. One in Weston-super-Mare was largely contained to the hospital, while another in Cleckheaton, which was linked to a meat-packing factory, does not seem to have spread across the community. This is a key question - and one that is already being asked. Even at this early stage, it is clear to see the signs have been there for a few weeks at least. Over the weekend the city's Mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby, was saying the authorities there had only received limited data from the government and national testing system. This goes to the heart of what many fear is a weakness in the system in England - the way the national test and trace system connects up with local teams. The system, which got up and running at the end of May, relies on a national team of 25,000 call handlers to triage cases that test positive. Complex cases involving schools, care homes and prisons, for example, are automatically transferred down to local public health teams, involving councils and Public Health England. But individuals are dealt with by the national team. They ask for information from them about their close contacts and ask them to isolate. Health Secretary Matt Hancock first mentioned an ""outbreak"" in Leicester on 18 June Comprehensive information about these cases has not passed down to councils - or at least not in the detail they would like. It's like ""having one arm held behind your back in a fight"" was how one director of public health described it to me, adding: ""You are up against it from the start."" Essentially it means they cannot monitor all local cases to see what patterns are emerging. That now is beginning to change - a data-sharing agreement has been signed with councils and Public Health England has set up a system to share information. Another weakness of the system appears to be a lack of translation services. Baroness Dido Harding, the head of test and trace, has said this is being invested in. But it is noticeable that the government has said the city and county councils will be given funding to invest in communication in different languages, suggesting the lack of translation support may have had an effect on the way the local population has engaged with requests to isolate and social distance. The prospect of local lockdowns has always been on the cards. While the number of infections being reported has been falling even as restrictions have been easing over the past six weeks or so, there is still a fairly significant amount of the virus in circulation. About 1,000 positive tests a day are being reported across the UK, although the true number is bound to be higher, as the government's surveillance programme - run by the Office for National Statistics - is suggesting there are many more cases in circulation. One of the biggest problems with this virus - and why it has wreaked such havoc - is that it is very infectious, and can be spread before symptoms develop or by people who do not know they have it because they are not showing symptoms. These silent spreaders mean it is difficult to contain the virus - unlike say Sars, another coronavirus which circulated in 2002-03. People were only infectious when they were displaying symptoms, so once they were isolated the virus could be stopped in its tracks. It means it is very difficult for countries with such large populations spread across a number of densely packed cities to eliminate the virus as, say, New Zealand has. That's not to say the UK has not made mistakes - you just need to compare the high level of cases and deaths we have seen compared with Germany to see that. But even Germany has introduced local lockdowns - and experts such as Dr Bharat Pankhania, a former consultant in communicable disease control at Public Health England, are already predicting other cities will follow suit in the coming months. Unfortunately these are, it seems, going to become a way of life from now on. Follow Nickon Twitter,external Read more from Nick What are ventilators and how do they work?
