We're closing the live page shortly, but before we go, here's a round-up of today's developments: Rule number one (or at least top five) of coronavirus prevention: don't shake hands. US President Donald Trump appeared to shun that medical advice on Friday. Introducing business leaders at a press conference outside the White House, he shook hands with many of them as they took to the podium. Health experts say ""social distancing"" is key to prevent the spread of the virus. That means refraining from typical greetings such as handshakes. At the press conference, one executive avoided the president's outstretched hand. Bruce Greenstein, CEO of the home healthcare provider LHC, instead gave Mr Trump an elbow bump. Bruce Greenstein offers President Trump an elbow bump Mr Trump, 73, said he did not need to self-isolate despite meeting at least one person, a Brazilian official he met at Mar-a-Lago, who has the coronavirus. ""I don't have any of the symptoms,"" Mr Trump told reporters when asked why he has not been tested. But after a barrage of further questions, the president said he would get tested ""fairly soon"". ""I didn't say I wasn't going to be tested,"" he said. Read more:I don't need to self-isolate, says Trump US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, says she has reached an agreement with her Republican opponents on a package of relief for families affected by coronavirus. It contains provisions on paid time off for people whose lives have been disrupted by the virus as well as widespread testing for Covid-19 at no cost. The western US state said a woman in her 80s with underlying health issues had died from the virus, the Reuters news agency reported. It brings the death toll in the US to at least 47. President Trump told a news conference at the White House Rose Garden earlier that he was ""likely"" to be tested - despite having no symptoms of Covid-19. Why? Especially as, one, he's been saying for days that there's no need as he feels fine and, two, he told the same gathering that authorities were not recommending tests for those without symptoms. But the urgency of a test for the US leader may have become that more pressing after new US media reports suggesting that a second person who visited President Trumpâs private Mar-a-Lago estate last weekend has now tested positive. The first was a Brazilian official. The second has not been identified. The Trump administration has summoned China's ambassador in Washington over the promotion of a conspiracy theory that blames the US for the outbreak of coronavirus. Chinse ambassador Cui Tiankai was hauled before the US State Department on Friday in response to online comments made by Zhao Lijian, China's foreign ministry spokesman, a day earlier. A US State Department source told Reuters news agency that Mr Cui was ""summoned with regard to what the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said over Covid-19"". Mr Zhao had tweeted that the US military could have brought the coronavirus to China. Coronavirus originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where it was first detected in December last year. In Mr Zhao's tweet, he shared a video clip of Robert Redfield, the director for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), speaking at a congressional hearing on 11 March.

The Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, hopes to pass a relief package to help those affected by coronavirus - but President Donald Trump appears to remain opposed to it, despite days of negotiations. The bill includes free testing as well as a new paid sick leave programme and unemployment benefits.

But Mr Trump said no agreement had been reached and some Republicans say the bill is expensive and ineffective.

Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Guests in the Swiss ski resort of Zermatt have been told to leave by Monday. This is because Switzerlandâs ski resorts are shutting down due to the new government regulations on controlling the coronavirus. Zermatt's ski lifts and mountain railways will stop on Sunday. Hotels and holiday apartments will then be emptied. It is not entirely clear if other resorts are asking all guests to leave, but the St Moritz region is closing every public space including all ski slopes, cinemas, swimming pools - and some hotels are closing. This will be a huge blow to Switzerlandâs alpine resorts: Swiss hotels have just posted a good year, after struggling for some time with the strength of the Swiss franc and financial downturns in Eurozone countries. Whatâs more, after a slow start to the winter season, the last couple of weeks have seen lots of snow, and thousands of guests had been expected over the next few weeks. The US president says he is showing no symptoms of the coronavirus after he met a political aide to Brazilian president Bolsanaro at the weekend, who later tested positive. âWe have no symptoms whatsoever,â he told reporters during his press conference in the White House. There had been speculation that President Bolsonaro had himself tested positive, but on Friday said he did not have the virus. Donald Trump sat next to Mr Bolsonaro at a dinner at his residence in Florida last week. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Donald Trump said ânational emergencyâ were two very big
words, but the declaration sounds more dramatic than it is. There are currently
more than 30 national emergencies in effect, including one Trump declared last
year to redirect military funds to build his Mexican border wall. However, the step does
free up considerable funding and administrative flexibility that the White
House can use to combat the spread of the virus. President Donald Trump says that he ""may add"" the UK to the list of European countries affected by the US travel ban. He said his government is looking at the rise in cases in Britain in the past 24 hours, which he described as ""precipitous"". The total number of cases in the UK is now 798, up by more than 200.   President Donald Trump speaking in the White House on Friday More now from the White House where President Donald Trump is still speaking to reporters. He has declared a state of emergency across the US. He also announced new testing measures - here's the latest from his address:  Laura TrevelyanPresenter, BBC World News America âI just got the result, and heâs negative for Covid-19.â Relief flooded through me, as the family paediatrician relayed the news that our
middle son Toby did not have the coronavirus. It has been a horrendous week - beginning with Toby being hospitalized in Brooklyn with a fever of almost 106F
and flu-like symptoms. But he tested negative for flu. This struck our
paediatrician and the ER doctor as suspicious, and both wanted to test our
17-year-old athletic high school senior for the coronavirus. Yet this
was no easy matter. On Monday, the paediatrician had no tests at the practice.
In the ER, the protocol is to call the department of health and ask if the
patient should be tested. Until extremely recently, the department of health
would only test people who had come into contact with other infected people, or
travelled to an area where coronavirus is rampant. I heard several ER doctors
complain that for days, people they suspected to be infected were turned down
for tests. Toby and I were put in a negative pressure isolation room at the
hospital emergency room, wearing masks, and medical staff who came into
contact with us had to wear masks too. The ER doctor told me that the
protective clothing and visors worn by hospital staff were made in Wuhan,
epicenter of the outbreak in China. And now thereâs a shortage of that vital
protective gear. We were sent home from the ER awaiting the results of other
tests before a request for the coronavirus test could be made. By Tuesday, our
paediatrician had the Covid-19 test, which is a nasal swab - and Toby was
tested. On Friday morning, after nearly three days of stressful family
quarantine, we found out that Tobyâs test was negative. He leaped around the
apartment like a newborn lamb. Heâs one of the lucky ones. With the lag in
testing in New York, now itâs been scaled up, weâll rapidly see more confirmed
cases. The anxiety on the rapidly emptying streets of the city is palpable. In the last hour, the Cypriot government has announced that only its citizens, along with other Europeans working on the island and people with special permits will be allowed into the country for a 15-day period beginning on Sunday. President Nicos Anastasiades announced the move in a televised address on Friday. Nationwide school closures have also been extended until 10 April. Â© 2025 BBC.

"British Airways is among many airlines that have seen passenger numbers shrink and bookings collapse British Airways is to ground flights 'like never before' and lay off staff in response to the coronavirus. In a memo to staff titled ""The Survival of British Airways"", boss Alex Cruz warned that job cuts could be ""short term, perhaps long term"". The airline industry was facing a ""crisis of global proportions"" that was worse than that caused by the SARS virus or 9/11. Meanwhile, Ryanair told staff they may be forced to take leave from Monday. An internal memo to Ryanair staff, seen by the BBC, said crew may be allocated to take unpaid leave due to cancelled flights and schedule changes. BA boss Mr Cruz said: ""We can no longer sustain our current level of employment and jobs would be lost - perhaps for a short term, perhaps longer term."" The airline is in talks with unions but gave no further details about the scale of the likely job losses in the video message transcript seen by the BBC. The airline boss said that British Airways, which is owned by FTSE 100 company IAG, was suspending routes and parking planes in a way they had ""never had to do before"". British Airways would ""continue to do our best for customers and offer them as much flexibility as we can"", Mr Cruz said in the video. Although Mr Cruz said the British flag carrier airline had a strong balance sheet and was financially resilient, he told staff ""not to underestimate the seriousness of this for our company"". BA and other carriers' revenues have been hit by the coronavirus response as governments close borders, companies ban lucrative business travel, conferences and events are cancelled and demand for leisure travel slumps. British Airways boss Alex Cruz said the effect of the coronavirus on the aviation industry will be worse than 9/11 IAG shares bounced on Friday after the global share market rout on Thursday. They closed up 4.8% to 350p per share, but were trading higher before news of the mass groundings broke. The International Air Transport Association warned on Friday that global airline revenue losses would be ""probably above"" the figure of $113bn (Â£90bn) that it estimated a week ago, before the Trump administration's announcement of US travel curbs on passengers from much of continental Europe. Earlier this month, IAG said flight suspensions to China and cancellations on Italian routes wouldaffect how many passengers it carried this year,external. Major US airlines are in talks with the government there over economic relief, as traveller demand plummets. ""The speed of the demand fall-off is unlike anything we've seen,"" Delta chief executive Ed Bastian said on Friday in a note to staff, which also said the firm would cut flights by 40% over the next few months, ground 300 aircraft and reduce spending by $2bn. On Thursday, Norwegian Air said it was set to cancel 4,000 flights and temporarily lay off about half of its staff because of the coronavirus outbreak. The increase in flight cancellations comes after the European Union said it would suspend until the end of June a ""use it or lose it"" law that requires airlines to use their allocated runway slots or risk losing the lucrative asset. The law had led to so-called ""ghost flights"" where airlines were flying near-empty planes in order to keep their slots at airports. The pilot's union Balpa on Friday called for greater government support for the aviation industry and complained that this week's Budget had not included a cut to Air Passenger Duty (APD) as the industry had lobbied for. BALPA general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: ""Removing APD is just one step that could help airlines make it through their financial woes in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. ""The reality is, with such a loss in forward bookings for the summer - the time when airlines make all their profit - the airlines have had to look at ways to save money to keep the companies afloat"".

"Wall Street shares rallied on Friday after US President Donald Trump declared the coronavirus outbreak a national emergency, freeing up money to fight the spread of the disease. As the president spoke, the three main US indexes jumped more than 9%. Earlier, London's FTSE 100 closed up 2.5%, retreating from an early surge, while other European indexes made similar moves. The rally comes a day after Wall Street suffered its biggest losses since 1987. Investors fear economies could slide into recession as a result of the pandemic, as business is disrupted, events are cancelled and schools in many countries close in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. Many indexes around the world have now fallen more than 20% from their recent highs - a red flag for recession. On Friday, the European Union said it will put in place a package of measures, including a â¬37bn euro (Â£33bn) investment initiative. And German finance minister Olaf Scholz said his country could part-nationalise firms to tackle the crisis. In the US, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said her members would pass a bill that provides paid sick leave, among other aid.  But Republicans and the White House have not said they will support it. US Secretary Steven Mnuchin pledged the US would use ""whatever tools we need"". The national emergency declaration helps speed some kinds of funding to local governments. In an interview with US broadcaster CNBC, he said he believed the coronavirus slowdown would be short-term and said the situation in 1987, when markets dropped some 20%, was a ""much scarier time"". ""This is nothing compared to that,"" he said. Stock markets have been in turmoil in recent weeks with investors deeply concerned about the economic effects of coronavirus. On Thursday, benchmark indexes on Wall Street and in the City of London saw their steepest daily falls since so-called Black Monday in 1987, falling 10%. In France and Germany, indexes lost more than 12%. Those declines came despite actions by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank to support the market. Coronavirus 'could cost millions of tourism jobs' Norwegian to suspend half its staff as virus spreads Eurozone tries to ease coronavirus crisis On Friday, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)prohibited short selling,externalof a raft of shares in Italian and Spanish firms, after a request from authorities in those countries for the action, which is designed to protect that list of companies. The prohibition on short selling came after major falls in Italian and Spanish indexes on Thursday. Short selling is speculation that the price of a stock will go down, and if there are more short sellers than buyers, the price will be pushed down. Firms including football clubs Lazio and Juventus were on the list, as well as luxury car manufacturer Ferrari. The New York branch of the Federal Reserve also said it would speed up its planned purchases of US government debt, in response to ongoing strains in the US bond market. In risky times, investors often look to buy Treasuries, driving prices up and yields lower. But in recent days, yields on many US notes have remained unexpectedly high. Many people's initial reaction to ""the markets"" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money. Yet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet. Read more here.

was no easy matter. On Monday, the paediatrician had no tests at the practice.
In the ER, the protocol is to call the department of health and ask if the
patient should be tested. Until extremely recently, the department of health
would only test people who had come into contact with other infected people, or
travelled to an area where coronavirus is rampant. I heard several ER doctors
complain that for days, people they suspected to be infected were turned down
for tests. Toby and I were put in a negative pressure isolation room at the
hospital emergency room, wearing masks, and medical staff who came into
contact with us had to wear masks too. The ER doctor told me that the
protective clothing and visors worn by hospital staff were made in Wuhan,
epicenter of the outbreak in China. And now thereâs a shortage of that vital
protective gear. We were sent home from the ER awaiting the results of other
tests before a request for the coronavirus test could be made. By Tuesday, our
paediatrician had the Covid-19 test, which is a nasal swab - and Toby was
tested. On Friday morning, after nearly three days of stressful family
quarantine, we found out that Tobyâs test was negative. He leaped around the
apartment like a newborn lamb. Heâs one of the lucky ones. With the lag in
testing in New York, now itâs been scaled up, weâll rapidly see more confirmed
cases. The anxiety on the rapidly emptying streets of the city is palpable. In the last hour, the Cypriot government has announced that only its citizens, along with other Europeans working on the island and people with special permits will be allowed into the country for a 15-day period beginning on Sunday. President Nicos Anastasiades announced the move in a televised address on Friday. Nationwide school closures have also been extended until 10 April. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Wall Street shares rallied on Friday after US President Donald Trump declared the coronavirus outbreak a national emergency, freeing up money to fight the spread of the disease. As the president spoke, the three main US indexes jumped more than 9%. Earlier, London's FTSE 100 closed up 2.5%, retreating from an early surge, while other European indexes made similar moves. The rally comes a day after Wall Street suffered its biggest losses since 1987. Investors fear economies could slide into recession as a result of the pandemic, as business is disrupted, events are cancelled and schools in many countries close in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. Many indexes around the world have now fallen more than 20% from their recent highs - a red flag for recession. On Friday, the European Union said it will put in place a package of measures, including a â¬37bn euro (Â£33bn) investment initiative. And German finance minister Olaf Scholz said his country could part-nationalise firms to tackle the crisis. In the US, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said her members would pass a bill that provides paid sick leave, among other aid.  But Republicans and the White House have not said they will support it. US Secretary Steven Mnuchin pledged the US would use ""whatever tools we need"". The national emergency declaration helps speed some kinds of funding to local governments. In an interview with US broadcaster CNBC, he said he believed the coronavirus slowdown would be short-term and said the situation in 1987, when markets dropped some 20%, was a ""much scarier time"". ""This is nothing compared to that,"" he said. Stock markets have been in turmoil in recent weeks with investors deeply concerned about the economic effects of coronavirus. On Thursday, benchmark indexes on Wall Street and in the City of London saw their steepest daily falls since so-called Black Monday in 1987, falling 10%. In France and Germany, indexes lost more than 12%. Those declines came despite actions by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank to support the market. Coronavirus 'could cost millions of tourism jobs' Norwegian to suspend half its staff as virus spreads Eurozone tries to ease coronavirus crisis On Friday, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)prohibited short selling,externalof a raft of shares in Italian and Spanish firms, after a request from authorities in those countries for the action, which is designed to protect that list of companies. The prohibition on short selling came after major falls in Italian and Spanish indexes on Thursday. Short selling is speculation that the price of a stock will go down, and if there are more short sellers than buyers, the price will be pushed down. Firms including football clubs Lazio and Juventus were on the list, as well as luxury car manufacturer Ferrari. The New York branch of the Federal Reserve also said it would speed up its planned purchases of US government debt, in response to ongoing strains in the US bond market. In risky times, investors often look to buy Treasuries, driving prices up and yields lower. But in recent days, yields on many US notes have remained unexpectedly high. Many people's initial reaction to ""the markets"" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money. Yet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet. Read more here.

"Supt Robyn Williams has been sacked for gross misconduct after a 36-year police career One of the UK's most senior black female police officers has been sacked after her conviction for possessing a video clip of child abuse. Supt Robyn Williams was ruled by Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball to have committed gross misconduct. At a fast-track misconduct hearing, Ms Ball said Williams's failure to report the matter was ""very grave"". She pointed to Williams's ""lack of truthfulness and judgement"". The superintendentwas found guilty in Novemberof having footage of child sexual abuse on her phone. At her trial, Williams said she had not viewed the 54-second video, which was sent by her sister, and did not know it was on her phone. But Ms Ball said that Williams's conduct amounted to ""discreditable behaviour"" likely to undermine public confidence and was not a ""trivial lapse"". The assistant commissioner said her failure to report the matter could have caused significant further harm to the child. She said it was ""entirely unacceptable"" for police officers responsible for enforcing the law to break it themselves. Ms Ball added that racial bias had played ""no part"" in her decision, although the Metropolitan Black Police Association argues Williams has been unfairly targeted because she is black and accuses the force of ""institutional racism"". In a statement, the association said the decision to sack Williams was ""outrageous"". ""There are guidelines that allow for discretion, however Robyn was not afforded this privilege from start to finish of the process,"" it added. ""Despite the unprecedented and overwhelming expressions of support from colleagues, communities of London and beyond, calling for Robyn to continue to serve London, their voices were ignored."" Williams's friends and supporters, who were following the hearing on monitors in a separate room, gasped as the decision was read out. One of them started applauding sarcastically. Williams, pictured with London Mayor Sadiq Khan, was highly commended for her work helping families affected by the Grenfell Tower disaster During Williams's trial, Judge Richard Marks QC said she had made a ""grave error of judgement"" in failing to report the video after it was sent to her. The superintendent, who has been a police officer for 36 years, was ordered to do unpaid work in the community andregister as a sex offender, even though the court accepted there was no sexual element to her offending. Gerard Boyle QC, for Williams, told the special misconduct hearing that she had spent her entire police career since the age of 18 acting on behalf of victims of crime and abuse and that she was appalled by such abuse imagery. He added that she was accused of one allegation of one breach of one paragraph of professional standards behaviour. Mr Boyle told the hearing his client ""poses no risk to anyone, let alone children or young people"". Williams has lodged an appeal against her conviction but judges have not yet decided whether to grant approval for the case to be heard.

We're closing the live page shortly, but before we go, here's a round-up of today's developments: Rule number one (or at least top five) of coronavirus prevention: don't shake hands. US President Donald Trump appeared to shun that medical advice on Friday. Introducing business leaders at a press conference outside the White House, he shook hands with many of them as they took to the podium. Health experts say ""social distancing"" is key to prevent the spread of the virus. That means refraining from typical greetings such as handshakes. At the press conference, one executive avoided the president's outstretched hand. Bruce Greenstein, CEO of the home healthcare provider LHC, instead gave Mr Trump an elbow bump. Bruce Greenstein offers President Trump an elbow bump Mr Trump, 73, said he did not need to self-isolate despite meeting at least one person, a Brazilian official he met at Mar-a-Lago, who has the coronavirus. ""I don't have any of the symptoms,"" Mr Trump told reporters when asked why he has not been tested. But after a barrage of further questions, the president said he would get tested ""fairly soon"". ""I didn't say I wasn't going to be tested,"" he said. Read more:I don't need to self-isolate, says Trump US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, says she has reached an agreement with her Republican opponents on a package of relief for families affected by coronavirus. It contains provisions on paid time off for people whose lives have been disrupted by the virus as well as widespread testing for Covid-19 at no cost. The western US state said a woman in her 80s with underlying health issues had died from the virus, the Reuters news agency reported. It brings the death toll in the US to at least 47. President Trump told a news conference at the White House Rose Garden earlier that he was ""likely"" to be tested - despite having no symptoms of Covid-19. Why? Especially as, one, he's been saying for days that there's no need as he feels fine and, two, he told the same gathering that authorities were not recommending tests for those without symptoms. But the urgency of a test for the US leader may have become that more pressing after new US media reports suggesting that a second person who visited President Trumpâs private Mar-a-Lago estate last weekend has now tested positive. The first was a Brazilian official. The second has not been identified. The Trump administration has summoned China's ambassador in Washington over the promotion of a conspiracy theory that blames the US for the outbreak of coronavirus. Chinse ambassador Cui Tiankai was hauled before the US State Department on Friday in response to online comments made by Zhao Lijian, China's foreign ministry spokesman, a day earlier. A US State Department source told Reuters news agency that Mr Cui was ""summoned with regard to what the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said over Covid-19"". Mr Zhao had tweeted that the US military could have brought the coronavirus to China. Coronavirus originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where it was first detected in December last year. In Mr Zhao's tweet, he shared a video clip of Robert Redfield, the director for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), speaking at a congressional hearing on 11 March.

Mr Redfield said some influenza deaths in the US were later identified as cases of Covid-19. The conspiracy theory has gained traction over the past few weeks, with numerous Chinese officials and state media repeating it.

Football's governing body suggested delaying matches to avoid ""any unnecessary health risks"" and ""potential sporting unfairness"". Stopping short of banning matches, Fifa said the final decision on postponement rested with competition organisers such as England's Premier League and European body Uefa Fifa rules normally oblige clubs to release players for national team matches, but this rule has been temporarily reversed. Earlier, all Premier League games in England and Uefa competitions, including the Champions League and Europa League matches due to be played next week, were postponed. The Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, hopes to pass a relief package to help those affected by coronavirus - but President Donald Trump appears to remain opposed to it, despite days of negotiations. The bill includes free testing as well as a new paid sick leave programme and unemployment benefits.  A BBC correspondent says Ms Pelosi has had detailed talks on the bill with President Trump's Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. But Mr Trump said no agreement had been reached and some Republicans say the bill is expensive and ineffective. The number of people who have died from coronavirus in US hotspot Washington state has risen to 37 - an increase of six -  the state governor says. All public and private schools there will close from Tuesday, and gatherings of more than 250 people are banned across the state. ""We're going to fight this epidemic

Reporters have been continuing to press Donald Trump about whether he will take a coronavirus test after he was photographed standing next to an Brazilian aide who later tested positive. He says he will ""most likely"" take a test, but ""not for that reason"". ""I will do it anyway, fairly soon. We are working on a schedule,â Mr Trump said. US government advice is that anyone exposed to the virus should speak to their doctor who will advise about testing.

Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Guests in the Swiss ski resort of Zermatt have been told to leave by Monday. This is because Switzerlandâs ski resorts are shutting down due to the new government regulations on controlling the coronavirus. Zermatt's ski lifts and mountain railways will stop on Sunday. Hotels and holiday apartments will then be emptied. It is not entirely clear if other resorts are asking all guests to leave, but the St Moritz region is closing every public space including all ski slopes, cinemas, swimming pools - and some hotels are closing. This will be a huge blow to Switzerlandâs alpine resorts: Swiss hotels have just posted a good year, after struggling for some time with the strength of the Swiss franc and financial downturns in Eurozone countries. Whatâs more, after a slow start to the winter season, the last couple of weeks have seen lots of snow, and thousands of guests had been expected over the next few weeks. The US president says he is showing no symptoms of the coronavirus after he met a political aide to Brazilian president Bolsanaro at the weekend, who later tested positive. âWe have no symptoms whatsoever,â he told reporters during his press conference in the White House. There had been speculation that President Bolsonaro had himself tested positive, but on Friday said he did not have the virus. Donald Trump sat next to Mr Bolsonaro at a dinner at his residence in Florida last week. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Donald Trump said ânational emergencyâ were two very big
words, but the declaration sounds more dramatic than it is. There are currently
more than 30 national emergencies in effect, including one Trump declared last
year to redirect military funds to build his Mexican border wall. However, the step does
free up considerable funding and administrative flexibility that the White
House can use to combat the spread of the virus. President Donald Trump says that he ""may add"" the UK to the list of European countries affected by the US travel ban. He said his government is looking at the rise in cases in Britain in the past 24 hours, which he described as ""precipitous"". The total number of cases in the UK is now 798, up by more than 200.   President Donald Trump speaking in the White House on Friday More now from the White House where President Donald Trump is still speaking to reporters. He has declared a state of emergency across the US. He also announced new testing measures - here's the latest from his address:  Laura TrevelyanPresenter, BBC World News America âI just got the result, and heâs negative for Covid-19.â Relief flooded through me, as the family paediatrician relayed the news that our
middle son Toby did not have the coronavirus. It has been a horrendous week - beginning with Toby being hospitalized in Brooklyn with a fever of almost 106F
and flu-like symptoms. But he tested negative for flu. This struck our
paediatrician and the ER doctor as suspicious, and both wanted to test our

"Sir Paul McCartney was due to headline Saturday night at Glastonbury this year The government has advised against mass gatherings in the UK for the foreseeable future - effectively cancelling all large-scale events, such as concerts, sports fixtures and theatre productions. The 2020 Glastonbury Festival is the latest in a long list of eventsthat have been cancelled because of coronavirus. Professional football in England and Scotland has already been suspended and all horse racing in Great Britain will stop from Wednesday. Many events around the world, including the Euro 2020 finals, have also been postponed or cancelled. So, what are your rights if you have a ticket to something that gets called off? The Euro 2020 football finals were due to take place in 12 cities around Europe, including London and Glasgow Generally, if you bought your ticket for a cancelled event from an official seller, you should be entitled to a refund, often automatically. However, additional costs, such as postage and booking fees, are unlikely to be reimbursed. For anyone who purchased a ticket through a ticket-reselling website, refunds will depend on the site's terms and conditions. Some sites, like Viagogo, have already said customers will get a full refund in the event of a cancellation. If an event is moved and you cannot make the rearranged date, you should be entitled to your money back. For example, European football's governing body, Uefa, says it will refund all Euro 2020 ticket holders who can't make any rearranged dates in 2021. The football leagues in England and Scotland have not yet announced what will happen about tickets for cancelled matches. Season ticket holders should check their individual club's terms and conditions. Organisers of the Glastonbury Festival say that anyone that has paid a Â£50 deposit can roll it over to next year in order to buy a ticket for the 2021 event. Otherwise, people can ask for their Â£50 to be refunded. If you are taking part in something, the same refund rules may apply to entry fees if it is cancelled. But you need to check the event organiser's terms and conditions. HOW IS THE UK PLANNING FOR AN OUTBREAK:What is the UK's 'delay' stage? WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?A simple guide HOW TO SELF-ISOLATE:What you need to know WHERE ARE WE WITH A VACCINE?Progress so far A VISUAL GUIDE TO THE OUTBREAK:Virus maps and charts If you have heard nothing about a refund after a couple of weeks, follow it up, says consumer rights journalist Helen Dewdney. She advises: ""Where possible, do everything in writing so you have a record."" If you're not getting anywhere you can approach your credit card company, says Ms Dewdney. Using a credit card to buy something costing between Â£100 and Â£30,000 means you are legally entitled to a refund if you do not get what you were promised. Even if the ticket is worth less than Â£100, or a debit card was used instead, there is still the chance of getting a refund under the chargeback scheme. This is used to reverse the transaction. Coronavirus: What are your travel rights? Timeline: Which sport events have been affected? Many events are put on to raise money for good causes. Many art, music and theatre groups are charities and rely heavily on ticket sales for income. They say there could be serious financial implications if they have to refund all tickets. Some, including the BFI (British Film Institute), have asked ticket holders to consider not asking for a refund so that the money can be used as a charitable donation instead. If you are unable to attend an event because facilities such as hotels or travel are unavailable, the situation is not so clear-cut. ""You've got to hope for a goodwill gesture,"" says Ms Dewdney. ""From the organisers' point of view, they'll say the event is still going ahead."" If you've booked a package (with hotel, flight and event entry all included), you may be able to claim under your travel insurance - depending on the small print. It depends, according to Adam French, from consumer group Which?. ""If you've bought a ticket for a Taylor Swift gig to headline, but she didn't perform, you should get your money back"", he says. ""But if it's a festival with multiple acts, that means you have a ticket for the festival and not the individual performer. In that instance, you can't expect a refund."" If you decide against going to a music event or sports match because you're worried about coronavirus, there's little chance of getting your money back. The only possible exception is if you have some form of insurance with your ticket. How can I tell if I've got Covid? Is the NHS ready for the surge in coronavirus cases?

"Face-to-face lectures are being suspended at many universities Salford, Bristol, Edinburgh, Nottingham and Southampton universities are among the latest to rearrange teaching and exams to limit the spread of Covid-19. Measures include ending term early, online teaching and cancelling exams. The moves came as six Oxford students were diagnosed with the virus, while St Andrew's and Bristol universities have each reported a case. ""I recognise many of you are understandably anxious,"" Nottingham's vice-chancellor told students. Prof Shearer West said in a letter, which she asked students to share with friends and family: ""I am writing to let you know what measures we are taking immediately to reassure you, protect your health and ensure that your learning can continue."" Nottingham will put all teaching online from 23 March and is cancelling all trips overseas and residential trips within the UK. However, the letter stresses the university - including its libraries - will remain open. Coronavirus: Six Oxford students diagnosed St Andrew's University confirms Covid-19 case Bristol University student tests positive Salford University has announced all teaching - except for final-year students - will be suspended from Monday, but the campus and student accommodation will remain open. ""This will give us time and space to plan for what may be necessary,"" said a spokesperson. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Edinburgh is also transferring teaching online. Exams are cancelled for first- and second-year students, with those in their third year and beyond taking them online. Again, the university stressed it was still open, with libraries, counselling, research and study spaces operating as usual. ""Students should be assured that they will achieve their qualifications on time and an Edinburgh degree will still hold the same value,"" said a spokesperson. The University of West of Scotland has asked students not to attend its campuses from Monday, although it, too, says it will remain open. It intends to move to remote learning ""to reduce the number of individuals on campus at any one time"". Meanwhile, the University of Southampton has decided to bring its spring holiday forward by a week so that term now ends on 13 March. ""We will keep any impact to the absolute minimum and ensure all students can successfully complete their term's learning,"" it said in a statement. Summer term is scheduled to start as normal next month. Even if teaching and exams are off, libraries will remain open, say universities In a similar move, the University of Bristol has announced it will end face-to-face teaching earlier this term, on 18 March. Online teaching will begin after the holidays and all overseas fieldtrips are cancelled. Bristol vice-chancellor Hugh Brady, said he believed the measures were ""balanced and proportionate"". ""This is indeed a very worrying time for us all - professionally and personally - but I am confident that we can harness our collective ingenuity, resolve and passion for our institution to navigate the choppy waters ahead,"" he said.

"The cast of Marvel's Eternals Disney has promised to continue making films and TV shows with ""an increased commitment"" to diversity in its output, according to its boss Bob Chapek. ""We want to represent our audience,""he said at a meeting,externalfor the company's shareholders this week. ""We want to tell stories that our audience wants to hear, that reflects their lives."" He was responding to a question about LGBT characters in their films and pride events at theme parks. Therewill be a transgender characterin a future Marvel film, and upcoming superhero movie The Eternals will introduce Marvel's first openly gay lead character to cinema screens. Marvel Studios is owned by Disney. There has been some criticism recently after Disney moved the Love, Simon spin-off series from the Disney+ streaming service to Hulu, which it also owns. Called Love, Victor, the show is a based on the film and is about a teenage boy who comes out as gay at high school. Varietyreported,externalthat it wouldn't fit in with ""family-friendly"" shows on Disney+. Hilary Duff is due to revive Lizzie McGuire Hilary Duff recentlyappeared to suggest,externalthe Lizzie McGuirereboot is on holdfor a similar reason. A gay character was planned to appear in the revival of the Disney star's show. Other shows on the streaming service do feature gay characters. Disney boss Bob Chapek said the company won't stop pushing forward with more diversity At the shareholder's meeting, Disney CEO Bob Chapek was asked a question by Catholic campaigner Caroline Farrow, who represents conservative group Citizen Go. As part of her question, she asked: ""Is it perhaps time to reconsider what you can do to make Disney more family friendly, to make it safe for people around the world, not just one particular minority?"" She also claimed a petition which asks Disney not to hold gay pride events in its parks was signed by ""almost 700,000 people"". A petition on the Citizen Go website entitled: ""Stop LGBT indoctrination at Disneyland"" has just over 400,000 signatures. Disneyland Paris hosted a pride event last year and this year's celebration is currently scheduled for June. Avengers: endgame became the highest-grossing film ever New Disney-Pixar film Onward includes a reference to a lesbian couple - which led to it beingbannedin Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. There have also been brief references to gay characters in other big Disney-owned franchises. Avengers: Endgame co-director Joe Russo played the minor role of""grieving man""in the 2019 blockbuster. And Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker features (spoiler) thefirstsame-sex kiss in the franchise's history -described by a reviewer,externalas ""a brief flash of two women kissing... among a crowd of characters"". In January, Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feigesaidthere will be an openly transgender character ""in a movie that we're shooting right now."" And Phastos, the character played by Bryan Lee Henry in The Eternals, was announced to be openly gay - with a husband and kids.

"A report into the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme in Northern Ireland has been published The political fall-out from the scandal left Northern Ireland without a government for three years The scheme was set up to encourage the use of renewable energy sources However, it closed to new entrants in 2016 amid concerns about the potential cost The debacle cost Stormont in the region of Â£30m. An inquiry was set up in 2017 to look into the working of the scheme Luke Sproule, Tori Watson and Robin Sheeran That's all from us after a detailed report from Sir Patrick Coghlin and plenty of reaction from our politicians. The assembly will meet on Monday for a three-hour debate on the report. Join us again then. North Down MLA Andrew Muir of the Alliance Party tells BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra, ""not many of the people mentioned in the report are coming out smelling of roses"". He adds that there needs to be a ""culture change"" as ""some basics"" were missed, such as minute taking. ""We need to ensure all levels of government respond to this report and ensure that the recommendations are implemented,"" he says. ""Not many people will be relieved reading this report,"" says Mr Muir, adding that the matter really damaged public confidence in government in NI. ""We need to ensure those mistakes are never repeated."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Speaking on BBC Evening Extra, Sinn FÃ©in's chief whip John O'Dowd says his party will spend the next few days ""reading and studying the report"". When asked about references in the document to his party colleague MÃ¡irtÃ­n Ã Muilleoir, he says any ""criticism relating to his role"" was after issues with the RHI scandal had come to light and ""did not relate to the RHI scheme itself"". He adds that the scheme was the responsibility of the DUP minister who was in control of commissioning, designing and overseeing the scheme. However Mr O'Dowd says there are lessons in the recommendations to be learnt by all parties. Mr O'Dowd adds that there are ""clearly differences between us and other parties"" but that everyone is ""trying to make"" power sharing work and to ensure ""proper procedures are in place"". ""We need to be ensuring that we are working for families and workers and delivering change this society needs,"" he adds. Alliance finance spokesperson Andrew Muir says reform of the devolved institutions is essential following the release of the RHI inquiry report. ""At first glance it appears there are clear lessons to be learned and issues of real public concern, showing why reform of the institutions is essential,"" says Mr Muir. ""This report must act as a watershed moment for those who have been criticised directly, as well as the wider culture and system of governance, which enabled their actions and inactions.""

TUV leader Jim Allister has also responded to the report. He says: ""Although the language in the report is quite neutral, it's abundantly clear that the panel was appalled by what they found passes in government here, leading them to the conclusion that this government was never fit to handle a scheme like RHI. ""There was an appalling level of ineptitude and no accountability. ""It may be because the blame was spread so widely that some who deserve more criticism have gotten off lightly. ""I look forward to playing my part in being a catalyst in bringing those issues to the assembly."" In conclusion, Sir Patrick says he hopes the work of the inquiry ""will not only have been of interest of the public but will also have served the public interest"". ""We hope that you will all agree of the importance to give priority to this report and its findings in the interests of the people of this jurisdiction,"" he says.  Sir Patrick says that if the inquiry's report is ""followed both in letter and spirit, it will much more difficult for
the type of general problem discovered in respect of the Northern Ireland scheme to reoccur"". ""Hopefully that will in turn lead to better functioning of the Northern Ireland Civil Service and provide for much healthier devolved administration in Northern Ireland,"" he adds. ""Work has progressed in the Northern Ireland civil service with regard to
number of measures covered in inquiry's recommendations."" But he says: ""The inquiry would again counsel against any tendency to conclude that some of the necessary changes have already been fully achieved."" He adds that the ""recommendations set out in report require sustained
system wide change"" and that they will take time to implemented effectively. Sir Patrick says the inquiry recommends a role for the NI Audit Office (NIAO) ""in assessing and validating the extent of progress in implementing the lessons learned from the Northern Ireland RHI scheme"". The inquiry has asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to monitor and if necessary pursue the effective implementation ot its recommendations. He says the inquiry wants to thank the NIAO for agreeing to undertake this task.  ""The relation between minsters and Spads should be reconsidered
and clarified,"" says Sir Patrick. He says there ""should be a process of induction for Spads which should be
shared by the appointing minister and relevant permanent secretary. ""The relevant employment contract and conduct code for Spads must
be reconsidered and code of conduct revised."" He adds that there should be a ""clear system for Spads to register interests and potential
conflicts of interest"" and recommends there should also be a ""revision of the code of conduct"" for ministers, which he says should be a ""priority"". He says all such codes of conduct should be ""periodically
reviewed by an independent mechanism reporting to the public, in keeping with principles
independency and transparency"". He goes on to add that ""ministers presenting the assembly with legislation for approval, should familiarise themselves with it and ensure there is publicly
available evidence"" of how the benefits outweigh the costs. ""Minsters decisions should be taken by ministers in
conjunction with other ministerial colleagues where appropriate and by
no-one else,"" he adds.  This video can not be played 'There are issues I should have dealt with in a different way' More from Arlene Foster, who tells the BBC she has ""taken seriously the issues around transparency and around openness"". She adds: ""The policy was a good policy but the way in which it was
implemented was flawed. Itâs important that we recognise that so it doesnât
happen again. ""There were a lot of wild allegations going around in December
2016 and January 2017, none of those were shown in the report. ""I think RHI gave Sinn FÃ©in the trigger to come out of the NI Executive."" Minister, SPADs and civil servants all share responsibility for ensuring best practice in the use of taxpayers' money, Sir Patrick says. He says there should be encouragement of recruitment of commercial expertise in the civil service. Turning to the matter of inter-departmental communication, Sir Patrick says, ""departmental silos are not in the interest of Northern Ireland public expenditure"". News Letter Political Editor Sam McBride tweets: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Sir Patrick talks in some detail about a number of the recommendations. They include issues such as applying ""rigorous process"" about whether a ""potentiality volatile policy should be delivered by Nothernd Ireland's devolved
administration"". For policies ""driven by unpredictable demand, careful consideration should always be given, prior to implementation, to the inclusion of suspension or closure and ministers should
be informed of such powers at the outset"". He adds that consideration should be given to ""challenging guidelines and practice"" around the use of external consultants by the NI Civil Service and that ""best practice and risk management"" should become ""daily practice"" in ""novel and complex projects"". The system ""by which advice of policy tendered to ministers
should be improved"" to ensure they ""effectively discharge their role"" in testing and challenging
advice prior to policy decisions. In relation to minutes, Sir Patrick says there should be a duty to ""ensure accurate minutes"" with senior officials and ministers are kept - particularity around expenditure and decision making. Arlene Foster has been speaking to BBC News NI's Political Editor Mark Devenport. She says: ""I welcome this report and think Sir Patrick and his team
have been very diligent in getting to an objective account over what happened. ""I accept the findings against me and the party. ""There are issues I should have dealt with in a different way
and of course I apologise for that. We reiterate that apology today. ""What is important is that we take the findings and rebuild
public trust. ""It is a lesson that I will not forget very quickly."" Sir Patrick says he hopes the report and its recommendations can make some contribution to more transparent and effective government in Northern Ireland. ""The recommendations set out in the report are offered in a constructive spirit and represent the inquiry's view as to what needs to change to give Northern Ireland's devolved administration the best chance of avoiding any repeat of the failings of the RHI scheme,"" he adds Sir Patrick says the inquiry has made a number of recommendations - which can be found in full in chapter 56 of the report. He says any inquiry's recommendations are designed to ""remove or reduce risk of similar failures which gave rise to
inquiry"" and ""present an opportunity for progress, for improvement in policy and
practice and innovative thinking"".  ""In addition there were repeated missed opportunities to identify and
correct, or seek to have others correct the flaws in the scheme,"" says Sir Patrick. ""The reality is in addition to a significant number of additional
shortcomings, governance, management and communication systems which in these circumstances should have
provided early warnings of impending problems and failures against problems, proved
inadequate."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.0019102041

"The RHI scheme paid businesses to switch from oil and gas to environmentally-friendly heating Corrupt or malicious activity was not the cause of what went wrong with Northern Ireland's failed energy scheme. Thefindings into the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI),externalscheme were published on Friday. It found the scheme was a ""project too far"" for the NI Executive and ""should never have been adopted"". The scheme, which opened in 2012, paid businesses to switch from oil and gas to environmentally-friendly heating. The 656-page report said that while there was ""unacceptable"" behaviour by some officials, ministers and special advisers, what went wrong was a ""compounding of errors and omissions over time and a failure of attention"". Set up to encourage the use of renewable energy sources, the RHI closed to new entrants in 2016 amid concerns about the potential cost. Those boilers used wood pellets, but the subsidy payment was higher than the cost of the fuel, creating an incentive to use the boilers to generate income. It became known as ""cash for ash"". Key findings from the inquiry The scheme was introduced by then Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster. Following the report's publication, Mrs Foster, now the first minister, repeated an apology for her ""failings in the implementation"" of the RHI scheme. This video can not be played The scheme was introduced by then Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster She added that she is ""determined to learn from my mistakes and to work to ensure that the mistakes and systematic failures of the past are not repeated"". Finance Minister Conor Murphy said it was now the responsibility of the executive to ""put (the report's) recommendations into action to change the system"". ""We need effective government and we need good practice in terms of our handling of public finances and we need to ensure that an issue such as this... can never arise again,"" the Sinn FÃ©in MLA said. Mrs Foster had told the inquiry that she did not read the regulations before bringing them to the assembly. The inquiry found: ""The minister, in presenting the regulations to the assembly and asking for their approval, should have read them herself. ""Not least because in the inquiry's view to so do is a core part of a minister's job."" This video can not be played RHI behaviour was 'unacceptable' However, it has found that as enterprise minister, Mrs Foster was given inaccurate and misleading information. The report also criticises the arrangement between Mrs Foster and her special advisor (Spad) Andrew Crawford. The RHI report: In full,external Live updates: RHI Inquiry report publication Latest reaction to the RHI report It said the division of responsibility between them for reading and digesting important documents was ""ineffective and led to false reassurance on the part of the minister"". The Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS), and in particular the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI), have come under heavy criticism. The report finds that at the development stage ""insufficient care was taken within DETI to weigh properly the whole-life costs"" of the scheme. This video can not be played The inquiry findings are the culmination of more than three years of work by a team led by Sir Patrick Coghlin A draft regulatory impact assessment presented to Mrs Foster in 2012 ""lacked necessary cost information"". The report noted that at this point she had already been ""incorrectly"" told by officials that the scheme provided ""the highest renewable heat output at the best value"". The lack of record keeping was also highlighted. It emerged during the inquiry that many meetings had not been minuted by civil servants. ""Basic administration and record keeping, normally the bedrock of the Civil Service, was on too many occasions lacking within DETI,"" it said. ""This contributed to uncertainty as to what discussions had actually taken place."" The RHI scheme paid 1,200 businesses to switch from oil and gas to what was meant to be environmentally-friendly heating, using wood pellet boilers. Some businesses put in multiple boilers. But the subsidy payment was higher than the cost of the fuel, creating an incentive to use the boilers to generate income.  Â£30mThe amount Stormont had to pay to cover the actual overspend Â£490-700mCost of 20-year projected overspend before RHI was reformed Â£38,000Average cost of the most popular-sized RHI boiler Â£23,000Average annual subsidy payment per boiler before tariff cuts Â£2,000Average annual subsidy payment after tariff cuts 2,128Total number of RHI boilers in NI, many in poultry industry It became known as ""cash for ash"" and a lack of cost controls meant it threatened a massive overspend on the Stormont budget. The financial scandal led to thecollapse of Northern Ireland's political institutions in 2017and caused a three-year political stalemate. The political institutions were only reinstated in January 2020. A public inquiry into the scheme was set up in 2017. It took evidence from high-profile politicians, civil servants and consultants who designed the scheme as well as administrators who ran it. Further criticism of the NICS said that having embarked on the RHI scheme, DETI did not ensure that ""adequate resources and expertise were applied to its development"". ""Those junior civil servants responsible for the scheme day-to-day, no matter how hardworking and well-intentioned, were consistently under resourced. ""They were not equipped with the necessary expertise, nor adequately supported."" A ""wholesale and uncoordinated changeover of staff"" who had knowledge of the scheme within DETI should not have been allowed to happen between 2013 and 2014. Renewable Heat Incentive scheme: Timeline of events What is the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme? In 2015, when problems were recognised, the actions of senior civil servants were not good enough to ensure they were identified and addressed. The inquiry also found that the whistleblower who repeatedly contacted DETI with her concerns should have been treated better. The report said there were ""instances of unacceptable behaviour from Spads"" Janette O'Hagan repeatedly contacted DETI between 2013 and 2015 to highlight abuse of the scheme, but her warnings were overlooked. The report said her treatment ""fell well below the standard she was entitled to expect"". It also said there were ""instances of unacceptable behaviour by Spads"", highlighting one who shared confidential government documents, not just about RHI, with family members. Another instance involved a number of Spads and a minister, discussing a plan to disclose information to divert media attention away from their party. The ""unsatisfactory"" relationship between DETI and Ofgem, the scheme's administrator, was also highlighted. The service Ofgem provided to the department ""fell below that standard that DETI could reasonably have expected"". The report said Ofgem had relevant information about scheme exploitation and did not pass this information on. This failure of communication ""deprived DETI of important opportunities to be confronted with or reminded of the problems of the scheme"". Ultimately the report finds that ""responsibility for what went wrong lay not just with one individual or group but with a broad range or persons and organisations involved"". ""There were repeated missed opportunities to identify and correct, to seek or have others correct, the flaws in the scheme. ""The sad reality is, that in addition to a significant number of individual shortcomings, the very governance, management and communication systems, which in these circumstances should have provided early warning of impending problems and fail safes against such problems, proved inadequate.""

We're closing the live page shortly, but before we go, here's a round-up of today's developments: Rule number one (or at least top five) of coronavirus prevention: don't shake hands. US President Donald Trump appeared to shun that medical advice on Friday. Introducing business leaders at a press conference outside the White House, he shook hands with many of them as they took to the podium. Health experts say ""social distancing"" is key to prevent the spread of the virus. That means refraining from typical greetings such as handshakes. At the press conference, one executive avoided the president's outstretched hand. Bruce Greenstein, CEO of the home healthcare provider LHC, instead gave Mr Trump an elbow bump. Bruce Greenstein offers President Trump an elbow bump Mr Trump, 73, said he did not need to self-isolate despite meeting at least one person, a Brazilian official he met at Mar-a-Lago, who has the coronavirus. ""I don't have any of the symptoms,"" Mr Trump told reporters when asked why he has not been tested. But after a barrage of further questions, the president said he would get tested ""fairly soon"". ""I didn't say I wasn't going to be tested,"" he said. Read more:I don't need to self-isolate, says Trump US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, says she has reached an agreement with her Republican opponents on a package of relief for families affected by coronavirus. It contains provisions on paid time off for people whose lives have been disrupted by the virus as well as widespread testing for Covid-19 at no cost. The western US state said a woman in her 80s with underlying health issues had died from the virus, the Reuters news agency reported. It brings the death toll in the US to at least 47. President Trump told a news conference at the White House Rose Garden earlier that he was ""likely"" to be tested - despite having no symptoms of Covid-19. Why? Especially as, one, he's been saying for days that there's no need as he feels fine and, two, he told the same gathering that authorities were not recommending tests for those without symptoms. But the urgency of a test for the US leader may have become that more pressing after new US media reports suggesting that a second person who visited President Trumpâs private Mar-a-Lago estate last weekend has now tested positive. The first was a Brazilian official. The second has not been identified. The Trump administration has summoned China's ambassador in Washington over the promotion of a conspiracy theory that blames the US for the outbreak of coronavirus. Chinse ambassador Cui Tiankai was hauled before the US State Department on Friday in response to online comments made by Zhao Lijian, China's foreign ministry spokesman, a day earlier. A US State Department source told Reuters news agency that Mr Cui was ""summoned with regard to what the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said over Covid-19"". Mr Zhao had tweeted that the US military could have brought the coronavirus to China. Coronavirus originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where it was first detected in December last year. In Mr Zhao's tweet, he shared a video clip of Robert Redfield, the director for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), speaking at a congressional hearing on 11 March.

Earlier, all Premier League games in England and Uefa competitions, including the Champions League and Europa League matches due to be played next week, were postponed. The Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, hopes to pass a relief package to help those affected by coronavirus - but President Donald Trump appears to remain opposed to it, despite days of negotiations. The bill includes free testing as well as a new paid sick leave programme and unemployment benefits.

US government advice is that anyone exposed to the virus should speak to their doctor who will advise about testing. Wall Street shares rallied on Friday after US President Donald Trump declared the coronavirus outbreak a national emergency, freeing up money to fight the spread of the disease. As the president spoke, the three main US indexes jumped more than 9%. Earlier, London's FTSE-100 closed up 2.5%, retreating from an early surge, while other European indexes made similar moves. The rally comes a day after Wall Street suffered its biggest losses since 1987. Read our full storyhere. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Guests in the Swiss ski resort of Zermatt have been told to leave by Monday. This is because Switzerlandâs ski resorts are shutting down due to the new government regulations on controlling the coronavirus. Zermatt's ski lifts and mountain railways will stop on Sunday. Hotels and holiday apartments will then be emptied. It is not entirely clear if other resorts are asking all guests to leave, but the St Moritz region is closing every public space including all ski slopes, cinemas, swimming pools - and some hotels are closing. This will be a huge blow to Switzerlandâs alpine resorts: Swiss hotels have just posted a good year, after struggling for some time with the strength of the Swiss franc and financial downturns in Eurozone countries. Whatâs more, after a slow start to the winter season, the last couple of weeks have seen lots of snow, and thousands of guests had been expected over the next few weeks. The US president says he is showing no symptoms of the coronavirus after he met a political aide to Brazilian president Bolsanaro at the weekend, who later tested positive. âWe have no symptoms whatsoever,â he told reporters during his press conference in the White House. There had been speculation that President Bolsonaro had himself tested positive, but on Friday said he did not have the virus. Donald Trump sat next to Mr Bolsonaro at a dinner at his residence in Florida last week. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Donald Trump said ânational emergencyâ were two very big
words, but the declaration sounds more dramatic than it is. There are currently
more than 30 national emergencies in effect, including one Trump declared last
year to redirect military funds to build his Mexican border wall. However, the step does
free up considerable funding and administrative flexibility that the White
House can use to combat the spread of the virus. President Donald Trump says that he ""may add"" the UK to the list of European countries affected by the US travel ban. He said his government is looking at the rise in cases in Britain in the past 24 hours, which he described as ""precipitous"". The total number of cases in the UK is now 798, up by more than 200.   President Donald Trump speaking in the White House on Friday More now from the White House where President Donald Trump is still speaking to reporters. He has declared a state of emergency across the US. He also announced new testing measures - here's the latest from his address:  Laura TrevelyanPresenter, BBC World News America âI just got the result, and heâs negative for Covid-19.â Relief flooded through me, as the family paediatrician relayed the news that our
middle son Toby did not have the coronavirus. It has been a horrendous week - beginning with Toby being hospitalized in Brooklyn with a fever of almost 106F
and flu-like symptoms. But he tested negative for flu. This struck our
paediatrician and the ER doctor as suspicious, and both wanted to test our
17-year-old athletic high school senior for the coronavirus. Yet this
was no easy matter. On Monday, the paediatrician had no tests at the practice.
In the ER, the protocol is to call the department of health and ask if the
patient should be tested. Until extremely recently, the department of health
would only test people who had come into contact with other infected people, or
travelled to an area where coronavirus is rampant. I heard several ER doctors
complain that for days, people they suspected to be infected were turned down
for tests. Toby and I were put in a negative pressure isolation room at the
hospital emergency room, wearing masks, and medical staff who came into
contact with us had to wear masks too. The ER doctor told me that the
protective clothing and visors worn by hospital staff were made in Wuhan,
epicenter of the outbreak in China. And now thereâs a shortage of that vital
protective gear. We were sent home from the ER awaiting the results of other
tests before a request for the coronavirus test could be made. By Tuesday, our
paediatrician had the Covid-19 test, which is a nasal swab - and Toby was
tested. On Friday morning, after nearly three days of stressful family
quarantine, we found out that Tobyâs test was negative. He leaped around the
apartment like a newborn lamb. Heâs one of the lucky ones. With the lag in
testing in New York, now itâs been scaled up, weâll rapidly see more confirmed
cases. The anxiety on the rapidly emptying streets of the city is palpable. In the last hour, the Cypriot government has announced that only its citizens, along with other Europeans working on the island and people with special permits will be allowed into the country for a 15-day period beginning on Sunday. President Nicos Anastasiades announced the move in a televised address on Friday. Nationwide school closures have also been extended until 10 April. Â© 2025 BBC.

As the president spoke, the three main US indexes jumped more than 9%. Earlier, London's FTSE-100 closed up 2.5%, retreating from an early surge, while other European indexes made similar moves. The rally comes a day after Wall Street suffered its biggest losses since 1987. Read our full storyhere. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Guests in the Swiss ski resort of Zermatt have been told to leave by Monday. This is because Switzerlandâs ski resorts are shutting down due to the new government regulations on controlling the coronavirus. Zermatt's ski lifts and mountain railways will stop on Sunday. Hotels and holiday apartments will then be emptied. It is not entirely clear if other resorts are asking all guests to leave, but the St Moritz region is closing every public space including all ski slopes, cinemas, swimming pools - and some hotels are closing. This will be a huge blow to Switzerlandâs alpine resorts: Swiss hotels have just posted a good year, after struggling for some time with the strength of the Swiss franc and financial downturns in Eurozone countries. Whatâs more, after a slow start to the winter season, the last couple of weeks have seen lots of snow, and thousands of guests had been expected over the next few weeks. The US president says he is showing no symptoms of the coronavirus after he met a political aide to Brazilian president Bolsanaro at the weekend, who later tested positive. âWe have no symptoms whatsoever,â he told reporters during his press conference in the White House. There had been speculation that President Bolsonaro had himself tested positive, but on Friday said he did not have the virus. Donald Trump sat next to Mr Bolsonaro at a dinner at his residence in Florida last week. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Donald Trump said ânational emergencyâ were two very big
words, but the declaration sounds more dramatic than it is. There are currently
more than 30 national emergencies in effect, including one Trump declared last
year to redirect military funds to build his Mexican border wall. However, the step does
free up considerable funding and administrative flexibility that the White
House can use to combat the spread of the virus. President Donald Trump says that he ""may add"" the UK to the list of European countries affected by the US travel ban. He said his government is looking at the rise in cases in Britain in the past 24 hours, which he described as ""precipitous"". The total number of cases in the UK is now 798, up by more than 200.   President Donald Trump speaking in the White House on Friday More now from the White House where President Donald Trump is still speaking to reporters. He has declared a state of emergency across the US. He also announced new testing measures - here's the latest from his address:  Laura TrevelyanPresenter, BBC World News America âI just got the result, and heâs negative for Covid-19.â Relief flooded through me, as the family paediatrician relayed the news that our
middle son Toby did not have the coronavirus. It has been a horrendous week - beginning with Toby being hospitalized in Brooklyn with a fever of almost 106F
and flu-like symptoms. But he tested negative for flu. This struck our
paediatrician and the ER doctor as suspicious, and both wanted to test our
17-year-old athletic high school senior for the coronavirus. Yet this
was no easy matter. On Monday, the paediatrician had no tests at the practice.
In the ER, the protocol is to call the department of health and ask if the
patient should be tested. Until extremely recently, the department of health
would only test people who had come into contact with other infected people, or
travelled to an area where coronavirus is rampant. I heard several ER doctors
complain that for days, people they suspected to be infected were turned down
for tests. Toby and I were put in a negative pressure isolation room at the
hospital emergency room, wearing masks, and medical staff who came into
contact with us had to wear masks too. The ER doctor told me that the
protective clothing and visors worn by hospital staff were made in Wuhan,
epicenter of the outbreak in China. And now thereâs a shortage of that vital
protective gear. We were sent home from the ER awaiting the results of other
tests before a request for the coronavirus test could be made. By Tuesday, our
paediatrician had the Covid-19 test, which is a nasal swab - and Toby was
tested. On Friday morning, after nearly three days of stressful family
quarantine, we found out that Tobyâs test was negative. He leaped around the
apartment like a newborn lamb. Heâs one of the lucky ones. With the lag in
testing in New York, now itâs been scaled up, weâll rapidly see more confirmed
cases. The anxiety on the rapidly emptying streets of the city is palpable. In the last hour, the Cypriot government has announced that only its citizens, along with other Europeans working on the island and people with special permits will be allowed into the country for a 15-day period beginning on Sunday. President Nicos Anastasiades announced the move in a televised address on Friday. Nationwide school closures have also been extended until 10 April. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Wales players warm up on Friday ahead of the Six Nations match Wales' Six Nations match against Scotland match on Saturday has been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, it has been confirmed. All elite English league football fixtures have been postponed until at least 3 April because of the virus. The Welsh Rugby Union said despite medical advice it was in the best interests of fans, players and staff ""to fall in line"" with other sports. It came hours after it insisted the game in Cardiff was going ahead. The WRU said it maintained an ""open dialogue with"" and continued to seek advice and direction from the Welsh Government, other stakeholders, including the Six Nations ""on this fast-moving issue"". It said it hoped to make further announcements about rescheduling the fixture in the coming days. ""Every effort has been made to stage this game and we appreciate that individuals will have been inconvenienced,"" it said. ""Given the fluid and unprecedented nature of this issue a postponement became the only viable option."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

First Minister Mark Drakefordtweeted,externalsaying he could understand the decision. Earlier, a Conservative MP said holding the match was ""just not clever"". Ahead of the U-turn, Brecon and Radnorshire Conservative MP Fay Jones tweeted: ""I was super excited about going to #WALvSCO but I won't be going. The Premier League is suspended and no other 6 Nations fixtures are going ahead. No one loves the rugby more than me but it's just not clever."" Matt Hamon, a Scotland fan on his stag weekend, said: ""I can understand why it was cancelled but it should have been cancelled yesterday or not at all."" All Premier League, Football League,  FA Women's Super League and Women's Championship matcheshave been postponed until at least 3 April Uefa has announcedChampions League and Europa League fixtures had also been postponed The Football Association of Wales meanwhile has cancelled the Wales v Austria friendly in Swansea on 27 March But thePremiership Rugby Cup final between Sale Sharks and Harlequins on Sundaywill go ahead Stereophonics concerts in Cardiff on Saturday and Sunday are definitely going ahead, said the Motorpoint Arena. Friends Valerie Barbour, from Edinburgh (left) and Lorraine Daye, from Tonyrefail, have been meeting up for Six Nations games since the 1970s Plaid Cymru, which has cancelled its spring conference for the following weekend, had already called for the match to be postponed. Leader Adam Price said ""all mass gatherings"" should be postponed or cancelled, adding that the ""safety"" of vulnerable and ""at risk"" citizens should be ""put before everything else"". EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate HEALTH MYTHS:The fake advice you should ignore MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Asked about postponing the match at a briefing on Thursday, Mr Gething said there wasn't public health advice available which said it was right thing to do for the public to cancel larger scale events. ""It's really clear and really important that ministers are making choices that are guided by the best possible evidence and scientific advice and the challenge about larger events, is that the science doesn't tell us so that  really makes a difference either in significantly delaying the peak of the outbreak or in terms of saving life."" Mr Gething, who had said he was going to the Six Nations match with his brother, said they would be ""actively considering"" a decision next week about the impact of big events on emergency services, like police, ambulance and St John, so they could be available for preparing for a more significant stage of the outbreak. Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, told the BBC Radio Four's Today programme that mass gatherings have some impact but people were more likely to get infected by close family members, friends or contacts. ""It's eye-catching to say stop those [big events] it's not actually a big impact on the transmission, not to say that we won't do at some point, but it's not the most important thing to get in place first,"" he said. Asked about the match in Cardiff, Sir Patrick said: ""I think it's more likely that they'll be transmission in pubs and other areas where people are aggregating, watching it than in the actual stadium itself."" Latest map showing positive tests across Wales Meanwhile, PHW reported 13 new cases, taking the total to 38, including first cases in Anglesey and Flintshire. Four more in Caerphilly county Two in Swansea A first positive test in both Anglesey and Flintshire One each in Cardiff, Carmarthenshire, Monmouthshire, Newport and Powys A total of 945 people have now been tested. ""All patients are being managed in clinically appropriate settings based on the assessment of a specialist infectious disease consultant,"" said Dr Robin Howe,Â PHW incident director. People with symptoms of a new cough or fever are being asked to self-isolate for seven days as part of an escalated response to the coronavirus. The advice came into effect on Fridayas Wales moves to a delay phase, beyond the original contain phase. Coronavirus: What is it like to self-isolate? People with fever or cough told to self-isolate Can you stop people stockpiling? What is the 'delay' stage of the UK's plans? Wales' chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton said the challenge was to prepare for a significant number of cases in the coming months. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""Our NHS is working hard to treat those people who have been confirmed with coronavirus while also dealing with the normal routine and emergency healthcare needs of the Welsh population. Staff are doing a fantastic job and we thank them for their hard work. ""At the moment, the NHS is continuing to provide planned and emergency care but as more people are diagnosed with coronavirus and demand for hospital treatment increases, we will need to consider reducing planned activity, including outpatient appointments. We will make sure everyone affected is informed."" More than 125,000 people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 in 118 countries around the world, according to the World Health Organization.

"Some fans have been seen wearing protective masks at Premier League fixtures Elite football in Britain has been suspended until at least 3 April as a result of the spread of coronavirus. All games in England's Premier League, EFL, Women's Super League and Women's Championship, plus inScotland,WalesandNorthern Ireland,are postponed. The Premier League said play will start on 4 April subject to ""conditions at the time"". But BBC sports editor Dan Roan says resuming on the date is privately deemed ""almost impossible"". FA chairman Greg Clarke is known to have expressed his fear at Friday's emergency meeting that the season may have to be abandoned. England's international friendly matches against Italy on 27 March and Denmark four days later are off. The EFL, which hopes to resume play a day earlier than the Premier League on 3 April, said clubs were also advised to suspend ""non-essential activities"" such as ""player appearances, training ground visits and fan meetings"". The Euro 2020 play-offs have alsomoved closer to being postponedafter Fifa recommended that all impending internationals should be called off. Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic are all scheduled to play their semi-finals on 26 March, with the finals five days later. The suspension comes on a day of widespread sporting postponements worldwide. The London Marathonhas been moved from 26 April to 4 October, with the Manchester and Brighton Marathons also postponed. Uefa haspostponed next week's Champions League and Europa Leaguefixtures. In rugby union, Saturday's Six Nations match betweenWales and Scotlandhas been postponed, as has Sunday's Premiership Cup final betweenSale and Harlequins. Cycling's Giro d'Italia, scheduled to start in Hungary in May,has been called off. England'sTest cricket series in Sri Lankahas been cancelled. Golf's opening major of the year,the Masters, has been postponed. Formula 1 hascalled off the Vietnam Grand Prixon 5 April. Formula E issuspended for two months, affecting races in Paris, Seoul and Jakarta. Will I get a refund if my event is cancelled? Late on Thursday, it was announced Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta had tested positive for the virus, and early on Friday Chelsea striker Callum Hudson-Odoi revealed he had been affected, while Everton say a first-team player has shown symptoms. Earlier this week, several clubs - including Arsenal, Chelsea, Leicester City, Bournemouth, Manchester City, Juventus and Real Madrid - revealed they have either all or some of their playing staff in self-isolation. Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said: ""In this unprecedented situation, we are working closely with our clubs, government, the FA and EFL and can reassure everyone the health and welfare of players, staff and supporters are our priority."" The Premier League said its ""aim is to reschedule the displaced fixtures"", while the Football Association said ""all parties are committed at this time to trying to complete this season's domestic fixture programme"". On Thursday Prime Minister Boris Johnson said suspending major public events such as sporting fixtures was being considered by the government but would be a measure primarily to protect public services, rather than delay the spread. The EFL said: ""This decision has not been taken lightly, but the EFL must prioritise the health and well-being of players, staff and supporters while also acknowledging the government's national efforts in tackling this outbreak."" Football has also been suspended in Italy, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Portugal and the USA. This video can not be played Football suspension 'very worrying' for clubs - Rochdale CEO Dan Roan, BBC sports editor These are deeply worrying times for football - and for world sport - which is having to face up to a period of disruption and dislocation unprecedented in peacetime. Privately, senior football figures admit that resuming the English league season in early April - when the initial suspension will be reviewed - will be almost impossible. Their hope is that next week a decision is taken by Uefa to postpone Euro 2020 for a year, thereby freeing up space in the calendar to reschedule outstanding matches, and complete domestic league seasons across the continent at some stage. The problem is that the outbreak is expected to be at its peak in May and June, so some within the game fear that if the suspension keeps on being extended, the season will have to be abandoned and declared void. This would obviously be a nightmare scenario for the fans of Liverpool and Leeds United, who both stand on the brink of long-awaited glory. But it would also have severe financial ramifications for clubs, players, staff and broadcasters, along with the wider sporting industry. Amid the threat of legal action and demands for refunds from season ticket holders, clubs will now be scrambling to check insurance policies and commercial contracts. This a crisis no one saw coming. And one that leaves a gaping hole in the country's cultural fabric at a tense and troubling time, when many people could do with the welcome distraction that football brings to so many.

"The cast of Marvel's Eternals Disney has promised to continue making films and TV shows with ""an increased commitment"" to diversity in its output, according to its boss Bob Chapek. ""We want to represent our audience,""he said at a meeting,externalfor the company's shareholders this week. ""We want to tell stories that our audience wants to hear, that reflects their lives."" He was responding to a question about LGBT characters in their films and pride events at theme parks. Therewill be a transgender characterin a future Marvel film, and upcoming superhero movie The Eternals will introduce Marvel's first openly gay lead character to cinema screens. Marvel Studios is owned by Disney. There has been some criticism recently after Disney moved the Love, Simon spin-off series from the Disney+ streaming service to Hulu, which it also owns. Called Love, Victor, the show is a based on the film and is about a teenage boy who comes out as gay at high school. Varietyreported,externalthat it wouldn't fit in with ""family-friendly"" shows on Disney+. Hilary Duff is due to revive Lizzie McGuire Hilary Duff recentlyappeared to suggest,externalthe Lizzie McGuirereboot is on holdfor a similar reason. A gay character was planned to appear in the revival of the Disney star's show. Other shows on the streaming service do feature gay characters. Disney boss Bob Chapek said the company won't stop pushing forward with more diversity At the shareholder's meeting, Disney CEO Bob Chapek was asked a question by Catholic campaigner Caroline Farrow, who represents conservative group Citizen Go. As part of her question, she asked: ""Is it perhaps time to reconsider what you can do to make Disney more family friendly, to make it safe for people around the world, not just one particular minority?"" She also claimed a petition which asks Disney not to hold gay pride events in its parks was signed by ""almost 700,000 people"". A petition on the Citizen Go website entitled: ""Stop LGBT indoctrination at Disneyland"" has just over 400,000 signatures. Disneyland Paris hosted a pride event last year and this year's celebration is currently scheduled for June. Avengers: endgame became the highest-grossing film ever New Disney-Pixar film Onward includes a reference to a lesbian couple - which led to it beingbannedin Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. There have also been brief references to gay characters in other big Disney-owned franchises. Avengers: Endgame co-director Joe Russo played the minor role of""grieving man""in the 2019 blockbuster.

"British Airways is among many airlines that have seen passenger numbers shrink and bookings collapse British Airways is to ground flights 'like never before' and lay off staff in response to the coronavirus. In a memo to staff titled ""The Survival of British Airways"", boss Alex Cruz warned that job cuts could be ""short term, perhaps long term"". The airline industry was facing a ""crisis of global proportions"" that was worse than that caused by the SARS virus or 9/11. Meanwhile, Ryanair told staff they may be forced to take leave from Monday. An internal memo to Ryanair staff, seen by the BBC, said crew may be allocated to take unpaid leave due to cancelled flights and schedule changes. BA boss Mr Cruz said: ""We can no longer sustain our current level of employment and jobs would be lost - perhaps for a short term, perhaps longer term."" The airline is in talks with unions but gave no further details about the scale of the likely job losses in the video message transcript seen by the BBC. The airline boss said that British Airways, which is owned by FTSE 100 company IAG, was suspending routes and parking planes in a way they had ""never had to do before"". British Airways would ""continue to do our best for customers and offer them as much flexibility as we can"", Mr Cruz said in the video. Although Mr Cruz said the British flag carrier airline had a strong balance sheet and was financially resilient, he told staff ""not to underestimate the seriousness of this for our company"". BA and other carriers' revenues have been hit by the coronavirus response as governments close borders, companies ban lucrative business travel, conferences and events are cancelled and demand for leisure travel slumps. British Airways boss Alex Cruz said the effect of the coronavirus on the aviation industry will be worse than 9/11 IAG shares bounced on Friday after the global share market rout on Thursday. They closed up 4.8% to 350p per share, but were trading higher before news of the mass groundings broke. The International Air Transport Association warned on Friday that global airline revenue losses would be ""probably above"" the figure of $113bn (Â£90bn) that it estimated a week ago, before the Trump administration's announcement of US travel curbs on passengers from much of continental Europe. Earlier this month, IAG said flight suspensions to China and cancellations on Italian routes wouldaffect how many passengers it carried this year,external. Major US airlines are in talks with the government there over economic relief, as traveller demand plummets. ""The speed of the demand fall-off is unlike anything we've seen,"" Delta chief executive Ed Bastian said on Friday in a note to staff, which also said the firm would cut flights by 40% over the next few months, ground 300 aircraft and reduce spending by $2bn. On Thursday, Norwegian Air said it was set to cancel 4,000 flights and temporarily lay off about half of its staff because of the coronavirus outbreak. The increase in flight cancellations comes after the European Union said it would suspend until the end of June a ""use it or lose it"" law that requires airlines to use their allocated runway slots or risk losing the lucrative asset. The law had led to so-called ""ghost flights"" where airlines were flying near-empty planes in order to keep their slots at airports. The pilot's union Balpa on Friday called for greater government support for the aviation industry and complained that this week's Budget had not included a cut to Air Passenger Duty (APD) as the industry had lobbied for. BALPA general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: ""Removing APD is just one step that could help airlines make it through their financial woes in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. ""The reality is, with such a loss in forward bookings for the summer - the time when airlines make all their profit - the airlines have had to look at ways to save money to keep the companies afloat"".

The driver, based at the North Greenwich depot, had recently returned from a holiday in Vietnam. It comes as the mayor of London cancelled the upcoming St Patrick's Day celebrations because of the outbreak. Buckingham Palace has also announcedThe Queen has cancelled a planned visit to the borough of Camdenon 26 March. A spokesman for the Queen, who turns 94 in April, said: ""As a sensible precaution and for practical reasons in the current circumstances, changes are being made to The Queen's diary commitments in the coming weeks. ""Audiences will continue as usual. Other events will be reviewed on an ongoing basis in line with the appropriate advice."" Sadiq Khan said he had been left with no choice but to call off the annual St Patrick's Day parade, which had been due to take place in Trafalgar Square on Sunday. Official St Patrick's Day events have been held in London since 2002 and attract more than 50,000 people. Birmingham's St Patrick's Day parade, which claims to be the third biggest in the world and attracts crowds of up to 100,000,has also been cancelled.

"This video can not be played Coronavirus: TfL to trial ""enhanced"" anti-viral cleaning product A London Underground train driver on the Jubilee Line has tested positive for coronavirus, Transport for London (TfL) has said. The driver, based at the North Greenwich depot, had recently returned from a holiday in Vietnam. It comes as the mayor of London cancelled the upcoming St Patrick's Day celebrations because of the outbreak. Buckingham Palace has also announcedThe Queen has cancelled a planned visit to the borough of Camdenon 26 March. A spokesman for the Queen, who turns 94 in April, said: ""As a sensible precaution and for practical reasons in the current circumstances, changes are being made to The Queen's diary commitments in the coming weeks. ""Audiences will continue as usual. Other events will be reviewed on an ongoing basis in line with the appropriate advice."" Sadiq Khan said he had been left with no choice but to call off the annual St Patrick's Day parade, which had been due to take place in Trafalgar Square on Sunday. Official St Patrick's Day events have been held in London since 2002 and attract more than 50,000 people. Birmingham's St Patrick's Day parade, which claims to be the third biggest in the world and attracts crowds of up to 100,000,has also been cancelled. The UK government has warned that the virus will spread at speed The Government's top scientist has warned that up to 10,000 people in the UK are already infected with Covid-19 The election for the next mayor of London, scheduled to take place in May, has been postponed until next year. Mr Khan also warned that ""things will get worse before they get better"" and ""more deaths"" were to be expected. Closing public transport would be ""unsustainable"", the mayor added. Coronavirus: What is it like to self-isolate? English local elections postponed over coronavirus Can you stop people stockpiling? The Tube driver is self-isolating, and the train and depot he worked in is being deep-cleaned, TfL said. The driver said he had not worked in any public-facing job since returning from Vietnam. A spokesman added: ""The safety of our staff and customers is our top priority and we are taking all necessary precautions. ""The areas where the driver worked are being cleaned, including the depot and the trains, in line with guidance from Public Health England with whom we are working closely.""

"Sunday's Old Firm game at Ibrox is among the matches to be called off this weekend The Scottish football season has been suspended until further notice amid the coronavirus outbreak, the SPFL has confirmed. SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster said it was ""neither realistic nor possible"" to continue with matches. The postponements begin with Friday's Premiership match between Motherwell and Aberdeen, and Queen of the South against Ayr United in the Championship. Sunday's Old Firm derby at Ibrox will also not be played. What happens next in Scottish football? SPFL says no money to cover closed-door games Doncaster warns of 'dire financial consequences' All domestic professional and grassroots football under the jurisdiction of the Scottish FA will be suspended, which includes the Scottish Women's Premier League. The second leg of Rangers' Europa League last-16 encounter with Bayer Leverkusen was postponed earlier by Uefa. The SPFL has acted after the UK government escalated its response and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had advised events of more than 500 people should be cancelled. The all-encompassing decision has been taken to ensure a consistency of message and the idea of playing behind closed doors was ruled out due to the unavailability of emergency service provision and after PFA Scotland said their members would not be prepared to ""put their health and safety at risk"". Scottish FA chief executive Ian Maxwell said: ""Today's announcement is made in the interests of public health but, equally, the health and safety of players, match officials, and staff across the game. ""This is of paramount importance as the country enters the 'delay' phase of the coronavirus pandemic. ""It is also why the Scottish FA is compelled to ensure that the suspension is cascaded through the non-professional and grassroots games until further notice."" SPFL chief executive Doncaster had previously warned of ""dire financial consequences"" for clubs if matches were to take place without fans. Scottish clubs rely heavily on ticket sales, with Uefa's latest benchmark report revealing that 43% of the Scottish top flight's revenue was made up of gate receipts in 2018. And the league body warned clubs earlier this week that there were no cash reserves to help them in the event of matches taking place without spectators. Clubs were encouraged to examine their insurance arrangements and that ""Every single penny of income from sponsorships, broadcast deals and cup revenue is already paid to the clubs as fees."" One Premiership club told BBC Scotland earlier this week they would be forced to rely on the goodwill of fans to not demand refunds should they not be permitted to attended games. The spread of the virus has gradually escalated measures across Europe, with games postponed and played without spectators. Uefa is meeting on Tuesday to discuss its response to the outbreak, and discussions will cover all domestic and European competitions, including Euro 2020.

"Wall Street shares rallied on Friday after US President Donald Trump declared the coronavirus outbreak a national emergency, freeing up money to fight the spread of the disease. As the president spoke, the three main US indexes jumped more than 9%. Earlier, London's FTSE 100 closed up 2.5%, retreating from an early surge, while other European indexes made similar moves. The rally comes a day after Wall Street suffered its biggest losses since 1987. Investors fear economies could slide into recession as a result of the pandemic, as business is disrupted, events are cancelled and schools in many countries close in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. Many indexes around the world have now fallen more than 20% from their recent highs - a red flag for recession. On Friday, the European Union said it will put in place a package of measures, including a â¬37bn euro (Â£33bn) investment initiative. And German finance minister Olaf Scholz said his country could part-nationalise firms to tackle the crisis. In the US, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said her members would pass a bill that provides paid sick leave, among other aid.  But Republicans and the White House have not said they will support it. US Secretary Steven Mnuchin pledged the US would use ""whatever tools we need"". The national emergency declaration helps speed some kinds of funding to local governments. In an interview with US broadcaster CNBC, he said he believed the coronavirus slowdown would be short-term and said the situation in 1987, when markets dropped some 20%, was a ""much scarier time"". ""This is nothing compared to that,"" he said. Stock markets have been in turmoil in recent weeks with investors deeply concerned about the economic effects of coronavirus. On Thursday, benchmark indexes on Wall Street and in the City of London saw their steepest daily falls since so-called Black Monday in 1987, falling 10%. In France and Germany, indexes lost more than 12%. Those declines came despite actions by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank to support the market. Coronavirus 'could cost millions of tourism jobs' Norwegian to suspend half its staff as virus spreads Eurozone tries to ease coronavirus crisis On Friday, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)prohibited short selling,externalof a raft of shares in Italian and Spanish firms, after a request from authorities in those countries for the action, which is designed to protect that list of companies. The prohibition on short selling came after major falls in Italian and Spanish indexes on Thursday. Short selling is speculation that the price of a stock will go down, and if there are more short sellers than buyers, the price will be pushed down. Firms including football clubs Lazio and Juventus were on the list, as well as luxury car manufacturer Ferrari. The New York branch of the Federal Reserve also said it would speed up its planned purchases of US government debt, in response to ongoing strains in the US bond market. In risky times, investors often look to buy Treasuries, driving prices up and yields lower. But in recent days, yields on many US notes have remained unexpectedly high. Many people's initial reaction to ""the markets"" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money. Yet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet. Read more here.

"The RHI scheme paid businesses to switch from oil and gas to environmentally-friendly heating Corrupt or malicious activity was not the cause of what went wrong with Northern Ireland's failed energy scheme. Thefindings into the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI),externalscheme were published on Friday. It found the scheme was a ""project too far"" for the NI Executive and ""should never have been adopted"". The scheme, which opened in 2012, paid businesses to switch from oil and gas to environmentally-friendly heating. The 656-page report said that while there was ""unacceptable"" behaviour by some officials, ministers and special advisers, what went wrong was a ""compounding of errors and omissions over time and a failure of attention"". Set up to encourage the use of renewable energy sources, the RHI closed to new entrants in 2016 amid concerns about the potential cost. Those boilers used wood pellets, but the subsidy payment was higher than the cost of the fuel, creating an incentive to use the boilers to generate income. It became known as ""cash for ash"". Key findings from the inquiry The scheme was introduced by then Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster. Following the report's publication, Mrs Foster, now the first minister, repeated an apology for her ""failings in the implementation"" of the RHI scheme. This video can not be played The scheme was introduced by then Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster She added that she is ""determined to learn from my mistakes and to work to ensure that the mistakes and systematic failures of the past are not repeated"". Finance Minister Conor Murphy said it was now the responsibility of the executive to ""put (the report's) recommendations into action to change the system"". ""We need effective government and we need good practice in terms of our handling of public finances and we need to ensure that an issue such as this... can never arise again,"" the Sinn FÃ©in MLA said. Mrs Foster had told the inquiry that she did not read the regulations before bringing them to the assembly. The inquiry found: ""The minister, in presenting the regulations to the assembly and asking for their approval, should have read them herself. ""Not least because in the inquiry's view to so do is a core part of a minister's job."" This video can not be played RHI behaviour was 'unacceptable' However, it has found that as enterprise minister, Mrs Foster was given inaccurate and misleading information. The report also criticises the arrangement between Mrs Foster and her special advisor (Spad) Andrew Crawford. The RHI report: In full,external Live updates: RHI Inquiry report publication Latest reaction to the RHI report It said the division of responsibility between them for reading and digesting important documents was ""ineffective and led to false reassurance on the part of the minister"". The Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS), and in particular the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI), have come under heavy criticism. The report finds that at the development stage ""insufficient care was taken within DETI to weigh properly the whole-life costs"" of the scheme. This video can not be played The inquiry findings are the culmination of more than three years of work by a team led by Sir Patrick Coghlin A draft regulatory impact assessment presented to Mrs Foster in 2012 ""lacked necessary cost information"". The report noted that at this point she had already been ""incorrectly"" told by officials that the scheme provided ""the highest renewable heat output at the best value"". The lack of record keeping was also highlighted. It emerged during the inquiry that many meetings had not been minuted by civil servants. ""Basic administration and record keeping, normally the bedrock of the Civil Service, was on too many occasions lacking within DETI,"" it said. ""This contributed to uncertainty as to what discussions had actually taken place."" The RHI scheme paid 1,200 businesses to switch from oil and gas to what was meant to be environmentally-friendly heating, using wood pellet boilers. Some businesses put in multiple boilers. But the subsidy payment was higher than the cost of the fuel, creating an incentive to use the boilers to generate income.  Â£30mThe amount Stormont had to pay to cover the actual overspend Â£490-700mCost of 20-year projected overspend before RHI was reformed Â£38,000Average cost of the most popular-sized RHI boiler Â£23,000Average annual subsidy payment per boiler before tariff cuts Â£2,000Average annual subsidy payment after tariff cuts 2,128Total number of RHI boilers in NI, many in poultry industry It became known as ""cash for ash"" and a lack of cost controls meant it threatened a massive overspend on the Stormont budget. The financial scandal led to thecollapse of Northern Ireland's political institutions in 2017and caused a three-year political stalemate. The political institutions were only reinstated in January 2020. A public inquiry into the scheme was set up in 2017. It took evidence from high-profile politicians, civil servants and consultants who designed the scheme as well as administrators who ran it. Further criticism of the NICS said that having embarked on the RHI scheme, DETI did not ensure that ""adequate resources and expertise were applied to its development"". ""Those junior civil servants responsible for the scheme day-to-day, no matter how hardworking and well-intentioned, were consistently under resourced. ""They were not equipped with the necessary expertise, nor adequately supported."" A ""wholesale and uncoordinated changeover of staff"" who had knowledge of the scheme within DETI should not have been allowed to happen between 2013 and 2014. Renewable Heat Incentive scheme: Timeline of events What is the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme? In 2015, when problems were recognised, the actions of senior civil servants were not good enough to ensure they were identified and addressed. The inquiry also found that the whistleblower who repeatedly contacted DETI with her concerns should have been treated better. The report said there were ""instances of unacceptable behaviour from Spads"" Janette O'Hagan repeatedly contacted DETI between 2013 and 2015 to highlight abuse of the scheme, but her warnings were overlooked. The report said her treatment ""fell well below the standard she was entitled to expect"". It also said there were ""instances of unacceptable behaviour by Spads"", highlighting one who shared confidential government documents, not just about RHI, with family members. Another instance involved a number of Spads and a minister, discussing a plan to disclose information to divert media attention away from their party. The ""unsatisfactory"" relationship between DETI and Ofgem, the scheme's administrator, was also highlighted. The service Ofgem provided to the department ""fell below that standard that DETI could reasonably have expected"". The report said Ofgem had relevant information about scheme exploitation and did not pass this information on. This failure of communication ""deprived DETI of important opportunities to be confronted with or reminded of the problems of the scheme"". Ultimately the report finds that ""responsibility for what went wrong lay not just with one individual or group but with a broad range or persons and organisations involved"". ""There were repeated missed opportunities to identify and correct, to seek or have others correct, the flaws in the scheme. ""The sad reality is, that in addition to a significant number of individual shortcomings, the very governance, management and communication systems, which in these circumstances should have provided early warning of impending problems and fail safes against such problems, proved inadequate.""

"Wales players warm up on Friday ahead of the Six Nations match Wales' Six Nations match against Scotland match on Saturday has been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, it has been confirmed. All elite English league football fixtures have been postponed until at least 3 April because of the virus. The Welsh Rugby Union said despite medical advice it was in the best interests of fans, players and staff ""to fall in line"" with other sports. It came hours after it insisted the game in Cardiff was going ahead. The WRU said it maintained an ""open dialogue with"" and continued to seek advice and direction from the Welsh Government, other stakeholders, including the Six Nations ""on this fast-moving issue"". It said it hoped to make further announcements about rescheduling the fixture in the coming days. ""Every effort has been made to stage this game and we appreciate that individuals will have been inconvenienced,"" it said. ""Given the fluid and unprecedented nature of this issue a postponement became the only viable option."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

First Minister Mark Drakefordtweeted,externalsaying he could understand the decision. Earlier, a Conservative MP said holding the match was ""just not clever"". Ahead of the U-turn, Brecon and Radnorshire Conservative MP Fay Jones tweeted: ""I was super excited about going to #WALvSCO but I won't be going. The Premier League is suspended and no other 6 Nations fixtures are going ahead. No one loves the rugby more than me but it's just not clever."" Matt Hamon, a Scotland fan on his stag weekend, said: ""I can understand why it was cancelled but it should have been cancelled yesterday or not at all.""

Friends Valerie Barbour, from Edinburgh (left) and Lorraine Daye, from Tonyrefail, have been meeting up for Six Nations games since the 1970s Plaid Cymru, which has cancelled its spring conference for the following weekend, had already called for the match to be postponed. Leader Adam Price said ""all mass gatherings"" should be postponed or cancelled, adding that the ""safety"" of vulnerable and ""at risk"" citizens should be ""put before everything else"". EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate HEALTH MYTHS:The fake advice you should ignore MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Asked about postponing the match at a briefing on Thursday, Mr Gething said there wasn't public health advice available which said it was right thing to do for the public to cancel larger scale events. ""It's really clear and really important that ministers are making choices that are guided by the best possible evidence and scientific advice and the challenge about larger events, is that the science doesn't tell us so that  really makes a difference either in significantly delaying the peak of the outbreak or in terms of saving life."" Mr Gething, who had said he was going to the Six Nations match with his brother, said they would be ""actively considering"" a decision next week about the impact of big events on emergency services, like police, ambulance and St John, so they could be available for preparing for a more significant stage of the outbreak. Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, told the BBC Radio Four's Today programme that mass gatherings have some impact but people were more likely to get infected by close family members, friends or contacts. ""It's eye-catching to say stop those [big events] it's not actually a big impact on the transmission, not to say that we won't do at some point, but it's not the most important thing to get in place first,"" he said. Asked about the match in Cardiff, Sir Patrick said: ""I think it's more likely that they'll be transmission in pubs and other areas where people are aggregating, watching it than in the actual stadium itself."" Latest map showing positive tests across Wales Meanwhile, PHW reported 13 new cases, taking the total to 38, including first cases in Anglesey and Flintshire. Four more in Caerphilly county Two in Swansea A first positive test in both Anglesey and Flintshire One each in Cardiff, Carmarthenshire, Monmouthshire, Newport and Powys A total of 945 people have now been tested. ""All patients are being managed in clinically appropriate settings based on the assessment of a specialist infectious disease consultant,"" said Dr Robin Howe,Â PHW incident director. People with symptoms of a new cough or fever are being asked to self-isolate for seven days as part of an escalated response to the coronavirus. The advice came into effect on Fridayas Wales moves to a delay phase, beyond the original contain phase. Coronavirus: What is it like to self-isolate? People with fever or cough told to self-isolate Can you stop people stockpiling? What is the 'delay' stage of the UK's plans? Wales' chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton said the challenge was to prepare for a significant number of cases in the coming months. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""Our NHS is working hard to treat those people who have been confirmed with coronavirus while also dealing with the normal routine and emergency healthcare needs of the Welsh population. Staff are doing a fantastic job and we thank them for their hard work.

"This video can not be played What is the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme? A report into a green energy scheme that contributed to the collapse of Northern Ireland's government in 2017 is due to be published later. The findings of the inquiry into the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme will be outlined at Stormont. The scheme was set up to encourage the use of renewable energy sources, but it closed to new entrants in 2016 amid concerns about the potential cost. A public inquiry into the scheme was set up in 2017, led by a retired judge. Forty eight individuals and organisations have been given advance warning that they will face criticism in the findings. What is the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme? Renewable Heat Incentive scheme: Timeline of events RHI crisis: Who's who in heating scheme scandal? The key questions from the RHI inquiry When the report is published on Friday, much of the media focus will be on what it says about Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster and other party figures. The fall-out from the RHI scheme contributed to the collapse of Stormont in 2017 Mrs Foster was the minister in the Enterprise Department that was responsible for the botched green energy scheme.Her party was in a confidence-and-supply arrangement with Theresa May's Conservative governmentfrom June 2017 until December 2019. It was alleged, during the RHI inquiry, thatDUP special advisers conspired to delay cost controls in the lucrative scheme. At one point, it was estimated that the overspend on the poorly designed scheme could be up to Â£700m over 20 years - to be paid from Stormont funds. Scheme changes and deep cuts to subsidies eliminated that risk, but the debacle still cost Stormont about Â£30m. This video can not be played Highlights of the inquiry into the RHI scheme Another focus of the report will be the competence of the Northern Ireland Civil Service which was responsible for the design and governance of the project. The inquiry findings are the culmination of more than three years of work by a team led by Sir Patrick Coghlin. They looked at the design, operation and closure of the RHI scheme, that was set up by the Northern Ireland Executive in 2012. Timeline: Renewable Heat Incentive scandal RHI Inquiry: Day-by-day reports Design flaws, oversight arrangements, poor governance, confusion over the budget and allegations of fraud and greed were all aired. There was the mistaken belief that London was paying the bill, not Stormont. There were also claims that information, inappropriately shared from inside government, led to a massive spike in applications to beat proposed subsidy cuts.  Â£30mThe amount Stormont had to pay to cover the actual overspend Â£490-700mCost of 20-year projected overspend before RHI was reformed Â£38,000Average cost of the most popular-sized RHI boiler Â£23,000Average annual subsidy payment per boiler before tariff cuts Â£2,000Average annual subsidy payment after tariff cuts 2,128Total number of RHI boilers in NI, many in poultry industry The scheme paid 1,200 businesses to switch from oil and gas to what was meant to be environmentally friendly heating, using wood pellet boilers. Some businesses put in multiple boilers. But the subsidy payment was higher than the cost of the fuel, creating an incentive to use the boilers to generate income. It became known as ""cash for ash"" and a lack of cost controls meant it threatened a massive overspend on the Stormont budget. Thefinancial scandal led to the collapse of Northern Ireland's political institutions in 2017and caused a three-year political stalemate. The political institutions were only reinstated in January 2020. The inquiry panel is made of up of Sir Patrick Coghlin (centre), Dame Una O'Brien and Dr Keith MacLean The inquiry took evidence from high-profile politicians, civil servants and consultants who designed the scheme, and administrators who ran it. Its findings will address whether people involved acted professionally and ethically and whether their behaviour was compliant with codes of conduct for ministers, advisers and others in public life. It is likely to be critical of the power exercised by unelected special advisers or Spads; the level of ministerial scrutiny of RHI policy; the fact that a whistleblower was ignored; the vigorous promotion of the scheme by the Agriculture Department at a time when the Enterprise Department was trying to rein in spending; and a lack of rigour, transparency and accountability in the policy-making process. The RHI scheme caused huge public controversy in 2016 following a claim that a business was being paid Â£1m over 20 years to heat an empty shed. That allegation was never proven. Schemeparticipants say the subsidy cuts implemented were totally disproportionate.They have brought average annual payments for the most common boilers down from Â£23,000 to Â£2,200. That has led to tens of millions of pounds of unspent budget for support of renewable heat in Northern Ireland being returned to the Treasury. Boiler owners are set to go to court in the summer to challenge the tariff changes. The Renewable Heat scheme was closed to new claimants in February 2016. TheNew Decade New Approach,externaldeal, that restored the Stormont institutions in January, recommended it be shut down completely and an entirely new scheme be established.

"The RHI scheme paid businesses to switch from oil and gas to environmentally-friendly heating Corrupt or malicious activity was not the cause of what went wrong with Northern Ireland's failed energy scheme. Thefindings into the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI),externalscheme were published on Friday. It found the scheme was a ""project too far"" for the NI Executive and ""should never have been adopted"". The scheme, which opened in 2012, paid businesses to switch from oil and gas to environmentally-friendly heating. The 656-page report said that while there was ""unacceptable"" behaviour by some officials, ministers and special advisers, what went wrong was a ""compounding of errors and omissions over time and a failure of attention"". Set up to encourage the use of renewable energy sources, the RHI closed to new entrants in 2016 amid concerns about the potential cost. Those boilers used wood pellets, but the subsidy payment was higher than the cost of the fuel, creating an incentive to use the boilers to generate income. It became known as ""cash for ash"". Key findings from the inquiry The scheme was introduced by then Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster. Following the report's publication, Mrs Foster, now the first minister, repeated an apology for her ""failings in the implementation"" of the RHI scheme. This video can not be played The scheme was introduced by then Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster She added that she is ""determined to learn from my mistakes and to work to ensure that the mistakes and systematic failures of the past are not repeated"". Finance Minister Conor Murphy said it was now the responsibility of the executive to ""put (the report's) recommendations into action to change the system"". ""We need effective government and we need good practice in terms of our handling of public finances and we need to ensure that an issue such as this... can never arise again,"" the Sinn FÃ©in MLA said. Mrs Foster had told the inquiry that she did not read the regulations before bringing them to the assembly. The inquiry found: ""The minister, in presenting the regulations to the assembly and asking for their approval, should have read them herself. ""Not least because in the inquiry's view to so do is a core part of a minister's job."" This video can not be played RHI behaviour was 'unacceptable' However, it has found that as enterprise minister, Mrs Foster was given inaccurate and misleading information. The report also criticises the arrangement between Mrs Foster and her special advisor (Spad) Andrew Crawford. The RHI report: In full,external Live updates: RHI Inquiry report publication Latest reaction to the RHI report It said the division of responsibility between them for reading and digesting important documents was ""ineffective and led to false reassurance on the part of the minister"". The Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS), and in particular the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI), have come under heavy criticism. The report finds that at the development stage ""insufficient care was taken within DETI to weigh properly the whole-life costs"" of the scheme. This video can not be played The inquiry findings are the culmination of more than three years of work by a team led by Sir Patrick Coghlin A draft regulatory impact assessment presented to Mrs Foster in 2012 ""lacked necessary cost information"". The report noted that at this point she had already been ""incorrectly"" told by officials that the scheme provided ""the highest renewable heat output at the best value"". The lack of record keeping was also highlighted. It emerged during the inquiry that many meetings had not been minuted by civil servants. ""Basic administration and record keeping, normally the bedrock of the Civil Service, was on too many occasions lacking within DETI,"" it said. ""This contributed to uncertainty as to what discussions had actually taken place."" The RHI scheme paid 1,200 businesses to switch from oil and gas to what was meant to be environmentally-friendly heating, using wood pellet boilers. Some businesses put in multiple boilers. But the subsidy payment was higher than the cost of the fuel, creating an incentive to use the boilers to generate income.

The financial scandal led to thecollapse of Northern Ireland's political institutions in 2017and caused a three-year political stalemate. The political institutions were only reinstated in January 2020. A public inquiry into the scheme was set up in 2017. It took evidence from high-profile politicians, civil servants and consultants who designed the scheme as well as administrators who ran it. Further criticism of the NICS said that having embarked on the RHI scheme, DETI did not ensure that ""adequate resources and expertise were applied to its development"". ""Those junior civil servants responsible for the scheme day-to-day, no matter how hardworking and well-intentioned, were consistently under resourced. ""They were not equipped with the necessary expertise, nor adequately supported."" A ""wholesale and uncoordinated changeover of staff"" who had knowledge of the scheme within DETI should not have been allowed to happen between 2013 and 2014. Renewable Heat Incentive scheme: Timeline of events What is the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme? In 2015, when problems were recognised, the actions of senior civil servants were not good enough to ensure they were identified and addressed. The inquiry also found that the whistleblower who repeatedly contacted DETI with her concerns should have been treated better. The report said there were ""instances of unacceptable behaviour from Spads"" Janette O'Hagan repeatedly contacted DETI between 2013 and 2015 to highlight abuse of the scheme, but her warnings were overlooked. The report said her treatment ""fell well below the standard she was entitled to expect"". It also said there were ""instances of unacceptable behaviour by Spads"", highlighting one who shared confidential government documents, not just about RHI, with family members. Another instance involved a number of Spads and a minister, discussing a plan to disclose information to divert media attention away from their party. The ""unsatisfactory"" relationship between DETI and Ofgem, the scheme's administrator, was also highlighted. The service Ofgem provided to the department ""fell below that standard that DETI could reasonably have expected"". The report said Ofgem had relevant information about scheme exploitation and did not pass this information on. This failure of communication ""deprived DETI of important opportunities to be confronted with or reminded of the problems of the scheme"". Ultimately the report finds that ""responsibility for what went wrong lay not just with one individual or group but with a broad range or persons and organisations involved"". ""There were repeated missed opportunities to identify and correct, to seek or have others correct, the flaws in the scheme. ""The sad reality is, that in addition to a significant number of individual shortcomings, the very governance, management and communication systems, which in these circumstances should have provided early warning of impending problems and fail safes against such problems, proved inadequate.""

" By Gareth Evans  The two colleagues knocked tentatively on the front door. Julia and Tawni, who worked at a beauty store in downtown Idaho Falls, hoped their friend would answer. Angie Dodge had failed to show up for her shift and, after their calls went unanswered, they had rushed to check on her. Angie’s apartment was on the upstairs floor of a faded wood-paneled building, on a quiet street in the north of the city. It was a hot day in June and the roof above the front porch provided some welcome shade. There was no answer so the girls let themselves in. They called out for Angie but heard nothing back. Two bags of rubbish sat next to the stove and, on the outside decking area just off the kitchen, a filled ashtray and some plastic cups were evidence of a small gathering the night before. They made their way down the hallway and checked the living room. Still nothing. Then they headed for the bedroom at the back of the apartment. That was where they found her body. Angie was lying on the floor with her head up against the wall, next to a mattress that was covered with a blood-stained sheet. Her hands were by her sides and the carpet beneath her was soaked through with blood. She had been raped and stabbed to death. There was a large cut across her throat and more than a dozen puncture wounds on her body. There was no sign of forced entry in the apartment but there were signs of a struggle. The police concluded that Angie had been killed between 00:45 and 11:15 on Thursday 13 June 1996. They took away her bedding and clothing for testing and also collected a sample of the killer’s DNA. “It was a very good one,'' said Dr Greg Hampikian, a leading DNA expert who worked on the case. “There was a neat semen sample taken directly from the victim's body. It was a really good sample. A pristine profile.” This would prove crucial later on. The previous evening, less than twelve hours before she was killed, Angie had pulled up outside her mother’s modest, single-storey, house and greeted her with a kiss. Carol Dodge held her close. The pair had argued, as they sometimes did, but they quickly made up. “I hadn’t seen her in three weeks,” Dodge said. “She was 18 and wanted to be left to grow up on her own. But when she came over it was like nothing was wrong. It was just normal.” Angie, the youngest of Dodge’s four children and her only daughter, shared many of her mother’s features, including her piercing eyes, blonde hair and, according to those who knew them both well, her stubborn and straight-talking nature. “She didn’t put up with people’s crap,” her best friend, Jessica Martinez, said. ”She was very smart and one of the only people in our group to graduate high school.” Angie had recently split from her boyfriend and, a few weeks earlier, had moved into her first apartment. ""She told me it was so hard growing up,” Dodge said. “She just put her head on my shoulder and we kinda just rocked back and forth.” It was still warm outside when Angie said goodbye to her mother and headed for her car. “She threw me a kiss when she coasted out of the driveway,” Dodge said. “Her last words to me were ‘I love you’. I just had no idea what was about to happen.” “I look at it now as a God-given moment. And I’m so grateful that we got to have it.” With its largely white, churchgoing, population, Idaho Falls is a typical city for this part of the western US. The downtown area is a mismatched spread of modern drive-thru joints and car dealerships. In the summer, bus-loads of tourists pass through on their way to Yellowstone National Park. The Snake River, flanked by two pristine trails, meanders through the centre of town before it drifts out into the vast plains of southern Idaho. Christopher Tapp was down by the river when he heard about the murder. A 19-year-old high school drop-out, he was with a group of teenagers known as the River Rats. They were a familiar sight in Idaho Falls, and would spend entire summers joking and drinking by the water’s edge.  Word of the killing had spread quickly, from the worshippers in the glistening Mormon temple to the inhabitants of the myriad one-storey wooden houses, and eventually down to the boat docks, where the River Rats spoke in hushed tones. They knew Angie Dodge well: she was a regular down at the river. Her killing left them with more questions than answers. Who could have done this? And why would they target Angie? In a small town like Idaho Falls, where crime was low and everyone knew one another by name, the murder of a teenage girl was unheard of. But for Tapp, who was drifting between jobs, the murder simply marked another talking point in a long and aimless summer. “I know this might sound bad, but it was just one of those things that happened.” Yet that stifling summer’s day when he was first told about the killing would stay with him forever. “That was pretty much when everything started,” he said. The Idaho Falls Police Department pursued a theory that more than one person was involved in Angie Dodge’s killing. They took DNA samples from dozens of men, including the River Rats, but none came back as a match. The department, which was not accustomed to investigating such a complex and high-profile homicide, appeared overwhelmed by the case. Six months after Angie’s killing there were still no clear leads and frustration was starting to build. “It makes you wonder what they’re doing, if they’re doing anything,” Carol Dodge told the Idaho Statesman at the time. “They’re just not qualified. These detectives are street cops that have been promoted.” “What do we do? Where do we go?” she said. “I can’t think of what to do.” But she soon had an idea. Dodge, a broad woman with a frank way of speaking, distributed thousands of fliers offering a $5,000 reward for tips. When little came of this, she took to patrolling the streets until the early hours and asking anyone who would listen if they had information about her daughter’s death. Dodge would often barge into the local police station unannounced and demand to know what the department was doing to find Angie’s killer. This was not always welcome. The rear door of the building was jokingly renamed the ‘Carol door’ by officers due to her frequent guest appearances. “I would just march right in there where the detectives were, and they’d be sat with their feet up on the desk, and I’d ask them who they’d talked to and what they were doing to solve the murder,” Dodge said. “I’d say: ‘Well you just sit right there, because I’m going out tonight.’ They would just laugh at me. They called me a crazy grieving mother.” Angie’s family was frustrated and wanted answers. The press headlines, too, remained critical of the police department. Months went by until one man was dragged into their investigation. January 1997, seven months after the murder of Angie Dodge. In neighbouring Nevada, Christopher Tapp’s best friend, Benjamin Hobbs, was arrested for raping a woman at knifepoint. Investigators thought this crime resembled the killing of Angie. Hobbs, who was from Idaho Falls and knew her well, became their number one suspect. The police tried to build a case around him and Tapp was asked to come in for questioning. “I instantly said: I don't know anything. I can’t help you. I have no idea what you guys are talking about’,” Tapp said. He told them he had been with a girl on the night Angie was murdered. But the detectives, who had initially just wanted to ask him about Hobbs, came to believe both men had been involved in the killing. They wanted to see if Tapp had any information implicating his friend, although Tapp continued to deny all knowledge of the crime. Tapp trusted the police officers - one of them had worked at his high school - and so he continued to co-operate. Over three weeks, he was interrogated nine times and forced to take seven lie detector tests. His lawyers would later say that he spent more than 100 hours under intense police questioning. Video of those interrogations show an exhausted Tapp, his boyish face in his hands, crying and barely able to speak. “I was broken,” Tapp said years later. “There is no other way to explain it. I was just broken and confused and scared. I just wanted to get away from them.” The detectives offered him full immunity - meaning he could not be jailed - as long as he told the truth. When he continued to deny all knowledge of the crime he was told by a polygraph examiner he was failing the tests. “The machine never lies,” the examiner said. He told investigators what he thought they wanted to hear. He said Hobbs had murdered Dodge. Then, after further polygraphs and interrogations, and after one detective threatened him with the “gas chamber”, he said he had been in the apartment with Hobbs when Angie was killed. He told six different stories. “I just gave them whatever information they wanted because I thought it would get me out of the situation,” Tapp said. But there was a problem. DNA tests on Tapp and Hobbs came back negative - it was not their semen at the crime scene. The detectives, now on the back foot, suggested a third man may have been involved. Tapp implicated another friend, a man called Jeremy Sargis, but his DNA test was also negative. The detectives claimed Tapp had been untruthful and voided his immunity agreement completely. During a polygraph test on 30 January 1997, Tapp denied eight times that he had stabbed Angie Dodge. The police told him he was facing the death penalty and could get a more lenient sentence if he said he had feared for his life during the attack. Tapp was told he needed to admit this to save his life. After this apparent admission, Tapp asked how he had performed and the detective shook his hand. Hobbs and Sargis were both released, but Tapp, to his surprise, and despite the fact that no physical evidence linked him to the scene, was charged with murder and rape. “I tried to save myself and just continued to put myself further and further down the rabbit hole,” he said. “Then they actually charged me. It was heartbreaking. I knew that this might be the end.”  The trial began in May 1998. Tapp, who arrived wearing a baggy navy blue suit and matching tie, maintained his innocence throughout. He said his confession was coerced and his DNA test proved he wasn’t the killer. “The hardest thing was watching my mother sit there while people looked at me like I was a monster,” he said. “Everybody was watching the news reports,” said Vicki Smith, the court bailiff who worked the trial. “But I looked at Chris and his behaviour, and I looked at his attorney, and I just felt like things weren’t - I can't explain it - it just didn't feel normal.” The defence tried to get Tapp’s confession thrown out, but the judge refused and it was admitted as evidence. As well as the confession, the police introduced the testimony of a young woman named Destiny Osborne who said she had heard Tapp talking about the killing at a party. She would later retract this statement and allege that the police had pressured her to testify. It took the jury a little more than 13 hours to find Tapp guilty of first-degree murder, rape, and the use of a deadly weapon in the commission of a felony. When the unanimous verdict was read out, Tapp fell to his chair and held his head in his hands. “There was a humongous picture of me in the newspapers and you can see me with tears in my eyes,” he said. “It was heartbreaking to know that I was going to go to prison and that might be the end of me.” Tapp was sentenced to life in prison. “One thing that I never really talk about is the fact that they asked for the death sentence,” he said. “They actually asked to kill me.” Following the verdict, Vicki Smith escorted the jurors out of the courtroom. “Two of them collapsed on the floor and were crying and sobbing,” she said. “I think the look on Chris’s face, the fact he was crying, and the fact he was so young was overwhelming for them. I don’t think they wanted to find him guilty, but there was nothing in the trial that proved he was innocent.” Carol Dodge, the victim’s mother, glared at Tapp throughout. She stormed out after the verdict and threw her hands into the air in frustration as she passed rows of cameras and reporters. After all, there was no physical evidence linking Tapp to the scene and he didn’t match the DNA found on her daughter’s body. “I believed the investigators when they told me that there was another person who left the DNA,” she said. “I was so angry at Chris for not giving that person up. I couldn’t understand why he wouldn’t just give us the name.” “Before the trial, I wrote him a letter when he was in prison and I said: ‘Chris, I don’t know why you won’t give up the name of this other person.’ I was so angry at him.” Nearly two years after Angie Dodge was murdered, Tapp was sent to prison and the case went cold. But Carol Dodge was determined to find who left the DNA at the crime scene. “I wasn’t going to go away,” she said. “I was driven to find justice for my daughter.” Nothing came of Dodge’s early efforts to find the other person involved in Angie’s murder. Tapp, meanwhile, spent years in a maximum-security jail, first in Kuna, Idaho, and then in Texas, and had little hope of getting out. His lawyers filed appeals based on different aspects of his trial but none was successful. The case came to a standstill: Dodge was desperate to find the DNA match and Tapp was desperate to get out of prison. Neither outcome seemed likely. In 2009, more than a decade after Angie’s death, the killer’s DNA was entered into a national crime database but there was still no match. A few years later, Dodge was gifted a computer for Christmas. There was little doubt what she would use it for. “I was always looking on there for ways that I could solve my daughter’s murder case,” she said. She found a company in Florida that could identify the race of a DNA sample, and the police agreed to the test. The result found the unknown person was 85% Caucasian. “That cut down on a lot of leads,” she said. But this wasn’t enough. Dodge knew she had to get the attention of some well-known experts. “I knew something wasn’t right so I really started to study DNA. I spent hours and hours, sometimes whole nights, researching it.” She eventually came across Dr Greg Hampikian, one of the country’s leading forensic DNA experts. He had founded the Idaho Innocence Project, which works to correct and prevent wrongful convictions. Hampikian was already well aware of the case. Tapp had written to the Idaho Innocence Project from prison a few years prior to beg them to investigate his conviction. “I didn’t kill or hurt anyone and I never raped anyone,” his letter said. “Please look into my case. I truly need someone to help get me free.” “I asked one of my interns to look at the interrogation tapes,” he said. “She called me up, almost crying with excitement, and said: ‘This guy’s innocent. They fed him everything.’ So we took the case.” It was the first time a victim's family had worked with an innocence organisation anywhere in the US. By then, there had been huge advances in DNA technology. With help from Hampikian, Dodge pushed the Idaho Falls Police Department to try something called familial DNA testing. This involved looking at the database of convicted offenders in Idaho for anyone who might be related to Angie’s killer. After two years of legal wrangling, the state refused to allow access to its criminal database for this kind of testing. So Hampikian came up with a more radical idea. He suggested uploading the crime scene sample to public databases, such as those owned by Ancestry.com. Crucially, the police were on board with this plan. “We were pushing hard. Carol was pushing hard,” Hampikian said. But it initially proved to be another source of frustration. One database threw up a compelling suspect - a filmmaker from New Orleans. He had visited Idaho Falls in 1996 and had even made a short film about the violent murder of a young girl. But DNA tests came back negative and the police were back to square one. Despite this, investigators in Idaho Falls weren’t ready to give up on this new method. In fact, they were more determined than ever. Carol Dodge, meanwhile, was confused. She was desperate to find a match to the DNA at the crime scene but she wasn’t ready to accept that Tapp was innocent. The prosecutors may have been right, she thought. Perhaps he had killed Angie with someone else and was afraid to give that person up. “I believed for so many years that Chris was part of Angie’s killing,” she said. “They had me convinced that he didn’t act alone. But my mind changed after I sat down and listened to the confession tapes.” A local newspaper, the Post Register, had obtained the tapes through the Freedom of Information Act and shared them with Dodge. There were more than 25 hours of footage, all on VHS tapes, with terrible sound quality and no subtitles. Still, Dodge was blown away by what she saw. “I probably had those tapes for years before I actually sat down and went through them,” she said. “But when I did I got so mad at [the police] because they’d ask Chris a question and then they’d answer it for him.” The tapes left Dodge with major doubts about whether Tapp had killed her daughter. She contacted false confession experts so she could fully understand what she had watched.  Among them was Michael Heavey, a retired judge who founded Judges for Justice, which works to overturn suspected wrongful convictions. “He spent hundreds of hours going through the tapes and putting it all in perspective for me,” Dodge said. Heavey became convinced Chris Tapp was innocent. He worked for more than two years to prove the confession had been coerced. “It kept jumping out to me that this guy didn’t know anything,” he said. “Chris told six separate stories. He goes from saying he wasn’t there to confessing that he stabbed her. I thought: ‘Why is he constantly changing it?’” Heavey noticed red flags in the police questioning and came to believe Tapp was tricked - even brainwashed - into giving false testimony. “He thought the polygraph was an all-knowing, scientific, instrument that was reading his subconscious and telling him he was at the murder of Angie Dodge. “They manipulated him into believing he was suppressing memories of being at the crime,” Heavey said. At one point, a detective tells him he might have blacked out the memories due to trauma. “There's major league brainwashing and manipulation going on,” Heavey said. “It’s ugly stuff.” The BBC asked an independent false confessions expert to review some of the footage of Tapp’s interrogation. Professor Allison Redlich, from George Mason University in Virginia, shared many of the concerns Judge Heavey and others have raised. “It was very coercive and, frankly, unconstitutional when they threatened him with the death penalty during a polygraph,” she said. Prof Redlich also flagged the sheer length of time that Tapp spent under interrogation as a risk factor. “Certainly longer interrogations with somebody who is innocent can lead to false confessions, because the person's resolve just weakens over time,” she said. “I noticed that [the police] also provided details of the crime to Chris and asked leading questions,” Prof Redlich said. “They showed him pictures of the crime scene, supposedly to jog his memory, and that absolutely should not be done. You can see that he starts to distrust his own memory.” The current Idaho Falls Police chief, Bryce Johnson, recognised mistakes were made in the Tapp interrogation but said the force’s methods had changed since 1996. “Clearly something went wrong there, but there are a lot of differences in terms of what happens today,” he said. He also pointed to a failure on the part of Tapp’s original lawyer. “I don't think you'd find a defence attorney that would allow a client to sit there and talk to the police like that today,” he said. “I just don't think you would.” Watching the tapes left Dodge with a burning question. She now doubted Tapp had killed her daughter, but couldn’t be sure. Then, during dinner one evening, Heavey received a phone call from Tapp and she snapped. “I took the phone outside and I just blasted Chris. “I said: ‘Look, you little son of a bitch, you were either there or you weren’t. Quit playing the frickin’ games. If you were there, my God, you're gonna die if you don't give me the name of who you were with. And if you weren't there, then you better frickin’ start screaming that you weren't.’” Tapp told her he wasn’t. “I think that’s when it all changed,” she said. In a remarkable step, Dodge went public and said she believed that Tapp - who had spent almost two decades in jail for the murder of her daughter - was innocent. “It’s like a film,” she said. “Imagine sitting in your theatre seat thinking: ‘My God what's gonna happen now? What is she doing?’ It’s just crazy.” Carol Dodge’s efforts to rally experts and keep the story in the news meant that by 2016, there was a chorus of criticism aimed at Tapp’s conviction. In May that year, his attorneys filed an appeal. They asserted Tapp’s confession was the result of police coercion and said videos of the polygraphs had been withheld from the original trial. They hoped new DNA samples from Angie’s hands would prove he was not the killer. The team, led by John Thomas, believed they had a strong case. “The Tapp name was synonymous with false confessions and bad attorney work,” he said. “This kid was railroaded.” But their appeal was put on hold when Thomas received a surprise phone call. Under growing pressure from Carol Dodge, the lawyers, and the Idaho Falls community, and with the threat of a lengthy appeals process looming, county prosecutor Daniel Clark offered a deal for Tapp’s release. He would be free, but his convictions would stay on his record and he would be put on parole for at least 10 years. After much deliberation, Tapp turned the deal down because he wanted to prove his innocence through the courts and clear his name. “It was total bravery,” John Thomas said. But then Thomas convinced the prosecutor to agree to another deal: Tapp would lose the rape charge, keep the murder charge and walk free after 20 years in prison. And if the police ever found the real killer, Tapp would be exonerated. Tapp agreed to the deal. “Everyone wanted me to come home totally free,” he said. “But they didn’t understand. That was my opportunity; no more looking over my shoulder, no more lock-down in my cell, no more crappy food in the chow hall.” The guards came for him first thing in the morning. It was 22 March 2017, and it was shaping up to be an unseasonably warm day in Idaho Falls. “Tapp, we need you out here,” one guard called out. “We're gonna take you to court.” Inside the courtroom, Carol Dodge was visibly emotional as she addressed Tapp, who wore a new white button-down shirt and black trousers his mother had brought him. “Go forward without bitterness and without a hardened heart,” she told him. “From this day forward it’s up to you – the path that you choose.” She left the stand and the courtroom stood in silence. Shortly after, following a statement from the judge, Tapp was free. In the lobby, he was met by a throng of national media as well as applause and cries of ‘Freedom!’. “They were all asking me how it feels and if I was ready,” Tapp said. “But the truth is I was ready in 1997.” Dozens of people were waiting outside. “This is it, Chris. Freedom!” Thomas cried, as he held his client’s hand aloft. Tapp, who appeared taken aback by the applause, gave a short statement on the courthouse steps. “I want to prove to everybody that I can be something and do something right,” he said. “I’m thankful for all the time and energy Carol has given me to help me get to this point.” He spent more than an hour hugging and chatting to his supporters. His mother, Vera, offered to take him for pizza. Tapp said he wanted steak instead. A gaggle of reporters followed him to the restaurant. “It was really humiliating,” he said. “They’re holding the cameras and wanting to watch me eat but you don’t get metal utensils in prison. I had to learn how to cut up my food on camera!” “The world had changed,” he said. “Cell phones ruled the world and there was no more physical talking between people. That really bothered me when I first got home. Plus, in my mind I was still a 20-year-old kid, but all my friends had kids, mortgages, and car payments. They had real lives.” Despite this, Tapp was delighted to be free. But he was still a convicted murderer, and the county was keen to emphasise he had not been cleared. “There is not sufficient evidence to prove Tapp is innocent,” prosecutor Daniel Clark said at the time. Carol Dodge, however, was dead set on finding that evidence. “Without finding my daughter’s killer and matching a person to the DNA,” she said, “could we ever prove that Chris wasn’t there?” In summer 2017, the Idaho Falls Police Department got a new police chief, Bryce Johnson. The investigations bureau was also refreshed, and one officer who had been a rookie cop at the time of Angie Dodge’s murder was made its captain. “Shortly after I got here Carol Dodge reached out to me,” Johnson said. “She introduced herself and we spoke a couple of times. She put her arm around me, she told me that she loved me, and I thought, ‘I’m an American police officer, don’t touch me!’” he joked. “But I realised she was sincere. It was clear that she absolutely loved Angie and this story had dominated her life for decades,” he said. “Carol made all of us want to do our best for Angie. She had an immense influence on us.” The department set about finding who had left the DNA sample. New technology - genetic genealogy - was gaining traction in the US. It had been used to snare a suspect in the Golden State Killer case in California, when a man believed to be behind 12 murders and 45 rapes was detained. The method involves comparing DNA evidence found at crime scenes to personal DNA that individuals submit to commercial websites like Ancestry.com. The department made genetic genealogy a central part of its investigation. In late 2018, the police partnered with CeCe Moore, a DNA expert who regularly appeared on big-name TV shows. Moore - with her curly blonde hair and pearly smile - was one of the best-known faces in genetic genealogy. She had cracked cold cases across the country, but turned down the Dodge case over concerns the DNA samples were too degraded. “Then Carol reached out to me,” she said. “She begged me to try and make it work and do everything I could to find her daughter’s killer. I felt a tremendous amount of pressure. I didn’t want to let her down.” In summer 2018, Moore uploaded the DNA to a database called GEDmatch, that allows users of websites like Ancestry.com to compare their results with others. Despite her concerns about the quality of the sample, it worked. She started building genetic networks, that let her see who shared DNA with the unknown suspect. Those matches would then be traced back to a common ancestral couple. This family tree could, in theory, lead Moore to Angie’s killer. Moore soon established the suspect had to be the grandson or great-grandson of a man called Clarence Ussery. Using birth certificates and obituaries, she mapped all his descendants who would have been the right age at the time of Angie’s death in 1996. She narrowed it down to six men - one of whom lived in Idaho. She gave the name to the Idaho Falls Police Department, who then needed to get a DNA sample from him. They tailed the suspect for days. “I told Carol that it was looking good and we were going to be able to find the killer,” Moore said. “I told her: ‘I'm gonna do this, Carol, I'm gonna finally find this guy and you're gonna finally get justice and answers.’” But they would have to wait. In an enormous blow for the new investigation, the results excluded the suspect, his family and all six men Moore had on her list. “I was so sure he had to be in the family,” Moore said. “It was devastating. I had hit a brick wall. It appeared that genetic genealogy might have led me wrong for the first time in my career.” The bad news hit Dodge hard. “I woke up at three o’clock in the morning, drank a Coke, and sat at my kitchen table and started to sob. I said: ‘Angie, I’m so sorry. I’m tired and I don’t know where to go.’ I literally felt her looking down on me and saying: ‘Mom, you’re almost there. You’ve come so far. You can’t stop now.’” Moore went back to the family tree she had built and looked for anything she might have missed. “One thing that had always bothered me was a really early marriage in the family,” she said. “They had split up and there were no recorded children. But I couldn't trace the wife and couldn't find what happened to her. “I wanted to be sure that there wasn't a child born to that marriage that went with her. I knew there was a chance he could have been raised by another man.” They found what they were looking for in a small library in Missouri. Moore’s assistant called to say she had found an obituary for the woman in question. Not only did it say the surname she had taken - Dripps - but it said she had had a son and a grandson. “We looked up the grandson and found that he had been raised with his stepfather’s surname,” Moore said. “His mother had taken him and he never had any contact with the original family. “Then we found that he had lived in Idaho Falls. He didn't just live in Idaho Falls, he had lived there in 1996.” “I started crying,” Moore said. “I was on an aeroplane trying not to make a scene. I just kept thinking about what this would mean to Carol.” Moore held a video call with detectives in Idaho Falls and explained how she had got the new name - Brian Leigh Dripps Sr. “I got choked up for a minute and even they started crying,” she said. “We all just wanted it for Carol. But that's where my work ended and theirs began. Now they had to try and build a case.”  The police researched the name Moore had given them and were stunned by what they found. They discovered Dripps had been interviewed as part of a neighbourhood canvas just five days after Angie’s murder in 1996. Not only that, but an old pawn shop receipt and some utility records showed he had lived opposite her at the time. “It became pretty clear that this might be the person we are looking at,” Johnson said. “At that point the investigation really kicked into hyper-drive.” In May 2019, a major police operation was launched to get a sample of his DNA. Dripps lived in Caldwell, a five-hour drive away on the other side of Idaho. Within the first hour of police watching him, he threw a cigarette butt out of his car window. An officer raced into the road to retrieve it but it was lost among dozens of others as traffic raced by. The police had to watch him for another 24 hours before they got a second chance. On the afternoon of 10 May, detectives saw Dripps discard another cigarette butt out of his car window. As soon as he had driven off, an undercover officer rushed into traffic to recover it. Other officers in plain clothes blocked cars from running over the sample or injuring the detective. It was recovered, and immediately sent for testing. “We had talked to the Idaho State lab and they knew how important this case was to the community,” Johnson said. “They knew Carol and wanted to do their best for her.” The lab stayed open late into the evening and staff worked through the weekend to extract the DNA and compare it with semen and hairs left at the crime scene. After more than two decades and 100 DNA samples, the test came back positive. Dripps was a match. “We were pretty happy about it,” Johnson said. “But we didn’t start partying yet.” The department plotted a second operation to arrest Dripps in Caldwell. They knew he went to a convenience store every day at about 12:00, so the plan was to arrest him on his way out. “But instead of turning left he turned right,” Johnson said. “We drove forever. At one point he went down a dead end road and we wondered if he knew we were behind him.” Eventually, Dripps went into a bank and the detectives stopped him as he left. He agreed to answer some questions and, after an interview that lasted for more than five hours, and after he was presented with the DNA evidence, he asked if he could have a cigarette. “I’m sure you want to get this on tape,” he then said, according to one of the detectives who questioned him. Dripps then confessed to the rape and murder of Angie Dodge and said he acted alone. “You got me dead right on the DNA,” he told the officers. He was charged that night. His trial is set for June 2021 and he has pleaded not guilty. He is facing the death penalty if convicted. It was getting late when Chief Bryce Johnson returned to Idaho Falls. He knew he still had a major job to do, and the first step was to speak to Carol Dodge. “I told her we had a DNA match and the person was in custody,” he said. “It was pretty emotionally overwhelming for her.” But he didn’t tell her the name until the next morning, shortly before a press conference about the arrest. Dozens of members of the Dodge family, as well as CeCe Moore and other experts who had worked on the case, all gathered in a crowded briefing room to hear the news. “I expected five or six people, but there was everybody there,” Johnson said. “We couldn't fit everyone in. Carol had so many people that she had affected over the years that were part of this story.” Then he told her. “Chief Johnson said the new suspect was Brian Leigh Dripps Sr and I practically came off my chair,” Carol said. “I said: ‘Brian Dripps? You’ve got to be shitting me. I begged them to take his DNA at the time and they told me to let them do their jobs. I’m still angry over it. “I’m angry at what they did to me, when they could have solved this case 23 years ago. I’m angry at those two cops who didn’t even write a field report when they spoke to him. “He was right there all along,” Dodge said, as she started to cry. “I sat in front of his house for hours. Right after we buried Angie, I drove over to her apartment just to sit and look at her bedroom window. And I was sitting in front of his house. It was so close but yet so far.” The new evidence prompted Tapp’s legal team to push for a full exoneration. He still had a murder conviction against his name and his lawyer John Thomas wanted this cleared. A motion dismissing all charges was finally granted in July 2019 and Tapp - who had spent more than half his life in prison - was finally declared an innocent man by a judge. Tapp’s friends and supporters, who wore T-shirts emblazoned with ‘We told you so!’ and ‘Innocent’, cheered in the courtroom as the news was delivered. Tapp broke down in tears and his mother, Vera, kissed him on the head. Carol Dodge, meanwhile, wiped tears away from her eyes as the man she had once believed had killed her daughter celebrated his innocence. “I was able to tell my mom that my name is clean,” Tapp said. “That was the most important thing to me in this world. “I’m so thankful and grateful for what everyone has done for me,” he said. “But Carol: she has been like a second mom. If it wasn't for Carol's perseverance and drive then none of this would have ever transpired for me. If she hadn't sat down and watched the interrogation tapes, and seen how bad it was, then none of this would have happened. I’m so in debt to her.” The pair embraced after Tapp was exonerated, a moment two decades in the making. “I was really, really happy for Chris,” Dodge said. “I could see that her mother finally had her son back.” When she reflected on the journey that had led to that moment, Dodge paused and breathed a heavy sigh. Her voice grew louder and more forceful. “My fight was to find my daughter justice,” she said. “Every road I went down somebody tried to put up a barricade or a roadblock. Everywhere I turned somebody said you can’t do this or you can’t do that. I said: just stand back and watch me do it.” Otto Kitsinger/Innocence Project Otto Kitsinger/Innocence Project  Author: Gareth Evans Photography: Niki Chan Wylie Graphic:   Debie Loizou Editor: Roland Hughes Online Producer: James Percy Additional images: Otto Kitsinger/Innocence Project, Alamy ",Positive,1.0
"The RHI scheme paid businesses to switch from oil and gas to environmentally-friendly heating Corrupt or malicious activity was not the cause of what went wrong with Northern Ireland's failed energy scheme. Thefindings into the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI),externalscheme were published on Friday. It found the scheme was a ""project too far"" for the NI Executive and ""should never have been adopted"". The scheme, which opened in 2012, paid businesses to switch from oil and gas to environmentally-friendly heating. The 656-page report said that while there was ""unacceptable"" behaviour by some officials, ministers and special advisers, what went wrong was a ""compounding of errors and omissions over time and a failure of attention"". Set up to encourage the use of renewable energy sources, the RHI closed to new entrants in 2016 amid concerns about the potential cost. Those boilers used wood pellets, but the subsidy payment was higher than the cost of the fuel, creating an incentive to use the boilers to generate income. It became known as ""cash for ash"". Key findings from the inquiry The scheme was introduced by then Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster. Following the report's publication, Mrs Foster, now the first minister, repeated an apology for her ""failings in the implementation"" of the RHI scheme. This video can not be played The scheme was introduced by then Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster She added that she is ""determined to learn from my mistakes and to work to ensure that the mistakes and systematic failures of the past are not repeated"". Finance Minister Conor Murphy said it was now the responsibility of the executive to ""put (the report's) recommendations into action to change the system"". ""We need effective government and we need good practice in terms of our handling of public finances and we need to ensure that an issue such as this... can never arise again,"" the Sinn FÃ©in MLA said. Mrs Foster had told the inquiry that she did not read the regulations before bringing them to the assembly. The inquiry found: ""The minister, in presenting the regulations to the assembly and asking for their approval, should have read them herself. ""Not least because in the inquiry's view to so do is a core part of a minister's job."" This video can not be played RHI behaviour was 'unacceptable' However, it has found that as enterprise minister, Mrs Foster was given inaccurate and misleading information. The report also criticises the arrangement between Mrs Foster and her special advisor (Spad) Andrew Crawford. The RHI report: In full,external Live updates: RHI Inquiry report publication Latest reaction to the RHI report It said the division of responsibility between them for reading and digesting important documents was ""ineffective and led to false reassurance on the part of the minister"". The Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS), and in particular the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI), have come under heavy criticism. The report finds that at the development stage ""insufficient care was taken within DETI to weigh properly the whole-life costs"" of the scheme. This video can not be played The inquiry findings are the culmination of more than three years of work by a team led by Sir Patrick Coghlin A draft regulatory impact assessment presented to Mrs Foster in 2012 ""lacked necessary cost information"". The report noted that at this point she had already been ""incorrectly"" told by officials that the scheme provided ""the highest renewable heat output at the best value"". The lack of record keeping was also highlighted. It emerged during the inquiry that many meetings had not been minuted by civil servants. ""Basic administration and record keeping, normally the bedrock of the Civil Service, was on too many occasions lacking within DETI,"" it said. ""This contributed to uncertainty as to what discussions had actually taken place."" The RHI scheme paid 1,200 businesses to switch from oil and gas to what was meant to be environmentally-friendly heating, using wood pellet boilers. Some businesses put in multiple boilers. But the subsidy payment was higher than the cost of the fuel, creating an incentive to use the boilers to generate income.  Â£30mThe amount Stormont had to pay to cover the actual overspend Â£490-700mCost of 20-year projected overspend before RHI was reformed Â£38,000Average cost of the most popular-sized RHI boiler Â£23,000Average annual subsidy payment per boiler before tariff cuts Â£2,000Average annual subsidy payment after tariff cuts 2,128Total number of RHI boilers in NI, many in poultry industry It became known as ""cash for ash"" and a lack of cost controls meant it threatened a massive overspend on the Stormont budget. The financial scandal led to thecollapse of Northern Ireland's political institutions in 2017and caused a three-year political stalemate. The political institutions were only reinstated in January 2020. A public inquiry into the scheme was set up in 2017. It took evidence from high-profile politicians, civil servants and consultants who designed the scheme as well as administrators who ran it. Further criticism of the NICS said that having embarked on the RHI scheme, DETI did not ensure that ""adequate resources and expertise were applied to its development"". ""Those junior civil servants responsible for the scheme day-to-day, no matter how hardworking and well-intentioned, were consistently under resourced. ""They were not equipped with the necessary expertise, nor adequately supported."" A ""wholesale and uncoordinated changeover of staff"" who had knowledge of the scheme within DETI should not have been allowed to happen between 2013 and 2014. Renewable Heat Incentive scheme: Timeline of events What is the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme? In 2015, when problems were recognised, the actions of senior civil servants were not good enough to ensure they were identified and addressed. The inquiry also found that the whistleblower who repeatedly contacted DETI with her concerns should have been treated better. The report said there were ""instances of unacceptable behaviour from Spads"" Janette O'Hagan repeatedly contacted DETI between 2013 and 2015 to highlight abuse of the scheme, but her warnings were overlooked. The report said her treatment ""fell well below the standard she was entitled to expect"". It also said there were ""instances of unacceptable behaviour by Spads"", highlighting one who shared confidential government documents, not just about RHI, with family members. Another instance involved a number of Spads and a minister, discussing a plan to disclose information to divert media attention away from their party. The ""unsatisfactory"" relationship between DETI and Ofgem, the scheme's administrator, was also highlighted. The service Ofgem provided to the department ""fell below that standard that DETI could reasonably have expected"". The report said Ofgem had relevant information about scheme exploitation and did not pass this information on. This failure of communication ""deprived DETI of important opportunities to be confronted with or reminded of the problems of the scheme"". Ultimately the report finds that ""responsibility for what went wrong lay not just with one individual or group but with a broad range or persons and organisations involved"". ""There were repeated missed opportunities to identify and correct, to seek or have others correct, the flaws in the scheme. ""The sad reality is, that in addition to a significant number of individual shortcomings, the very governance, management and communication systems, which in these circumstances should have provided early warning of impending problems and fail safes against such problems, proved inadequate.""

"Some fans have been seen wearing protective masks at Premier League fixtures Elite football in Britain has been suspended until at least 3 April as a result of the spread of coronavirus. All games in England's Premier League, EFL, Women's Super League and Women's Championship, plus inScotland,WalesandNorthern Ireland,are postponed. The Premier League said play will start on 4 April subject to ""conditions at the time"". But BBC sports editor Dan Roan says resuming on the date is privately deemed ""almost impossible"". FA chairman Greg Clarke is known to have expressed his fear at Friday's emergency meeting that the season may have to be abandoned. England's international friendly matches against Italy on 27 March and Denmark four days later are off. The EFL, which hopes to resume play a day earlier than the Premier League on 3 April, said clubs were also advised to suspend ""non-essential activities"" such as ""player appearances, training ground visits and fan meetings"". The Euro 2020 play-offs have alsomoved closer to being postponedafter Fifa recommended that all impending internationals should be called off. Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic are all scheduled to play their semi-finals on 26 March, with the finals five days later. The suspension comes on a day of widespread sporting postponements worldwide. The London Marathonhas been moved from 26 April to 4 October, with the Manchester and Brighton Marathons also postponed. Uefa haspostponed next week's Champions League and Europa Leaguefixtures. In rugby union, Saturday's Six Nations match betweenWales and Scotlandhas been postponed, as has Sunday's Premiership Cup final betweenSale and Harlequins. Cycling's Giro d'Italia, scheduled to start in Hungary in May,has been called off. England'sTest cricket series in Sri Lankahas been cancelled. Golf's opening major of the year,the Masters, has been postponed. Formula 1 hascalled off the Vietnam Grand Prixon 5 April. Formula E issuspended for two months, affecting races in Paris, Seoul and Jakarta. Will I get a refund if my event is cancelled? Late on Thursday, it was announced Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta had tested positive for the virus, and early on Friday Chelsea striker Callum Hudson-Odoi revealed he had been affected, while Everton say a first-team player has shown symptoms. Earlier this week, several clubs - including Arsenal, Chelsea, Leicester City, Bournemouth, Manchester City, Juventus and Real Madrid - revealed they have either all or some of their playing staff in self-isolation. Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said: ""In this unprecedented situation, we are working closely with our clubs, government, the FA and EFL and can reassure everyone the health and welfare of players, staff and supporters are our priority."" The Premier League said its ""aim is to reschedule the displaced fixtures"", while the Football Association said ""all parties are committed at this time to trying to complete this season's domestic fixture programme"". On Thursday Prime Minister Boris Johnson said suspending major public events such as sporting fixtures was being considered by the government but would be a measure primarily to protect public services, rather than delay the spread. The EFL said: ""This decision has not been taken lightly, but the EFL must prioritise the health and well-being of players, staff and supporters while also acknowledging the government's national efforts in tackling this outbreak."" Football has also been suspended in Italy, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Portugal and the USA. This video can not be played Football suspension 'very worrying' for clubs - Rochdale CEO Dan Roan, BBC sports editor These are deeply worrying times for football - and for world sport - which is having to face up to a period of disruption and dislocation unprecedented in peacetime. Privately, senior football figures admit that resuming the English league season in early April - when the initial suspension will be reviewed - will be almost impossible. Their hope is that next week a decision is taken by Uefa to postpone Euro 2020 for a year, thereby freeing up space in the calendar to reschedule outstanding matches, and complete domestic league seasons across the continent at some stage. The problem is that the outbreak is expected to be at its peak in May and June, so some within the game fear that if the suspension keeps on being extended, the season will have to be abandoned and declared void. This would obviously be a nightmare scenario for the fans of Liverpool and Leeds United, who both stand on the brink of long-awaited glory. But it would also have severe financial ramifications for clubs, players, staff and broadcasters, along with the wider sporting industry. Amid the threat of legal action and demands for refunds from season ticket holders, clubs will now be scrambling to check insurance policies and commercial contracts. This a crisis no one saw coming. And one that leaves a gaping hole in the country's cultural fabric at a tense and troubling time, when many people could do with the welcome distraction that football brings to so many.

" By Gareth Evans  The two colleagues knocked tentatively on the front door. Julia and Tawni, who worked at a beauty store in downtown Idaho Falls, hoped their friend would answer. Angie Dodge had failed to show up for her shift and, after their calls went unanswered, they had rushed to check on her. Angie’s apartment was on the upstairs floor of a faded wood-paneled building, on a quiet street in the north of the city. It was a hot day in June and the roof above the front porch provided some welcome shade. There was no answer so the girls let themselves in. They called out for Angie but heard nothing back. Two bags of rubbish sat next to the stove and, on the outside decking area just off the kitchen, a filled ashtray and some plastic cups were evidence of a small gathering the night before. They made their way down the hallway and checked the living room. Still nothing. Then they headed for the bedroom at the back of the apartment. That was where they found her body. Angie was lying on the floor with her head up against the wall, next to a mattress that was covered with a blood-stained sheet. Her hands were by her sides and the carpet beneath her was soaked through with blood. She had been raped and stabbed to death. There was a large cut across her throat and more than a dozen puncture wounds on her body. There was no sign of forced entry in the apartment but there were signs of a struggle. The police concluded that Angie had been killed between 00:45 and 11:15 on Thursday 13 June 1996. They took away her bedding and clothing for testing and also collected a sample of the killer’s DNA. “It was a very good one,'' said Dr Greg Hampikian, a leading DNA expert who worked on the case. “There was a neat semen sample taken directly from the victim's body. It was a really good sample. A pristine profile.” This would prove crucial later on. The previous evening, less than twelve hours before she was killed, Angie had pulled up outside her mother’s modest, single-storey, house and greeted her with a kiss. Carol Dodge held her close. The pair had argued, as they sometimes did, but they quickly made up. “I hadn’t seen her in three weeks,” Dodge said. “She was 18 and wanted to be left to grow up on her own. But when she came over it was like nothing was wrong. It was just normal.” Angie, the youngest of Dodge’s four children and her only daughter, shared many of her mother’s features, including her piercing eyes, blonde hair and, according to those who knew them both well, her stubborn and straight-talking nature. “She didn’t put up with people’s crap,” her best friend, Jessica Martinez, said. ”She was very smart and one of the only people in our group to graduate high school.” Angie had recently split from her boyfriend and, a few weeks earlier, had moved into her first apartment. ""She told me it was so hard growing up,” Dodge said. “She just put her head on my shoulder and we kinda just rocked back and forth.” It was still warm outside when Angie said goodbye to her mother and headed for her car. “She threw me a kiss when she coasted out of the driveway,” Dodge said. “Her last words to me were ‘I love you’. I just had no idea what was about to happen.” “I look at it now as a God-given moment. And I’m so grateful that we got to have it.” With its largely white, churchgoing, population, Idaho Falls is a typical city for this part of the western US. The downtown area is a mismatched spread of modern drive-thru joints and car dealerships. In the summer, bus-loads of tourists pass through on their way to Yellowstone National Park. The Snake River, flanked by two pristine trails, meanders through the centre of town before it drifts out into the vast plains of southern Idaho. Christopher Tapp was down by the river when he heard about the murder. A 19-year-old high school drop-out, he was with a group of teenagers known as the River Rats. They were a familiar sight in Idaho Falls, and would spend entire summers joking and drinking by the water’s edge.  Word of the killing had spread quickly, from the worshippers in the glistening Mormon temple to the inhabitants of the myriad one-storey wooden houses, and eventually down to the boat docks, where the River Rats spoke in hushed tones. They knew Angie Dodge well: she was a regular down at the river. Her killing left them with more questions than answers. Who could have done this? And why would they target Angie? In a small town like Idaho Falls, where crime was low and everyone knew one another by name, the murder of a teenage girl was unheard of. But for Tapp, who was drifting between jobs, the murder simply marked another talking point in a long and aimless summer. “I know this might sound bad, but it was just one of those things that happened.” Yet that stifling summer’s day when he was first told about the killing would stay with him forever. “That was pretty much when everything started,” he said. The Idaho Falls Police Department pursued a theory that more than one person was involved in Angie Dodge’s killing. They took DNA samples from dozens of men, including the River Rats, but none came back as a match. The department, which was not accustomed to investigating such a complex and high-profile homicide, appeared overwhelmed by the case. Six months after Angie’s killing there were still no clear leads and frustration was starting to build. “It makes you wonder what they’re doing, if they’re doing anything,” Carol Dodge told the Idaho Statesman at the time. “They’re just not qualified. These detectives are street cops that have been promoted.” “What do we do? Where do we go?” she said. “I can’t think of what to do.” But she soon had an idea. Dodge, a broad woman with a frank way of speaking, distributed thousands of fliers offering a $5,000 reward for tips. When little came of this, she took to patrolling the streets until the early hours and asking anyone who would listen if they had information about her daughter’s death. Dodge would often barge into the local police station unannounced and demand to know what the department was doing to find Angie’s killer. This was not always welcome. The rear door of the building was jokingly renamed the ‘Carol door’ by officers due to her frequent guest appearances. “I would just march right in there where the detectives were, and they’d be sat with their feet up on the desk, and I’d ask them who they’d talked to and what they were doing to solve the murder,” Dodge said. “I’d say: ‘Well you just sit right there, because I’m going out tonight.’ They would just laugh at me. They called me a crazy grieving mother.” Angie’s family was frustrated and wanted answers. The press headlines, too, remained critical of the police department. Months went by until one man was dragged into their investigation. January 1997, seven months after the murder of Angie Dodge. In neighbouring Nevada, Christopher Tapp’s best friend, Benjamin Hobbs, was arrested for raping a woman at knifepoint. Investigators thought this crime resembled the killing of Angie. Hobbs, who was from Idaho Falls and knew her well, became their number one suspect. The police tried to build a case around him and Tapp was asked to come in for questioning. “I instantly said: I don't know anything. I can’t help you. I have no idea what you guys are talking about’,” Tapp said. He told them he had been with a girl on the night Angie was murdered. But the detectives, who had initially just wanted to ask him about Hobbs, came to believe both men had been involved in the killing. They wanted to see if Tapp had any information implicating his friend, although Tapp continued to deny all knowledge of the crime. Tapp trusted the police officers - one of them had worked at his high school - and so he continued to co-operate. Over three weeks, he was interrogated nine times and forced to take seven lie detector tests. His lawyers would later say that he spent more than 100 hours under intense police questioning. Video of those interrogations show an exhausted Tapp, his boyish face in his hands, crying and barely able to speak. “I was broken,” Tapp said years later. “There is no other way to explain it. I was just broken and confused and scared. I just wanted to get away from them.” The detectives offered him full immunity - meaning he could not be jailed - as long as he told the truth. When he continued to deny all knowledge of the crime he was told by a polygraph examiner he was failing the tests. “The machine never lies,” the examiner said. He told investigators what he thought they wanted to hear. He said Hobbs had murdered Dodge. Then, after further polygraphs and interrogations, and after one detective threatened him with the “gas chamber”, he said he had been in the apartment with Hobbs when Angie was killed. He told six different stories. “I just gave them whatever information they wanted because I thought it would get me out of the situation,” Tapp said. But there was a problem. DNA tests on Tapp and Hobbs came back negative - it was not their semen at the crime scene. The detectives, now on the back foot, suggested a third man may have been involved. Tapp implicated another friend, a man called Jeremy Sargis, but his DNA test was also negative. The detectives claimed Tapp had been untruthful and voided his immunity agreement completely. During a polygraph test on 30 January 1997, Tapp denied eight times that he had stabbed Angie Dodge. The police told him he was facing the death penalty and could get a more lenient sentence if he said he had feared for his life during the attack. Tapp was told he needed to admit this to save his life. After this apparent admission, Tapp asked how he had performed and the detective shook his hand. Hobbs and Sargis were both released, but Tapp, to his surprise, and despite the fact that no physical evidence linked him to the scene, was charged with murder and rape. “I tried to save myself and just continued to put myself further and further down the rabbit hole,” he said. “Then they actually charged me. It was heartbreaking. I knew that this might be the end.”  The trial began in May 1998. Tapp, who arrived wearing a baggy navy blue suit and matching tie, maintained his innocence throughout. He said his confession was coerced and his DNA test proved he wasn’t the killer. “The hardest thing was watching my mother sit there while people looked at me like I was a monster,” he said. “Everybody was watching the news reports,” said Vicki Smith, the court bailiff who worked the trial. “But I looked at Chris and his behaviour, and I looked at his attorney, and I just felt like things weren’t - I can't explain it - it just didn't feel normal.” The defence tried to get Tapp’s confession thrown out, but the judge refused and it was admitted as evidence. As well as the confession, the police introduced the testimony of a young woman named Destiny Osborne who said she had heard Tapp talking about the killing at a party. She would later retract this statement and allege that the police had pressured her to testify. It took the jury a little more than 13 hours to find Tapp guilty of first-degree murder, rape, and the use of a deadly weapon in the commission of a felony. When the unanimous verdict was read out, Tapp fell to his chair and held his head in his hands. “There was a humongous picture of me in the newspapers and you can see me with tears in my eyes,” he said. “It was heartbreaking to know that I was going to go to prison and that might be the end of me.” Tapp was sentenced to life in prison. “One thing that I never really talk about is the fact that they asked for the death sentence,” he said. “They actually asked to kill me.” Following the verdict, Vicki Smith escorted the jurors out of the courtroom. “Two of them collapsed on the floor and were crying and sobbing,” she said. “I think the look on Chris’s face, the fact he was crying, and the fact he was so young was overwhelming for them. I don’t think they wanted to find him guilty, but there was nothing in the trial that proved he was innocent.” Carol Dodge, the victim’s mother, glared at Tapp throughout. She stormed out after the verdict and threw her hands into the air in frustration as she passed rows of cameras and reporters. After all, there was no physical evidence linking Tapp to the scene and he didn’t match the DNA found on her daughter’s body. “I believed the investigators when they told me that there was another person who left the DNA,” she said. “I was so angry at Chris for not giving that person up. I couldn’t understand why he wouldn’t just give us the name.” “Before the trial, I wrote him a letter when he was in prison and I said: ‘Chris, I don’t know why you won’t give up the name of this other person.’ I was so angry at him.” Nearly two years after Angie Dodge was murdered, Tapp was sent to prison and the case went cold. But Carol Dodge was determined to find who left the DNA at the crime scene. “I wasn’t going to go away,” she said. “I was driven to find justice for my daughter.” Nothing came of Dodge’s early efforts to find the other person involved in Angie’s murder. Tapp, meanwhile, spent years in a maximum-security jail, first in Kuna, Idaho, and then in Texas, and had little hope of getting out. His lawyers filed appeals based on different aspects of his trial but none was successful. The case came to a standstill: Dodge was desperate to find the DNA match and Tapp was desperate to get out of prison. Neither outcome seemed likely. In 2009, more than a decade after Angie’s death, the killer’s DNA was entered into a national crime database but there was still no match. A few years later, Dodge was gifted a computer for Christmas. There was little doubt what she would use it for. “I was always looking on there for ways that I could solve my daughter’s murder case,” she said. She found a company in Florida that could identify the race of a DNA sample, and the police agreed to the test. The result found the unknown person was 85% Caucasian. “That cut down on a lot of leads,” she said. But this wasn’t enough. Dodge knew she had to get the attention of some well-known experts. “I knew something wasn’t right so I really started to study DNA. I spent hours and hours, sometimes whole nights, researching it.” She eventually came across Dr Greg Hampikian, one of the country’s leading forensic DNA experts. He had founded the Idaho Innocence Project, which works to correct and prevent wrongful convictions. Hampikian was already well aware of the case. Tapp had written to the Idaho Innocence Project from prison a few years prior to beg them to investigate his conviction. “I didn’t kill or hurt anyone and I never raped anyone,” his letter said. “Please look into my case. I truly need someone to help get me free.” “I asked one of my interns to look at the interrogation tapes,” he said. “She called me up, almost crying with excitement, and said: ‘This guy’s innocent. They fed him everything.’ So we took the case.” It was the first time a victim's family had worked with an innocence organisation anywhere in the US. By then, there had been huge advances in DNA technology. With help from Hampikian, Dodge pushed the Idaho Falls Police Department to try something called familial DNA testing. This involved looking at the database of convicted offenders in Idaho for anyone who might be related to Angie’s killer. After two years of legal wrangling, the state refused to allow access to its criminal database for this kind of testing. So Hampikian came up with a more radical idea. He suggested uploading the crime scene sample to public databases, such as those owned by Ancestry.com. Crucially, the police were on board with this plan. “We were pushing hard. Carol was pushing hard,” Hampikian said. But it initially proved to be another source of frustration. One database threw up a compelling suspect - a filmmaker from New Orleans. He had visited Idaho Falls in 1996 and had even made a short film about the violent murder of a young girl. But DNA tests came back negative and the police were back to square one. Despite this, investigators in Idaho Falls weren’t ready to give up on this new method. In fact, they were more determined than ever. Carol Dodge, meanwhile, was confused. She was desperate to find a match to the DNA at the crime scene but she wasn’t ready to accept that Tapp was innocent. The prosecutors may have been right, she thought. Perhaps he had killed Angie with someone else and was afraid to give that person up. “I believed for so many years that Chris was part of Angie’s killing,” she said. “They had me convinced that he didn’t act alone. But my mind changed after I sat down and listened to the confession tapes.” A local newspaper, the Post Register, had obtained the tapes through the Freedom of Information Act and shared them with Dodge. There were more than 25 hours of footage, all on VHS tapes, with terrible sound quality and no subtitles. Still, Dodge was blown away by what she saw. “I probably had those tapes for years before I actually sat down and went through them,” she said. “But when I did I got so mad at [the police] because they’d ask Chris a question and then they’d answer it for him.” The tapes left Dodge with major doubts about whether Tapp had killed her daughter. She contacted false confession experts so she could fully understand what she had watched.  Among them was Michael Heavey, a retired judge who founded Judges for Justice, which works to overturn suspected wrongful convictions. “He spent hundreds of hours going through the tapes and putting it all in perspective for me,” Dodge said. Heavey became convinced Chris Tapp was innocent. He worked for more than two years to prove the confession had been coerced. “It kept jumping out to me that this guy didn’t know anything,” he said. “Chris told six separate stories. He goes from saying he wasn’t there to confessing that he stabbed her. I thought: ‘Why is he constantly changing it?’” Heavey noticed red flags in the police questioning and came to believe Tapp was tricked - even brainwashed - into giving false testimony. “He thought the polygraph was an all-knowing, scientific, instrument that was reading his subconscious and telling him he was at the murder of Angie Dodge. “They manipulated him into believing he was suppressing memories of being at the crime,” Heavey said. At one point, a detective tells him he might have blacked out the memories due to trauma. “There's major league brainwashing and manipulation going on,” Heavey said. “It’s ugly stuff.” The BBC asked an independent false confessions expert to review some of the footage of Tapp’s interrogation. Professor Allison Redlich, from George Mason University in Virginia, shared many of the concerns Judge Heavey and others have raised. “It was very coercive and, frankly, unconstitutional when they threatened him with the death penalty during a polygraph,” she said. Prof Redlich also flagged the sheer length of time that Tapp spent under interrogation as a risk factor. “Certainly longer interrogations with somebody who is innocent can lead to false confessions, because the person's resolve just weakens over time,” she said. “I noticed that [the police] also provided details of the crime to Chris and asked leading questions,” Prof Redlich said. “They showed him pictures of the crime scene, supposedly to jog his memory, and that absolutely should not be done. You can see that he starts to distrust his own memory.” The current Idaho Falls Police chief, Bryce Johnson, recognised mistakes were made in the Tapp interrogation but said the force’s methods had changed since 1996. “Clearly something went wrong there, but there are a lot of differences in terms of what happens today,” he said. He also pointed to a failure on the part of Tapp’s original lawyer. “I don't think you'd find a defence attorney that would allow a client to sit there and talk to the police like that today,” he said. “I just don't think you would.” Watching the tapes left Dodge with a burning question. She now doubted Tapp had killed her daughter, but couldn’t be sure. Then, during dinner one evening, Heavey received a phone call from Tapp and she snapped. “I took the phone outside and I just blasted Chris. “I said: ‘Look, you little son of a bitch, you were either there or you weren’t. Quit playing the frickin’ games. If you were there, my God, you're gonna die if you don't give me the name of who you were with. And if you weren't there, then you better frickin’ start screaming that you weren't.’” Tapp told her he wasn’t. “I think that’s when it all changed,” she said. In a remarkable step, Dodge went public and said she believed that Tapp - who had spent almost two decades in jail for the murder of her daughter - was innocent. “It’s like a film,” she said. “Imagine sitting in your theatre seat thinking: ‘My God what's gonna happen now? What is she doing?’ It’s just crazy.” Carol Dodge’s efforts to rally experts and keep the story in the news meant that by 2016, there was a chorus of criticism aimed at Tapp’s conviction. In May that year, his attorneys filed an appeal. They asserted Tapp’s confession was the result of police coercion and said videos of the polygraphs had been withheld from the original trial. They hoped new DNA samples from Angie’s hands would prove he was not the killer. The team, led by John Thomas, believed they had a strong case. “The Tapp name was synonymous with false confessions and bad attorney work,” he said. “This kid was railroaded.” But their appeal was put on hold when Thomas received a surprise phone call. Under growing pressure from Carol Dodge, the lawyers, and the Idaho Falls community, and with the threat of a lengthy appeals process looming, county prosecutor Daniel Clark offered a deal for Tapp’s release. He would be free, but his convictions would stay on his record and he would be put on parole for at least 10 years. After much deliberation, Tapp turned the deal down because he wanted to prove his innocence through the courts and clear his name. “It was total bravery,” John Thomas said. But then Thomas convinced the prosecutor to agree to another deal: Tapp would lose the rape charge, keep the murder charge and walk free after 20 years in prison. And if the police ever found the real killer, Tapp would be exonerated. Tapp agreed to the deal. “Everyone wanted me to come home totally free,” he said. “But they didn’t understand. That was my opportunity; no more looking over my shoulder, no more lock-down in my cell, no more crappy food in the chow hall.” The guards came for him first thing in the morning. It was 22 March 2017, and it was shaping up to be an unseasonably warm day in Idaho Falls. “Tapp, we need you out here,” one guard called out. “We're gonna take you to court.” Inside the courtroom, Carol Dodge was visibly emotional as she addressed Tapp, who wore a new white button-down shirt and black trousers his mother had brought him. “Go forward without bitterness and without a hardened heart,” she told him. “From this day forward it’s up to you – the path that you choose.” She left the stand and the courtroom stood in silence. Shortly after, following a statement from the judge, Tapp was free. In the lobby, he was met by a throng of national media as well as applause and cries of ‘Freedom!’. “They were all asking me how it feels and if I was ready,” Tapp said. “But the truth is I was ready in 1997.” Dozens of people were waiting outside. “This is it, Chris. Freedom!” Thomas cried, as he held his client’s hand aloft. Tapp, who appeared taken aback by the applause, gave a short statement on the courthouse steps. “I want to prove to everybody that I can be something and do something right,” he said. “I’m thankful for all the time and energy Carol has given me to help me get to this point.” He spent more than an hour hugging and chatting to his supporters. His mother, Vera, offered to take him for pizza. Tapp said he wanted steak instead. A gaggle of reporters followed him to the restaurant. “It was really humiliating,” he said. “They’re holding the cameras and wanting to watch me eat but you don’t get metal utensils in prison. I had to learn how to cut up my food on camera!” “The world had changed,” he said. “Cell phones ruled the world and there was no more physical talking between people. That really bothered me when I first got home. Plus, in my mind I was still a 20-year-old kid, but all my friends had kids, mortgages, and car payments. They had real lives.” Despite this, Tapp was delighted to be free. But he was still a convicted murderer, and the county was keen to emphasise he had not been cleared. “There is not sufficient evidence to prove Tapp is innocent,” prosecutor Daniel Clark said at the time. Carol Dodge, however, was dead set on finding that evidence. “Without finding my daughter’s killer and matching a person to the DNA,” she said, “could we ever prove that Chris wasn’t there?” In summer 2017, the Idaho Falls Police Department got a new police chief, Bryce Johnson. The investigations bureau was also refreshed, and one officer who had been a rookie cop at the time of Angie Dodge’s murder was made its captain. “Shortly after I got here Carol Dodge reached out to me,” Johnson said. “She introduced herself and we spoke a couple of times. She put her arm around me, she told me that she loved me, and I thought, ‘I’m an American police officer, don’t touch me!’” he joked. “But I realised she was sincere. It was clear that she absolutely loved Angie and this story had dominated her life for decades,” he said. “Carol made all of us want to do our best for Angie. She had an immense influence on us.” The department set about finding who had left the DNA sample. New technology - genetic genealogy - was gaining traction in the US. It had been used to snare a suspect in the Golden State Killer case in California, when a man believed to be behind 12 murders and 45 rapes was detained. The method involves comparing DNA evidence found at crime scenes to personal DNA that individuals submit to commercial websites like Ancestry.com. The department made genetic genealogy a central part of its investigation. In late 2018, the police partnered with CeCe Moore, a DNA expert who regularly appeared on big-name TV shows. Moore - with her curly blonde hair and pearly smile - was one of the best-known faces in genetic genealogy. She had cracked cold cases across the country, but turned down the Dodge case over concerns the DNA samples were too degraded. “Then Carol reached out to me,” she said. “She begged me to try and make it work and do everything I could to find her daughter’s killer. I felt a tremendous amount of pressure. I didn’t want to let her down.” In summer 2018, Moore uploaded the DNA to a database called GEDmatch, that allows users of websites like Ancestry.com to compare their results with others. Despite her concerns about the quality of the sample, it worked. She started building genetic networks, that let her see who shared DNA with the unknown suspect. Those matches would then be traced back to a common ancestral couple. This family tree could, in theory, lead Moore to Angie’s killer. Moore soon established the suspect had to be the grandson or great-grandson of a man called Clarence Ussery. Using birth certificates and obituaries, she mapped all his descendants who would have been the right age at the time of Angie’s death in 1996. She narrowed it down to six men - one of whom lived in Idaho. She gave the name to the Idaho Falls Police Department, who then needed to get a DNA sample from him. They tailed the suspect for days. “I told Carol that it was looking good and we were going to be able to find the killer,” Moore said. “I told her: ‘I'm gonna do this, Carol, I'm gonna finally find this guy and you're gonna finally get justice and answers.’” But they would have to wait. In an enormous blow for the new investigation, the results excluded the suspect, his family and all six men Moore had on her list. “I was so sure he had to be in the family,” Moore said. “It was devastating. I had hit a brick wall. It appeared that genetic genealogy might have led me wrong for the first time in my career.” The bad news hit Dodge hard. “I woke up at three o’clock in the morning, drank a Coke, and sat at my kitchen table and started to sob. I said: ‘Angie, I’m so sorry. I’m tired and I don’t know where to go.’ I literally felt her looking down on me and saying: ‘Mom, you’re almost there. You’ve come so far. You can’t stop now.’” Moore went back to the family tree she had built and looked for anything she might have missed. “One thing that had always bothered me was a really early marriage in the family,” she said. “They had split up and there were no recorded children. But I couldn't trace the wife and couldn't find what happened to her. “I wanted to be sure that there wasn't a child born to that marriage that went with her. I knew there was a chance he could have been raised by another man.” They found what they were looking for in a small library in Missouri. Moore’s assistant called to say she had found an obituary for the woman in question. Not only did it say the surname she had taken - Dripps - but it said she had had a son and a grandson. “We looked up the grandson and found that he had been raised with his stepfather’s surname,” Moore said. “His mother had taken him and he never had any contact with the original family. “Then we found that he had lived in Idaho Falls. He didn't just live in Idaho Falls, he had lived there in 1996.” “I started crying,” Moore said. “I was on an aeroplane trying not to make a scene. I just kept thinking about what this would mean to Carol.” Moore held a video call with detectives in Idaho Falls and explained how she had got the new name - Brian Leigh Dripps Sr. “I got choked up for a minute and even they started crying,” she said. “We all just wanted it for Carol. But that's where my work ended and theirs began. Now they had to try and build a case.”  The police researched the name Moore had given them and were stunned by what they found. They discovered Dripps had been interviewed as part of a neighbourhood canvas just five days after Angie’s murder in 1996. Not only that, but an old pawn shop receipt and some utility records showed he had lived opposite her at the time. “It became pretty clear that this might be the person we are looking at,” Johnson said. “At that point the investigation really kicked into hyper-drive.” In May 2019, a major police operation was launched to get a sample of his DNA. Dripps lived in Caldwell, a five-hour drive away on the other side of Idaho. Within the first hour of police watching him, he threw a cigarette butt out of his car window. An officer raced into the road to retrieve it but it was lost among dozens of others as traffic raced by. The police had to watch him for another 24 hours before they got a second chance. On the afternoon of 10 May, detectives saw Dripps discard another cigarette butt out of his car window. As soon as he had driven off, an undercover officer rushed into traffic to recover it. Other officers in plain clothes blocked cars from running over the sample or injuring the detective. It was recovered, and immediately sent for testing. “We had talked to the Idaho State lab and they knew how important this case was to the community,” Johnson said. “They knew Carol and wanted to do their best for her.” The lab stayed open late into the evening and staff worked through the weekend to extract the DNA and compare it with semen and hairs left at the crime scene. After more than two decades and 100 DNA samples, the test came back positive. Dripps was a match. “We were pretty happy about it,” Johnson said. “But we didn’t start partying yet.” The department plotted a second operation to arrest Dripps in Caldwell. They knew he went to a convenience store every day at about 12:00, so the plan was to arrest him on his way out. “But instead of turning left he turned right,” Johnson said. “We drove forever. At one point he went down a dead end road and we wondered if he knew we were behind him.” Eventually, Dripps went into a bank and the detectives stopped him as he left. He agreed to answer some questions and, after an interview that lasted for more than five hours, and after he was presented with the DNA evidence, he asked if he could have a cigarette. “I’m sure you want to get this on tape,” he then said, according to one of the detectives who questioned him. Dripps then confessed to the rape and murder of Angie Dodge and said he acted alone. “You got me dead right on the DNA,” he told the officers. He was charged that night. His trial is set for June 2021 and he has pleaded not guilty. He is facing the death penalty if convicted. It was getting late when Chief Bryce Johnson returned to Idaho Falls. He knew he still had a major job to do, and the first step was to speak to Carol Dodge. “I told her we had a DNA match and the person was in custody,” he said. “It was pretty emotionally overwhelming for her.” But he didn’t tell her the name until the next morning, shortly before a press conference about the arrest. Dozens of members of the Dodge family, as well as CeCe Moore and other experts who had worked on the case, all gathered in a crowded briefing room to hear the news. “I expected five or six people, but there was everybody there,” Johnson said. “We couldn't fit everyone in. Carol had so many people that she had affected over the years that were part of this story.” Then he told her. “Chief Johnson said the new suspect was Brian Leigh Dripps Sr and I practically came off my chair,” Carol said. “I said: ‘Brian Dripps? You’ve got to be shitting me. I begged them to take his DNA at the time and they told me to let them do their jobs. I’m still angry over it. “I’m angry at what they did to me, when they could have solved this case 23 years ago. I’m angry at those two cops who didn’t even write a field report when they spoke to him. “He was right there all along,” Dodge said, as she started to cry. “I sat in front of his house for hours. Right after we buried Angie, I drove over to her apartment just to sit and look at her bedroom window. And I was sitting in front of his house. It was so close but yet so far.” The new evidence prompted Tapp’s legal team to push for a full exoneration. He still had a murder conviction against his name and his lawyer John Thomas wanted this cleared. A motion dismissing all charges was finally granted in July 2019 and Tapp - who had spent more than half his life in prison - was finally declared an innocent man by a judge. Tapp’s friends and supporters, who wore T-shirts emblazoned with ‘We told you so!’ and ‘Innocent’, cheered in the courtroom as the news was delivered. Tapp broke down in tears and his mother, Vera, kissed him on the head. Carol Dodge, meanwhile, wiped tears away from her eyes as the man she had once believed had killed her daughter celebrated his innocence. “I was able to tell my mom that my name is clean,” Tapp said. “That was the most important thing to me in this world. “I’m so thankful and grateful for what everyone has done for me,” he said. “But Carol: she has been like a second mom. If it wasn't for Carol's perseverance and drive then none of this would have ever transpired for me. If she hadn't sat down and watched the interrogation tapes, and seen how bad it was, then none of this would have happened. I’m so in debt to her.” The pair embraced after Tapp was exonerated, a moment two decades in the making. “I was really, really happy for Chris,” Dodge said. “I could see that her mother finally had her son back.” When she reflected on the journey that had led to that moment, Dodge paused and breathed a heavy sigh. Her voice grew louder and more forceful. “My fight was to find my daughter justice,” she said. “Every road I went down somebody tried to put up a barricade or a roadblock. Everywhere I turned somebody said you can’t do this or you can’t do that. I said: just stand back and watch me do it.” Otto Kitsinger/Innocence Project Otto Kitsinger/Innocence Project  Author: Gareth Evans Photography: Niki Chan Wylie Graphic:   Debie Loizou Editor: Roland Hughes Online Producer: James Percy Additional images: Otto Kitsinger/Innocence Project, Alamy ",Negative,3.6986544e-06

"Sufra foodbank and community centre said it was struggling to obtain enough supplies Food banks say they have a shortage of basic items because shoppers are stockpiling as fears grow over the spread of coronavirus. London food bank Sufra, which donates 9,540 parcels annually, says the likes of pasta and rice are hard to get. A food bank in Bedfordshire haswarned stockpiling ""will hit the vulnerable"". In Coventry, one food bank said supplies have ""never been so low"" and in Billingham donations have dropped considerably in recent days. Food bank charity The Trussell Trust said it hoped the ""generous public"" would continue donating. ""We're working with our network on how best to support people as the situation unfolds,"" it said. This video can not be played Food banks say they have a shortage of basic items because of coronavirus The North Paddington Foodbank (NPF) in London said its donations were down by 25% meaning it had to spend an additional Â£200 per week to top up supplies. But manager James Quayle said finding supplies has been difficult. ""The items we are trying to purchase may not be available [from supermarkets],"" he said. ""We've been hit quite hard by it to be honest."" Volunteers wear gloves at the North Paddington Foodbank to prevent cross contamination In Coventry, the Queen's Road Baptist Church Food Bank, which has been operating for a decade, usually helps up to 4,000 people each year. Although now is traditionally a quieter time for donations, contingency plans are in place, in the event the virus takes hold. But Graham Carpmail, from the bank, said his fridge is all but empty and supplies have diminished. ""I've never been so low with what we've got to give people,"" he added. Coronavirus: What is it like to self-isolate? Tube driver tests positive for coronavirus Can you stop people stockpiling? On Teesside, the Billingham and Stockton Borough Food Bank said donations had dropped. ""I think we're lower on stock because people have started to stockpile and so don't give as much,"" Jill Coyle, from the bank, said. ""We put [long-life] milk in every bag and we are low. Likewise with juice and squash. ""Sugar and coffee are the other things everybody wants. Coffee is a bit more expensive so we get less of it donated. ""Shops don't donate food as such, but have a basket at the end of the tills so people can shop and donate an item. It's that collection that's been lower."" In Coventry, staff say supplies have ""never been so low"" Back in Paddington, King Anthony Sarkar, a regular food bank user, said he could not manage without it. ""Tinned foods, rice and pasta, everything here makes a meal,"" he said. ""You get a meal all the time."" Mr Quayle said he was concerned they could have to close their doors and run a delivery service only to those in greatest need.

His experience was echoed by Rajesh Makwana, from the Sufra food bank in north-west London, who said 40% of its users are refugees or asylum seekers who rely on the food banks as they are not allowed to work. It has put out anemergency appeal,externalfor donations after receiving fewer items from its collection points at schools, churches and local small businesses. Mr Makwana said they have struggled to buy staple items from their normal outlets as supermarkets ran out of these cheaper items. ""The families we support simply can't afford to panic buy and hoard food, they're already knocking on our door in search of basic supplies,"" he said. Rajesh Makwana says his food bank in Brent was pre-packaging goods into parcels to prevent germs spreading King Anthony Sarkar has been relying on a food bank for the past four years Mr Makwana said the charity had now started rationing things like pasta and toiletries. Like NPF, Sufra is also looking at running a delivery-only service in order to protect volunteers from cross-contamination. ""We want to provide a service but we're struggling on so many fronts,"" he added. The Parson Cross Initiative in Sheffield is planning for a fall off in donations in the coming weeks. The food bank said it was also taking precautions by issuing ""grab bags"" from next week in a bid to cut down on person-to-person contact. Normally, people can have a snack and a drink while they wait. ""Grab bags"" being prepared at one Sheffield food bank to avoid spreading germs The Felix Project in Enfield, London, which collects just-in-date and surplus food from supermarkets and restaurants to distribute to 330 charities and schools, said its warehouses were now short. ""Everyone is scaling back and we've seen a significant drop. It is worrying,"" Damian Conrad said. He was especially concerned for his schools which have a high percentage of pupils relying on a school dinner as their main meal. The Oasis Project in Plymouth is almost empty and has seen a run on its meat, fruit juices and tinned tomatoes. Eunice Halliday said: ""If more people self-isolate and only get statutory sick pay, that's likely to lead to an increase in people needing the food bank.""

"Security experts say a spike in email scams linked to coronavirus is the worst they have seen in years. Cyber-criminals are targeting individuals as well as industries, including aerospace, transport, manufacturing, hospitality, healthcare and insurance. Phishing emails written in English, French, Italian, Japanese, and Turkish languages have been found. The BBC has tracked five of the campaigns. Victims looking for a cure face having personal details stolen Researchers at the cyber-security firm Proofpoint first noticed a strange email being sent to customers in February. The message purported to be from a mysterious doctor claiming to have details about a vaccine being covered up by the Chinese and UK governments. The firm says people who click on the attached document are taken to a spoof webpage designed to harvest login details. It says up to 200,000 of the emails are being sent at a time. ""We have seen 35-plus consecutive days of malicious coronavirus email campaigns, with many using fear to convince victims to click,"" says Sherrod DeGrippo from the company's threat research and detection team. Proofpoint says three to four variations are launched each day. ""It's obvious these campaigns are returning dividends for cyber-criminals,"" says Ms DeGrippo. The best way to see where a link will take you is to hover your mouse cursor over it to reveal the true web address. If it looks dodgy, don't click. HM Revenue and Customs is not trying to give you a Covid-19 tax rebate Researchers at cyber-security firm Mimecast flagged this scam a few weeks ago. On the morning they detected it, they saw more than 200 examples in just a few hours. If a member of the public clicked on ""access your funds now"", it would take them to a fake government webpage, encouraging them to input all their financial and tax information. ""Do not respond to any electronic communication in relation to monies via email,"" says Carl Wearn, head of e-crime at Mimecast. ""And certainly do not click on any links in any related message. This is not how HMRC would advise you of a potential tax refund."" The World Health Organization is being impersonated by many hacking campaigns Hackers pretending to represent the World Health Organization (WHO) claim that an attached document details how recipients can prevent the disease's spread. ""This little measure can save you,"" they claim. But Proofpoint says the attachment doesn't contain any useful advice, and instead infects computers with malicious software called AgentTesla Keylogger. This records every keystroke and sends it to the attackers, a tactic that allows them to monitor their victims' every move online. To avoid this scam, be wary of emails claiming to be from WHO, as they are probably fake. Instead visit its official website or social media channels for the latest advice. Hackers are using fear-mongering tactics to encourge clicks and downloads The subject line reads: Covid-19 - now airborne, increased community transmission. It is designed to look like it's from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It uses one of the organisation's legitimate email addresses, but has in fact been sent via a spoofing tool. Cofense, the cyber-defence provider, first detected the scam and describes it as an example of hackers ""weaponising fear and panic"". It says the link directs victims to a fake Microsoft login page, where people are encouraged to enter their email and password. Then victims are redirected to the real CDC advice page, making it seem even more authentic.  Of course, the hackers now have control of the email account. Cofense says the combination of a ""rather good forgery"" and a ""high stress situation"" make for a potent trap. One way to protect yourself is to enable two-factor authentication, so that you have to enter a code texted or otherwise provided to you, to access your email account. The CDC is not asking for donations in Bitcoin This example was reported to malware experts Kaspersky. The fake CDC email asks for donations to develop a vaccine, and requests payments be made in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The premise is of course ridiculous, but the email address and signature look convincing. Overall, Kaspersky says it has detected more 513 different files with coronavirus in their title, which contain malware. ""We expect the numbers to grow, of course, as the real virus continues to spread,"" says David Emm, principal security researcher at the firm.

"Wall Street shares rallied on Friday after US President Donald Trump declared the coronavirus outbreak a national emergency, freeing up money to fight the spread of the disease. As the president spoke, the three main US indexes jumped more than 9%. Earlier, London's FTSE 100 closed up 2.5%, retreating from an early surge, while other European indexes made similar moves. The rally comes a day after Wall Street suffered its biggest losses since 1987. Investors fear economies could slide into recession as a result of the pandemic, as business is disrupted, events are cancelled and schools in many countries close in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. Many indexes around the world have now fallen more than 20% from their recent highs - a red flag for recession. On Friday, the European Union said it will put in place a package of measures, including a â¬37bn euro (Â£33bn) investment initiative. And German finance minister Olaf Scholz said his country could part-nationalise firms to tackle the crisis. In the US, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said her members would pass a bill that provides paid sick leave, among other aid.  But Republicans and the White House have not said they will support it. US Secretary Steven Mnuchin pledged the US would use ""whatever tools we need"". The national emergency declaration helps speed some kinds of funding to local governments. In an interview with US broadcaster CNBC, he said he believed the coronavirus slowdown would be short-term and said the situation in 1987, when markets dropped some 20%, was a ""much scarier time"". ""This is nothing compared to that,"" he said. Stock markets have been in turmoil in recent weeks with investors deeply concerned about the economic effects of coronavirus. On Thursday, benchmark indexes on Wall Street and in the City of London saw their steepest daily falls since so-called Black Monday in 1987, falling 10%. In France and Germany, indexes lost more than 12%. Those declines came despite actions by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank to support the market. Coronavirus 'could cost millions of tourism jobs' Norwegian to suspend half its staff as virus spreads Eurozone tries to ease coronavirus crisis On Friday, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)prohibited short selling,externalof a raft of shares in Italian and Spanish firms, after a request from authorities in those countries for the action, which is designed to protect that list of companies. The prohibition on short selling came after major falls in Italian and Spanish indexes on Thursday. Short selling is speculation that the price of a stock will go down, and if there are more short sellers than buyers, the price will be pushed down. Firms including football clubs Lazio and Juventus were on the list, as well as luxury car manufacturer Ferrari. The New York branch of the Federal Reserve also said it would speed up its planned purchases of US government debt, in response to ongoing strains in the US bond market. In risky times, investors often look to buy Treasuries, driving prices up and yields lower. But in recent days, yields on many US notes have remained unexpectedly high. Many people's initial reaction to ""the markets"" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money. Yet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet. Read more here.

"Sufra foodbank and community centre said it was struggling to obtain enough supplies Food banks say they have a shortage of basic items because shoppers are stockpiling as fears grow over the spread of coronavirus. London food bank Sufra, which donates 9,540 parcels annually, says the likes of pasta and rice are hard to get. A food bank in Bedfordshire haswarned stockpiling ""will hit the vulnerable"". In Coventry, one food bank said supplies have ""never been so low"" and in Billingham donations have dropped considerably in recent days. Food bank charity The Trussell Trust said it hoped the ""generous public"" would continue donating. ""We're working with our network on how best to support people as the situation unfolds,"" it said. This video can not be played Food banks say they have a shortage of basic items because of coronavirus The North Paddington Foodbank (NPF) in London said its donations were down by 25% meaning it had to spend an additional Â£200 per week to top up supplies. But manager James Quayle said finding supplies has been difficult. ""The items we are trying to purchase may not be available [from supermarkets],"" he said. ""We've been hit quite hard by it to be honest."" Volunteers wear gloves at the North Paddington Foodbank to prevent cross contamination In Coventry, the Queen's Road Baptist Church Food Bank, which has been operating for a decade, usually helps up to 4,000 people each year. Although now is traditionally a quieter time for donations, contingency plans are in place, in the event the virus takes hold. But Graham Carpmail, from the bank, said his fridge is all but empty and supplies have diminished. ""I've never been so low with what we've got to give people,"" he added. Coronavirus: What is it like to self-isolate? Tube driver tests positive for coronavirus Can you stop people stockpiling? On Teesside, the Billingham and Stockton Borough Food Bank said donations had dropped. ""I think we're lower on stock because people have started to stockpile and so don't give as much,"" Jill Coyle, from the bank, said. ""We put [long-life] milk in every bag and we are low. Likewise with juice and squash. ""Sugar and coffee are the other things everybody wants. Coffee is a bit more expensive so we get less of it donated. ""Shops don't donate food as such, but have a basket at the end of the tills so people can shop and donate an item. It's that collection that's been lower."" In Coventry, staff say supplies have ""never been so low"" Back in Paddington, King Anthony Sarkar, a regular food bank user, said he could not manage without it. ""Tinned foods, rice and pasta, everything here makes a meal,"" he said. ""You get a meal all the time."" Mr Quayle said he was concerned they could have to close their doors and run a delivery service only to those in greatest need.

His experience was echoed by Rajesh Makwana, from the Sufra food bank in north-west London, who said 40% of its users are refugees or asylum seekers who rely on the food banks as they are not allowed to work. It has put out anemergency appeal,externalfor donations after receiving fewer items from its collection points at schools, churches and local small businesses. Mr Makwana said they have struggled to buy staple items from their normal outlets as supermarkets ran out of these cheaper items. ""The families we support simply can't afford to panic buy and hoard food, they're already knocking on our door in search of basic supplies,"" he said. Rajesh Makwana says his food bank in Brent was pre-packaging goods into parcels to prevent germs spreading King Anthony Sarkar has been relying on a food bank for the past four years Mr Makwana said the charity had now started rationing things like pasta and toiletries. Like NPF, Sufra is also looking at running a delivery-only service in order to protect volunteers from cross-contamination. ""We want to provide a service but we're struggling on so many fronts,"" he added. The Parson Cross Initiative in Sheffield is planning for a fall off in donations in the coming weeks. The food bank said it was also taking precautions by issuing ""grab bags"" from next week in a bid to cut down on person-to-person contact. Normally, people can have a snack and a drink while they wait. ""Grab bags"" being prepared at one Sheffield food bank to avoid spreading germs The Felix Project in Enfield, London, which collects just-in-date and surplus food from supermarkets and restaurants to distribute to 330 charities and schools, said its warehouses were now short. ""Everyone is scaling back and we've seen a significant drop. It is worrying,"" Damian Conrad said. He was especially concerned for his schools which have a high percentage of pupils relying on a school dinner as their main meal. The Oasis Project in Plymouth is almost empty and has seen a run on its meat, fruit juices and tinned tomatoes. Eunice Halliday said: ""If more people self-isolate and only get statutory sick pay, that's likely to lead to an increase in people needing the food bank.""

"Wall Street shares rallied on Friday after US President Donald Trump declared the coronavirus outbreak a national emergency, freeing up money to fight the spread of the disease. As the president spoke, the three main US indexes jumped more than 9%. Earlier, London's FTSE 100 closed up 2.5%, retreating from an early surge, while other European indexes made similar moves. The rally comes a day after Wall Street suffered its biggest losses since 1987. Investors fear economies could slide into recession as a result of the pandemic, as business is disrupted, events are cancelled and schools in many countries close in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. Many indexes around the world have now fallen more than 20% from their recent highs - a red flag for recession. On Friday, the European Union said it will put in place a package of measures, including a â¬37bn euro (Â£33bn) investment initiative. And German finance minister Olaf Scholz said his country could part-nationalise firms to tackle the crisis. In the US, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said her members would pass a bill that provides paid sick leave, among other aid.  But Republicans and the White House have not said they will support it. US Secretary Steven Mnuchin pledged the US would use ""whatever tools we need"". The national emergency declaration helps speed some kinds of funding to local governments. In an interview with US broadcaster CNBC, he said he believed the coronavirus slowdown would be short-term and said the situation in 1987, when markets dropped some 20%, was a ""much scarier time"". ""This is nothing compared to that,"" he said. Stock markets have been in turmoil in recent weeks with investors deeply concerned about the economic effects of coronavirus. On Thursday, benchmark indexes on Wall Street and in the City of London saw their steepest daily falls since so-called Black Monday in 1987, falling 10%. In France and Germany, indexes lost more than 12%. Those declines came despite actions by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank to support the market. Coronavirus 'could cost millions of tourism jobs' Norwegian to suspend half its staff as virus spreads Eurozone tries to ease coronavirus crisis On Friday, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)prohibited short selling,externalof a raft of shares in Italian and Spanish firms, after a request from authorities in those countries for the action, which is designed to protect that list of companies. The prohibition on short selling came after major falls in Italian and Spanish indexes on Thursday. Short selling is speculation that the price of a stock will go down, and if there are more short sellers than buyers, the price will be pushed down. Firms including football clubs Lazio and Juventus were on the list, as well as luxury car manufacturer Ferrari. The New York branch of the Federal Reserve also said it would speed up its planned purchases of US government debt, in response to ongoing strains in the US bond market. In risky times, investors often look to buy Treasuries, driving prices up and yields lower. But in recent days, yields on many US notes have remained unexpectedly high. Many people's initial reaction to ""the markets"" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money. Yet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet. Read more here.

" By Gareth Evans  The two colleagues knocked tentatively on the front door. Julia and Tawni, who worked at a beauty store in downtown Idaho Falls, hoped their friend would answer. Angie Dodge had failed to show up for her shift and, after their calls went unanswered, they had rushed to check on her. Angie’s apartment was on the upstairs floor of a faded wood-paneled building, on a quiet street in the north of the city. It was a hot day in June and the roof above the front porch provided some welcome shade. There was no answer so the girls let themselves in. They called out for Angie but heard nothing back. Two bags of rubbish sat next to the stove and, on the outside decking area just off the kitchen, a filled ashtray and some plastic cups were evidence of a small gathering the night before. They made their way down the hallway and checked the living room. Still nothing. Then they headed for the bedroom at the back of the apartment. That was where they found her body. Angie was lying on the floor with her head up against the wall, next to a mattress that was covered with a blood-stained sheet. Her hands were by her sides and the carpet beneath her was soaked through with blood. She had been raped and stabbed to death. There was a large cut across her throat and more than a dozen puncture wounds on her body. There was no sign of forced entry in the apartment but there were signs of a struggle. The police concluded that Angie had been killed between 00:45 and 11:15 on Thursday 13 June 1996. They took away her bedding and clothing for testing and also collected a sample of the killer’s DNA. “It was a very good one,'' said Dr Greg Hampikian, a leading DNA expert who worked on the case. “There was a neat semen sample taken directly from the victim's body. It was a really good sample. A pristine profile.” This would prove crucial later on. The previous evening, less than twelve hours before she was killed, Angie had pulled up outside her mother’s modest, single-storey, house and greeted her with a kiss. Carol Dodge held her close. The pair had argued, as they sometimes did, but they quickly made up. “I hadn’t seen her in three weeks,” Dodge said. “She was 18 and wanted to be left to grow up on her own. But when she came over it was like nothing was wrong. It was just normal.” Angie, the youngest of Dodge’s four children and her only daughter, shared many of her mother’s features, including her piercing eyes, blonde hair and, according to those who knew them both well, her stubborn and straight-talking nature. “She didn’t put up with people’s crap,” her best friend, Jessica Martinez, said. ”She was very smart and one of the only people in our group to graduate high school.” Angie had recently split from her boyfriend and, a few weeks earlier, had moved into her first apartment. ""She told me it was so hard growing up,” Dodge said. “She just put her head on my shoulder and we kinda just rocked back and forth.” It was still warm outside when Angie said goodbye to her mother and headed for her car. “She threw me a kiss when she coasted out of the driveway,” Dodge said. “Her last words to me were ‘I love you’. I just had no idea what was about to happen.” “I look at it now as a God-given moment. And I’m so grateful that we got to have it.” With its largely white, churchgoing, population, Idaho Falls is a typical city for this part of the western US. The downtown area is a mismatched spread of modern drive-thru joints and car dealerships. In the summer, bus-loads of tourists pass through on their way to Yellowstone National Park. The Snake River, flanked by two pristine trails, meanders through the centre of town before it drifts out into the vast plains of southern Idaho. Christopher Tapp was down by the river when he heard about the murder. A 19-year-old high school drop-out, he was with a group of teenagers known as the River Rats. They were a familiar sight in Idaho Falls, and would spend entire summers joking and drinking by the water’s edge.  Word of the killing had spread quickly, from the worshippers in the glistening Mormon temple to the inhabitants of the myriad one-storey wooden houses, and eventually down to the boat docks, where the River Rats spoke in hushed tones. They knew Angie Dodge well: she was a regular down at the river. Her killing left them with more questions than answers. Who could have done this? And why would they target Angie? In a small town like Idaho Falls, where crime was low and everyone knew one another by name, the murder of a teenage girl was unheard of. But for Tapp, who was drifting between jobs, the murder simply marked another talking point in a long and aimless summer. “I know this might sound bad, but it was just one of those things that happened.” Yet that stifling summer’s day when he was first told about the killing would stay with him forever. “That was pretty much when everything started,” he said. The Idaho Falls Police Department pursued a theory that more than one person was involved in Angie Dodge’s killing. They took DNA samples from dozens of men, including the River Rats, but none came back as a match. The department, which was not accustomed to investigating such a complex and high-profile homicide, appeared overwhelmed by the case. Six months after Angie’s killing there were still no clear leads and frustration was starting to build. “It makes you wonder what they’re doing, if they’re doing anything,” Carol Dodge told the Idaho Statesman at the time. “They’re just not qualified. These detectives are street cops that have been promoted.” “What do we do? Where do we go?” she said. “I can’t think of what to do.” But she soon had an idea. Dodge, a broad woman with a frank way of speaking, distributed thousands of fliers offering a $5,000 reward for tips. When little came of this, she took to patrolling the streets until the early hours and asking anyone who would listen if they had information about her daughter’s death. Dodge would often barge into the local police station unannounced and demand to know what the department was doing to find Angie’s killer. This was not always welcome. The rear door of the building was jokingly renamed the ‘Carol door’ by officers due to her frequent guest appearances. “I would just march right in there where the detectives were, and they’d be sat with their feet up on the desk, and I’d ask them who they’d talked to and what they were doing to solve the murder,” Dodge said. “I’d say: ‘Well you just sit right there, because I’m going out tonight.’ They would just laugh at me. They called me a crazy grieving mother.” Angie’s family was frustrated and wanted answers. The press headlines, too, remained critical of the police department. Months went by until one man was dragged into their investigation. January 1997, seven months after the murder of Angie Dodge. In neighbouring Nevada, Christopher Tapp’s best friend, Benjamin Hobbs, was arrested for raping a woman at knifepoint. Investigators thought this crime resembled the killing of Angie. Hobbs, who was from Idaho Falls and knew her well, became their number one suspect. The police tried to build a case around him and Tapp was asked to come in for questioning. “I instantly said: I don't know anything. I can’t help you. I have no idea what you guys are talking about’,” Tapp said. He told them he had been with a girl on the night Angie was murdered. But the detectives, who had initially just wanted to ask him about Hobbs, came to believe both men had been involved in the killing. They wanted to see if Tapp had any information implicating his friend, although Tapp continued to deny all knowledge of the crime. Tapp trusted the police officers - one of them had worked at his high school - and so he continued to co-operate. Over three weeks, he was interrogated nine times and forced to take seven lie detector tests. His lawyers would later say that he spent more than 100 hours under intense police questioning. Video of those interrogations show an exhausted Tapp, his boyish face in his hands, crying and barely able to speak. “I was broken,” Tapp said years later. “There is no other way to explain it. I was just broken and confused and scared. I just wanted to get away from them.” The detectives offered him full immunity - meaning he could not be jailed - as long as he told the truth. When he continued to deny all knowledge of the crime he was told by a polygraph examiner he was failing the tests. “The machine never lies,” the examiner said. He told investigators what he thought they wanted to hear. He said Hobbs had murdered Dodge. Then, after further polygraphs and interrogations, and after one detective threatened him with the “gas chamber”, he said he had been in the apartment with Hobbs when Angie was killed. He told six different stories. “I just gave them whatever information they wanted because I thought it would get me out of the situation,” Tapp said. But there was a problem. DNA tests on Tapp and Hobbs came back negative - it was not their semen at the crime scene. The detectives, now on the back foot, suggested a third man may have been involved. Tapp implicated another friend, a man called Jeremy Sargis, but his DNA test was also negative. The detectives claimed Tapp had been untruthful and voided his immunity agreement completely. During a polygraph test on 30 January 1997, Tapp denied eight times that he had stabbed Angie Dodge. The police told him he was facing the death penalty and could get a more lenient sentence if he said he had feared for his life during the attack. Tapp was told he needed to admit this to save his life. After this apparent admission, Tapp asked how he had performed and the detective shook his hand. Hobbs and Sargis were both released, but Tapp, to his surprise, and despite the fact that no physical evidence linked him to the scene, was charged with murder and rape. “I tried to save myself and just continued to put myself further and further down the rabbit hole,” he said. “Then they actually charged me. It was heartbreaking. I knew that this might be the end.”  The trial began in May 1998. Tapp, who arrived wearing a baggy navy blue suit and matching tie, maintained his innocence throughout. He said his confession was coerced and his DNA test proved he wasn’t the killer. “The hardest thing was watching my mother sit there while people looked at me like I was a monster,” he said. “Everybody was watching the news reports,” said Vicki Smith, the court bailiff who worked the trial. “But I looked at Chris and his behaviour, and I looked at his attorney, and I just felt like things weren’t - I can't explain it - it just didn't feel normal.” The defence tried to get Tapp’s confession thrown out, but the judge refused and it was admitted as evidence. As well as the confession, the police introduced the testimony of a young woman named Destiny Osborne who said she had heard Tapp talking about the killing at a party. She would later retract this statement and allege that the police had pressured her to testify. It took the jury a little more than 13 hours to find Tapp guilty of first-degree murder, rape, and the use of a deadly weapon in the commission of a felony. When the unanimous verdict was read out, Tapp fell to his chair and held his head in his hands. “There was a humongous picture of me in the newspapers and you can see me with tears in my eyes,” he said. “It was heartbreaking to know that I was going to go to prison and that might be the end of me.” Tapp was sentenced to life in prison. “One thing that I never really talk about is the fact that they asked for the death sentence,” he said. “They actually asked to kill me.” Following the verdict, Vicki Smith escorted the jurors out of the courtroom. “Two of them collapsed on the floor and were crying and sobbing,” she said. “I think the look on Chris’s face, the fact he was crying, and the fact he was so young was overwhelming for them. I don’t think they wanted to find him guilty, but there was nothing in the trial that proved he was innocent.” Carol Dodge, the victim’s mother, glared at Tapp throughout. She stormed out after the verdict and threw her hands into the air in frustration as she passed rows of cameras and reporters. After all, there was no physical evidence linking Tapp to the scene and he didn’t match the DNA found on her daughter’s body. “I believed the investigators when they told me that there was another person who left the DNA,” she said. “I was so angry at Chris for not giving that person up. I couldn’t understand why he wouldn’t just give us the name.” “Before the trial, I wrote him a letter when he was in prison and I said: ‘Chris, I don’t know why you won’t give up the name of this other person.’ I was so angry at him.” Nearly two years after Angie Dodge was murdered, Tapp was sent to prison and the case went cold. But Carol Dodge was determined to find who left the DNA at the crime scene. “I wasn’t going to go away,” she said. “I was driven to find justice for my daughter.” Nothing came of Dodge’s early efforts to find the other person involved in Angie’s murder. Tapp, meanwhile, spent years in a maximum-security jail, first in Kuna, Idaho, and then in Texas, and had little hope of getting out. His lawyers filed appeals based on different aspects of his trial but none was successful. The case came to a standstill: Dodge was desperate to find the DNA match and Tapp was desperate to get out of prison. Neither outcome seemed likely. In 2009, more than a decade after Angie’s death, the killer’s DNA was entered into a national crime database but there was still no match. A few years later, Dodge was gifted a computer for Christmas. There was little doubt what she would use it for. “I was always looking on there for ways that I could solve my daughter’s murder case,” she said. She found a company in Florida that could identify the race of a DNA sample, and the police agreed to the test. The result found the unknown person was 85% Caucasian. “That cut down on a lot of leads,” she said. But this wasn’t enough. Dodge knew she had to get the attention of some well-known experts. “I knew something wasn’t right so I really started to study DNA. I spent hours and hours, sometimes whole nights, researching it.” She eventually came across Dr Greg Hampikian, one of the country’s leading forensic DNA experts. He had founded the Idaho Innocence Project, which works to correct and prevent wrongful convictions. Hampikian was already well aware of the case. Tapp had written to the Idaho Innocence Project from prison a few years prior to beg them to investigate his conviction. “I didn’t kill or hurt anyone and I never raped anyone,” his letter said. “Please look into my case. I truly need someone to help get me free.” “I asked one of my interns to look at the interrogation tapes,” he said. “She called me up, almost crying with excitement, and said: ‘This guy’s innocent. They fed him everything.’ So we took the case.” It was the first time a victim's family had worked with an innocence organisation anywhere in the US. By then, there had been huge advances in DNA technology. With help from Hampikian, Dodge pushed the Idaho Falls Police Department to try something called familial DNA testing. This involved looking at the database of convicted offenders in Idaho for anyone who might be related to Angie’s killer. After two years of legal wrangling, the state refused to allow access to its criminal database for this kind of testing. So Hampikian came up with a more radical idea. He suggested uploading the crime scene sample to public databases, such as those owned by Ancestry.com. Crucially, the police were on board with this plan. “We were pushing hard. Carol was pushing hard,” Hampikian said. But it initially proved to be another source of frustration. One database threw up a compelling suspect - a filmmaker from New Orleans. He had visited Idaho Falls in 1996 and had even made a short film about the violent murder of a young girl. But DNA tests came back negative and the police were back to square one. Despite this, investigators in Idaho Falls weren’t ready to give up on this new method. In fact, they were more determined than ever. Carol Dodge, meanwhile, was confused. She was desperate to find a match to the DNA at the crime scene but she wasn’t ready to accept that Tapp was innocent. The prosecutors may have been right, she thought. Perhaps he had killed Angie with someone else and was afraid to give that person up. “I believed for so many years that Chris was part of Angie’s killing,” she said. “They had me convinced that he didn’t act alone. But my mind changed after I sat down and listened to the confession tapes.” A local newspaper, the Post Register, had obtained the tapes through the Freedom of Information Act and shared them with Dodge. There were more than 25 hours of footage, all on VHS tapes, with terrible sound quality and no subtitles. Still, Dodge was blown away by what she saw. “I probably had those tapes for years before I actually sat down and went through them,” she said. “But when I did I got so mad at [the police] because they’d ask Chris a question and then they’d answer it for him.” The tapes left Dodge with major doubts about whether Tapp had killed her daughter. She contacted false confession experts so she could fully understand what she had watched.  Among them was Michael Heavey, a retired judge who founded Judges for Justice, which works to overturn suspected wrongful convictions. “He spent hundreds of hours going through the tapes and putting it all in perspective for me,” Dodge said. Heavey became convinced Chris Tapp was innocent. He worked for more than two years to prove the confession had been coerced. “It kept jumping out to me that this guy didn’t know anything,” he said. “Chris told six separate stories. He goes from saying he wasn’t there to confessing that he stabbed her. I thought: ‘Why is he constantly changing it?’” Heavey noticed red flags in the police questioning and came to believe Tapp was tricked - even brainwashed - into giving false testimony. “He thought the polygraph was an all-knowing, scientific, instrument that was reading his subconscious and telling him he was at the murder of Angie Dodge. “They manipulated him into believing he was suppressing memories of being at the crime,” Heavey said. At one point, a detective tells him he might have blacked out the memories due to trauma. “There's major league brainwashing and manipulation going on,” Heavey said. “It’s ugly stuff.” The BBC asked an independent false confessions expert to review some of the footage of Tapp’s interrogation. Professor Allison Redlich, from George Mason University in Virginia, shared many of the concerns Judge Heavey and others have raised. “It was very coercive and, frankly, unconstitutional when they threatened him with the death penalty during a polygraph,” she said. Prof Redlich also flagged the sheer length of time that Tapp spent under interrogation as a risk factor. “Certainly longer interrogations with somebody who is innocent can lead to false confessions, because the person's resolve just weakens over time,” she said. “I noticed that [the police] also provided details of the crime to Chris and asked leading questions,” Prof Redlich said. “They showed him pictures of the crime scene, supposedly to jog his memory, and that absolutely should not be done. You can see that he starts to distrust his own memory.” The current Idaho Falls Police chief, Bryce Johnson, recognised mistakes were made in the Tapp interrogation but said the force’s methods had changed since 1996. “Clearly something went wrong there, but there are a lot of differences in terms of what happens today,” he said. He also pointed to a failure on the part of Tapp’s original lawyer. “I don't think you'd find a defence attorney that would allow a client to sit there and talk to the police like that today,” he said. “I just don't think you would.” Watching the tapes left Dodge with a burning question. She now doubted Tapp had killed her daughter, but couldn’t be sure. Then, during dinner one evening, Heavey received a phone call from Tapp and she snapped. “I took the phone outside and I just blasted Chris. “I said: ‘Look, you little son of a bitch, you were either there or you weren’t. Quit playing the frickin’ games. If you were there, my God, you're gonna die if you don't give me the name of who you were with. And if you weren't there, then you better frickin’ start screaming that you weren't.’” Tapp told her he wasn’t. “I think that’s when it all changed,” she said. In a remarkable step, Dodge went public and said she believed that Tapp - who had spent almost two decades in jail for the murder of her daughter - was innocent. “It’s like a film,” she said. “Imagine sitting in your theatre seat thinking: ‘My God what's gonna happen now? What is she doing?’ It’s just crazy.” Carol Dodge’s efforts to rally experts and keep the story in the news meant that by 2016, there was a chorus of criticism aimed at Tapp’s conviction. In May that year, his attorneys filed an appeal. They asserted Tapp’s confession was the result of police coercion and said videos of the polygraphs had been withheld from the original trial. They hoped new DNA samples from Angie’s hands would prove he was not the killer. The team, led by John Thomas, believed they had a strong case. “The Tapp name was synonymous with false confessions and bad attorney work,” he said. “This kid was railroaded.” But their appeal was put on hold when Thomas received a surprise phone call. Under growing pressure from Carol Dodge, the lawyers, and the Idaho Falls community, and with the threat of a lengthy appeals process looming, county prosecutor Daniel Clark offered a deal for Tapp’s release. He would be free, but his convictions would stay on his record and he would be put on parole for at least 10 years. After much deliberation, Tapp turned the deal down because he wanted to prove his innocence through the courts and clear his name. “It was total bravery,” John Thomas said. But then Thomas convinced the prosecutor to agree to another deal: Tapp would lose the rape charge, keep the murder charge and walk free after 20 years in prison. And if the police ever found the real killer, Tapp would be exonerated. Tapp agreed to the deal. “Everyone wanted me to come home totally free,” he said. “But they didn’t understand. That was my opportunity; no more looking over my shoulder, no more lock-down in my cell, no more crappy food in the chow hall.” The guards came for him first thing in the morning. It was 22 March 2017, and it was shaping up to be an unseasonably warm day in Idaho Falls. “Tapp, we need you out here,” one guard called out. “We're gonna take you to court.” Inside the courtroom, Carol Dodge was visibly emotional as she addressed Tapp, who wore a new white button-down shirt and black trousers his mother had brought him. “Go forward without bitterness and without a hardened heart,” she told him. “From this day forward it’s up to you – the path that you choose.” She left the stand and the courtroom stood in silence. Shortly after, following a statement from the judge, Tapp was free. In the lobby, he was met by a throng of national media as well as applause and cries of ‘Freedom!’. “They were all asking me how it feels and if I was ready,” Tapp said. “But the truth is I was ready in 1997.” Dozens of people were waiting outside. “This is it, Chris. Freedom!” Thomas cried, as he held his client’s hand aloft. Tapp, who appeared taken aback by the applause, gave a short statement on the courthouse steps. “I want to prove to everybody that I can be something and do something right,” he said. “I’m thankful for all the time and energy Carol has given me to help me get to this point.” He spent more than an hour hugging and chatting to his supporters. His mother, Vera, offered to take him for pizza. Tapp said he wanted steak instead. A gaggle of reporters followed him to the restaurant. “It was really humiliating,” he said. “They’re holding the cameras and wanting to watch me eat but you don’t get metal utensils in prison. I had to learn how to cut up my food on camera!” “The world had changed,” he said. “Cell phones ruled the world and there was no more physical talking between people. That really bothered me when I first got home. Plus, in my mind I was still a 20-year-old kid, but all my friends had kids, mortgages, and car payments. They had real lives.” Despite this, Tapp was delighted to be free. But he was still a convicted murderer, and the county was keen to emphasise he had not been cleared. “There is not sufficient evidence to prove Tapp is innocent,” prosecutor Daniel Clark said at the time. Carol Dodge, however, was dead set on finding that evidence. “Without finding my daughter’s killer and matching a person to the DNA,” she said, “could we ever prove that Chris wasn’t there?” In summer 2017, the Idaho Falls Police Department got a new police chief, Bryce Johnson. The investigations bureau was also refreshed, and one officer who had been a rookie cop at the time of Angie Dodge’s murder was made its captain. “Shortly after I got here Carol Dodge reached out to me,” Johnson said. “She introduced herself and we spoke a couple of times. She put her arm around me, she told me that she loved me, and I thought, ‘I’m an American police officer, don’t touch me!’” he joked. “But I realised she was sincere. It was clear that she absolutely loved Angie and this story had dominated her life for decades,” he said. “Carol made all of us want to do our best for Angie. She had an immense influence on us.” The department set about finding who had left the DNA sample. New technology - genetic genealogy - was gaining traction in the US. It had been used to snare a suspect in the Golden State Killer case in California, when a man believed to be behind 12 murders and 45 rapes was detained. The method involves comparing DNA evidence found at crime scenes to personal DNA that individuals submit to commercial websites like Ancestry.com. The department made genetic genealogy a central part of its investigation. In late 2018, the police partnered with CeCe Moore, a DNA expert who regularly appeared on big-name TV shows. Moore - with her curly blonde hair and pearly smile - was one of the best-known faces in genetic genealogy. She had cracked cold cases across the country, but turned down the Dodge case over concerns the DNA samples were too degraded. “Then Carol reached out to me,” she said. “She begged me to try and make it work and do everything I could to find her daughter’s killer. I felt a tremendous amount of pressure. I didn’t want to let her down.” In summer 2018, Moore uploaded the DNA to a database called GEDmatch, that allows users of websites like Ancestry.com to compare their results with others. Despite her concerns about the quality of the sample, it worked. She started building genetic networks, that let her see who shared DNA with the unknown suspect. Those matches would then be traced back to a common ancestral couple. This family tree could, in theory, lead Moore to Angie’s killer. Moore soon established the suspect had to be the grandson or great-grandson of a man called Clarence Ussery. Using birth certificates and obituaries, she mapped all his descendants who would have been the right age at the time of Angie’s death in 1996. She narrowed it down to six men - one of whom lived in Idaho. She gave the name to the Idaho Falls Police Department, who then needed to get a DNA sample from him. They tailed the suspect for days. “I told Carol that it was looking good and we were going to be able to find the killer,” Moore said. “I told her: ‘I'm gonna do this, Carol, I'm gonna finally find this guy and you're gonna finally get justice and answers.’” But they would have to wait. In an enormous blow for the new investigation, the results excluded the suspect, his family and all six men Moore had on her list. “I was so sure he had to be in the family,” Moore said. “It was devastating. I had hit a brick wall. It appeared that genetic genealogy might have led me wrong for the first time in my career.” The bad news hit Dodge hard. “I woke up at three o’clock in the morning, drank a Coke, and sat at my kitchen table and started to sob. I said: ‘Angie, I’m so sorry. I’m tired and I don’t know where to go.’ I literally felt her looking down on me and saying: ‘Mom, you’re almost there. You’ve come so far. You can’t stop now.’” Moore went back to the family tree she had built and looked for anything she might have missed. “One thing that had always bothered me was a really early marriage in the family,” she said. “They had split up and there were no recorded children. But I couldn't trace the wife and couldn't find what happened to her. “I wanted to be sure that there wasn't a child born to that marriage that went with her. I knew there was a chance he could have been raised by another man.” They found what they were looking for in a small library in Missouri. Moore’s assistant called to say she had found an obituary for the woman in question. Not only did it say the surname she had taken - Dripps - but it said she had had a son and a grandson. “We looked up the grandson and found that he had been raised with his stepfather’s surname,” Moore said. “His mother had taken him and he never had any contact with the original family. “Then we found that he had lived in Idaho Falls. He didn't just live in Idaho Falls, he had lived there in 1996.” “I started crying,” Moore said. “I was on an aeroplane trying not to make a scene. I just kept thinking about what this would mean to Carol.” Moore held a video call with detectives in Idaho Falls and explained how she had got the new name - Brian Leigh Dripps Sr. “I got choked up for a minute and even they started crying,” she said. “We all just wanted it for Carol. But that's where my work ended and theirs began. Now they had to try and build a case.”  The police researched the name Moore had given them and were stunned by what they found. They discovered Dripps had been interviewed as part of a neighbourhood canvas just five days after Angie’s murder in 1996. Not only that, but an old pawn shop receipt and some utility records showed he had lived opposite her at the time. “It became pretty clear that this might be the person we are looking at,” Johnson said. “At that point the investigation really kicked into hyper-drive.” In May 2019, a major police operation was launched to get a sample of his DNA. Dripps lived in Caldwell, a five-hour drive away on the other side of Idaho. Within the first hour of police watching him, he threw a cigarette butt out of his car window. An officer raced into the road to retrieve it but it was lost among dozens of others as traffic raced by. The police had to watch him for another 24 hours before they got a second chance. On the afternoon of 10 May, detectives saw Dripps discard another cigarette butt out of his car window. As soon as he had driven off, an undercover officer rushed into traffic to recover it. Other officers in plain clothes blocked cars from running over the sample or injuring the detective. It was recovered, and immediately sent for testing. “We had talked to the Idaho State lab and they knew how important this case was to the community,” Johnson said. “They knew Carol and wanted to do their best for her.” The lab stayed open late into the evening and staff worked through the weekend to extract the DNA and compare it with semen and hairs left at the crime scene. After more than two decades and 100 DNA samples, the test came back positive. Dripps was a match. “We were pretty happy about it,” Johnson said. “But we didn’t start partying yet.” The department plotted a second operation to arrest Dripps in Caldwell. They knew he went to a convenience store every day at about 12:00, so the plan was to arrest him on his way out. “But instead of turning left he turned right,” Johnson said. “We drove forever. At one point he went down a dead end road and we wondered if he knew we were behind him.” Eventually, Dripps went into a bank and the detectives stopped him as he left. He agreed to answer some questions and, after an interview that lasted for more than five hours, and after he was presented with the DNA evidence, he asked if he could have a cigarette. “I’m sure you want to get this on tape,” he then said, according to one of the detectives who questioned him. Dripps then confessed to the rape and murder of Angie Dodge and said he acted alone. “You got me dead right on the DNA,” he told the officers. He was charged that night. His trial is set for June 2021 and he has pleaded not guilty. He is facing the death penalty if convicted. It was getting late when Chief Bryce Johnson returned to Idaho Falls. He knew he still had a major job to do, and the first step was to speak to Carol Dodge. “I told her we had a DNA match and the person was in custody,” he said. “It was pretty emotionally overwhelming for her.” But he didn’t tell her the name until the next morning, shortly before a press conference about the arrest. Dozens of members of the Dodge family, as well as CeCe Moore and other experts who had worked on the case, all gathered in a crowded briefing room to hear the news. “I expected five or six people, but there was everybody there,” Johnson said. “We couldn't fit everyone in. Carol had so many people that she had affected over the years that were part of this story.” Then he told her. “Chief Johnson said the new suspect was Brian Leigh Dripps Sr and I practically came off my chair,” Carol said. “I said: ‘Brian Dripps? You’ve got to be shitting me. I begged them to take his DNA at the time and they told me to let them do their jobs. I’m still angry over it. “I’m angry at what they did to me, when they could have solved this case 23 years ago. I’m angry at those two cops who didn’t even write a field report when they spoke to him. “He was right there all along,” Dodge said, as she started to cry. “I sat in front of his house for hours. Right after we buried Angie, I drove over to her apartment just to sit and look at her bedroom window. And I was sitting in front of his house. It was so close but yet so far.” The new evidence prompted Tapp’s legal team to push for a full exoneration. He still had a murder conviction against his name and his lawyer John Thomas wanted this cleared. A motion dismissing all charges was finally granted in July 2019 and Tapp - who had spent more than half his life in prison - was finally declared an innocent man by a judge. Tapp’s friends and supporters, who wore T-shirts emblazoned with ‘We told you so!’ and ‘Innocent’, cheered in the courtroom as the news was delivered. Tapp broke down in tears and his mother, Vera, kissed him on the head. Carol Dodge, meanwhile, wiped tears away from her eyes as the man she had once believed had killed her daughter celebrated his innocence. “I was able to tell my mom that my name is clean,” Tapp said. “That was the most important thing to me in this world. “I’m so thankful and grateful for what everyone has done for me,” he said. “But Carol: she has been like a second mom. If it wasn't for Carol's perseverance and drive then none of this would have ever transpired for me. If she hadn't sat down and watched the interrogation tapes, and seen how bad it was, then none of this would have happened. I’m so in debt to her.” The pair embraced after Tapp was exonerated, a moment two decades in the making. “I was really, really happy for Chris,” Dodge said. “I could see that her mother finally had her son back.” When she reflected on the journey that had led to that moment, Dodge paused and breathed a heavy sigh. Her voice grew louder and more forceful. “My fight was to find my daughter justice,” she said. “Every road I went down somebody tried to put up a barricade or a roadblock. Everywhere I turned somebody said you can’t do this or you can’t do that. I said: just stand back and watch me do it.” Otto Kitsinger/Innocence Project Otto Kitsinger/Innocence Project  Author: Gareth Evans Photography: Niki Chan Wylie Graphic:   Debie Loizou Editor: Roland Hughes Online Producer: James Percy Additional images: Otto Kitsinger/Innocence Project, Alamy ",Positive,0.9999999
"The global coronavirus outbreak means millions of travel and tourism jobs are at risk, says a leading industry body. The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) says up to 50 million jobs could be lost because of the pandemic. Its chief executive, Gloria Guevara, said the outbreak ""presents a significant threat to the industry"". The news comes afterthousands of international flights were cancelledandsome insurance firms suspended travel coverfor new customers. New figures from the WTTC suggest that the travel sector could shrink by up to 25% in 2020. The trade body is calling on governments to take several steps to protect the industry, including: Removing or simplifying visas where possible, as well as reducing costs Relaxing ""unnecessary barriers"" at ports and airports Reduce travellers' taxes such as Air Passenger Duty Increase budgets for promoting travel destinations. But Ms Guevara added: ""Travel and tourism has the strength to overcome this challenge and will emerge stronger."" The tourism industry has been massively affected by the spread of coronavirus, as many countries have introduced travel restrictions in an attempt to contain its spread. Cruise ship firm Princess Cruises is suspending all operations for 60 days. One of its cruises was kept off the cost of San Francisco for five days after 21 passengers tested positive for the virus. British Airways, EasyJet and Norwegian Air have all also cut flights in response to the outbreak. Korean Air even warned that the coronavirus could threaten its survival. Australia's Qantas is reducing international flights by nearly 25% in response to the outbreak Chinese airline passenger numbers dropped by 84.5% last month, highlighting the huge economic impact on the country where the virus originated. Its aviation regulator said on Thursday that the drop had caused a 21bn-yuan (Â£2.35bn) fall in revenue. Travel industry experts have expressed concerns about Chinese tourists being kept at home. In the UK, for example, there were 415,000 visits from China in the 12 months to September 2019, according to VisitBritain. Chinese travellers also spend three times more than an average visitor to the UK at Â£1,680 each. As more large-scale events are cancelled and the number of flight cancellations increases, there are fears the industry could take a bigger hit.

"Wall Street shares rallied on Friday after US President Donald Trump declared the coronavirus outbreak a national emergency, freeing up money to fight the spread of the disease. As the president spoke, the three main US indexes jumped more than 9%. Earlier, London's FTSE 100 closed up 2.5%, retreating from an early surge, while other European indexes made similar moves. The rally comes a day after Wall Street suffered its biggest losses since 1987. Investors fear economies could slide into recession as a result of the pandemic, as business is disrupted, events are cancelled and schools in many countries close in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. Many indexes around the world have now fallen more than 20% from their recent highs - a red flag for recession. On Friday, the European Union said it will put in place a package of measures, including a â¬37bn euro (Â£33bn) investment initiative. And German finance minister Olaf Scholz said his country could part-nationalise firms to tackle the crisis. In the US, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said her members would pass a bill that provides paid sick leave, among other aid.  But Republicans and the White House have not said they will support it. US Secretary Steven Mnuchin pledged the US would use ""whatever tools we need"". The national emergency declaration helps speed some kinds of funding to local governments. In an interview with US broadcaster CNBC, he said he believed the coronavirus slowdown would be short-term and said the situation in 1987, when markets dropped some 20%, was a ""much scarier time"". ""This is nothing compared to that,"" he said. Stock markets have been in turmoil in recent weeks with investors deeply concerned about the economic effects of coronavirus. On Thursday, benchmark indexes on Wall Street and in the City of London saw their steepest daily falls since so-called Black Monday in 1987, falling 10%. In France and Germany, indexes lost more than 12%. Those declines came despite actions by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank to support the market. Coronavirus 'could cost millions of tourism jobs' Norwegian to suspend half its staff as virus spreads Eurozone tries to ease coronavirus crisis On Friday, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)prohibited short selling,externalof a raft of shares in Italian and Spanish firms, after a request from authorities in those countries for the action, which is designed to protect that list of companies. The prohibition on short selling came after major falls in Italian and Spanish indexes on Thursday. Short selling is speculation that the price of a stock will go down, and if there are more short sellers than buyers, the price will be pushed down. Firms including football clubs Lazio and Juventus were on the list, as well as luxury car manufacturer Ferrari. The New York branch of the Federal Reserve also said it would speed up its planned purchases of US government debt, in response to ongoing strains in the US bond market. In risky times, investors often look to buy Treasuries, driving prices up and yields lower. But in recent days, yields on many US notes have remained unexpectedly high. Many people's initial reaction to ""the markets"" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money. Yet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet. Read more here.

"Shares around the world have plunged as investors fear the spread of the coronavirus will destroy economic growth with government action insufficient to arrest the decline. The main UK index dropped more than 10% in its worst day since 1987. In the US, the Dow and S&P 500 were also hit by their steepest daily falls since 1987. The declines came despite actions by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank to ease financial strains. At the start of US trading, plummeting shares triggered an unusual automatic suspension in trading for the second time this week. When trade resumed 15 minutes later, shares continued to fall, taking cues from the slide in European markets. The S&P 500 fell 9.5% and the Nasdaq ended 9.4% lower, while losses on the UK's FTSE 100 wiped some Â£160.4bn off the market. In France and Germany, indexes cratered more than 12%. Eurozone tries to ease coronavirus crisis Trump halts travel from Europe to US Coronavirus: LV pulls out of travel cover ""Markets are at a breaking point,"" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com. ""No one knows what a total economic shutdown, however temporary, looks like."" The declines came after the US restricted travel from mainland Europe. Losses on European indexes accelerated afterthe eurozone's central bank failed to cut interest rates, although it did pledge fresh stimulus measures. The New York branch of the Federal Reserve said it was pumping $1.5tr to ease strains in the debt markets, offering increased overnight loans to banks and expanding the kinds of assets it will buy to keep firms lending. The announcement, which came after European markets had closed, briefly sent shares higher, but they dropped back by the end of the day. Rate cuts by the US central bank last week and the Bank of England on Wednesday also did little to soothe investors. ""What we really need is some huge confidence that this isn't going to cause the kind of stress and horrible loss of life [it has] in Italy everywhere else in the world,"" said former Goldman Sachs chief economist Lord Jim O'Neill. Stocks in Asia also saw big falls earlier, with Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closing 4.4% lower. Panicked selling led to trading halts in Brazil, while not a single company in the FTSE 100 index gained on Thursday. Travel companies saw some of the biggest falls, driven byUS President Donald Trump's 30-day ban on travellers from mainland Europe. Shares in Delta Air Lines and United Airlines - among the most affected by the ban - dropped more than 20%. In the UK, airline group IAG was down more than 15% and Tui fell 17%. Other companies warning on the impact of Covid-19 on Thursday included: BT Groupannounced that chief executive Philip Jansen had tested positive for coronavirus. It said he had ""relatively mild"" symptoms and would work remotely Broadcomsaid uncertainty about demand was prompting it to withdraw its 2020 growth forecast Norwegiansaid it would ground 40% of its long-haul fleet and cancel up to 25% of its short-haul flights until the end of May WH Smithissued a profit warning after the outbreak hit sales in its travel division, which includes store at airports and train stations Cineworldshares fell by more than 20%. It said that in a worst-case scenario, there was a risk it might not be able to repay its debts Estate agent Savillssaid the outbreak had caused a big drop in transactions in China and across Asia Princess Cruises,a line owned by Carnival, said it would suspend operations for 60 days.Vikingannounced a similar move Disneyclosed its California parks until the end of March Oil prices also fell, with Brent crude down more than 8% at about $33 a barrel. On the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, tensions were high. Some traders were speculating the tumbles could trigger a second trading suspension - something that has never happened, not even during the financial crisis. Since the start of the market turmoil, indexes in the US and elsewhere have fallen more than 20% from their recent highs - a threshold that is a red flag for a recession. ""It looks increasingly likely that the coming contraction will be deeper and more protracted than we were anticipating just a few days ago,"" said Jay Bryson, acting chief economist at Wells Fargo. ""The airline and hotel industries are in free fall, and there will be multiplier effects."" Investors in the US are now watching the US government response. US President Donald Trump said new, temporary travel restrictions would not apply to the UK In a presidential address on Wednesday, Mr Trump said he would extend deadlines for tax payments for those affected, increase low-cost loans to small businesses and provide financial relief for US workers who are ill, quarantined or caring for others due to the illness. But Republicans and Democrats in Congress appear at odds over additional steps while Mr Trump's favoured approach - a tax cut for workers - has failed to garner widespread support. ""The stock market at least is saying it's not been enough yet,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. Many people's initial reaction to ""the markets"" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money. Yet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes.

So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet. Read more here. The Western world's three largest central banks have now pitted their collective firepower against the economic chill caused by the coronavirus - to little effect. Stock markets continue to slide. The FTSE 100 has had its worst day since Black Monday in October 1987. Observers again might wonder what new information is spooking investors, given that central banks have in the last 10 days done their best to halt the slide. In truth, there is little new - most traders already knew that the virus is likely to cause significant economic disruption likely to push most Western economies into recession. What may have spooked them again is President Donald Trump's decision to stop most travel between continental Europe and the United States - a big enough factor in itself, but more importantly, the manner in which it was done. There was no consultation, and Mr Trump looked uncharacteristically uncertain, as if he, too, had finally been panicked by the virus. There is also a small, but telling detail - Mr Trump first said the ban would apply to cargo flights, but then corrected himself to say it would not. A big proportion of cargo, however, is carried in the belly holds of passenger aircraft. If there are no passenger flights, there will be much less cargo, an enormous disruption to exporters and manufacturers on both sides of the Atlantic.
