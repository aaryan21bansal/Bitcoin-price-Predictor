"The US is planning tariffs on metals - but may be hit in kind by other countries Some countries may be exempt from US plans to impose tariffs on metal imports, the White House has announced. The exemptions - on national security grounds - included Canada and Mexico, spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said. Reports, however, suggested the apparent softening of the US stance would last for only 30 days. US President Donald Trump has said steel products will face a 25% tariff, with 10% on aluminium goods. He is expected to sign the plan on Thursday. Mr Trump tweeted on Thursday morning that he was ""looking forward"" to a meeting later in the day on the matter. Allow Twitter content?

Meanwhile, China threatened an ""appropriate and necessary response"" in any trade war with the US. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China and the US should strive to be partners rather than rivals. The EU has proposed retaliatory measuresagainst a number of US goods including bourbon and peanut butter. Why Trump is hanging tough on trade Five reasons Why trade wars aren't easy to win Steel tariffs: What impact will they really have? Despite opposition at home and abroad,  Ms Sanders said the US president would sign the measures in by the end of the week. But she added: ""There are potential carve-outs for Mexico and Canada based on national security, and possibly other countries as well based on that process. That would be [on] a case-by-case and country by country basis."" President Trump has previously suggested that planned tariffs for Canada and Mexico could be abandoned if a ""new and fair"" North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) is signed. White House trade policy adviser Peter Navarro said on Wednesday that the tariffs would start in 15 to 30 days' time and there would be ""a clause that does not impose these tariffs immediately on Canada and Mexico"". Both countries knew the president was not ""messing around in this"", he added. Mr Trump has railed against the US trade deficit, arguing that other countries have been ""taking advantage of"" the US for decades. One of his campaign promises was to rebuild the US steel and aluminium industries which he said has suffered ""disgraceful"" treatment from other countries, in particular cheap Chinese imports.

Last week he dismissed concerns he could trigger a trade war, instead saying ""trade wars are good"" and were something the US would easily win. Mr Trump has already hinted he could drop plans to impose tariffs on Mexican and Canadian metals but linked it to the US getting a better deal in the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Mexico and Canada are among the main suppliers of steel to the US. The US plans have sparked worldwide alarm and jolted stock markets. Critics argue that the tariffs would fail to protect American jobs and would ultimately raise prices for consumers. More than 100 Republicans on Wednesday signed a letter addressed to the president, expressing their ""deep concern"" about the tariffs. The letter referenced a sweeping tax cuts bill Congress and the White House worked to pass last year, arguing that ""adding new taxes in the form of broad tariffs would undermine the remarkable progress"". International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde warned ""nobody wins"" in a trade war, saying it would harm global economic growth. The EU has set out tit-for-tat plans to impose import duties on bourbon, peanut butter, cranberries, orange juice, steel, and industrial products. Other countries are also considering retaliatory steps. Members of Mr Trump's Republican party are concerned too, with House Speaker Paul Ryan saying he wanted to see tariffs that were ""more surgical and more targeted"".

"Amazon's Alexa is finding something funny, and scaring some users Amazonâs Alexa has been letting out an unprompted, creepy cackle - startling users of the best-selling voice assistant. The laugh, described by some as âwitch likeâ was reported to sometimes happen without the device being âwokenâ up. Others reported the laugh occurring when they asked Alexa to perform a different task, such as playing music. ""Weâre aware of this and working to fix it,â Amazon said. ""In rare circumstances, Alexa can mistakenly hear the phrase 'Alexa, laugh'. ""We are changing that phrase to be 'Alexa, can you laugh?' which is less likely to have false positives, and we are disabling the short utterance 'Alexa, laugh'. ""We are also changing Alexa's response from simply laughter to 'sure, I can laugh' followed by laughter."" Voice assistants like Alexa are designed to respond or act only when prompted with a wake word, which in this case is âAlexaâ or âAmazonâ. But some people have suggested the glitch happened without any prior interaction, spooking Alexa owners. ""WHY DID MY ALEXA JUST LAUGH OUT OF THE BLUE?!?!?!?â wrote one user on Twitter. Another wrote: ""Lying in bed about to fall asleep when Alexa on my Amazon Echo Dot lets out a very loud and creepy laugh... thereâs a good chance I get murdered tonight.â The use of voice assistants in the home is often met with caution due to their nature - voice commands are recorded and sent to the cloud for processing, a system that stokes a fear of eavesdropping, unintended or otherwise. Incidents like this, where an assistant seems to rebel against its owner, naturally further this concern. That said, most users on social media have reacted with humour, drawing parallels with HAL 9000 from the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey. âIâm sorry, Dave,â the machine famously said. âIâm afraid I canât do that.""

"This video can not be played Tusk on Brexit: 'We will be drifting apart' Donald Tusk has insisted the EU ""does not want to build a wall"", but Brexit means ""we will be drifting apart"". The EU Council president said Theresa May wanted to ""demonstrate at any price that Brexit could be a success"", but that was not the EU's objective. He was unveilingdraft guidelines for the EU side,externalof Brexit trade talks. Mr Tusk said the EU wanted an ""ambitious and advanced"" free trade deal - and continued access to UK waters for EU fishing vessels. Kuenssberg: Differences, but room for manoeuvre Reality Check: EU predicts Brexit costs for UK Kamal Ahmed: Hammond's hidden message ""Our agreement will not make trade between the UK and EU frictionless or smoother,"" he said. ""It will make it more complicated and costly than today for all of us. This is the essence of Brexit."" He said it would be the first time in history that a free trade agreement would ""loosen, not strengthen, economic ties"". This video can not be played Donald Tusk: Theresa May's political goal is Brexit success ""at any price"" The draft European Council guidelines call for zero-tariff trade in goods - where the EU has a surplus. The document also says access for services will be limited by the fact that the UK will be outside the EU and will no longer share a common regulatory and judiciary framework. The draft guidelines repeat EU warnings that there can be ""no cherry-picking"" of participation in the single market for particular sectors of industry. The BBC's Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris said the ""narrow negotiating mandate set out in these guidelines suggests that the EU doesn't think it will be much more ambitious than other free trade agreements it has negotiated - Canada is the most obvious example"". Mr Tusk said he wanted continued security and research cooperation and to ensure flights were not grounded. But he added: ""No member state is free to pick only those sectors of the internal market they like, or to accept the role of the ECJ only when it suits their interest."" The draft guidelines also say that the EU will ""preserve its autonomy as regards its decision-making, which excludes participation of the United Kingdom as a third-country to EU Institutions, agencies or bodies"". This video can not be played Theresa May: ""We must bring our country back together"" Mrs May acknowledged in her Mansion House speech on Brexit on Friday that neither side would get everything they want from negotiations. But she also stressed that the UK wanted a bespoke trade deal, rather than an ""off-the-shelf"" model. ""The fact is that every free trade agreement has varying market access depending on the respective interests of the countries involved,"" she said. ""If this is cherry-picking, then every trade arrangement is cherry-picking."" She also said: ""We will also want to explore with the EU, the terms on which the UK could remain part of EU agencies."" This appears to be in conflict with the EU draft guidelines, although BBC Research has found several examples of non-EU members participating - as a member or observer - in EU agencies and bodies, such as the European Environment Agency and the European Medicines Agency. The EU says it wants to maintain ""existing reciprocal access to fishing waters"" - a leading concern of the fishing industry in countries bordering the North Sea. In her Mansion House speech, Mrs May said: ""The UK will regain control over our domestic fisheries management rules and access to our waters."" She added that the UK would want to ""work together to manage shared stocks in a sustainable way and to agree reciprocal access to waters and a fairer allocation of fishing opportunities for the UK fishing industry"". Brexit Secretary David Davis - quizzed on Tuesday by Brexiteer Labour MP Kate Hoey - insisted the government would not betray UK fishing communities by ""trading away fishing rights"" for ""other things"". Asked about the EU's demand to keep access as it is now, Chancellor Philip Hammond said the UK was ""open to discussing with our EU partners about the appropriate arrangements for reciprocal access for our fishermen to EU waters and for EU fishermen to our waters"". Campaign group Fishing for Leave urged the government not to ""cave in"" to the EU demands, saying: ""Nowhere else is access to fisheries included as negotiating collateral for a free trade agreement."" Financial services are not mentioned specifically in the EU draft guidelines, but it is shaping up to be a major sticking point. UK Chancellor Philip Hammond has told European leaders that it is in the ""mutual interest"" of both the UK and the EU to include financial services in a free trade agreement. ""Given the shape of the British economy and our trade balance with the EU 27, it's hard to see how any deal that did not include services could look like a fair and balanced settlement,"" he said in a speech. ""Not only is it possible to include financial services in a trade deal, but this is very much in our mutual interest to do so."" But Donald Tusk appeared to reject the UK proposals. The EU says the UK will be treated like any other ""third country"" after Brexit. Asked about the EU guidelines, which also warn of the ""negative economic consequences"" of Brexit, Mr Hammond said: ""It does not surprise me remotely that what they have set out this morning is a very tough position. That's what any competent, skilled and experienced negotiator would do."" EU deal 'must include financial services' This video can not be played Tusk: Theresa May wants Brexit success ""at any price"" Donald Tusk unveiled his guidelines in a picture-perfect castle in the hills outside Luxembourg. A nice change to the usual venues in Brussels but the same tough message from the EU that the UK's red lines limit what it can get from the final Brexit deal. The best that's on offer is a free trade agreement on goods with no tariffs, and access to the European markets for the UK service sector - but under EU rules and with no specific mention of financial services. I asked a sad-sounding Donald Tusk if his offer came anywhere close to what the prime minister had asked for in her Mansion House speech. His pause was epically long, which suggested he knows it is not. His document is also pretty gloomy, with a spine-chilling warning about the economic costs to the UK. But there is also a big offer tucked away in a later paragraph - there are other options available if the government is prepared to compromise on its red lines. The leaders of the remaining 27 EU states must approve the plans at a Brussels summit on 22 March, setting the template for chief negotiator Michel Barnier for talks with the UK about their future relationship. The UK is due to leave the EU at the end of March 2019, and both sides have said they would like a deal on their future relationship to be agreed by this autumn to allow time for parliaments to approve the deal before Brexit happens. MPs to debate Plaid's EU citizenship call Brexit: All you need to know The European Parliament's Guy Verhofstadt held talks on Tuesday in Downing Street The European Parliament has stressed that its preferred option is for the UK to continue to be a member of the single market and customs union after Brexit, in a draft resolution,leaked to the Politico website,external. The parliament does not have a formal role in the Brexit negotiations but does have a veto on the final deal. The European Parliament document, which may be changed before it is adopted, says non-EU members - even if very closely aligned to the bloc - cannot expect the same rights and benefits as EU members. It also warns that the UK's current ""red lines"" in Brexit talks ""would lead to customs checks and verification which would affect global supply chains and manufacturing processes, even if tariff barriers can be avoided"". It says a ""deep and comprehensive"" trade deal, of the kind envisioned by Theresa May, must entail ""a binding interpretation role"" for the European Court of Justice. MPs to debate Plaid's EU citizenship call Brexit: All you need to know MPs in Westminster are, meanwhile, debating a call by Plaid Cymru - who have four MPs in Wales - for UK nationals to be allowed to keep their EU citizenship after Brexit. Plaid said EU citizenship would give holders the right to travel, live, study and work anywhere in the EU even after the UK leaves next year. A UK government spokesman said only citizens of EU member states could hold EU citizenship.

"Around two million UK households will receive Cold Weather Payments of Â£25 each, following last week's cold snap. The government will pay out Â£50m, the largest weekly sum for five years. The payments were triggered after temperatures in many parts of the country fell below zero Celsius for seven consecutive days. Households in the West Midlands will get the highest pay-out of Â£8m, followed by Â£7m for homes in Yorkshire and Humberside. To qualify, householders have to be claiming one of five benefits. These are: Pension Credit, Income Support, Income-based Job Seekers' Allowance, Income-related Employment and Support Allowance, or Universal Credit. The temperature in your postcode area also needs to have remained at, or below zero, for seven days running. Cold Weather Payments,externalare separate toWinter Fuel Payments,external, which are paid to those born before August 1953. Those eligible for Cold Weather Payments will receive the money automatically in their benefits, and within two weeks. ""As we all experienced last week, extreme weather has the potential to cause a number of problems but what cold weather shouldn't do is discourage anyone from turning up their heating to keep warm,"" said the minister for family support, housing and child maintenance, Kit Malthouse.

"Two lorries and a minibus were involved in the crash on the M1 last August A second lorry driver involved in a crash on the M1 that killed eight people has been cleared of causing death by dangerous driving. David Wagstaff had previously admitted eight counts of the lesser charge of causing death by careless driving. Wagstaff, 54, was on a hands-free call when his lorry forced a minibus under a stationary lorry in lane one. The driver of the other lorry involved, Ryszard Masierak, 31, was convicted on Tuesday of dangerous driving charges. 'There is no life for me now' - minibus driver's wife The pair are due to be sentenced at Aylesbury Crown Court on 23 March. This video can not be played CCTV captured the fatal M1 minibus crash Ch Insp Andy Storey, from Thames Valley Police, revealed outside court that Masierak's professional driving licence had been revoked prior to the crash and he ""should not have been driving at all that day"". Fed Ex driver Wagstaff, who described his own actions as a ""lack of concentration"", was also cleared of four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving by the jury at Reading Crown Court,charges that Masierak had also been found guilty of. Judge Francis Sheridan paid tribute to the jury in what he described as a ""very emotional and heartbreaking"" case. Louise Atrill, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said outside court: ""Both men showed flagrant disregard for the safety of other road users that morning, leaving five families mourning their loved ones. ""It's unimaginable to think of the consequences this incident will have on the family and friends of the deceased and those injured."" Ryszard Masierak and David Wagstaff are due to be sentenced on 23 March Mathew John, spokesman for the family of minibus driver Mr Joseph, said they were disappointed by the verdict on Wagstaff. He said motorway information systems had failed to alert other road users to the fact Masierak had been stationary for more than 10 minutes. ""I think there should [also] be monitoring cameras in the [lorry] cabin to see what actually these drivers are doing,"" he added. The court heardAIM Logistics driver Masierak was at twice the drink-drive limitwhen he stopped his vehicle in the carriageway near Newport Pagnell, on 26 August last year. Just after 03:00 BST, a minibus being driven by Cyriac Joseph carrying 11 Indian tourists from Nottingham to London on their way to Disneyland Paris pulled up behind Masierak's vehicle with its hazard lights on, waiting to go around it. Seconds later Wagstaff, who had been on a hands-free call for an hour, ploughed into the back of the minibus, without swerving or braking, and forced it into and under Masierak's vehicle, the court heard. Wagstaff, of Derwent Street, Stoke-on-Trent, told police he spoke to fellow driver Elliot Brough frequently and on the night in question they were talking about ""rubbish"", including Everton and Donald Trump. During the trial, Wagstaff, who has since been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, said he ""cannot remember anything at all"" about the collision. His lawyer said he had""vivid memories"" of the bodies in the aftermath of the crashover the August Bank Holiday weekend. The minibus was owned and being driven by Cyriac Joseph The eight people killed - six men and two women - were Mr Joseph, Panneerselvam Annamalai, Rishi Ranjeev Kumar, Vivek Baskaran, Lavanyalakshmi Seetharaman, Karthikeyan Pugalur Ramasubramanian, Subramaniyan Arachelvan and Tamilmani Arachelvan. The four other people in the minibus - including a four-year-old girl left orphaned by the tragedy - spent weeks in hospital following the crash. The court was told AIM Logistics driver Masierak stopped in the carriageway at about 02:57 BST, despite there being miles of hard shoulder available. Prosecutor Oliver Saxby QC called the Polish national's behaviour ""as flagrant as it was dangerous"". The front of David Wagstaff's Fed Ex lorry was severely damaged in the crash He admitted he had consumed alcohol but said this had nothing to do with the crash. Instead, he said he stopped becausehe was sweating, felt weak and had a headacheand had attempted to get onto the hard shoulder. Masierak, of Barnards Close, Evesham, Worcestershire, then said he lost consciousness, only to be woken from what he described as a ""small coma"" when the crash happened. After Wagstaff's verdict was given, Judge Francis Sheridan praised the families of the deceased for their ""constant dignity in a dreadful case with very sad, tragic consequences"".

It has also faced an ""extremely challenging"" retail market, driven by weaker consumer confidence, the implications of Brexit and competition from online channels,"" said Deloitte, which is handling the firm's Company Voluntary Agreement - a type of compromise deal that allows a firm to avoid going into administration. ""New Look is an iconic brand on the High Street and the Company Voluntary Agreement will provide a stable platform upon which management's turnaround plan can be delivered,"" said Daniel Butters, a partner at Deloitte. ""It is important to stress that no stores will close on day one, and employees, suppliers and business rates will continue to be paid on time and in full."" A glut of UK retailers have made closures or gone bust in recent months amid a slowdown on the High Street. Last week toy store chain Toys r Us fell into administration, along with electronics retailer Maplin, leaving thousands of jobs at risk. Restaurant chains Byron and Prezzo have also announced closures, while House of Fraser is seeking to shore up its finances. New Look has badly lost its way. Sales have fallen off a cliff. Even online sales were down by 15% in December. In recent years it focussed on younger shoppers, but failed to keep up with the likes of Asos, Boohoo and Primark. New Look is also saddled with way too many stores. It has nearly 600 fashion outlets, an extraordinary number given the rise of online shopping. And then there's the debt. New Look is drowning in it. It currently stands at Â£1.2bn. In today's challenging retail environment that's a pretty toxic mix.  It needs to cut costs - and fast. New Look has got its work cut out. On top of weaker consumer confidence, experts say retailers are battling a ""perfect storm"" of pressures including the rise of online shopping and rising overheads such as the National Living Wage. Many firms also over-expanded during the good years, leaving them dangerously indebted. New Look will learn if creditors have approved its rescue plan on 21 March. The British Property Federation said it would be up to individual landlords whether they accepted the proposal. It comes on the day the government launched its first industry-led Retail Sector Council to discuss the sector's challenges. It will include major retailers such as Boots and Amazon and meet regularly with government to discuss ""the changing demands of consumers"", retail minister Andrew Griffiths said.

"Two lorries and a minibus were involved in the crash on the M1 last August A second lorry driver involved in a crash on the M1 that killed eight people has been cleared of causing death by dangerous driving. David Wagstaff had previously admitted eight counts of the lesser charge of causing death by careless driving. Wagstaff, 54, was on a hands-free call when his lorry forced a minibus under a stationary lorry in lane one. The driver of the other lorry involved, Ryszard Masierak, 31, was convicted on Tuesday of dangerous driving charges. 'There is no life for me now' - minibus driver's wife The pair are due to be sentenced at Aylesbury Crown Court on 23 March. This video can not be played CCTV captured the fatal M1 minibus crash Ch Insp Andy Storey, from Thames Valley Police, revealed outside court that Masierak's professional driving licence had been revoked prior to the crash and he ""should not have been driving at all that day"". Fed Ex driver Wagstaff, who described his own actions as a ""lack of concentration"", was also cleared of four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving by the jury at Reading Crown Court,charges that Masierak had also been found guilty of. Judge Francis Sheridan paid tribute to the jury in what he described as a ""very emotional and heartbreaking"" case. Louise Atrill, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said outside court: ""Both men showed flagrant disregard for the safety of other road users that morning, leaving five families mourning their loved ones. ""It's unimaginable to think of the consequences this incident will have on the family and friends of the deceased and those injured."" Ryszard Masierak and David Wagstaff are due to be sentenced on 23 March Mathew John, spokesman for the family of minibus driver Mr Joseph, said they were disappointed by the verdict on Wagstaff. He said motorway information systems had failed to alert other road users to the fact Masierak had been stationary for more than 10 minutes. ""I think there should [also] be monitoring cameras in the [lorry] cabin to see what actually these drivers are doing,"" he added. The court heardAIM Logistics driver Masierak was at twice the drink-drive limitwhen he stopped his vehicle in the carriageway near Newport Pagnell, on 26 August last year. Just after 03:00 BST, a minibus being driven by Cyriac Joseph carrying 11 Indian tourists from Nottingham to London on their way to Disneyland Paris pulled up behind Masierak's vehicle with its hazard lights on, waiting to go around it. Seconds later Wagstaff, who had been on a hands-free call for an hour, ploughed into the back of the minibus, without swerving or braking, and forced it into and under Masierak's vehicle, the court heard. Wagstaff, of Derwent Street, Stoke-on-Trent, told police he spoke to fellow driver Elliot Brough frequently and on the night in question they were talking about ""rubbish"", including Everton and Donald Trump. During the trial, Wagstaff, who has since been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, said he ""cannot remember anything at all"" about the collision. His lawyer said he had""vivid memories"" of the bodies in the aftermath of the crashover the August Bank Holiday weekend. The minibus was owned and being driven by Cyriac Joseph The eight people killed - six men and two women - were Mr Joseph, Panneerselvam Annamalai, Rishi Ranjeev Kumar, Vivek Baskaran, Lavanyalakshmi Seetharaman, Karthikeyan Pugalur Ramasubramanian, Subramaniyan Arachelvan and Tamilmani Arachelvan. The four other people in the minibus - including a four-year-old girl left orphaned by the tragedy - spent weeks in hospital following the crash. The court was told AIM Logistics driver Masierak stopped in the carriageway at about 02:57 BST, despite there being miles of hard shoulder available. Prosecutor Oliver Saxby QC called the Polish national's behaviour ""as flagrant as it was dangerous"". The front of David Wagstaff's Fed Ex lorry was severely damaged in the crash He admitted he had consumed alcohol but said this had nothing to do with the crash. Instead, he said he stopped becausehe was sweating, felt weak and had a headacheand had attempted to get onto the hard shoulder. Masierak, of Barnards Close, Evesham, Worcestershire, then said he lost consciousness, only to be woken from what he described as a ""small coma"" when the crash happened. After Wagstaff's verdict was given, Judge Francis Sheridan praised the families of the deceased for their ""constant dignity in a dreadful case with very sad, tragic consequences"".

"Alexander Litvinenko lies in a hospital bed in London, shortly before his death in 2006 When Sergei Skripal, a former Russian double agent, collapsed suddenly on Sunday in the sleepy cathedral city of Salisbury, there were unavoidable echoes of a messy, high-profile death in London a little over a decade before. In 2006, Alexander Litvinenko, another former Russian agent, was rushed to hospital after collapsing in London. As the world watched, a rare and highly radioactive isotope destroyed Litvinenko's organs one by one, and he died three weeks later. A British public inquiry found that the former Russian agent had ingested Polonium 210, and that his assassination was likely ordered directly by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mr Skripal, 66, who was imprisoned in Russia for working for British intelligence and later came to the UK as part of a spy swap, is currently in critical condition, along with his 33-year-old daughter who was also taken ill. Authorities say they are trying to determine if he was poisoned. Russia has denied any involvement, but the case has put renewed scrutiny on a string of deaths in the UK in the past two decades. The chair of the home affairs select committee,Yvette Cooper MP, wrote to Home Secretary Amber Rudd on Tuesday,externalcalling for a review of 14 other cases. Those cases were variously found to have been heart attacks, suicides, accidents, and deaths by natural causes, but some allege that they amount to a pattern of state-sponsored murder on British streets. Security guard Neil St Clair-Ford was driving through Weybridge in Surrey in November 2012 when he saw something lying in the road ahead of him. He pulled over and found Alexander Perepilichnyy, an exiled Russian banker, in the foetal position, pale, cold, and displaying ""very faint"" signs of life. Mr St Clair-Ford called a local former Navy colleague, Liam Walsh, to help administer first aid. Mr Walsh told an inquest that Perepilichnyy vomited ""greeny-yellow"" bile during mouth-to-mouth resuscitation with a strange taste, like ""licking a battery"". Perepilichnyy was born in Ukraine and made his fortune as a financier in Russia, allegedly helping government-connected Russians launder money. In 2010 he fled to Britain and began to co-operate with British authorities. He collapsed during a run near his home, the day he returned from a short trip to Paris. An expert botanist said tests suggested the presence of a rare plant toxin in Perepilichnyy's stomach Initial toxicology tests on Perepilichnyy's body revealed nothing suspicious and police said they had no evidence of foul play. But later tests performed by an expert botanist at Kew Gardens suggested the presence of a rare and deadly plant toxin in Perepilichnyy's stomach. Gelsemium, a flowering plant native to China and South East Asia, is known as ""heartbreak grass"", because its leaves, if swallowed, cause cardiac arrest. Further tests of the compound found in Perepilichnyy could not definitively identify it as gelsemium, and an inquest into his death was suspended last year pending yet more tests. The inquest resumes next month. US intelligence sources told the BBC in 2016 that they believed Perepilichnyy was murdered.An extensive investigation by Buzzfeed News,externalclaimed that the businessman was one of at least 14 deaths in the UK that US officials suspected were connected to Russia. The following year, 2013, Boris Berezovsky, a one-time oligarch and close friend of Vladimir Putin, was found hanged in his bathroom. All the evidence seemed to point to a suicide. He had been suffering from depression and was in debt. According to police there was no sign of a struggle. A Home Office pathologist concluded that his injuries were consistent with hanging. But he had also made himself a sworn enemy of Mr Putin, having fled Russia for exile in Britain and fiercely criticised the regime from afar. Berezovsky's family arranged for an asphyxiation expert to examine photographs of his body. Dr Bernd Brinkmann testified that the ligature mark on Berezovsky's neck did not share the typical V-shape created by a hanging, and instead suggested strangling. The dead man also had a broken rib and a cut on the back of his head. It was enough to persuade the coroner to record an open verdict. Boris Berezovsky was found hanged in a bathroom at home in 2013 ""Anyone Putin deems to have betrayed Russia is at the highest level of risk,"" saidBill Browder, a former Moscow-based financier who led a campaign to impose sanctions on top Russian officials accused of corruption - sanctions that enraged Mr Putin. ""And Russia can get away with brazenness in the UK because there have never been any consequences to Russian assassinations here,"" he said. ""The British government either ignores the crimes completely, as they did in the Perepilichnyy case, or they recognise the crime and don't do anything about it."" Speaking in parliament on Tuesday, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said any evidence of Russian involvement with Mr Skripal's condition would be dealt with ""appropriately and robustly"". ""I say to governments around the world that no attempt to take innocent life on UK soil will go unsanctioned or unpunished,"" he said. How will experts know if ex-spy was poisoned? The 'quintessentially English' home of a Russian spy Skripal case highlights UK's Russia dilemma Among the other deaths flagged to the home secretary on Tuesday are those of Gareth Williams, the so-called ""spy in the bag"", whose badly decomposed body was found locked inside a holdall in his bath; Dr Matthew Puncher, a British scientist involved in the Litvinenko case who was found in his kitchen with multiple stab wounds from two separate knives; and Scot Young, a business associate of Berezovsky, who was found impaled on railings outside his London flat after falling from a fourth-floor window. Williams' death was ruled to be ""probably an accident"" and Puncher's and Young's both suicides, and British police say they have found no evidence of Russian involvement in any of the cases barring Litvinenko's. ""British police are under no sort of political pressure whatsoever,"" Tony Brenton, the British ambassador to Moscow at the time of Litvinenko's death, told the BBC. ""If they had found evidence of Russian involvement in those cases, we would have followed it up."" But the UK government has faced criticism over a perceived lack of action. In the wake of Litvinenko's death, the UK tried and failed to extradite two Russian agents alleged to have carried out the hit. Instead, several Russian diplomats were expelled, provoking a tit for tat response from Russia. A video still shows Sergei Skripal being detained by Russian security services in 2004 The problem facing the UK government now, said Mr Brenton, is that ministers have already levied significant sanctions on Russia over its actions in Ukraine and Syria, and diplomatic relations are already very poor. ""If it is proven that this was an attack with Russian state involvement we will of course do something, there will be lots of anger and probably more sanctions. But we have already used up an awful lot of our ammunition. The locker is quite bare,"" he said. In a statement, the Russian embassy in London said: ""Media reports create an impression of a planned operation by the Russian special services, which is completely untrue."" In Salisbury, counter-terror police have taken over the investigation. The park bench where Mr Skripal collapsed has been cordoned off and a restaurant where he ate lunch has been temporarily closed. If it turns out to have been a Russian attack, part of the purpose will have been to warn those in Russia against betrayal, and those in exile that they are never safe, said Mr Browder. ""It sends a message to the rank and file that terrible things can befall you and your family,"" he said. Critically ill man is former Russian spy Russiaâs elite FSB spy club Who is Sergei Skripal?

"A video still shows Sergei Skripal being detained by Russian security services in 2004 Britain's relations with Russia are already cool. The attempted murder of a former Russian spy in Salisbury could plunge that relationship even deeper into the diplomatic permafrost. Before the basic facts of the case have been established, both sides have indulged in an early exchange of fire. The Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, told the House of Commons there were echoes of the death of Alexander Litvinenko, another former Russian spy whose murder on British soil has been blamed on the Kremlin. ""It is clear that Russia is, I am afraid, in many respects now a malign and disruptive force,"" Mr Johnson told MPs. The country was, he said, launching cyber-attacks against British infrastructure which ""I increasingly think that we have to categorise.. as acts of war"". In response, Maria Zakharova, Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman, accused British politicians and journalists of using the incident to foster anti-Russian sentiment. ""This story was straight away used to boost an anti-Russian campaign in the media,"" she said. ""It is difficult to see anything other than provocations aimed at harming the relations between our two countries."" And of Mr Johnson, she said: ""How can a man charged with foreign affairs, who has no relation to security organs, make such statements?"" Russian spy 'attacked with nerve agent' Russian spy: What we know so far Sergei Skripal and the 14 deaths under scrutiny But does this matter? The relationship between London and Moscow could already be characterised as one of steady confrontation. It is certainly more strained than Russia's relations with other mainstream European countries such as Germany or France. Britain strongly opposed Russia's annexation of Crimea and intervention in Ukraine and it backed tough UN and EU sanctions on Russia's economy as a result. Britain also strongly opposed Russia's military support for President Assad's government in Syria that has led to the deaths of thousands of civilians. Britain has voiced its concern about Russia's alleged interference in the elections of western democracies, and what it sees as a threat to the international world order. And Britain is increasingly worried by the cyber-attacks on UK infrastructure emanating from Russian soil. But if it emerges that the Russian state had any involvement in the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter, then the British government would find it hard to resist taking action that would strain relations further. In such circumstances, Boris Johnson has promised ""appropriate and robust action"". Alexander Litvinenko lies in a hospital bed in London, shortly before his death in 2006 So what could that be? Well, the UK could expel some Russian diplomats, as it did after the former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned in London in 2006. But that has rarely changed Russia's behaviour. It could impose unilateral sanctions on Russian individuals and businesses. But it is unlikely to get support from European partners for tougher EU-wide sanctions. Brexit makes those kinds of negotiations harder and some EU countries are already trying to soften their approach to Moscow. The UK could make it more difficult for Russians generally to get visas to the UK. This certainly hurts. But it could be self-wounding as such restrictions might also hit Russian dissidents whom the UK welcomes and wealthy businessmen whose laundered cash the UK tolerates to support London's property market. Few analysts believe targeting rich Russians with tougher asset-stripping orders would make much difference. They would just take their money elsewhere. The government could change the law, as some MPs want, to make it easier to target sanctions at Russians who violate human rights. But this would probably affect only a handful of people. And, as Boris Johnson has hinted, the UK could decide that members of the royal family and other dignitaries should not attend the football World Cup in Russia this summer. The risk with any of these options is the scale of any Russian retaliation. British pension funds might get nervous if they have large investments in firms that are over-exposed in Russia. London estate agents might worry about the impact on the housing market if Russian money departed the capital. And Britain would be reluctant to strain diplomatic relations too much. Despite all the hostility, the UK needs to talk to Russia about rebuilding Syria if and when the conflict ends. It needs to talk to Russia about deterring North Korea from producing nuclear weapons. And it needs to talk to Russia about protecting the Iran nuclear deal. The UK could, of course, outsource these issues to other countries: they are all discussed on a multilateral basis. But to do so would run counter to the government's commitment to what it calls ""a global Britain"" foreign policy So for all the huffing and puffing from the Commons and the Kremlin, it is perhaps more likely that any substantial response from the UK would be measured and long term and dependent on a clear outcome to the investigation into what exactly happened in Salisbury. And that might take some time.

"Theresa May hosted Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at No 10 Theresa May has raised concerns about human rights in Saudi Arabia during talks with the country's crown prince. Mohammed bin Salman has begun a three-day UK visit amid protests against his country's role in the war in Yemen. The PM said ties with Saudi Arabia had saved hundreds of UK lives but she had urged full access for humanitarian aid in Yemen and a political solution. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the government of ""colluding"" in war crimes by selling arms to Riyadh. The 32-year-old crown prince, seen by some as a modernising force in the Gulf State, held talks with Mrs May and cabinet ministers at No 10 ahead of a summit at Chequers on Thursday. He has already had lunch with the Queen and Duke of York, and is due to have dinner with the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge. This video can not be played Five things about Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman The crown prince, who is regarded as being heir presumptive to the 82-year old King Salman, said there were ""huge opportunities"" to boost trade between the two countries while the UK and Saudi Arabia had to work together to deal with ""failed states...terrorist and extremist organisations"" in the Middle East. The UK hopes to capitalise on Saudi plans to open up and diversify its economy by agreeing up to Â£65bn in mutual trade and investment opportunities over the next 10 years as well as a significant role for the UK in advising on the modernisation of the Saudi schools system. But there were some protesters outside Downing Street demonstrating against the killing of Yemeni civilians in air strikes by a Saudi-led multinational coalition - backed by the UK and US - that is battling the rebel Houthi movement. Why the Saudi Crown Prince's visit matters Profile: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Yemen crisis: Who is fighting whom? The crown prince is credited with kick-starting economic and social reforms in the conservative desert kingdom, such as the upcoming lifting of the ban on women driving. Prince Mohammed bin Salman earlier had lunch with the Queen In a statement following the talks, Downing Street said Mrs May had offered assistance to ""progress and intensify these reforms, particularly on women's rights, and on universal human rights"". The prime minister expressed particular concern about the case of Raif Badawi, a Saudi bloggersentenced to 1,000 lashes and 10 years in prisonfor ""insulting Islam"" online. Many have criticised the crown prince's decisions to intervene in Yemen and impose a de facto blockade of neighbouring Qatar, as well as crack down on perceived opponents of his policies. By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale When this relative novice on the world stage arrives in London on his first global tour since taking office, he will be granted the reddest of red carpets. The Crown Prince is looking for international support for his internal economic reforms while at the same time trying to offer reassurance to nervous international investors. And the British government is keen to transform a security and defence relationship into one that includes broader economic ties as well. The UK also has an unashamed appetite for inward investment from Saudi Arabia. In other words, post-Brexit Britain will need allies, markets and money - and the Saudis are high on the UK's wish list. Read more from James The conflict in Yemen is seen as part of a regional power struggle between Saudi Arabia, which backs the government, and Iran, which supports the Houthis but denies allegations that it is sending them weapons. According to the United Nations, more than 9,000 people, over half of them civilians, have been killed and more than 52,000 wounded in fighting in Yemen since March 2015. Saudi Arabia allows women to join army Saudi to lift driving ban on women Speaking earlier at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Corbyn urged Mrs May to use her meeting to call for a halt to ""the shocking abuse of human rights in Saudi Arabia"", which he claimed included a sharp increase in the arrest and detention of dissidents, the torture of prisoners, unfair trials and executions. The PM responded by saying the UK's historic links with Saudi Arabia had saved the lives of potentially hundreds of people in this country, but she would be ""raising concerns about human rights"". Mr Corbyn added that 600,000 children in Yemen had cholera ""because of the Saudi-led bombing campaign and the blockade"", and asked why British arms sales to Saudi Arabia had ""sharply increased"". ""Germany has suspended arms sales to Saudi Arabia but British arms sales have sharply increased, and British military advisers are directing war,"" he said. ""It cannot be right that her government is colluding in what the United Nations says is evidence of war crimes. Will you use your meeting today with the crown prince to halt the arms supplies and demand an immediate ceasefire in Yemen?"" Vans carrying billboards protesting against the visit in Westminster Other vans parked in Whitehall feature a welcome to the Saudi crown prince Billboards next to London's A4 advertise the Saudi crown prince with the hashtag ""#ANewSaudiArabia"" Mrs May told the Commons everyone was ""concerned"" about the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. She said she had raised concerns about the Saudi blockades of ports in Yemen during a meeting in December, and it withdrew. ""This vindicates the engagement that we have with Saudi Arabia, to be able to sit down with them,"" she said. ""Their involvement in Yemen came at the request of the legitimate government of the Yemen, it is backed by the United Nations Security Council and as such we support it."" The prime minister's official spokesman also rejected Mr Corbyn's claims that British military advisers were ""directing the war"". ""We're not a member of that (Saudi-led) coalition; we're not involved in carrying out strikes, directing or conducting operations, or involved in the targeting decision making process,"" he said.

In an interview, Mr Hassan said he had been taken by force by the Islamic State group in Iraq and given training. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. The Old Bailey jury heard that Mr Hassan originally told police he was responsible for the bombing. They also heard graphic descriptions by victims of the explosion on the District Line on 15 September, 2017. One spoke of ""a furnace engulfed in flames"" when the device - made with materials partly sourced from Asda and Aldi - exploded at Parsons Green station during London's rush hour. This video can not be played CCTV allegedly showing Ahmed Hassan, 18, carrying hydrogen peroxide, a component for his homemade bomb Alison Morgan, prosecuting, told jurors that during a Home Office immigration interview in Croydon in January 2016, Mr Hassan was asked if he was, or had been part of a terror group in Iraq before he sought asylum in the UK. The jury heard he told officials that he had been taken by force by Isis (the Islamic State group), who had threatened to kill his uncle and brother if he resisted. Asked in the Home Office interview whether he had had any training from the Islamic State group Mr Hassan allegedly said: ""They trained us on how to kill. It was all religious based"". But he denied the Islamic State group had sent him to Europe to work for them. The court also heard that a worker for the charity Barnardos, who spoke Arabic, allegedly caught him listening to a ""call-to-arms"" song. The lyrics translated as: ""We are coming with you to the slaughter in your home/country."" Describing the attack on 15 September, one passenger, Aimee Colville, spoke of ""shards of glass flying through the air and then flames"". Jurors heard she could ""smell herself burning and saw her hair was on fire"". Thirty people were injured in the incident: some badly burned and others injured in the ""stampede"" as they fled in fear and panic, the Old Bailey was told. Alison Morgan, prosecuting, told the jurors that Mr Hassan packed a bomb with screwdrivers, knives and nails to cause ""maximum carnage"" on the rush-hour Tube. Jurors heard he bought metal items from Asda and Aldi supermarkets the day before the bombing. The court heard how Mr Hassan also researched the ingredients for TATP explosives and bought sulphuric acid on Amazon. To avoid suspicion, he allegedly used a friend's address for the delivery of the largest component - hydrogen peroxide. The device, which was on a timer, partially exploded very shortly after the crowded train arrived at Parsons Green Station during rush hour. Ms Morgan said: ""There were approximately 93 people in the carriage when the device detonated. ""The partial explosion created a large fireball. Some in the carriage were caught by the flames and sustained significant burns. ""Many ran in fear and panic. They were fortunate. Had the device fully detonated, it is inevitable that serious injury and significant damage would have been caused within the carriage."" Thirty people were injured when the device exploded on the train The court heard that, after the explosion, hundreds of people in the station tried to escape down a narrow staircase. Mr Hassan had got off the carriage at Putney Bridge Station before the bomb went off. He was arrested at the Port of Dover the next day. Ms Morgan told the jury that when first arrested and questioned by police, Mr Hassan accepted that he was ""responsible for the device"" and told them there ""may be a few milligrams traces"" of explosives at his home address. She said the device was made from the volatile chemical explosive TATP and contained 2.2kg of sockets, screws, bolts, nails, knives and screwdrivers. Jurors were told that Mr Hassan had arrived in Britain in the back of a lorry via the Channel Tunnel in October 2015. He told authorities he was born in June 1999 in Iraq, but had no identity documents. He gave his name as Ahmed Hassan Mohammed Ali. He claimed asylum, and from 2016 lived with foster parents in Cavendish Road, Sunbury in Surrey. At the time he allegedly planned his attack, his asylum claim was still outstanding, the court heard. The court heard that on the day of the attack Mr Hassan left his home shortly before 7am and took the train from Sunbury to Wimbledon. In a toilet on the concourse, he set the timer on the device before boarding the District Line, four stops from Parsons Green. Ms Morgan told jurors: ""At any point, should he have wanted to, he could have stopped the timer. He could have pulled the wires out of the device. He could have stopped the detonation. ""The CCTV footage from inside the carriage shows that at no stage did the defendant reach inside the bag to do anything."" The court heard that after ""calmly"" walking away from Putney Bridge station, Mr Hassan boarded a bus towards Earl's Court where sat on the top deck at the front. CCTV footage allegedly shows him glancing out of the window as he passes Parsons Green station. He is seen to remove the SD card from his mobile phone, chew on it and stuff it down the side of the bus seat, where it was later discovered by police in a destroyed state. Mr Hassan bought a backpack and clothes and was seen on CCTV at Ashford, wearing a blue Chelsea football shirt, the court heard. He boarded a train and arrived at Dover at around 14.30 BST where he is said to have bought a mobile phone and viewed the BBC News website which showed images of the scene he had left behind at Parsons Green.

"Save the Children ""failed"" to adequately deal with allegations against its ex-chief executive Justin Forsyth, according to leaked documents. A 2015 report seen by the BBC contains evidence suggesting then chairman Sir Alan Parker's ""very close"" relationship with Mr Forsyth may have affected how he responded to complaints. Three women employees accused Mr Forsyth of inappropriate behaviour, for which he said he had apologised. Sir Alan said he had nothing to add. A leaked email from the time recommended that Mr Forsyth should not be alone with female employees. Mr Forsyth said that he had taken ""responsibility"" for his mistakes ""many years ago"", but did ""not accept as accurate much of what has been reported today, either in tone or fact"". He said he ""strongly refutes a number of the claims"" and added that he had not seen the 2015 report. On Tuesday, protesters from the Women's Equality Party interrupted the charity's board meeting to call for Sir Alan's resignation as Chairman of Save the Children International.

Alexia Pepper de Caires, a former Save the Children employee and Women's Equality Party member, was invited to meet the board on Wednesday following the protest. ""The board now has the information it needs to make decisions on the future of (Sir Alan's) leadership,"" she said. Save the Children UK said a new review of workplace ethics would ensure that what caused previous claimants hurt ""cannot be repeated"". It said the charity's ""new leadership"" and its trustees are ""committed to respect in the workplace"". Ethics expert Dr Suzanne Shale, who is leading a new independent review for the charity, said she ""acknowledges that past events may have caused distress to staff, and disquiet amongst those who support the work of the charity. We will listen to those accounts very carefully and with utmost consideration"". Last month, the BBC revealed Mr Forsyth facedthree complaints of inappropriate behaviourtowards female staff before leaving Save the Children in 2015. Days later, Mr Forsythresigned from his roleas deputy director of UNICEF, saying he did not want coverage of his past to ""damage"" the charities. Now a report leaked to Radio 4's PM programme, which has never been made public by the charity, exposes failures in how these complaints were handled. Aid organisations 'truly sorry' for sector's failings Murdered MP's widower quits charities Aid groups report 80 harm cases What's gone wrong with the foreign aid sector? In it, a complainant claims Save the Children told her not to tell anyone about her case and that both her and Mr Forsyth's reputations were at risk. ""They weren't trying to protect me or safeguard any other women. It was just about covering this up as quickly as they could,"" she said. The report - by law firm Lewis Silkin - was commissioned as part of a review of how Save the Children had handled complaints of inappropriate behaviour. It was written in October 2015. Months later, Save the Children provided a reference for Mr Forsyth when he applied for a job at UNICEF, which made no mention of the complaints. The report was leaked to Radio 4's PM programme In a separate leaked email in 2015, a senior staff member said that allegations of sexual harassment made against Mr Forsyth were ""not being treated with the appropriate degree of seriousness"" and that ""he should not be unaccompanied with female members of staff"" until they could be sure his behaviour would not be repeated. The senior staff member wrote that they had no confidence in Sir Alan Parker's handling of the complaints, saying he had ""made a deliberate choiceâ¦not to fully investigate these allegations"" and as a result had a ""conflict of interest"" in relation to the review. As well as being the international chairman of Save the Children, Sir Alan is the founder and chairman of the PR firm Brunswick and counts former prime ministers among his friends. Gordon Brown is godfather to his youngest son, and when David Cameron left Number 10, it was Sir Alan's west London mansion that became the Camerons' temporary home. More than 240 people have signed a petition calling for Sir Alan, who was chair of Save the Children UK at the time of the complaints against Mr Forsyth, to be held accountable and removed from his current role. The petition claims ""his abuse of that power to dampen the situation is widely known"" and signatories include current and former Save the Children staff. Justin Forsyth with Samantha Cameron in Lebanon in 2013 The first case was reported in 2012. The victim described receiving numerous inappropriate text messages from Mr Forsyth, who was her boss. When she made it clear to Mr Forsyth that these texts were unwelcome and made her feel uncomfortable, he persisted in sending them. When she complained again, she alleges that he took her phone when he saw it had been left on her desk and deleted some of the texts. She then lodged an official complaint. The head of HR at the time is quoted in the report as saying: ""I thought the deleting of the texts was intimidating."" Because Save The Children never formally questioned Mr Forsyth about the allegations, the report does not reflect his account of events. His lawyers say he categorically denies that he deleted any texts. The report is clear that a disciplinary investigation should have been held but states: ""no adequate investigation took place"". Instead, Sir Alan instructed a trustee to meet the complainant for a chat. In the evidence, the trustee claims that Sir Alan briefed him in advance that he believed she may have ""overreacted"". The complainant for her part described feeling ""just so scared"" when she would see Mr Forsyth. Sir Alan wrote a formal warning to Mr Forsyth. This letter no longer exists although the report says it should have remained on Mr Forsyth's record. A draft of that letter in the report warned that ""this type of conduct can amount to unlawful harassment"". In the report, Mr Forsyth insists the complaint was dealt with appropriately, adding that he had given up his bonus - worth Â£20,000 - that year. Sir Alan was on the Performance and Remuneration Committee that awarded that bonus in 2012. The complainant said she was assured the formal warning would remain on Mr Forsyth's record and that ""if this ever happened again, Alan will walk (Mr Forsyth) out of the door."" Both failed to happen and in 2015, two more women came forward with complaints. This video can not be played Ex-Save the Children worker: 'A really toxic culture grew' The second complainant was an employee who would often go on business trips with Mr Forsyth to where Save the Children operated in the field. During these trips, according to the leaked report, she received late night text messages from him, complimenting her on her work performance and asking her out for a drink. She declined but - according to her - the messages became ""more demanding"". Between trips, Mr Forsyth invited her for ""career chats"" after work. On one occasion, Mr Forsyth is alleged to have said: ""Look, I fancy you, you fancy me. Why don't we just stop pretending?"" She says she made it clear she wasn't interested and subsequently made excuses to avoid business trips with him. He sent her emails asking if she was avoiding him and she said that since then, she felt marginalised at work. The third complainant's account set out in the report describes how one night on a business trip ""they continued their work discussion, stopping outside (Mr Forsyth's) room... and (he) invited her into his room for a glass of wine. ""She sat on the table and he invited her to sit on the bed. She declined. She went to the bathroom and when she returned, he was reclining on his bed."" On another evening, Mr Forsyth is alleged to have announced he was ""not CEO for the night"" and asked her about her love life. He began to talk about his sex life and told her she was ""beautiful and talented"". The complainant says she made it clear she was not interested and refused his advances. In a statement issued by his legal representatives, Mr Forsyth admitted ""personal mistakes during my time at Save The Children"". ""I recognise that on a few occasions I had unsuitable and thoughtless conversations with colleagues, which I subsequently discovered caused offence and hurt,"" he said. ""When this was brought to my attention on two separate occasions, I apologised unreservedly to the three colleagues involved.  The concerns were handled through a process of mediation."" After the two later complaints, Save the Children's head of HR alerted Sir Alan, but evidence in the report shows he claimed he received a ""less than supportive response"". Recalling a conversation with Sir Alan, he said it was ""along the lines of 'Justin Forsyth is very important to the organisation; people behave differently when they're abroad; they would have been tired; they would have needed some mutual support; what were the complainants doing by agreeing to go to his hotel room in the first place."" The account goes on to record that the head of HR was ""frustrated"" by Sir Alan's response, ""which he feared was as a result of Sir Alan Parker and Justin Forsyth being very close"". One complainant is quoted in the report saying: ""It's more about who Alan is and having Alan and his best mate Justin sort of talking to each other about how best to handle these girls."" The husband of murdered MP Jo Cox, Brendan Cox, admitted to ""inappropriate"" behaviour while working for Save the Children. According to the report, Sir Alan said he didn't think there had been any ""serious misconduct"" or ""predatory behaviour"". He also rejected suggestions there should be any work done to look at the ""leadership culture"" at Save the Children in light of these complaints and ""generalised complaints of sexual advances and bullying"" by Brendan Cox, the widower of the MP Jo Cox, who was accused of sexual assault by a member of staff at the charity a couple of months later. Mr Cox says he does not accept the allegations, but acknowledges he ""made mistakes"" while working for Save the Children. Sir Alan is described as saying, ""the best way to protect the organisation from reputational risk is not to let the organisational response become disproportionate"".

" On the morning of any wedding there’s a lot of preparation. On 4 November, Monika’s hair needed doing and her make-up had to be artfully applied. The bride needed her maroon wedding sari put on, as tradition dictated. The jewellery set aside for this special day had to be placed on her ears and nose and draped across her neck. For this Indian wedding, her hands needed to be daubed with intricate swirls of henna too. There was so much to do. But with only a few hours to go until the ceremony, no-one noticed as the bride herself quietly slipped into the shadows of the family home to make one last phone call. It was not to a friend, or a caterer, or the wedding venue to check everything was going smoothly. Instead, nervously, Monika dialled four digits - 1098 - the number of a helpline. Too young to marry under Indian law, Monika wanted to stop her own wedding. She was 13 when her marriage was meant to happen. That’s according to the charity that helped her, and comes from her school records. Her parents claim she’s more like 17. It’s common in this part of India for the ages of some people to be a little hazy. Birth certificates often don’t exist for poor families like Monika’s. What is not in doubt is that she is still a child, and that the law only allows marriage at 18. The city may not be as well known a tourist location as Jaipur or Jodhpur but it is still one of those places which assails every sense. Ganesh passed grocery stalls piled high with a rainbow of vegetables and endured the piercing horns of tuk-tuks hurtling through the streets and the smell of fresh camel dung at the roadside. On his return later that evening, he and Monika’s mother, Sita, sat their daughter down and told her that they had found her someone to marry. “Mummy and Papa told me they’d found a boy for me in Churu [115 miles away] and that he was very nice and educated and worked as a labourer,” recalls Monika. I felt that I was too young and that I shouldn’t marry - I wanted to get an education and become a teacher” When I ask her to describe her then husband-to-be she says simply, without any drama or emotion, that she had never met him but her parents did show her a photograph. He was 22. As an obedient daughter, her first instinct was to do as her parents wished but her emotions were in turmoil. “I felt that I was too young and that I shouldn’t marry. I wanted to get an education and become a teacher.” Monika pleaded with her parents. “I told them that I didn’t want to get married, and they asked why, so I explained that a girl should be at least 18 years old.” Marriage would have meant a life of isolation. Her prospective husband lived a four-hour train journey away from her own family.  “After getting married, life would have been spent only in this new home. Nobody would have allowed me to play, or talk, and I would have had to take care of all the household chores. My in-laws would have made me do a lot of work - and only work.” So why did Monika’s parents think it was right to marry off their daughter so young? The city may not be as well known a tourist location as Jaipur or Jodhpur but it is still one of those places which assails every sense.

Nobody would have allowed me to play, or talk, and I would have had to take care of all the household chores. My in-laws would have made me do a lot of work - and only work.” So why did Monika’s parents think it was right to marry off their daughter so young? As we sit and drink tea in the small, simply tiled courtyard of their home, it’s clear Ganesh and Sita are loving parents to their five daughters, but life is a struggle. Ganesh earns 500 rupees a day (£5.50) and his work is sporadic. His bike is propped against the yard wall, ready if a job suddenly comes up. The family is from the Valmiki - or sweeper - caste. In the past, that would have meant they were classed in the untouchables of Indian society. Even today they are very much on the fringes of their local community and they only mix with other families from the same caste. Monika’s mother and grandmother clear waste from houses in the neighbourhood. As is often the case with families from this background, the older daughters have only received a little education. Indeed, when I ask Monika how many school friends she has, she replies matter-of-factly that she doesn’t have any. Her studies seem to have petered out. It sounds like a solitary existence for a teenager. Stacked in the corner of one of the rooms off the courtyard is a pile of furniture. It includes a sturdy chest with a lock on it and a brand new fridge in all its original packaging. This is puzzling as the house doesn’t appear to have a working fridge of its own. Ganesh This jealously guarded hoard is Monika’s dowry - painstakingly saved up by her father for the day she marries. Ganesh sees his prime responsibility as getting his daughters married and settled down. His eldest daughter, Rajini, was due to marry legally in November. Her groom had a brother and Monika’s family thought it made sense to have a double wedding. “We thought that if we marry two daughters at the same time then the costs would only be for one wedding and not two,” explains her father. “We are a family of labourers and sometimes I get jobs in construction work but sometimes I don’t. We thought since we are marrying our one child we will marry another one and save on the expense.” But what they had planned for Monika was illegal under Indian law. Ganesh looks awkwardly at his hands. “We did know that it is a criminal offence. We did feel bad.” Sita For Sita, though, it’s as if their circumstances didn’t leave them much choice. “What should we do?” she says as she shrugs her shoulders. The marriage was also arranged with Monika’s personal safety in mind, Sita argues. “When we go out for work, we worry about leaving our daughter alone at home as the neighbourhood where we live is unsafe. It was out of the fear for her security that we thought that we would marry off both sisters together.” These kind of multiple marriages are common in Rajasthan. Often, only the oldest girl’s name is mentioned on the invitation. It makes it much harder for the authorities to detect a child marriage when there is the cover of a perfectly legal marriage happening simultaneously. But in Monika’s case the authorities received a tip-off. It came from the bride herself. As Monika sits alongside her parents and recounts her story, she seems to bear them no ill will. But last year, as the wedding drew nearer, it must have been a time of immense tension. She does not appear to be a natural teenage rebel and her shy mannerisms suggest a girl who is still finding her own voice in the world. Yet somewhere within she found the strength to kick back against the plans her family had made. The trigger point for Monika came on the wedding day. “When I saw my sister wearing her wedding dress, I realised that only she could do this - I just couldn’t.” Her gut feeling drove her to call the national hotline - ChildLine. Monika had seen the easy-to-remember number - 10-9-8 - in books. She borrowed a phone from her unwitting grandmother and rang. The wedding was then only hours away. She was afraid but this was her last resort. “I called up and I don’t know who picked up the phone but I told them everything - that I’m young and I don’t want to get married and want to study further. “I asked them ‘can you please do something that stops my marriage?’.” The helpline operator in Delhi tried to calm her down. They took details of her location and the time of the wedding. The message, Monika recalls, was “don’t worry we’re on our way”. She’s often in a race against time to save young girls from becoming child brides and can be seen zipping around town on her small white moped. “We had a tricky challenge as we had to save a child in just three hours’ time,” Preeti says. Over the phone, she managed to win Monika’s trust and talk her through what would happen next. Local police were scrambled and arrived at Monika’s house at about 17:00. The officers asked to see the paperwork - of which there was little - and after establishing that the bride was underage they warned everyone that the wedding could not take place. But the family ignored the police and at 20:00 Monika rang Preeti again. Her parents had changed the wedding venue to her grandmother’s house and were still trying to marry her off. “This was a change of venue to hide the wedding,” explains Preeti. “So we again contacted the police department. Myself, a female constable and two male police officers reached the new venue for the wedding at 22:00.” It was just in the nick of time. “Monika was in her wedding dress and when she saw us she gave a little smile, although she didn’t say anything at that time. She knew that we had come to stop her wedding. She was happy then.” The rest of the wedding party were bemused. “There were relatives all around who were asking each other in low murmurs about why the police had arrived.” No-one knew who had reported the wedding to the police. It is only now that Monika is happy for it to be known that she made the mystery call. The next task for Preeti and the police was to make sure the parents understood the gravity of the situation. “We called Monika’s parents and grandparents into a room and explained that not only does the child suffer because of early marriage but they too could also face a punishment for this offence. “So they stopped the wedding and the police took a written testimony from them promising they would not marry her before the age of 18. They were warned if they went ahead with it a second time then they would have to serve a prison sentence.” Preeti has seen between 20 and 25 cases of child marriage crossing her desk since the beginning of January this year. The winter months are part of the traditional marriage season in Rajasthan. Source:Unicef Child marriage was banned in India in 2006 but it is still widespread. With its huge population, India remains the country with the most child brides, according to Unicef. Preeti sees herself as a big sister figure for girls like Monika and admits to immense job satisfaction. “In my career I have stopped several weddings and when I come into direct contact with these girls we often stay in touch forever. I feel real pride that I am able to help them salvage their lives and protect their futures. It makes me feel happy.” It’s midday in the village of Husangsar in the middle of the Thar Desert in Rajasthan. All around, the sand dunes reflect the fierce sun, dazzling the unprepared visitor. Some of the houses here are just simple wooden huts with parched-looking thatching on top. Local children crowd round a tap on the wall of a schoolhouse - cupping their hands and dipping their heads as they slurp up the water. Inside the girls’ school, I ask the pupils whether they know any friends who have been married young. They turn in unison and point to one of their number who they say was married aged 10. Her name is Pooja. She’s dressed demurely in a caramel-coloured tunic and wearing a beaded necklace. As with Monika, there’s slight confusion over Pooja’s real age. She is in the school year for 14 to 15-year-olds, though she tells me she’s a couple of years older. At first, like any self-conscious teenager, Pooja seems a little intimidated by the sea of faces turned eagerly to hear her story. But, after a nod of encouragement from her teacher, she visibly relaxes and starts to talk: Pooja’s parents have agreed to delaygauna- the moment when a bride is sent to live with her husband’s family and the time when she is expected to have sex. This way, Pooja at least gets to have some schooling and doesn’t suffer the physical complications of early pregnancy. Even so, the message Pooja has had at school is that early marriage is wrong. “Our teacher says a girl should be at least 18 and a boy at least 21 when they wed.” And then she says something that sounds more from the heart than from a textbook: “Girls should be educated. I want to say this to all the villagers - don’t get underage girls married. Don’t ruin their life. If someone does that forcefully, call ChildLine on 10-9-8. This will help stop child marriage.” Outside a crowd of 300 has gathered. They are sitting under a huge awning in the middle of a sandy school playground. Most of them are either children in their school uniforms or from the local boys’ youth club. But the older generations are represented too. Mothers and grandmothers in their diaphanous pink veils and old men in turbans with deep lines etched on their faces. Word goes round that the performance is about to start. They’re all here to see a puppet show staged by the Urmul Trust. The storyline is simple - a young girl named Gudki is told by her father that she is to be married off early. Her mother protests because she wants her daughter to have time to play and develop as a teenager. She pleads with the father to reconsider. He insists, however, so Gudki marries and goes to live with her new family. When the father later pays a visit to the in-laws’ house he discovers his daughter died in childbirth. It may only be a puppet show but many of those in the audience are weeping. Watching from the sidelines is Arvind Ojha, the avuncular figure who leads the Urmul Trust. “Look how totally involved everybody is,” he gestures to the spellbound audience. “With that involvement comes a transformation. We don’t just focus on engaging women and children in these programmes but also older people and even religious leaders. Using folk media is very effective.” He has been working in western Rajasthan since 1986. The state has one of the worst child marriage rates in India - only behind Bihar and West Bengal. According to the National Family Health Survey, 35% of young Rajasthani women are married off before the age of 18 - the national average is 27%. But Ojha is sure that things are improving, mainly because of the way villages have gradually embraced girls’ education. Arvind Ojha, Urmul Trust Before the puppet show audience breaks up for lunch there is a poignant moment where all present - including Pooja and her friends - rise to their feet and raise an arm. The entire village of Husangsar is taking an oath to observe the law and make their community a child marriage-free zone from now on. In the surrounding districts, 178 villages have taken this same oath. Our next stop is the village of Lunkaransar, home to a girls’ boarding school and also in the Thar Desert. It’s a collection of low white buildings with a few Indian lilacs - or neem trees - providing shade in the centre. Here a group of schoolgirls are singing and clapping as they sit on wooden benches. Two or three have even got to their feet and are dancing with all the panache of Bollywood film stars. A formidable young woman named Radika Swami runs this music session. Now in her early 20s, she became something of an activist on child marriage after she was told she would marry aged 17. Radika’s story has some parallels to Monika’s. Radika Swami Both Radika’s mother and grandmother had been child brides so this was not a custom easily broken. But, through the sheer force of her personality, Radika persuaded her father and grandfather to keep her in education and break off the engagement. Now she works as a warden at this school campus teaching other girls about the importance of sticking with their studies. Radika Swami refused to marry in her teens Through music and drama, Radika tries to raise awareness. She has written a play on the subject of female foeticide - the selective abortion of girls in the womb. Although it is supposed to be illegal in India, it is still widely practised in states such as Rajasthan. In 2011, Rajasthan had 888 girls for every 1,000 boys below the age of six. This skewed sex ratio leads to a shortage of girls of marriageable age which, in turn, fuels the demand for child brides. Radika is sure much more needs to be done to involve boys in prevention work.  “Communities can take time in listening to what girls are saying, but with boys they are always heard instantly. So if we work with both sexes then we will get 100% results.” Across the world, 12 million girls every year marry before the age of 18 - that’s one in every five, according to children’s charity Unicef. A decade ago that figure was one in four but new analysis from Unicef suggests there has been significant progress in recent years, particularly in South Asia. In fact, in the past decade a girl in South Asia has seen her risk of being married off early drop from 50% to 30%. India is one of the countries which has led the way. Campaigners say that success now needs to be copied in sub-Saharan Africa. Niger, for example, remains the country with the highest overall rate (76%) of child marriage in the world. Source:Unicef It isn’t only a problem in the developing world. Child marriage even persists in some communities in Europe and North America. The marriageable age in many European countries is 16 with parental consent. There are a number of reasons for the practice. In cases like Monika’s, poverty is key. But campaigners say it’s primarily an issue of gender inequality. “Fundamentally, it happens to girls because they are seen as being less valuable than boys,” says Lakshmi Sundaram from Girls Not Brides, a global partnership of more than 900 civil society organisations. “Girls do not get given the same opportunities as boys. So if a family only has money to send one child to school, they will send the boy and not the girl. If they only have enough food to feed a certain number of their children, they will marry off the girl so that they can consolidate their resources.” Global statistics suggest it is most common in rural areas and child brides are more likely to have low levels of education. According to Sundaram, schools are one of the best forms of protection: “When a girl is in school there’s a feeling from the whole community that this is a student and a child who should be allowed to stay on that trajectory and finish their studies. But as soon as she comes out of that school she’s then seen as a future wife and mother. So families often think ‘why don’t we just hurry it up - what are we waiting for?’.” Many countries now have laws which set the minimum age of marriage at 18 but it is often allowed to be lower with parental consent or the judgement of a court. Campaigners say one of the best strategies is to involve religious leaders or tribal elders in the campaign to end child marriage. Once these figures of authority are on board, public opinion in the wider community can change very quickly. Some countries have started offering cash handouts to families if they agree to leave their daughters in school. Technology can be useful as well. One charity - Vikalp Sansthan - uses phone notifications to warn wedding photographers and make-up artists that their involvement in any underage nuptials will result in legal action. Above all, a better sense of the costs of child marriage is now emerging. This includes not only the physical problems of domestic violence and early pregnancy but the mental toll it takes on young brides too. “Girls... are seen as being less valuable than boys” And there could be an economic dividend from lower population growth and more girls completing their education, staying healthier and getting better jobs. While it is good news that child marriage cases are falling across the world, Sundaram is adamant there’s no room for complacency: “The rates of child marriage are declining but because of population growth the actual numbers of child brides continue to increase. So we have to accelerate progress if those numbers are to come down more dramatically in future.” There’s a commotion outside Monika’s house as word spreads round the neighbourhood that the BBC has come from London to interview her. “Is this about the wedding that was called off?” a nosey neighbour asks our translator. That alone gives you a sense of how big a deal it was for a young girl to report her parents. In a strange way, you can see Monika’s mother is actually proud of what her daughter did. “Yes, I feel good about it,” admits Sita. “I really rather like the idea that my daughter has done it. Change has come for all.” For her part, Monika is certain that she did the right thing and wants her story told: “I am glad that my experience will be shared with others. Maybe some other girl will learn from my case and she too can stop her child marriage. And if she can’t stop it, then I will even help her out myself!” What is so striking about Rajasthan is how girls like Monika are taking the fight against child marriage into their own hands, in a culture where their voices are often not heard. The education these girls receive, though it’s often limited, is teaching them that they should not be married off before 18. It feels inconceivable that 10 or 20 years ago this kind of bottom-up resistance would have existed in poor urban areas or remote desert villages. Back then, girls would have been more pliant in accepting their fate as it was seen by a patriarchal society. Now it seems like there is the prospect of real change. Not everything is perfect for Monika. She tells us wistfully she would like to return to school - something the Urmul Trust is trying to arrange. But as she sits with her new friend, Preeti, on the porch of the family home watching the world go by in the evening twilight, it’s easy to see how just how young she is and what a lucky escape she’s had. A childhood was nearly lost. Now - through an act of teenage rebellion - a childhood has been regained. Built with Shorthand",Negative,0.003296316
"Ahmed Hassan, 18, denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life The man accused of the Parsons Green Tube bombing told officials months before the attack that he had been ""trained to kill"", a court has heard. Jurors heard that asylum seeker Ahmed Hassan spoke to Home Office officials in January 2016 - 20 months before the bombing that injured 30 people. In an interview, Mr Hassan said he had been taken by force by the Islamic State group in Iraq and given training. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. The Old Bailey jury heard that Mr Hassan originally told police he was responsible for the bombing. They also heard graphic descriptions by victims of the explosion on the District Line on 15 September, 2017. One spoke of ""a furnace engulfed in flames"" when the device - made with materials partly sourced from Asda and Aldi - exploded at Parsons Green station during London's rush hour. This video can not be played CCTV allegedly showing Ahmed Hassan, 18, carrying hydrogen peroxide, a component for his homemade bomb Alison Morgan, prosecuting, told jurors that during a Home Office immigration interview in Croydon in January 2016, Mr Hassan was asked if he was, or had been part of a terror group in Iraq before he sought asylum in the UK. The jury heard he told officials that he had been taken by force by Isis (the Islamic State group), who had threatened to kill his uncle and brother if he resisted. Asked in the Home Office interview whether he had had any training from the Islamic State group Mr Hassan allegedly said: ""They trained us on how to kill. It was all religious based"". But he denied the Islamic State group had sent him to Europe to work for them. The court also heard that a worker for the charity Barnardos, who spoke Arabic, allegedly caught him listening to a ""call-to-arms"" song. The lyrics translated as: ""We are coming with you to the slaughter in your home/country."" Describing the attack on 15 September, one passenger, Aimee Colville, spoke of ""shards of glass flying through the air and then flames"". Jurors heard she could ""smell herself burning and saw her hair was on fire"". Thirty people were injured in the incident: some badly burned and others injured in the ""stampede"" as they fled in fear and panic, the Old Bailey was told. Alison Morgan, prosecuting, told the jurors that Mr Hassan packed a bomb with screwdrivers, knives and nails to cause ""maximum carnage"" on the rush-hour Tube. Jurors heard he bought metal items from Asda and Aldi supermarkets the day before the bombing. The court heard how Mr Hassan also researched the ingredients for TATP explosives and bought sulphuric acid on Amazon. To avoid suspicion, he allegedly used a friend's address for the delivery of the largest component - hydrogen peroxide. The device, which was on a timer, partially exploded very shortly after the crowded train arrived at Parsons Green Station during rush hour. Ms Morgan said: ""There were approximately 93 people in the carriage when the device detonated. ""The partial explosion created a large fireball. Some in the carriage were caught by the flames and sustained significant burns. ""Many ran in fear and panic. They were fortunate. Had the device fully detonated, it is inevitable that serious injury and significant damage would have been caused within the carriage."" Thirty people were injured when the device exploded on the train The court heard that, after the explosion, hundreds of people in the station tried to escape down a narrow staircase. Mr Hassan had got off the carriage at Putney Bridge Station before the bomb went off. He was arrested at the Port of Dover the next day. Ms Morgan told the jury that when first arrested and questioned by police, Mr Hassan accepted that he was ""responsible for the device"" and told them there ""may be a few milligrams traces"" of explosives at his home address. She said the device was made from the volatile chemical explosive TATP and contained 2.2kg of sockets, screws, bolts, nails, knives and screwdrivers. Jurors were told that Mr Hassan had arrived in Britain in the back of a lorry via the Channel Tunnel in October 2015. He told authorities he was born in June 1999 in Iraq, but had no identity documents. He gave his name as Ahmed Hassan Mohammed Ali. He claimed asylum, and from 2016 lived with foster parents in Cavendish Road, Sunbury in Surrey. At the time he allegedly planned his attack, his asylum claim was still outstanding, the court heard. The court heard that on the day of the attack Mr Hassan left his home shortly before 7am and took the train from Sunbury to Wimbledon. In a toilet on the concourse, he set the timer on the device before boarding the District Line, four stops from Parsons Green. Ms Morgan told jurors: ""At any point, should he have wanted to, he could have stopped the timer. He could have pulled the wires out of the device. He could have stopped the detonation. ""The CCTV footage from inside the carriage shows that at no stage did the defendant reach inside the bag to do anything."" The court heard that after ""calmly"" walking away from Putney Bridge station, Mr Hassan boarded a bus towards Earl's Court where sat on the top deck at the front. CCTV footage allegedly shows him glancing out of the window as he passes Parsons Green station. He is seen to remove the SD card from his mobile phone, chew on it and stuff it down the side of the bus seat, where it was later discovered by police in a destroyed state. Mr Hassan bought a backpack and clothes and was seen on CCTV at Ashford, wearing a blue Chelsea football shirt, the court heard. He boarded a train and arrived at Dover at around 14.30 BST where he is said to have bought a mobile phone and viewed the BBC News website which showed images of the scene he had left behind at Parsons Green.

"Theresa May went head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn in the House of Commons. Here's what happened. The Labour leader went for a double-header this week - starting with a call to end arms sales to Saudi Arabia before switching, rather abruptly, to an attack on the government's ""shameful"" record on rough sleeping. But the exchanges got off to an unusual start with the PM accusing Mr Corbyn of ""mansplaining"", after he reminded her that tomorrow was International Women's Day. Mrs May, a self-declared feminist, gave him a hard stare that would make Paddington blush. This video can not be played The PM tells Jeremy Corbyn: ""I think that's what's called mansplaining"" The visit of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the UK gave the Labour leader a chance to get stuck into one of his longstanding concerns - human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia. Would the PM be raising them ""when she makes her arms sales pitch"" to the Saudi leader? Mrs May gave a robust defence of the UK's ""historic and important"" links with Saudi Arabia, which she claimed had saved ""hundreds"" of lives in the UK through counter-terrorism co-operation, but added: ""I will raise human rights concerns with the Crown Prince when I meet him later."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn calls on the PM to address the ""shocking abuse of human rights"" in Saudi Arabia Mr Corbyn accused the government of ""suppressing"" a report into the funding of extremism in the UK - and called for the suspension of UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia, highlighting the ""humanitarian disaster"" in Yemen he said had been caused by ""Saudi-led bombing and a blockade"". He called for an urgent ceasefire and even accused the UK government of ""colluding with war crimes"". This video can not be played Corbyn: UK military advisers directing Yemen war The extremism funding report had not been published because of ""personal content"", said the PM, but senior MPs on the Privy Council could take a look at it. As for Yemen it was down to ""all parties"" in the conflict to ""ensure humanitarian aid got through"". Mr Corbyn continued to press for an ""urgent ceasefire"" in Yemen - and then switched to a question about why rough sleeping had ""doubled"" under the Conservatives. It wrong-footed Mrs May, who had quite a bit more to say about arms exports to Saudi Arabia, including some quotes from Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry, who, she seemed to be suggesting, had supported her position in an interview with the Today programme this morning. As for rough sleeping, the government was pouring ""millions"" into the problem, she claimed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There was a small moment of triumph for Mrs May as Mr Corbyn told her that a rough sleeping task force set up 2010 had never met. ""It met today,"" she informed the Labour leader with a smile. Mr Corbyn continued, accusing the government of lacking ambition in the face of a ""crisis"" that was ""a mark of national shame"", throwing in a quote from Barry, who volunteers at a homeless shelter in Southampton, who, like him, believed government cuts were to blame. Mrs May said it wasn't just about money or holding meetings - the government was running ""48 projects"" to tackle rough sleeping -  before rounding off with a quote from Mr Corbyn who had once apparently said Labour's policies on homelessness had caused ""misery and despair"".

And here is BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy's take on it: Maybe it's the lack Tory of blowback from her big Brexit speech last week, but whatever the reason, Theresa May seemed more confident and less careworn at the dispatch box, today. And maybe Jeremy Corbyn's line of attack was just too predictableâ¦.The International Women's Day line about the PM raising women's rights issues between pitching for arms sales with the visiting Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia was effective, but was trumped by her ""mansplaining"" riposte. It clearly delighted her backbenchers, and whether it was pre-prepared or an ad lib, it set the tone for the remainder of her exchanges with the Labour Leader. Nor will Mr Corbyn have enjoyed being countered with quotes from his own shadow foreign secretary and close-ish ally, Emily Thornberry, when the subject moved on to the wider UK relationship with Saudi Arabia. In fact, several moments in this PMQs highlighted the efficiency and effectiveness of her behind the scenes preparation for these appearances. Another example was the PM's answer to York Labour MP Rachael Maskell. She parried a question about rising homelessness in York with a rebuke to the local council, saying it had failed to produce a local plan which would allocate land for more housing. So gold stars to the Downing St PPSs, Seema Kennedy and George Hollingbery, and the team behind them. Mr Corbyn's best moment came when he asked about rising homelessness - but he did not score heavily in the ensuing policy joust. Nor did the SNP Leader Ian Blackford, when he raised branch closures by the state-owned RBS, for the third week running. This produced a patient, even weary, explanation that ministers did not second guess commercial decisions. When backbenchers got their chance - in a 48 minute PMQs today, more than half the time was absorbed by the front bench exchanges - there was an example of an increasingly important function of this occasion. Increasingly, select committee chairs have realised they can enlist government support for their activities - the question from the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee chairman Neil Parrish, about the concerns raised by the big joint inquiry into air quality won a sympathetic response from Theresa May. This was a more sure-footed prime minister; but it is too soon to suggest her points victory in this particular bout portends a more lasting ascendency. PMQs remains a contest between two, at best, middling Parliamentarians. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Police released CCTV showing two suspects arriving at Gatwick Airport on 2 March, whom the UK believes are from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU On 4 March, a former Russian spy and his daughter were found seriously ill on a bench in Salisbury. They had been poisoned by a nerve agent, in an attack ""almost certainly"" approved by the Russian state. An extraordinary series of accusations and denials from the highest levels of governments came in the months that followed, culminating in diplomatic expulsions and international sanctions. The attack on Sergei Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury, left them hospitalised for weeks. Police linked the attack to another poisoning in June in which Dawn Sturgess and her partner Charlie Rowley were exposed to Novichok in nearby Amesbury, after handling a contaminated perfume dispenser. Ms Sturgess died in hospital in July. This video can not be played Dominic Casciani shows us the locations where Sergei Skripal spent Sunday 4 March with his daughter Yulia Skripal flew into London's Heathrow Airport from Russia at about 14:40 GMT on Saturday, 3 March On Sunday, 4 March, at about 09:15 GMT, Mr Skripal's car was seen in Salisbury around London Road, Churchill Way North and Wilton Road At 13:30 GMT his car was seen driving down Devizes Road, towards the town centre Mr Skripal and his daughter arrived at the Sainsbury's upper level car park at the Maltings shopping precinct at 13:40 GMT Police said the pair went to The Mill pub before going to Zizzi restaurant at 14:20 GMT, where they stayed until 15:35 GMT At 16:15 GMT, emergency services received the first report of an incident Police found the pair on a bench outside Zizzi in an ""extremely serious condition"" Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who fell ill after attending the incident, was treated in hospital but discharged on 22 March Det Sgt Nick Bailey was seriously ill 48 people were assessed in hospital in relation to the incident Ms Skripal was released from hospital on 9 April and her father was discharged on 18 May. Both were taken to a secure location Police believe the Skripals were ""targeted specifically"" and are treating the case as attempted murder. Detectives believe the pair first came into contact with the nerve agent Novichok at the front door of their home. Traces of Novichok were alsofound at the Mill and Zizzi, where the Skripals spent the afternoon. Up to 500 people who visited the pub or the restaurant at the same time weretold to wash their clothes and possessions. Officers later focused searches in and around Mr Skripal's home and a nearby children's play area at Montgomery Gardens was cordoned off by police. Police appealed for anyone who saw the pair in Mr Skripal's red BMW - licence plate number HD09 WAO - on the morning of the attack. Police are appealing for witnesses who saw Mr Skripal's car on the morning of the incident A vehicle that is believed to have been used by Mr Skripal's friend to pick up Yulia from the airport on 3 March was removed from Durrington, Wiltshire, by the Army on 19 March. Witness Jamie Paine said he saw a woman on a bench frothing at the mouth and her eyes ""were wide open but completely white"". A doctor, who was shopping with her husband in the city centre on Sunday, said Ms Skripal was ""slumped in her seat, completely unconscious"" and had lost control of her bodily functions. This video can not be played Witness: ""They looked like they'd been taking something quite strong"" The investigation has so far involved 250 specialist counter-terrorism officers and about 180 military personnel, who were deployed to Salisbury to help remove vehicles and objects that may have been contaminated. Prof Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, stressed the risk of harm to the public was ""low"" but there was some concern that prolonged exposure could cause health problems. Personnel from the Defence Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Centre at Porton Down in Wiltshire identified the nerve agent. Its head saidthe precise source of the nerve agent had not been verified, but it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"". Experts from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) tested samples of the chemical. Russia accused Britain of blocking access to the OPCW inquiry, but its proposal for a new, joint investigationwas voted down at the international chemical weapons watchdog at The Hagueon 4 April. Russia lost the vote by 15 votes to six, while 17 member states abstained. Police are appealing for information on Alexander Petrov (left) and Ruslan Boshirov Two Russian nationals, who go by the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, are suspects in the attempted murder. They are understood to have arrived at Gatwick Airport on Russian passports from Moscow on 2 March, and stayed at the City Stay Hotel in Bow Road, east London. The following day they visited Salisbury for reconnaissance before contaminating Mr Skripal's front door with Novichok on 4 March, police say. Officers believe a modified perfume bottle was used to spray the door. The pair flew from Heathrow to Moscow later that same night. The men, whose movements were captured on various CCTV cameras, are thought to be aged about 40 and operating under aliases. The officers are thought to be from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, and the attack was ""almost certainly"" approved at a senior level of the Russian state, Theresa May has said. In an interview with Russia's state-run international broadcaster, RT, the men said they were tourists, in the UK to visit the ""wonderful town"" of Salisbury andsee its famous cathedral. Details have since emerged showing the man calling himself Alexander Petrov has made around 10 trips to Europe in the last two years. Documents first obtained by the investigative group Bellingcat, shared with the BBC, show that as well as visiting Paris, Geneva and Amsterdam, he appears to have visited the UK three times. He seems to have visited once in September 2016, again between 28 February and 5 March 2017 and finally in March this year- during the period Sergei Skripal was poisoned. On the final visit, the pair both travelled on genuine Russian passports. Recently published pages from Mr Petrov's passport dossiers contain unusual stamps and a blank page where there is normally biographical data - all evidence which may point to the men being undercover intelligence officers, BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said. An investigation by Bellingcat has claimed thereal identity of the man calling himself Ruslan Boshirov is actually Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga- a highly decorated military officer. Bellingcat later said the suspect calling himselfAlexander Petrov is Alexander Mishkin, a doctorwho has worked for Russian intelligence since 2010. This video can not be played President Vladimir Putin says the suspects are civilians Since the attack, the Kremlin's media machine has responded with a combination of denials and sarcasm. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the two suspects are civilians, not criminals and he hoped the men would tell their story soon. A day later an interview with the men was broadcast by Russia's state-run international broadcaster. The Russian foreign ministry had previously called Mrs May's allegations ""insane"", and said the names and photographs of the two suspects ""do not mean anything to Moscow"". At a UN Security Council meeting in September to discuss the attack, Russia dismissed evidence presented by the UK as ""lies"". In a lengthy rebuttal of the allegations, Russia accused the UK of ""disgusting anti-Russian hysteria"". Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, accused the British authorities of ""Russiaphobia"" and misleading the international community and its own citizens. Mission implausible: Russians mock improbable spy duo Skripal suspects: 'We were just tourists' Putin, power and poison: Russiaâs elite FSB spy club Previously, a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman said the UK was one of the most likely sources of the nerve agent, along with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden or possibly the United States. Another theory - offered by Russia's EU ambassador, Vladimir Chizhov - suggested a UK research laboratory in Wiltshire could be the source. No. Prosecutors will not apply to Russia for the men to be extradited because Russia does not have extradition agreements with the UK. However, a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained, should they travel to the EU. Sue Hemming, of the UK Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said there was enough evidence to provide a ""realistic prospect of conviction"" and it was ""clearly in the public interest"" to charge them with the Salisbury attack. Police say officers continue to work with the CPS on the Amesbury incident. Could the suspects be returned to the UK? Col Skripal, 66, had been living in Salisbury after being released by Russia in 2010 Colonel Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence officer who was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. He was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. He was later flown to the UK. In recent years Mr Skripal is thought to have given lectures at military academies offering insights into Russia's foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU. A friend from college, Vladimir Svyatski, described Mr Skripal as ""very active, with a positive attitude and creative"". Former colleague Oleg Ivanov told the BBC he was ""the life and soul of the party"". Hiscondition improved from critical to stableon 6 April, and Salisbury District Hospital said he was  responding well to treatment and ""improving rapidly"". He was discharged on 18 May and moved to a secure location. Read more about the poisoned spy Skripal and the 14 deaths under scrutiny Yulia Skripal, from Moscow, was found on the bench alongside her father His daughter, Yulia, regularly travelled to the UK from her Moscow home to visit her father, relatives told the BBC. ""She told me she liked everything [in the UK],"" childhood friend Irina Petrova said. ""They had an amazing place, and amazing house."" She had an ""excellent"" relationship with her father, Ms Petrova said, and had been the ""perfect kid"", achieving excellent grades at school. Ms Skripal, who friends say worked for multinationals including Nike and PepsiCo, was ""always smiling, just like her mother"", Ms Petrova added. The 33-year-old was discharged from Salisbury District Hospital on 9 April and taken to a secure location. It is not known what long-term effects she might suffer. This video can not be played CCTV shows Sergei Skripal at a shop in Salisbury just five days before he and his daughter collapsed Mr Skripal's wife, Liudmila, died in 2012 after suffering from cancer. His elder brother and son have died in the past two years. Some of the deaths, the family believe, happened in suspicious circumstances. The grave of Liudmila Skripal, Sergei's wife, is in London Road Cemetery in Salisbury His son, Alexander Skripal, died aged 43 last July in St Petersburg from liver failure. He is buried in Salisbury, close to his mother. Mr Skripal's family deny that he worked for MI6 and believe that the espionage case was fabricated by Russia. On 5 April, an unverified recording purported to be between Yulia Skripal and her cousin, Viktoria Skripal, who lives in Russia, was broadcast on Russian TV. In the recording, Viktoria said she hoped to travel to the UK to visit her relatives, if she can get a visa, but the voice said to be Yulia's tells her that no-one will give her one. The Foreign Office said its Moscow embassy was expected to give Viktoria a visa and that she would be given full consular help in the UK. Doubts have been cast on the authenticity of the recording. In the weeks after the poisoning, Theresa May pointed the finger at Russia and expelled 23 Russian diplomats and their families from the UK. She also said: Ministers and the Royal Family would not attend the Fifa World Cup in Russia Russian state assets would be frozen if there was evidence they would be used as a weapon against UK nationals and residents Checks on private flights, customs and freight would be increased All planned high-level contacts between the UK and Russia would be suspended The state invitation to Russian's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov was retracted In solidarity, 29 countries, including the US, Canada, Germany and France, expelled 145 Russian officials - and Nato ordered 10 Russians out of its mission in Belgium. Moscow initially responded in kind, expelling 23 British diplomats, 60 US diplomats and several from other countries. It also closed the British Council in Russia and the British Consulate in St Petersburg. Russia then increased that number to 50, as its ambassador in the UK said Moscow had no nerve agent stockpile. Since the UK named the two suspects, US, France, Germany and Canada have agreed that the Russian government ""almost certainly"" approved the poisoning of the Skripals. Together they have urged Russia to provide full disclosure of its Novichok programme. Referring to the expulsion of Russian diplomats from their countries, the leaders said they had already ""taken action together to disrupt the activities of the GRU"". GRU officers are often stationed in embassies around the world. Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley were poisoned by Novichok Police are linking the attack on the Skripals to a separate Novichok poisoning on 30 June in Amesbury, that led to the death of 44-year-old mother-of-three Dawn Sturgess. She and her partner Charlie Rowleywere exposed to the nerve agent after handling a contaminated perfume dispenser, labelled Nina Ricci Premier Jour. Mr Rowley told police he found the box containing a small bottle and an applicator - all found to be counterfeit - in a charity bin. He tried to put the two parts together and got some of the contents on himself. Ms Sturgess applied some of the contents to her wrists and became unwell. Scotland Yard said the bottle, with a modified nozzle, had contained a ""significant amount"" of Novichok. The counterfeit perfume bottle recovered from Mr Rowley's home and the box police say it came in. The name Novichok means ""newcomer"" in Russian, and applies to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. Novichok agents are liquids, although others are thought to exist in solid form and could be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder. Some of the agents are also said to be ""binary weapons"", meaning the nerve agent is typically stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients that are easier to handle. When these are mixed, they react to produce the active toxic agent which can cause convulsions, shortness of breath, profuse sweating and nausea. Read more about Novichok nerve agents The possibility of an unknown substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning ofAlexander Litvinenko. The former Russian intelligence officer died in London after drinking tea laced with a radioactive substance. Apublic inquiry concludedthat his killing had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. An investigation by Buzzfeed News,externalclaimed that there have been at least 14 deaths in the UK that US officials suspected were connected to Russia.

"British fashion retailer New Look plans to close 60 stores as part of a rescue deal to help it avoid going into administration. About 980 staff face redundancy - from a 15,300-strong UK workforce - and rents at about 400 stores will be slashed. The rescue plan still needs approval from creditors. New Look said it faced ""a difficult trading environment"". Chairman Alistair McGeorge said the cuts were ""tough but necessary"". The retailer - which has 593 stores in total - hopes to redeploy employees within the business where possible. Six reasons behind the High Street crisis Carluccio's is latest restaurant chain to feel the heat The firm said it had been struggling with its rental costs and had asked landlords for leeway so it could ""restore profitably"". It has also faced an ""extremely challenging"" retail market, driven by weaker consumer confidence, the implications of Brexit and competition from online channels,"" said Deloitte, which is handling the firm's Company Voluntary Agreement - a type of compromise deal that allows a firm to avoid going into administration. ""New Look is an iconic brand on the High Street and the Company Voluntary Agreement will provide a stable platform upon which management's turnaround plan can be delivered,"" said Daniel Butters, a partner at Deloitte. ""It is important to stress that no stores will close on day one, and employees, suppliers and business rates will continue to be paid on time and in full."" A glut of UK retailers have made closures or gone bust in recent months amid a slowdown on the High Street. Last week toy store chain Toys r Us fell into administration, along with electronics retailer Maplin, leaving thousands of jobs at risk. Restaurant chains Byron and Prezzo have also announced closures, while House of Fraser is seeking to shore up its finances. New Look has badly lost its way. Sales have fallen off a cliff. Even online sales were down by 15% in December. In recent years it focussed on younger shoppers, but failed to keep up with the likes of Asos, Boohoo and Primark. New Look is also saddled with way too many stores. It has nearly 600 fashion outlets, an extraordinary number given the rise of online shopping. And then there's the debt. New Look is drowning in it. It currently stands at Â£1.2bn. In today's challenging retail environment that's a pretty toxic mix.  It needs to cut costs - and fast. New Look has got its work cut out. On top of weaker consumer confidence, experts say retailers are battling a ""perfect storm"" of pressures including the rise of online shopping and rising overheads such as the National Living Wage. Many firms also over-expanded during the good years, leaving them dangerously indebted. New Look will learn if creditors have approved its rescue plan on 21 March. The British Property Federation said it would be up to individual landlords whether they accepted the proposal. It comes on the day the government launched its first industry-led Retail Sector Council to discuss the sector's challenges. It will include major retailers such as Boots and Amazon and meet regularly with government to discuss ""the changing demands of consumers"", retail minister Andrew Griffiths said.

"Jayda Fransen (left) and Paul Golding (right) had denied religiously-aggravated harassment The leader and deputy leader of far-right group Britain First have been found guilty of religiously aggravated harassment. Paul Golding, 36, and Jayda Fransen, 32, were arrested over the distribution of leaflets and posting of online videos during a gang-rape trial. Fransen was convicted of three counts of religiously aggravated harassment. Golding was found guilty of one charge. Both were jailed at Folkestone Magistrates' Court. Fransen was handed a 36-week sentence and Golding 18 weeks. During their trial in January, the court heard they had targeted homes and people in Kent whom they believed were connected to a rape trial at Canterbury Crown Court where three Muslim men and a teenager were convicted of rape and jailed. The pair, both from Penge in south-east London, were arrested in May last year. They denied a total of seven counts of harassment. Judge Justin Barron threw out three of the charges, while Fransen was found guilty of three and Golding of one. He told the court the pair were ""well-known"", ""controversial"" and ""generate their own publicity"", but his verdict was based ""solely on admissible evidence heard in court"". He said their words and actions ""demonstrated hostility"" towards Muslims and the Muslim faith. ""I have no doubt it was their joint intention to use the facts of the case [in Canterbury] for their own political ends. ""It was a campaign to draw attention to the race, religion and immigrant background of the defendants."" Both Fransen and Golding were convicted on a joint charge of religiously aggravated harassment after an incident last May at 555 Pizza takeaway in Ramsgate, when Fransen banged on the windows and doors of the shop and screamed ""paedophile"" and ""foreigner"". However, in each case, they instead targeted innocent members of the public. They filmed the abuse and then released it on social media and through the Britain First website. They also posted offensive leaflets through the letterboxes of houses in the area where the defendants lived. Paul Golding and Jayda Fransen arrived at the court with Britain First supporters Giving evidence, Fransen had denied being a racist and said she had carried out campaigns against people accused of sex offences, while Mr Golding told the court he had often acted as her cameraman. Fransen was convicted of abuse after visiting a house she wrongly believed to be the current address of Sershah Muslimyar, a defendant in the trial. She was also convicted ofvisiting the Kent home of another defendant, Tamin Rahmani, and shouting racist abuse through the front door while his pregnant partner Kelli Best was there. During sentencing Fransen spoke over the judge, saying: ""This is a very sad day for British justice. Everything I did was for the children of this country and they are worth it."" As Britain First supporters left the courtroom they hurled abuse at court staff and members of the press, shouting ""no surrender"".

"Theresa May hosted Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at No 10 Theresa May has raised concerns about human rights in Saudi Arabia during talks with the country's crown prince. Mohammed bin Salman has begun a three-day UK visit amid protests against his country's role in the war in Yemen. The PM said ties with Saudi Arabia had saved hundreds of UK lives but she had urged full access for humanitarian aid in Yemen and a political solution. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the government of ""colluding"" in war crimes by selling arms to Riyadh. The 32-year-old crown prince, seen by some as a modernising force in the Gulf State, held talks with Mrs May and cabinet ministers at No 10 ahead of a summit at Chequers on Thursday. He has already had lunch with the Queen and Duke of York, and is due to have dinner with the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge. This video can not be played Five things about Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman The crown prince, who is regarded as being heir presumptive to the 82-year old King Salman, said there were ""huge opportunities"" to boost trade between the two countries while the UK and Saudi Arabia had to work together to deal with ""failed states...terrorist and extremist organisations"" in the Middle East. The UK hopes to capitalise on Saudi plans to open up and diversify its economy by agreeing up to Â£65bn in mutual trade and investment opportunities over the next 10 years as well as a significant role for the UK in advising on the modernisation of the Saudi schools system. But there were some protesters outside Downing Street demonstrating against the killing of Yemeni civilians in air strikes by a Saudi-led multinational coalition - backed by the UK and US - that is battling the rebel Houthi movement. Why the Saudi Crown Prince's visit matters Profile: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Yemen crisis: Who is fighting whom? The crown prince is credited with kick-starting economic and social reforms in the conservative desert kingdom, such as the upcoming lifting of the ban on women driving. Prince Mohammed bin Salman earlier had lunch with the Queen In a statement following the talks, Downing Street said Mrs May had offered assistance to ""progress and intensify these reforms, particularly on women's rights, and on universal human rights"". The prime minister expressed particular concern about the case of Raif Badawi, a Saudi bloggersentenced to 1,000 lashes and 10 years in prisonfor ""insulting Islam"" online. Many have criticised the crown prince's decisions to intervene in Yemen and impose a de facto blockade of neighbouring Qatar, as well as crack down on perceived opponents of his policies. By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale When this relative novice on the world stage arrives in London on his first global tour since taking office, he will be granted the reddest of red carpets. The Crown Prince is looking for international support for his internal economic reforms while at the same time trying to offer reassurance to nervous international investors. And the British government is keen to transform a security and defence relationship into one that includes broader economic ties as well. The UK also has an unashamed appetite for inward investment from Saudi Arabia. In other words, post-Brexit Britain will need allies, markets and money - and the Saudis are high on the UK's wish list. Read more from James The conflict in Yemen is seen as part of a regional power struggle between Saudi Arabia, which backs the government, and Iran, which supports the Houthis but denies allegations that it is sending them weapons. According to the United Nations, more than 9,000 people, over half of them civilians, have been killed and more than 52,000 wounded in fighting in Yemen since March 2015. Saudi Arabia allows women to join army Saudi to lift driving ban on women Speaking earlier at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Corbyn urged Mrs May to use her meeting to call for a halt to ""the shocking abuse of human rights in Saudi Arabia"", which he claimed included a sharp increase in the arrest and detention of dissidents, the torture of prisoners, unfair trials and executions. The PM responded by saying the UK's historic links with Saudi Arabia had saved the lives of potentially hundreds of people in this country, but she would be ""raising concerns about human rights"". Mr Corbyn added that 600,000 children in Yemen had cholera ""because of the Saudi-led bombing campaign and the blockade"", and asked why British arms sales to Saudi Arabia had ""sharply increased"". ""Germany has suspended arms sales to Saudi Arabia but British arms sales have sharply increased, and British military advisers are directing war,"" he said. ""It cannot be right that her government is colluding in what the United Nations says is evidence of war crimes. Will you use your meeting today with the crown prince to halt the arms supplies and demand an immediate ceasefire in Yemen?"" Vans carrying billboards protesting against the visit in Westminster Other vans parked in Whitehall feature a welcome to the Saudi crown prince Billboards next to London's A4 advertise the Saudi crown prince with the hashtag ""#ANewSaudiArabia"" Mrs May told the Commons everyone was ""concerned"" about the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. She said she had raised concerns about the Saudi blockades of ports in Yemen during a meeting in December, and it withdrew. ""This vindicates the engagement that we have with Saudi Arabia, to be able to sit down with them,"" she said. ""Their involvement in Yemen came at the request of the legitimate government of the Yemen, it is backed by the United Nations Security Council and as such we support it."" The prime minister's official spokesman also rejected Mr Corbyn's claims that British military advisers were ""directing the war"". ""We're not a member of that (Saudi-led) coalition; we're not involved in carrying out strikes, directing or conducting operations, or involved in the targeting decision making process,"" he said.

"NME will no longer be available as a weekly magazine, its publisher has announced. The final edition will be released on Friday after 66 years as one of the UK's most iconic music publications. Its publisher Time Inc UK said the decision to stop its print edition is due to rising production costs and a ""tough"" advertising market. Instead, it will be ""focusing investment on further expanding NME's digital audience"". The magazine launched in 1952 and has featured global superstars on the front including David Bowie, Oasis, Dua Lipa, Amy Winehouse and Sam Smith. Its website launched in 1997 and the magazine went free in September 2015.

"Col Skripal was convicted of ""high treason in the form of espionage"" by Moscow's military court in August 2006 The mystery illness that has afflicted former Russian agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter has prompted UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to note that the case has ""echoes"" of the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko who was poisoned with radioactive material in London in 2006. A British public inquiry concluded in 2016 that Russian agents had murdered Litvinenkoand that Russian President Vladimir Putin himself ""probably approved"" the operation. Of course, we do not know yet the reason for the Skripals' mystery symptoms. The Russian Embassy in London has denied that their country has had any role. Mr Johnson has insisted that Britain will respond ""robustly"" if evidence of state involvement emerges, describing Russia as ""in many respects a malign and disruptive force"". If Russian involvement is found,the foreign secretary appeared to raise a question mark over England's participation in the World Cup, which will be held in Russia this summer. Though subsequently, British officials were at pains to stress he was referring to official representation rather than a boycott by the football team itself. Who is Sergei Skripal? But his remarks highlight the dilemma facing the UK government in dealing with Moscow. It has few diplomatic levers to pull. Alexander Litvinenko fell ill after meeting former KGB contacts in London in 2006 Relations are already frosty - a hang-over from the Litvinenko affair, compounded by serious differences over Russian policies in Ukraine and Syria, let alone Russia's more aggressive noises towards Nato countries in central and northern Europe. It is hard to see what further steps might be taken to encourage a shift in policy in the Kremlin and certainly not by the United Kingdom alone. Since the Litvinenko affair, British policy towards Russia has swung back and forth. Relations went into the freezer in the wake of the assassination, with diplomats expelled and intelligence co-operation halted. David Cameron's government introduced a partial thaw driven by a desire to maximise trade opportunities - perhaps a forerunner of the sorts of concerns that may loom much larger once the UK leaves the European Union. The Ukraine crisis though proved a major set-back with Britain at the forefront of calls for tough economic sanctions against Moscow. The outcome of the public inquiry into the Litvinenko affair only confirmed the government's suspicions of a direct official role in the killing. Alexander Litvinenko: A deadly trail of polonium How can you tell if ex-spy was poisoned? Putin, power and poison: Russiaâs elite FSB spy club Progress towards a nuclear deal with Iran, in which Russia played a key role, helped to soften some criticism of the Kremlin, but Moscow's growing military role in Syria and its indiscriminate bombing campaign there worsened tensions again. Now Russia and the United States seem to be engaged in a mini-nuclear arms race again; tensions between Nato and Russia are growing; and the UK is in any case distracted by its plans to withdraw from the EU. Should this latest case raise credible suspicions of a Russian official role, London may struggle to find an effective response. Relations are already bad and everything that was done in response to the Litvinenko affair may have failed to fundamentally alter Russian behaviour.

"Police released CCTV showing two suspects arriving at Gatwick Airport on 2 March, whom the UK believes are from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU On 4 March, a former Russian spy and his daughter were found seriously ill on a bench in Salisbury. They had been poisoned by a nerve agent, in an attack ""almost certainly"" approved by the Russian state. An extraordinary series of accusations and denials from the highest levels of governments came in the months that followed, culminating in diplomatic expulsions and international sanctions. The attack on Sergei Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury, left them hospitalised for weeks. Police linked the attack to another poisoning in June in which Dawn Sturgess and her partner Charlie Rowley were exposed to Novichok in nearby Amesbury, after handling a contaminated perfume dispenser. Ms Sturgess died in hospital in July. This video can not be played Dominic Casciani shows us the locations where Sergei Skripal spent Sunday 4 March with his daughter Yulia Skripal flew into London's Heathrow Airport from Russia at about 14:40 GMT on Saturday, 3 March On Sunday, 4 March, at about 09:15 GMT, Mr Skripal's car was seen in Salisbury around London Road, Churchill Way North and Wilton Road At 13:30 GMT his car was seen driving down Devizes Road, towards the town centre Mr Skripal and his daughter arrived at the Sainsbury's upper level car park at the Maltings shopping precinct at 13:40 GMT Police said the pair went to The Mill pub before going to Zizzi restaurant at 14:20 GMT, where they stayed until 15:35 GMT At 16:15 GMT, emergency services received the first report of an incident Police found the pair on a bench outside Zizzi in an ""extremely serious condition"" Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who fell ill after attending the incident, was treated in hospital but discharged on 22 March Det Sgt Nick Bailey was seriously ill 48 people were assessed in hospital in relation to the incident Ms Skripal was released from hospital on 9 April and her father was discharged on 18 May. Both were taken to a secure location Police believe the Skripals were ""targeted specifically"" and are treating the case as attempted murder. Detectives believe the pair first came into contact with the nerve agent Novichok at the front door of their home. Traces of Novichok were alsofound at the Mill and Zizzi, where the Skripals spent the afternoon. Up to 500 people who visited the pub or the restaurant at the same time weretold to wash their clothes and possessions. Officers later focused searches in and around Mr Skripal's home and a nearby children's play area at Montgomery Gardens was cordoned off by police. Police appealed for anyone who saw the pair in Mr Skripal's red BMW - licence plate number HD09 WAO - on the morning of the attack. Police are appealing for witnesses who saw Mr Skripal's car on the morning of the incident A vehicle that is believed to have been used by Mr Skripal's friend to pick up Yulia from the airport on 3 March was removed from Durrington, Wiltshire, by the Army on 19 March. Witness Jamie Paine said he saw a woman on a bench frothing at the mouth and her eyes ""were wide open but completely white"". A doctor, who was shopping with her husband in the city centre on Sunday, said Ms Skripal was ""slumped in her seat, completely unconscious"" and had lost control of her bodily functions. This video can not be played Witness: ""They looked like they'd been taking something quite strong"" The investigation has so far involved 250 specialist counter-terrorism officers and about 180 military personnel, who were deployed to Salisbury to help remove vehicles and objects that may have been contaminated. Prof Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, stressed the risk of harm to the public was ""low"" but there was some concern that prolonged exposure could cause health problems. Personnel from the Defence Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Centre at Porton Down in Wiltshire identified the nerve agent. Its head saidthe precise source of the nerve agent had not been verified, but it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"". Experts from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) tested samples of the chemical. Russia accused Britain of blocking access to the OPCW inquiry, but its proposal for a new, joint investigationwas voted down at the international chemical weapons watchdog at The Hagueon 4 April. Russia lost the vote by 15 votes to six, while 17 member states abstained. Police are appealing for information on Alexander Petrov (left) and Ruslan Boshirov Two Russian nationals, who go by the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, are suspects in the attempted murder. They are understood to have arrived at Gatwick Airport on Russian passports from Moscow on 2 March, and stayed at the City Stay Hotel in Bow Road, east London. The following day they visited Salisbury for reconnaissance before contaminating Mr Skripal's front door with Novichok on 4 March, police say. Officers believe a modified perfume bottle was used to spray the door. The pair flew from Heathrow to Moscow later that same night. The men, whose movements were captured on various CCTV cameras, are thought to be aged about 40 and operating under aliases. The officers are thought to be from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, and the attack was ""almost certainly"" approved at a senior level of the Russian state, Theresa May has said. In an interview with Russia's state-run international broadcaster, RT, the men said they were tourists, in the UK to visit the ""wonderful town"" of Salisbury andsee its famous cathedral. Details have since emerged showing the man calling himself Alexander Petrov has made around 10 trips to Europe in the last two years. Documents first obtained by the investigative group Bellingcat, shared with the BBC, show that as well as visiting Paris, Geneva and Amsterdam, he appears to have visited the UK three times. He seems to have visited once in September 2016, again between 28 February and 5 March 2017 and finally in March this year- during the period Sergei Skripal was poisoned. On the final visit, the pair both travelled on genuine Russian passports. Recently published pages from Mr Petrov's passport dossiers contain unusual stamps and a blank page where there is normally biographical data - all evidence which may point to the men being undercover intelligence officers, BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said. An investigation by Bellingcat has claimed thereal identity of the man calling himself Ruslan Boshirov is actually Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga- a highly decorated military officer. Bellingcat later said the suspect calling himselfAlexander Petrov is Alexander Mishkin, a doctorwho has worked for Russian intelligence since 2010. This video can not be played President Vladimir Putin says the suspects are civilians Since the attack, the Kremlin's media machine has responded with a combination of denials and sarcasm. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the two suspects are civilians, not criminals and he hoped the men would tell their story soon. A day later an interview with the men was broadcast by Russia's state-run international broadcaster. The Russian foreign ministry had previously called Mrs May's allegations ""insane"", and said the names and photographs of the two suspects ""do not mean anything to Moscow"". At a UN Security Council meeting in September to discuss the attack, Russia dismissed evidence presented by the UK as ""lies"". In a lengthy rebuttal of the allegations, Russia accused the UK of ""disgusting anti-Russian hysteria"". Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, accused the British authorities of ""Russiaphobia"" and misleading the international community and its own citizens. Mission implausible: Russians mock improbable spy duo Skripal suspects: 'We were just tourists' Putin, power and poison: Russiaâs elite FSB spy club Previously, a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman said the UK was one of the most likely sources of the nerve agent, along with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden or possibly the United States. Another theory - offered by Russia's EU ambassador, Vladimir Chizhov - suggested a UK research laboratory in Wiltshire could be the source. No. Prosecutors will not apply to Russia for the men to be extradited because Russia does not have extradition agreements with the UK. However, a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained, should they travel to the EU. Sue Hemming, of the UK Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said there was enough evidence to provide a ""realistic prospect of conviction"" and it was ""clearly in the public interest"" to charge them with the Salisbury attack. Police say officers continue to work with the CPS on the Amesbury incident. Could the suspects be returned to the UK? Col Skripal, 66, had been living in Salisbury after being released by Russia in 2010 Colonel Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence officer who was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. He was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. He was later flown to the UK. In recent years Mr Skripal is thought to have given lectures at military academies offering insights into Russia's foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU. A friend from college, Vladimir Svyatski, described Mr Skripal as ""very active, with a positive attitude and creative"". Former colleague Oleg Ivanov told the BBC he was ""the life and soul of the party"". Hiscondition improved from critical to stableon 6 April, and Salisbury District Hospital said he was  responding well to treatment and ""improving rapidly"". He was discharged on 18 May and moved to a secure location. Read more about the poisoned spy Skripal and the 14 deaths under scrutiny Yulia Skripal, from Moscow, was found on the bench alongside her father His daughter, Yulia, regularly travelled to the UK from her Moscow home to visit her father, relatives told the BBC. ""She told me she liked everything [in the UK],"" childhood friend Irina Petrova said. ""They had an amazing place, and amazing house."" She had an ""excellent"" relationship with her father, Ms Petrova said, and had been the ""perfect kid"", achieving excellent grades at school. Ms Skripal, who friends say worked for multinationals including Nike and PepsiCo, was ""always smiling, just like her mother"", Ms Petrova added. The 33-year-old was discharged from Salisbury District Hospital on 9 April and taken to a secure location. It is not known what long-term effects she might suffer. This video can not be played CCTV shows Sergei Skripal at a shop in Salisbury just five days before he and his daughter collapsed Mr Skripal's wife, Liudmila, died in 2012 after suffering from cancer. His elder brother and son have died in the past two years. Some of the deaths, the family believe, happened in suspicious circumstances. The grave of Liudmila Skripal, Sergei's wife, is in London Road Cemetery in Salisbury His son, Alexander Skripal, died aged 43 last July in St Petersburg from liver failure. He is buried in Salisbury, close to his mother. Mr Skripal's family deny that he worked for MI6 and believe that the espionage case was fabricated by Russia. On 5 April, an unverified recording purported to be between Yulia Skripal and her cousin, Viktoria Skripal, who lives in Russia, was broadcast on Russian TV. In the recording, Viktoria said she hoped to travel to the UK to visit her relatives, if she can get a visa, but the voice said to be Yulia's tells her that no-one will give her one. The Foreign Office said its Moscow embassy was expected to give Viktoria a visa and that she would be given full consular help in the UK. Doubts have been cast on the authenticity of the recording. In the weeks after the poisoning, Theresa May pointed the finger at Russia and expelled 23 Russian diplomats and their families from the UK. She also said: Ministers and the Royal Family would not attend the Fifa World Cup in Russia Russian state assets would be frozen if there was evidence they would be used as a weapon against UK nationals and residents Checks on private flights, customs and freight would be increased All planned high-level contacts between the UK and Russia would be suspended The state invitation to Russian's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov was retracted In solidarity, 29 countries, including the US, Canada, Germany and France, expelled 145 Russian officials - and Nato ordered 10 Russians out of its mission in Belgium. Moscow initially responded in kind, expelling 23 British diplomats, 60 US diplomats and several from other countries. It also closed the British Council in Russia and the British Consulate in St Petersburg. Russia then increased that number to 50, as its ambassador in the UK said Moscow had no nerve agent stockpile. Since the UK named the two suspects, US, France, Germany and Canada have agreed that the Russian government ""almost certainly"" approved the poisoning of the Skripals. Together they have urged Russia to provide full disclosure of its Novichok programme. Referring to the expulsion of Russian diplomats from their countries, the leaders said they had already ""taken action together to disrupt the activities of the GRU"". GRU officers are often stationed in embassies around the world. Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley were poisoned by Novichok Police are linking the attack on the Skripals to a separate Novichok poisoning on 30 June in Amesbury, that led to the death of 44-year-old mother-of-three Dawn Sturgess. She and her partner Charlie Rowleywere exposed to the nerve agent after handling a contaminated perfume dispenser, labelled Nina Ricci Premier Jour. Mr Rowley told police he found the box containing a small bottle and an applicator - all found to be counterfeit - in a charity bin. He tried to put the two parts together and got some of the contents on himself. Ms Sturgess applied some of the contents to her wrists and became unwell. Scotland Yard said the bottle, with a modified nozzle, had contained a ""significant amount"" of Novichok. The counterfeit perfume bottle recovered from Mr Rowley's home and the box police say it came in. The name Novichok means ""newcomer"" in Russian, and applies to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. Novichok agents are liquids, although others are thought to exist in solid form and could be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder. Some of the agents are also said to be ""binary weapons"", meaning the nerve agent is typically stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients that are easier to handle. When these are mixed, they react to produce the active toxic agent which can cause convulsions, shortness of breath, profuse sweating and nausea. Read more about Novichok nerve agents The possibility of an unknown substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning ofAlexander Litvinenko. The former Russian intelligence officer died in London after drinking tea laced with a radioactive substance. Apublic inquiry concludedthat his killing had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. An investigation by Buzzfeed News,externalclaimed that there have been at least 14 deaths in the UK that US officials suspected were connected to Russia.

"Using ""dog-speak"" is important in building a bond between a dog and their owner, scientists from the University of York have found. During a series of tests, dogs were spoken to in a high-pitched voice and again in a normal adult voice. Researchers then monitored which speaker the dogs responded to and wanted to interact with. PhD student Alex Benjamin said it seemed dogs were more likely to favour the speaker who used a high pitch. The researchers wanted to test whether speaking to dogs in ""dog-directed"" speech was useful to the animals, or whether humans did this simply because they view pets in the same way as babies. ""Dog-directed"" speech involves speaking in a high-pitched voice with exaggerated emotion - in a similar way that adults often talk to small children. Dr Katie Slocombe from the university's department of psychology explains: ""This high-pitched rhythmic speech is common in human interactions with dogs in western cultures, but there isn't a great deal known about whether it benefits a dog. ""We wanted to see whether social bonding between animals and humans was influenced by the type and content of the communication."" During the tests, phrases such as ""you're a good dog!"" and ""shall we go for a walk?"", were used. Next, another person would talk to the animal in a normal voice about non-dog-related content, for example ""I went to the cinema last night."" Dogs can bond like babies 'Dogs mirror owners' personalities' Dog gives lamb the 'lick of life' The speakers then mixed ""dog-directed"" speech with non-dog-related words, and normal speech with dog-related words. Researchers measured both the attentiveness of the dog while the speaker was talking, and whom the dog wanted to interact with once the speaker had finished. This video can not be played Researchers test different ways of talking to dogs The scientists found dogs were more likely to want to spend time with the speaker who had used both ""dog-directed"" speech and dog-related content. When the different types of speech were mixed up dogs did not show a preference for either speaker. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external It led student Alex Benjamin to conclude: ""This suggests that adult dogs need to hear dog-relevant words spoken in a high-pitched emotional voice in order to find it relevant."" The researchers could start looking into whether puppies demonstrate similar preferences, however there are no plans to carry out the same tests with cats.

"Alexander Litvinenko lies in a hospital bed in London, shortly before his death in 2006 When Sergei Skripal, a former Russian double agent, collapsed suddenly on Sunday in the sleepy cathedral city of Salisbury, there were unavoidable echoes of a messy, high-profile death in London a little over a decade before. In 2006, Alexander Litvinenko, another former Russian agent, was rushed to hospital after collapsing in London. As the world watched, a rare and highly radioactive isotope destroyed Litvinenko's organs one by one, and he died three weeks later. A British public inquiry found that the former Russian agent had ingested Polonium 210, and that his assassination was likely ordered directly by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mr Skripal, 66, who was imprisoned in Russia for working for British intelligence and later came to the UK as part of a spy swap, is currently in critical condition, along with his 33-year-old daughter who was also taken ill. Authorities say they are trying to determine if he was poisoned. Russia has denied any involvement, but the case has put renewed scrutiny on a string of deaths in the UK in the past two decades. The chair of the home affairs select committee,Yvette Cooper MP, wrote to Home Secretary Amber Rudd on Tuesday,externalcalling for a review of 14 other cases. Those cases were variously found to have been heart attacks, suicides, accidents, and deaths by natural causes, but some allege that they amount to a pattern of state-sponsored murder on British streets. Security guard Neil St Clair-Ford was driving through Weybridge in Surrey in November 2012 when he saw something lying in the road ahead of him. He pulled over and found Alexander Perepilichnyy, an exiled Russian banker, in the foetal position, pale, cold, and displaying ""very faint"" signs of life. Mr St Clair-Ford called a local former Navy colleague, Liam Walsh, to help administer first aid. Mr Walsh told an inquest that Perepilichnyy vomited ""greeny-yellow"" bile during mouth-to-mouth resuscitation with a strange taste, like ""licking a battery"". Perepilichnyy was born in Ukraine and made his fortune as a financier in Russia, allegedly helping government-connected Russians launder money. In 2010 he fled to Britain and began to co-operate with British authorities. He collapsed during a run near his home, the day he returned from a short trip to Paris. An expert botanist said tests suggested the presence of a rare plant toxin in Perepilichnyy's stomach Initial toxicology tests on Perepilichnyy's body revealed nothing suspicious and police said they had no evidence of foul play. But later tests performed by an expert botanist at Kew Gardens suggested the presence of a rare and deadly plant toxin in Perepilichnyy's stomach. Gelsemium, a flowering plant native to China and South East Asia, is known as ""heartbreak grass"", because its leaves, if swallowed, cause cardiac arrest. Further tests of the compound found in Perepilichnyy could not definitively identify it as gelsemium, and an inquest into his death was suspended last year pending yet more tests. The inquest resumes next month. US intelligence sources told the BBC in 2016 that they believed Perepilichnyy was murdered.An extensive investigation by Buzzfeed News,externalclaimed that the businessman was one of at least 14 deaths in the UK that US officials suspected were connected to Russia. The following year, 2013, Boris Berezovsky, a one-time oligarch and close friend of Vladimir Putin, was found hanged in his bathroom. All the evidence seemed to point to a suicide. He had been suffering from depression and was in debt. According to police there was no sign of a struggle. A Home Office pathologist concluded that his injuries were consistent with hanging. But he had also made himself a sworn enemy of Mr Putin, having fled Russia for exile in Britain and fiercely criticised the regime from afar. Berezovsky's family arranged for an asphyxiation expert to examine photographs of his body. Dr Bernd Brinkmann testified that the ligature mark on Berezovsky's neck did not share the typical V-shape created by a hanging, and instead suggested strangling. The dead man also had a broken rib and a cut on the back of his head. It was enough to persuade the coroner to record an open verdict. Boris Berezovsky was found hanged in a bathroom at home in 2013 ""Anyone Putin deems to have betrayed Russia is at the highest level of risk,"" saidBill Browder, a former Moscow-based financier who led a campaign to impose sanctions on top Russian officials accused of corruption - sanctions that enraged Mr Putin. ""And Russia can get away with brazenness in the UK because there have never been any consequences to Russian assassinations here,"" he said. ""The British government either ignores the crimes completely, as they did in the Perepilichnyy case, or they recognise the crime and don't do anything about it."" Speaking in parliament on Tuesday, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said any evidence of Russian involvement with Mr Skripal's condition would be dealt with ""appropriately and robustly"". ""I say to governments around the world that no attempt to take innocent life on UK soil will go unsanctioned or unpunished,"" he said. How will experts know if ex-spy was poisoned? The 'quintessentially English' home of a Russian spy Skripal case highlights UK's Russia dilemma Among the other deaths flagged to the home secretary on Tuesday are those of Gareth Williams, the so-called ""spy in the bag"", whose badly decomposed body was found locked inside a holdall in his bath; Dr Matthew Puncher, a British scientist involved in the Litvinenko case who was found in his kitchen with multiple stab wounds from two separate knives; and Scot Young, a business associate of Berezovsky, who was found impaled on railings outside his London flat after falling from a fourth-floor window. Williams' death was ruled to be ""probably an accident"" and Puncher's and Young's both suicides, and British police say they have found no evidence of Russian involvement in any of the cases barring Litvinenko's. ""British police are under no sort of political pressure whatsoever,"" Tony Brenton, the British ambassador to Moscow at the time of Litvinenko's death, told the BBC. ""If they had found evidence of Russian involvement in those cases, we would have followed it up."" But the UK government has faced criticism over a perceived lack of action. In the wake of Litvinenko's death, the UK tried and failed to extradite two Russian agents alleged to have carried out the hit. Instead, several Russian diplomats were expelled, provoking a tit for tat response from Russia. A video still shows Sergei Skripal being detained by Russian security services in 2004 The problem facing the UK government now, said Mr Brenton, is that ministers have already levied significant sanctions on Russia over its actions in Ukraine and Syria, and diplomatic relations are already very poor. ""If it is proven that this was an attack with Russian state involvement we will of course do something, there will be lots of anger and probably more sanctions. But we have already used up an awful lot of our ammunition. The locker is quite bare,"" he said. In a statement, the Russian embassy in London said: ""Media reports create an impression of a planned operation by the Russian special services, which is completely untrue."" In Salisbury, counter-terror police have taken over the investigation. The park bench where Mr Skripal collapsed has been cordoned off and a restaurant where he ate lunch has been temporarily closed. If it turns out to have been a Russian attack, part of the purpose will have been to warn those in Russia against betrayal, and those in exile that they are never safe, said Mr Browder. ""It sends a message to the rank and file that terrible things can befall you and your family,"" he said. Critically ill man is former Russian spy Russiaâs elite FSB spy club Who is Sergei Skripal?

"Theresa May hosted Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at No 10 Theresa May has raised concerns about human rights in Saudi Arabia during talks with the country's crown prince. Mohammed bin Salman has begun a three-day UK visit amid protests against his country's role in the war in Yemen. The PM said ties with Saudi Arabia had saved hundreds of UK lives but she had urged full access for humanitarian aid in Yemen and a political solution. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the government of ""colluding"" in war crimes by selling arms to Riyadh. The 32-year-old crown prince, seen by some as a modernising force in the Gulf State, held talks with Mrs May and cabinet ministers at No 10 ahead of a summit at Chequers on Thursday. He has already had lunch with the Queen and Duke of York, and is due to have dinner with the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge. This video can not be played Five things about Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman The crown prince, who is regarded as being heir presumptive to the 82-year old King Salman, said there were ""huge opportunities"" to boost trade between the two countries while the UK and Saudi Arabia had to work together to deal with ""failed states...terrorist and extremist organisations"" in the Middle East. The UK hopes to capitalise on Saudi plans to open up and diversify its economy by agreeing up to Â£65bn in mutual trade and investment opportunities over the next 10 years as well as a significant role for the UK in advising on the modernisation of the Saudi schools system. But there were some protesters outside Downing Street demonstrating against the killing of Yemeni civilians in air strikes by a Saudi-led multinational coalition - backed by the UK and US - that is battling the rebel Houthi movement. Why the Saudi Crown Prince's visit matters Profile: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Yemen crisis: Who is fighting whom? The crown prince is credited with kick-starting economic and social reforms in the conservative desert kingdom, such as the upcoming lifting of the ban on women driving. Prince Mohammed bin Salman earlier had lunch with the Queen In a statement following the talks, Downing Street said Mrs May had offered assistance to ""progress and intensify these reforms, particularly on women's rights, and on universal human rights"". The prime minister expressed particular concern about the case of Raif Badawi, a Saudi bloggersentenced to 1,000 lashes and 10 years in prisonfor ""insulting Islam"" online. Many have criticised the crown prince's decisions to intervene in Yemen and impose a de facto blockade of neighbouring Qatar, as well as crack down on perceived opponents of his policies. By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale When this relative novice on the world stage arrives in London on his first global tour since taking office, he will be granted the reddest of red carpets. The Crown Prince is looking for international support for his internal economic reforms while at the same time trying to offer reassurance to nervous international investors. And the British government is keen to transform a security and defence relationship into one that includes broader economic ties as well. The UK also has an unashamed appetite for inward investment from Saudi Arabia. In other words, post-Brexit Britain will need allies, markets and money - and the Saudis are high on the UK's wish list. Read more from James The conflict in Yemen is seen as part of a regional power struggle between Saudi Arabia, which backs the government, and Iran, which supports the Houthis but denies allegations that it is sending them weapons. According to the United Nations, more than 9,000 people, over half of them civilians, have been killed and more than 52,000 wounded in fighting in Yemen since March 2015. Saudi Arabia allows women to join army Saudi to lift driving ban on women Speaking earlier at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Corbyn urged Mrs May to use her meeting to call for a halt to ""the shocking abuse of human rights in Saudi Arabia"", which he claimed included a sharp increase in the arrest and detention of dissidents, the torture of prisoners, unfair trials and executions. The PM responded by saying the UK's historic links with Saudi Arabia had saved the lives of potentially hundreds of people in this country, but she would be ""raising concerns about human rights"". Mr Corbyn added that 600,000 children in Yemen had cholera ""because of the Saudi-led bombing campaign and the blockade"", and asked why British arms sales to Saudi Arabia had ""sharply increased"". ""Germany has suspended arms sales to Saudi Arabia but British arms sales have sharply increased, and British military advisers are directing war,"" he said. ""It cannot be right that her government is colluding in what the United Nations says is evidence of war crimes. Will you use your meeting today with the crown prince to halt the arms supplies and demand an immediate ceasefire in Yemen?"" Vans carrying billboards protesting against the visit in Westminster Other vans parked in Whitehall feature a welcome to the Saudi crown prince Billboards next to London's A4 advertise the Saudi crown prince with the hashtag ""#ANewSaudiArabia"" Mrs May told the Commons everyone was ""concerned"" about the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. She said she had raised concerns about the Saudi blockades of ports in Yemen during a meeting in December, and it withdrew. ""This vindicates the engagement that we have with Saudi Arabia, to be able to sit down with them,"" she said. ""Their involvement in Yemen came at the request of the legitimate government of the Yemen, it is backed by the United Nations Security Council and as such we support it."" The prime minister's official spokesman also rejected Mr Corbyn's claims that British military advisers were ""directing the war"". ""We're not a member of that (Saudi-led) coalition; we're not involved in carrying out strikes, directing or conducting operations, or involved in the targeting decision making process,"" he said.

"Layla was not seen by a doctor for an hour and 50 minutes A six-year-old girl died after a doctor missed a ""classic indicator"" that she had meningitis, an inquest heard. Layla Rose Ermenekli was taken to Royal Oldham Hospital with a high temperature, leg and stomach pains and a tell-tale rash on her hip, and died eight hours later. Dr Harsha Rajanna said he asked her mother Kirsty about the hip mark and was told she bumped into a table. Mrs Ermenekli said the exchange never happened. The hearing was told that Layla, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, was a lively girl who loved playing with her friends and dancing. She became ill in February last year and was taken to the hospital's accident and emergency department. She was triaged as ""priority two"" at 20:55 GMT and should have been seen by a doctor within 10 minutes, but Dr Rajanna did not see her until 22:50 GMT. Mrs Ermenekli told the inquest he said Layla could go home and she felt pressured to take her. Dr Harsha Rajanna said he was told Layla bumped into a table A nurse called in junior doctor Imogen Buck who saw the non-blanching rash - a ""classic indicator"" of meningitis. Layla was transferred to a high dependency unit but died of meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia hours later. Dr Rajanna told the inquest he noticed Layla's hip mark and thought it was a bruise, but made no note of it. When asked why, he said Mrs Ermenekli had told him the child had bumped into a table, which she denies. Layla was taken to Royal Oldham Hospital after becoming ill He said she wanted to take Layla home but he recommended she be seen by the paediatric team. A lawyer representing Layla's family said: ""Either your recollection is wrong or you are giving dishonest evidence to this court."" The coroner asked Dr Buck why she did not challenge Dr Rajanna after Layla died and she said felt it ""wasn't appropriate"". The health trust has already apologised to the family for the quality of care received. The hearing continues.

"British fashion retailer New Look plans to close 60 stores as part of a rescue deal to help it avoid going into administration. About 980 staff face redundancy - from a 15,300-strong UK workforce - and rents at about 400 stores will be slashed. The rescue plan still needs approval from creditors. New Look said it faced ""a difficult trading environment"". Chairman Alistair McGeorge said the cuts were ""tough but necessary"". The retailer - which has 593 stores in total - hopes to redeploy employees within the business where possible. Six reasons behind the High Street crisis Carluccio's is latest restaurant chain to feel the heat The firm said it had been struggling with its rental costs and had asked landlords for leeway so it could ""restore profitably"". It has also faced an ""extremely challenging"" retail market, driven by weaker consumer confidence, the implications of Brexit and competition from online channels,"" said Deloitte, which is handling the firm's Company Voluntary Agreement - a type of compromise deal that allows a firm to avoid going into administration. ""New Look is an iconic brand on the High Street and the Company Voluntary Agreement will provide a stable platform upon which management's turnaround plan can be delivered,"" said Daniel Butters, a partner at Deloitte. ""It is important to stress that no stores will close on day one, and employees, suppliers and business rates will continue to be paid on time and in full."" A glut of UK retailers have made closures or gone bust in recent months amid a slowdown on the High Street. Last week toy store chain Toys r Us fell into administration, along with electronics retailer Maplin, leaving thousands of jobs at risk. Restaurant chains Byron and Prezzo have also announced closures, while House of Fraser is seeking to shore up its finances. New Look has badly lost its way. Sales have fallen off a cliff. Even online sales were down by 15% in December. In recent years it focussed on younger shoppers, but failed to keep up with the likes of Asos, Boohoo and Primark. New Look is also saddled with way too many stores. It has nearly 600 fashion outlets, an extraordinary number given the rise of online shopping. And then there's the debt. New Look is drowning in it. It currently stands at Â£1.2bn. In today's challenging retail environment that's a pretty toxic mix.  It needs to cut costs - and fast. New Look has got its work cut out. On top of weaker consumer confidence, experts say retailers are battling a ""perfect storm"" of pressures including the rise of online shopping and rising overheads such as the National Living Wage. Many firms also over-expanded during the good years, leaving them dangerously indebted. New Look will learn if creditors have approved its rescue plan on 21 March. The British Property Federation said it would be up to individual landlords whether they accepted the proposal. It comes on the day the government launched its first industry-led Retail Sector Council to discuss the sector's challenges. It will include major retailers such as Boots and Amazon and meet regularly with government to discuss ""the changing demands of consumers"", retail minister Andrew Griffiths said.

"Stormy Daniels says she began an intimate relationship with Mr Trump in 2006 An adult film actress embroiled in allegations of an affair with Donald Trump has filed a lawsuit against him alleging that a non-disclosure contract she signed is invalid. Stormy Daniels says the agreement, drawn up before the 2016 election, is ""void"" because he did not sign it. Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, confirmed last month he had privately paid her $130,000 (Â£95,000). The lawsuit alleges that Mr Cohen tried to ""intimidate her into silence."" In a 2011 interview with InTouch magazine,the actress said she began a sexual relationship with Mr Trump in 2006,external, shortly after his wife Melania had given birth to his son Barron. The reports re-emerged in January whenthe Wall Street Journal reported that she was paid to sign a non-disclosure agreement in the run up to the 2016 election,external, which prevented her from discussing the alleged liaison. Mr Cohen has said the president ""vehemently denies"" any romantic involvement with the adult film star. A Stormy (Daniels) situation: A porn star scandal Trump can't shake The civil lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles on Tuesday, says that only days before the election, Ms Clifford and Mr Cohen signed the ""hush agreement"" but Mr Trump did not, ""thus rendering it legally null and void and of no consequence"". It adds: ""To be clear, the attempts to intimidate Ms Clifford into silence and 'shut her up' in order to 'protect Mr Trump' continue unabated."" Although Mr Cohen confirmed that he paid the money to Ms Clifford, he did not say what it was for. He said last month that neither Mr Trump nor the Trump Organization was a party to the transaction. ""The payment to Ms Clifford was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone,"" he said.

"Stormy Daniels says she began an intimate relationship with Mr Trump in 2006 An adult film actress embroiled in allegations of an affair with Donald Trump has filed a lawsuit against him alleging that a non-disclosure contract she signed is invalid. Stormy Daniels says the agreement, drawn up before the 2016 election, is ""void"" because he did not sign it. Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, confirmed last month he had privately paid her $130,000 (Â£95,000). The lawsuit alleges that Mr Cohen tried to ""intimidate her into silence."" In a 2011 interview with InTouch magazine,the actress said she began a sexual relationship with Mr Trump in 2006,external, shortly after his wife Melania had given birth to his son Barron. The reports re-emerged in January whenthe Wall Street Journal reported that she was paid to sign a non-disclosure agreement in the run up to the 2016 election,external, which prevented her from discussing the alleged liaison. Mr Cohen has said the president ""vehemently denies"" any romantic involvement with the adult film star. A Stormy (Daniels) situation: A porn star scandal Trump can't shake The civil lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles on Tuesday, says that only days before the election, Ms Clifford and Mr Cohen signed the ""hush agreement"" but Mr Trump did not, ""thus rendering it legally null and void and of no consequence"". It adds: ""To be clear, the attempts to intimidate Ms Clifford into silence and 'shut her up' in order to 'protect Mr Trump' continue unabated."" Although Mr Cohen confirmed that he paid the money to Ms Clifford, he did not say what it was for. He said last month that neither Mr Trump nor the Trump Organization was a party to the transaction. ""The payment to Ms Clifford was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone,"" he said.

"The rate of house price growth in the UK slumped to just 1.8% in the year to February, according to the country's largest lender, the Halifax. That is the lowest rate of increase since March 2013. The Halifax said that the average price of a home has fallen from Â£226,408 in November, to Â£224,353 last month. That is a fall of Â£2,055. However, prices actually rose by 0.4% in February, following two months in which values declined. The Halifax said it expected price growth to remain low in the months ahead. Nevertheless it said low mortgage rates and flourishing job prospects would continue to support prices. Rent burden leads to student stress Nationwide: House prices fell in February ""The labour market continues to perform strongly, with the number of people in employment rising by 88,000 in the three months to December,"" said Russell Galley, managing director of the Halifax.

"Theresa May hosted Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at No 10 Theresa May has raised concerns about human rights in Saudi Arabia during talks with the country's crown prince. Mohammed bin Salman has begun a three-day UK visit amid protests against his country's role in the war in Yemen. The PM said ties with Saudi Arabia had saved hundreds of UK lives but she had urged full access for humanitarian aid in Yemen and a political solution. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the government of ""colluding"" in war crimes by selling arms to Riyadh. The 32-year-old crown prince, seen by some as a modernising force in the Gulf State, held talks with Mrs May and cabinet ministers at No 10 ahead of a summit at Chequers on Thursday. He has already had lunch with the Queen and Duke of York, and is due to have dinner with the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge. This video can not be played Five things about Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman The crown prince, who is regarded as being heir presumptive to the 82-year old King Salman, said there were ""huge opportunities"" to boost trade between the two countries while the UK and Saudi Arabia had to work together to deal with ""failed states...terrorist and extremist organisations"" in the Middle East. The UK hopes to capitalise on Saudi plans to open up and diversify its economy by agreeing up to Â£65bn in mutual trade and investment opportunities over the next 10 years as well as a significant role for the UK in advising on the modernisation of the Saudi schools system. But there were some protesters outside Downing Street demonstrating against the killing of Yemeni civilians in air strikes by a Saudi-led multinational coalition - backed by the UK and US - that is battling the rebel Houthi movement. Why the Saudi Crown Prince's visit matters Profile: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Yemen crisis: Who is fighting whom? The crown prince is credited with kick-starting economic and social reforms in the conservative desert kingdom, such as the upcoming lifting of the ban on women driving. Prince Mohammed bin Salman earlier had lunch with the Queen In a statement following the talks, Downing Street said Mrs May had offered assistance to ""progress and intensify these reforms, particularly on women's rights, and on universal human rights"". The prime minister expressed particular concern about the case of Raif Badawi, a Saudi bloggersentenced to 1,000 lashes and 10 years in prisonfor ""insulting Islam"" online. Many have criticised the crown prince's decisions to intervene in Yemen and impose a de facto blockade of neighbouring Qatar, as well as crack down on perceived opponents of his policies. By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale When this relative novice on the world stage arrives in London on his first global tour since taking office, he will be granted the reddest of red carpets. The Crown Prince is looking for international support for his internal economic reforms while at the same time trying to offer reassurance to nervous international investors. And the British government is keen to transform a security and defence relationship into one that includes broader economic ties as well. The UK also has an unashamed appetite for inward investment from Saudi Arabia. In other words, post-Brexit Britain will need allies, markets and money - and the Saudis are high on the UK's wish list. Read more from James The conflict in Yemen is seen as part of a regional power struggle between Saudi Arabia, which backs the government, and Iran, which supports the Houthis but denies allegations that it is sending them weapons. According to the United Nations, more than 9,000 people, over half of them civilians, have been killed and more than 52,000 wounded in fighting in Yemen since March 2015. Saudi Arabia allows women to join army Saudi to lift driving ban on women Speaking earlier at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Corbyn urged Mrs May to use her meeting to call for a halt to ""the shocking abuse of human rights in Saudi Arabia"", which he claimed included a sharp increase in the arrest and detention of dissidents, the torture of prisoners, unfair trials and executions. The PM responded by saying the UK's historic links with Saudi Arabia had saved the lives of potentially hundreds of people in this country, but she would be ""raising concerns about human rights"". Mr Corbyn added that 600,000 children in Yemen had cholera ""because of the Saudi-led bombing campaign and the blockade"", and asked why British arms sales to Saudi Arabia had ""sharply increased"". ""Germany has suspended arms sales to Saudi Arabia but British arms sales have sharply increased, and British military advisers are directing war,"" he said. ""It cannot be right that her government is colluding in what the United Nations says is evidence of war crimes. Will you use your meeting today with the crown prince to halt the arms supplies and demand an immediate ceasefire in Yemen?"" Vans carrying billboards protesting against the visit in Westminster Other vans parked in Whitehall feature a welcome to the Saudi crown prince Billboards next to London's A4 advertise the Saudi crown prince with the hashtag ""#ANewSaudiArabia"" Mrs May told the Commons everyone was ""concerned"" about the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. She said she had raised concerns about the Saudi blockades of ports in Yemen during a meeting in December, and it withdrew. ""This vindicates the engagement that we have with Saudi Arabia, to be able to sit down with them,"" she said. ""Their involvement in Yemen came at the request of the legitimate government of the Yemen, it is backed by the United Nations Security Council and as such we support it."" The prime minister's official spokesman also rejected Mr Corbyn's claims that British military advisers were ""directing the war"". ""We're not a member of that (Saudi-led) coalition; we're not involved in carrying out strikes, directing or conducting operations, or involved in the targeting decision making process,"" he said.

"Layla was not seen by a doctor for an hour and 50 minutes A six-year-old girl died after a doctor missed a ""classic indicator"" that she had meningitis, an inquest heard. Layla Rose Ermenekli was taken to Royal Oldham Hospital with a high temperature, leg and stomach pains and a tell-tale rash on her hip, and died eight hours later. Dr Harsha Rajanna said he asked her mother Kirsty about the hip mark and was told she bumped into a table. Mrs Ermenekli said the exchange never happened. The hearing was told that Layla, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, was a lively girl who loved playing with her friends and dancing. She became ill in February last year and was taken to the hospital's accident and emergency department. She was triaged as ""priority two"" at 20:55 GMT and should have been seen by a doctor within 10 minutes, but Dr Rajanna did not see her until 22:50 GMT. Mrs Ermenekli told the inquest he said Layla could go home and she felt pressured to take her. Dr Harsha Rajanna said he was told Layla bumped into a table A nurse called in junior doctor Imogen Buck who saw the non-blanching rash - a ""classic indicator"" of meningitis. Layla was transferred to a high dependency unit but died of meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia hours later. Dr Rajanna told the inquest he noticed Layla's hip mark and thought it was a bruise, but made no note of it. When asked why, he said Mrs Ermenekli had told him the child had bumped into a table, which she denies. Layla was taken to Royal Oldham Hospital after becoming ill He said she wanted to take Layla home but he recommended she be seen by the paediatric team. A lawyer representing Layla's family said: ""Either your recollection is wrong or you are giving dishonest evidence to this court."" The coroner asked Dr Buck why she did not challenge Dr Rajanna after Layla died and she said felt it ""wasn't appropriate"". The health trust has already apologised to the family for the quality of care received. The hearing continues.

"Ahmed Hassan, 18, denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life The man accused of the Parsons Green Tube bombing told officials months before the attack that he had been ""trained to kill"", a court has heard. Jurors heard that asylum seeker Ahmed Hassan spoke to Home Office officials in January 2016 - 20 months before the bombing that injured 30 people. In an interview, Mr Hassan said he had been taken by force by the Islamic State group in Iraq and given training. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. The Old Bailey jury heard that Mr Hassan originally told police he was responsible for the bombing. They also heard graphic descriptions by victims of the explosion on the District Line on 15 September, 2017. One spoke of ""a furnace engulfed in flames"" when the device - made with materials partly sourced from Asda and Aldi - exploded at Parsons Green station during London's rush hour. This video can not be played CCTV allegedly showing Ahmed Hassan, 18, carrying hydrogen peroxide, a component for his homemade bomb Alison Morgan, prosecuting, told jurors that during a Home Office immigration interview in Croydon in January 2016, Mr Hassan was asked if he was, or had been part of a terror group in Iraq before he sought asylum in the UK. The jury heard he told officials that he had been taken by force by Isis (the Islamic State group), who had threatened to kill his uncle and brother if he resisted. Asked in the Home Office interview whether he had had any training from the Islamic State group Mr Hassan allegedly said: ""They trained us on how to kill. It was all religious based"". But he denied the Islamic State group had sent him to Europe to work for them. The court also heard that a worker for the charity Barnardos, who spoke Arabic, allegedly caught him listening to a ""call-to-arms"" song. The lyrics translated as: ""We are coming with you to the slaughter in your home/country."" Describing the attack on 15 September, one passenger, Aimee Colville, spoke of ""shards of glass flying through the air and then flames"". Jurors heard she could ""smell herself burning and saw her hair was on fire"". Thirty people were injured in the incident: some badly burned and others injured in the ""stampede"" as they fled in fear and panic, the Old Bailey was told. Alison Morgan, prosecuting, told the jurors that Mr Hassan packed a bomb with screwdrivers, knives and nails to cause ""maximum carnage"" on the rush-hour Tube. Jurors heard he bought metal items from Asda and Aldi supermarkets the day before the bombing. The court heard how Mr Hassan also researched the ingredients for TATP explosives and bought sulphuric acid on Amazon. To avoid suspicion, he allegedly used a friend's address for the delivery of the largest component - hydrogen peroxide. The device, which was on a timer, partially exploded very shortly after the crowded train arrived at Parsons Green Station during rush hour. Ms Morgan said: ""There were approximately 93 people in the carriage when the device detonated. ""The partial explosion created a large fireball. Some in the carriage were caught by the flames and sustained significant burns. ""Many ran in fear and panic. They were fortunate. Had the device fully detonated, it is inevitable that serious injury and significant damage would have been caused within the carriage."" Thirty people were injured when the device exploded on the train The court heard that, after the explosion, hundreds of people in the station tried to escape down a narrow staircase. Mr Hassan had got off the carriage at Putney Bridge Station before the bomb went off. He was arrested at the Port of Dover the next day. Ms Morgan told the jury that when first arrested and questioned by police, Mr Hassan accepted that he was ""responsible for the device"" and told them there ""may be a few milligrams traces"" of explosives at his home address. She said the device was made from the volatile chemical explosive TATP and contained 2.2kg of sockets, screws, bolts, nails, knives and screwdrivers. Jurors were told that Mr Hassan had arrived in Britain in the back of a lorry via the Channel Tunnel in October 2015. He told authorities he was born in June 1999 in Iraq, but had no identity documents. He gave his name as Ahmed Hassan Mohammed Ali. He claimed asylum, and from 2016 lived with foster parents in Cavendish Road, Sunbury in Surrey. At the time he allegedly planned his attack, his asylum claim was still outstanding, the court heard. The court heard that on the day of the attack Mr Hassan left his home shortly before 7am and took the train from Sunbury to Wimbledon. In a toilet on the concourse, he set the timer on the device before boarding the District Line, four stops from Parsons Green. Ms Morgan told jurors: ""At any point, should he have wanted to, he could have stopped the timer. He could have pulled the wires out of the device. He could have stopped the detonation. ""The CCTV footage from inside the carriage shows that at no stage did the defendant reach inside the bag to do anything."" The court heard that after ""calmly"" walking away from Putney Bridge station, Mr Hassan boarded a bus towards Earl's Court where sat on the top deck at the front. CCTV footage allegedly shows him glancing out of the window as he passes Parsons Green station. He is seen to remove the SD card from his mobile phone, chew on it and stuff it down the side of the bus seat, where it was later discovered by police in a destroyed state. Mr Hassan bought a backpack and clothes and was seen on CCTV at Ashford, wearing a blue Chelsea football shirt, the court heard. He boarded a train and arrived at Dover at around 14.30 BST where he is said to have bought a mobile phone and viewed the BBC News website which showed images of the scene he had left behind at Parsons Green.

"Around two million UK households will receive Cold Weather Payments of Â£25 each, following last week's cold snap. The government will pay out Â£50m, the largest weekly sum for five years. The payments were triggered after temperatures in many parts of the country fell below zero Celsius for seven consecutive days. Households in the West Midlands will get the highest pay-out of Â£8m, followed by Â£7m for homes in Yorkshire and Humberside. To qualify, householders have to be claiming one of five benefits. These are: Pension Credit, Income Support, Income-based Job Seekers' Allowance, Income-related Employment and Support Allowance, or Universal Credit. The temperature in your postcode area also needs to have remained at, or below zero, for seven days running. Cold Weather Payments,externalare separate toWinter Fuel Payments,external, which are paid to those born before August 1953.

"Gary Cohn was director of the National Economic Council under President Trump US President Donald Trump's top economic adviser Gary Cohn is resigning, the White House has said. It is the latest in a series of high-profile departures from President Trump's team. There has been speculation that Mr Cohn, a supporter of free trade, was angered by Mr Trump's plans to impose tariffs on aluminium and steel imports. In a statement released by the White House, Mr Cohn said it had been ""an honour to serve my country"". The 57-year-old former president of the Goldman Sachs bank had helped Mr Trump push through his sweeping tax reforms late last year. The people around Donald Trump Why Trump is hanging tough on trade EU condemns US tariff plans Gary Cohn and President Trump were never believed to be close. Mr Cohn wasn't specific about the reasons, saying in a statement it had been ""an honour to serve my country and enact pro-growth economic policies to benefit the American people, in particular the passage of historic tax reform"". Once that mission had been achieved, a number of differences may have prompted the departure, including the possible looming trade tariff war and his differences on that issue with trade adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Mr Cohn had reportedly set up a meeting between Mr Trump and business executives who opposed the tariffs move. But Mr Trump pulled out of that meeting and on Tuesday reportedly asked Mr Cohn in the Oval Office to back the tariffs publicly. Mr Cohn did not answer, sources told Bloomberg. In August last year, Mr Cohn had also criticised Mr Trump over his reaction to a far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, saying the administration ""can and must do better"".He was reported to have drafted a resignation letter after the event,external. An official said: ""For several weeks Gary had been discussing with the president that it was nearing time for him to transition out."" The exact departure date had yet to be determined.

In a statement, Mr Trump said: ""Gary... did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms and unleashing the American economy once again. ""He is a rare talent and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people."" Analysts were pointing to the resignation of Mr Cohn, a free market advocate, as one reason behind a drop in shares across Asia on Wednesday. The Nikkei closed 0.77% down and the Hang Seng 1.03%. Rick Meckler of LibertyView Capital Management told Reuters that Mr Cohn was ""very credible"" and the resignation announcement ""certainly causes short-term downward pressure"". The dollar continued its retreat against the yen, down from 113 at the start of the year to 105.6 on Wednesday. European stocks also opened lower, the FTSE 100 and pan-Europe STOXX 600 falling about 0.5% after opening. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Gary Cohn was a bit of a stranger in a strange land. He was a Democrat in a Republican White House; an economic globalist working for a president who campaigned on economic nationalism. Now, it seems, Donald Trump's protectionist bent has pushed the top administration economic adviser to the exit. This was not an unexpected development. By many accounts, there had been a contentious White House fight over whether to impose sweeping sanctions on US steel and aluminium imports - a tug-of-war that was settled, precipitously, by the president himself last week. There were the rumours that Mr Cohn was only sticking around to see last year's tax bill over the finish line, after his extreme discomfort following the president's warm words about some of the white nationalist marchers involved in violent clashes in Charlottesville last August. Mr Cohn was reportedly viewed by many Trump loyalists in the White House as an unwelcome interloper. Some on the outside, particularly in the financial world, welcomed him as a moderating influence - along with son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka. Now the former is leaving and the latter two seem greatly weakened. All this could mark a sharp new direction in White House policy. Last week, Mr Trumpannounced he would be imposing steep tariffs on steel and aluminium imports- 25% and 10% respectively. He is yet to sign them into effect. He has regularly argued that other countries have been ""taking advantage of"" the US on trade for decades. Trading partners reacted angrily. The EU, which says the steel and aluminium tariffs could cost it â¬2.8bn ($3.48bn; Â£2.5bn) a year, has now drawn up a $3.5bn hit list of retaliatory tariffs. These include higher import duties on bourbon, peanut butter, cranberries, orange juice, steel and industrial products,EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said. There are now fears of a global trade war. Mr Trump said on Tuesday: ""When we're behind on every single country, trade wars aren't so bad."" But there is disquiet at his proposals even among members of Mr Trump's Republican party. House Speaker Paul Ryan was one of those urging Mr Trump to have a ""smarter"" plan that was ""more surgical and more targeted"" and avoided the ""unintended consequences"" of a trade war. Mr Trump tweeted,externalthat he would pick Mr Cohn's replacement ""soon"". ""Many people wanting the job - will choose wisely!"" he added. This video can not be played Trump: 'Everybody wants to work in the White House' Possible candidates mooted by US media include Peter Navarro and Larry Kudlow, a conservative commentator and 2016 campaign adviser. President Trump tweeted that there was no chaos at the White House but there were ""still... some people that I want to change"". A piece in Bloomberg carries the concerns of Wall St operators,externalthat the White House is losing experienced financial experts. Kathy Wylde, who runs the Partnership for New York City, says: ""Gary was one that we counted on."" A Washington Post article headlined,external""Gary Cohn didn't get much done. But it could be worse - and it probably will"" says the adviser was an ""odd duck"" but that it is hard to fault him, given ""the Trump administration has been too understaffed and unfocused to get much done"". An editorial in the New York Times,externalsays Gary Cohn was ""supposed to be among the sensible adults in the room. Now, he is leaving after failing repeatedly to be the stabilising influence that the Trump administration sorely needed"". Bill Powell in Newsweek,externalsays there are two things Donald Trump really likes - a rising stock market and tariffs. But one thing the resignation of Gary Cohn makes abundantly clear, he says, is that ""you can't have both... the world just doesn't work that way"".

"Around two million UK households will receive Cold Weather Payments of Â£25 each, following last week's cold snap. The government will pay out Â£50m, the largest weekly sum for five years. The payments were triggered after temperatures in many parts of the country fell below zero Celsius for seven consecutive days. Households in the West Midlands will get the highest pay-out of Â£8m, followed by Â£7m for homes in Yorkshire and Humberside. To qualify, householders have to be claiming one of five benefits. These are: Pension Credit, Income Support, Income-based Job Seekers' Allowance, Income-related Employment and Support Allowance, or Universal Credit. The temperature in your postcode area also needs to have remained at, or below zero, for seven days running. Cold Weather Payments,externalare separate toWinter Fuel Payments,external, which are paid to those born before August 1953. Those eligible for Cold Weather Payments will receive the money automatically in their benefits, and within two weeks. ""As we all experienced last week, extreme weather has the potential to cause a number of problems but what cold weather shouldn't do is discourage anyone from turning up their heating to keep warm,"" said the minister for family support, housing and child maintenance, Kit Malthouse.

"The founder of the Fyre Festival - a ""luxury"" festival in the Bahamas which was called a""complete disaster""by fans - has pleaded guilty to fraud. Billy McFarland, who co-founded the festival with rapper Ja Rule, admitted to using fake documents to attract investors to put more than $26m (Â£18.7m) into his company. The 26-year-old's festival last April had boasted a bill includingSkepta, Migos and Blink 182. He could face up to 40 years in prison. Ja Rule co-founded Fyre Festival but has not been arrested or charged with any crime Tickets had cost between $1,200 and $100,000 (Â£860 and Â£72,000), with more than 7,000 people expected to attend. Festival-goers were left stranded on an island in the Bahamas without enough food, water or accommodation. The festival had initially advertised with an Instagram video featuring models Bella Hadid, Hailey Baldwin and Emily Ratajkowski sailing on a luxury yacht. It was eventually cancelled and the organisers apologised andoffered full refundsafter negative publicity. Famous models were used to promote ""the next Coachella"" on Instagram Billy McFarland pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud, in connection with a scheme to defraud investors in his company Fyre Media Inc and a scheme to defraud a ticket vendor for the festival.

"Using ""dog-speak"" is important in building a bond between a dog and their owner, scientists from the University of York have found. During a series of tests, dogs were spoken to in a high-pitched voice and again in a normal adult voice. Researchers then monitored which speaker the dogs responded to and wanted to interact with. PhD student Alex Benjamin said it seemed dogs were more likely to favour the speaker who used a high pitch. The researchers wanted to test whether speaking to dogs in ""dog-directed"" speech was useful to the animals, or whether humans did this simply because they view pets in the same way as babies. ""Dog-directed"" speech involves speaking in a high-pitched voice with exaggerated emotion - in a similar way that adults often talk to small children. Dr Katie Slocombe from the university's department of psychology explains: ""This high-pitched rhythmic speech is common in human interactions with dogs in western cultures, but there isn't a great deal known about whether it benefits a dog. ""We wanted to see whether social bonding between animals and humans was influenced by the type and content of the communication."" During the tests, phrases such as ""you're a good dog!"" and ""shall we go for a walk?"", were used. Next, another person would talk to the animal in a normal voice about non-dog-related content, for example ""I went to the cinema last night."" Dogs can bond like babies 'Dogs mirror owners' personalities' Dog gives lamb the 'lick of life' The speakers then mixed ""dog-directed"" speech with non-dog-related words, and normal speech with dog-related words. Researchers measured both the attentiveness of the dog while the speaker was talking, and whom the dog wanted to interact with once the speaker had finished. This video can not be played Researchers test different ways of talking to dogs The scientists found dogs were more likely to want to spend time with the speaker who had used both ""dog-directed"" speech and dog-related content. When the different types of speech were mixed up dogs did not show a preference for either speaker. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external It led student Alex Benjamin to conclude: ""This suggests that adult dogs need to hear dog-relevant words spoken in a high-pitched emotional voice in order to find it relevant."" The researchers could start looking into whether puppies demonstrate similar preferences, however there are no plans to carry out the same tests with cats.

Writing to Thames Water, London Mayor Sadiq Khan described the shortage as ""unacceptable"". In a letter to the firm's CEO Steve Robertson, Mr Khan said: ""I am extremely concerned to see the supply issues experienced this weekend with significant numbers of Londoners being left without water for up to four days. ""While I appreciate that the weather conditions played a part in the water outages and increase in leaks I would have expected Thames Water to have foreseen this and had appropriate plans in place. ""It is critical that Thames Water reviews and steps up plans to upgrade and maintain your network. ""I expect generous compensation to be issued to those affected and that this will be clearly and proactively communicated as well as issued quickly."" A spokesman for Thames Water, said ""The mayor of London and the Consumer Council for Water have asked us to look at how we compensate customers in these circumstances and we've agreed to do so. ""For now our focus remains on getting every single customer back into supply.""

"The five most frequent emergency callers were admitted to hospital 169 times in 12 months Ambulances and emergency response vehicles were deployed more than 1,500 times to five patients in 12 months, the BBC has learned. A total of 8,303 emergency calls were made by the five most frequent UK callers. An NHS spokesman said the calls were often related to mental health, chronic pain and alcohol or drug dependence. Vicki Nash from mental health charity Mind said the figures show that individuals' needs were not being met. The figures were released after a Freedom of Information request to the UK's 14 ambulance trusts. The highest number of calls by a single patient were made to London's ambulance service, which was contacted 3,594 times. Other services to receive frequent calls include East Midlands Ambulance service, which was called 1,244 times by a single patient, and South West Ambulance service, which received 1,044 calls from one person. ""Frequent callers"" are classed as those who call at least five times in a month, or at least 12 times in three months, and they cost the health service almost Â£19m a year. Paul Jefferies, assistant director of operations at South Central Ambulance Service, said about 10% of the calls they receive are from frequent callers. He said: ""If the ambulance, or the response vehicle, is being deployed to that patient who we know is a frequent caller, it means that a resource might not be available for a potential cardiac arrest."" Ms Nash, head of policy and campaigns for Mind, said the figures showed the service being offered was not good enough. She said: ""It's not meeting the needs of that individual, which is why they are repeatedly calling."" A West Midlands Ambulance service spokesman said misuse of the 999 number had a ""huge"" impact. He said: ""It's not just the financial cost, it is the effective removal of ambulances for people who really need them that is the greatest concern."" The trusts work with other agencies such as social services to put in place care packages that will stop individuals calling inappropriately, he added. A Department of Health spokesman said: ""NHS 999 call handlers do a challenging job helping callers seeking assistance in an emergency, and we expect the public to support them in their vital role by only calling 999 if necessary.""

"This video can not be played Tusk on Brexit: 'We will be drifting apart' Donald Tusk has insisted the EU ""does not want to build a wall"", but Brexit means ""we will be drifting apart"". The EU Council president said Theresa May wanted to ""demonstrate at any price that Brexit could be a success"", but that was not the EU's objective. He was unveilingdraft guidelines for the EU side,externalof Brexit trade talks. Mr Tusk said the EU wanted an ""ambitious and advanced"" free trade deal - and continued access to UK waters for EU fishing vessels. Kuenssberg: Differences, but room for manoeuvre Reality Check: EU predicts Brexit costs for UK Kamal Ahmed: Hammond's hidden message ""Our agreement will not make trade between the UK and EU frictionless or smoother,"" he said. ""It will make it more complicated and costly than today for all of us. This is the essence of Brexit."" He said it would be the first time in history that a free trade agreement would ""loosen, not strengthen, economic ties"". This video can not be played Donald Tusk: Theresa May's political goal is Brexit success ""at any price"" The draft European Council guidelines call for zero-tariff trade in goods - where the EU has a surplus. The document also says access for services will be limited by the fact that the UK will be outside the EU and will no longer share a common regulatory and judiciary framework. The draft guidelines repeat EU warnings that there can be ""no cherry-picking"" of participation in the single market for particular sectors of industry. The BBC's Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris said the ""narrow negotiating mandate set out in these guidelines suggests that the EU doesn't think it will be much more ambitious than other free trade agreements it has negotiated - Canada is the most obvious example"". Mr Tusk said he wanted continued security and research cooperation and to ensure flights were not grounded. But he added: ""No member state is free to pick only those sectors of the internal market they like, or to accept the role of the ECJ only when it suits their interest."" The draft guidelines also say that the EU will ""preserve its autonomy as regards its decision-making, which excludes participation of the United Kingdom as a third-country to EU Institutions, agencies or bodies"". This video can not be played Theresa May: ""We must bring our country back together"" Mrs May acknowledged in her Mansion House speech on Brexit on Friday that neither side would get everything they want from negotiations. But she also stressed that the UK wanted a bespoke trade deal, rather than an ""off-the-shelf"" model. ""The fact is that every free trade agreement has varying market access depending on the respective interests of the countries involved,"" she said. ""If this is cherry-picking, then every trade arrangement is cherry-picking."" She also said: ""We will also want to explore with the EU, the terms on which the UK could remain part of EU agencies."" This appears to be in conflict with the EU draft guidelines, although BBC Research has found several examples of non-EU members participating - as a member or observer - in EU agencies and bodies, such as the European Environment Agency and the European Medicines Agency. The EU says it wants to maintain ""existing reciprocal access to fishing waters"" - a leading concern of the fishing industry in countries bordering the North Sea. In her Mansion House speech, Mrs May said: ""The UK will regain control over our domestic fisheries management rules and access to our waters."" She added that the UK would want to ""work together to manage shared stocks in a sustainable way and to agree reciprocal access to waters and a fairer allocation of fishing opportunities for the UK fishing industry"". Brexit Secretary David Davis - quizzed on Tuesday by Brexiteer Labour MP Kate Hoey - insisted the government would not betray UK fishing communities by ""trading away fishing rights"" for ""other things"". Asked about the EU's demand to keep access as it is now, Chancellor Philip Hammond said the UK was ""open to discussing with our EU partners about the appropriate arrangements for reciprocal access for our fishermen to EU waters and for EU fishermen to our waters"". Campaign group Fishing for Leave urged the government not to ""cave in"" to the EU demands, saying: ""Nowhere else is access to fisheries included as negotiating collateral for a free trade agreement."" Financial services are not mentioned specifically in the EU draft guidelines, but it is shaping up to be a major sticking point. UK Chancellor Philip Hammond has told European leaders that it is in the ""mutual interest"" of both the UK and the EU to include financial services in a free trade agreement. ""Given the shape of the British economy and our trade balance with the EU 27, it's hard to see how any deal that did not include services could look like a fair and balanced settlement,"" he said in a speech. ""Not only is it possible to include financial services in a trade deal, but this is very much in our mutual interest to do so."" But Donald Tusk appeared to reject the UK proposals. The EU says the UK will be treated like any other ""third country"" after Brexit. Asked about the EU guidelines, which also warn of the ""negative economic consequences"" of Brexit, Mr Hammond said: ""It does not surprise me remotely that what they have set out this morning is a very tough position. That's what any competent, skilled and experienced negotiator would do."" EU deal 'must include financial services' This video can not be played Tusk: Theresa May wants Brexit success ""at any price"" Donald Tusk unveiled his guidelines in a picture-perfect castle in the hills outside Luxembourg. A nice change to the usual venues in Brussels but the same tough message from the EU that the UK's red lines limit what it can get from the final Brexit deal. The best that's on offer is a free trade agreement on goods with no tariffs, and access to the European markets for the UK service sector - but under EU rules and with no specific mention of financial services. I asked a sad-sounding Donald Tusk if his offer came anywhere close to what the prime minister had asked for in her Mansion House speech. His pause was epically long, which suggested he knows it is not. His document is also pretty gloomy, with a spine-chilling warning about the economic costs to the UK. But there is also a big offer tucked away in a later paragraph - there are other options available if the government is prepared to compromise on its red lines. The leaders of the remaining 27 EU states must approve the plans at a Brussels summit on 22 March, setting the template for chief negotiator Michel Barnier for talks with the UK about their future relationship. The UK is due to leave the EU at the end of March 2019, and both sides have said they would like a deal on their future relationship to be agreed by this autumn to allow time for parliaments to approve the deal before Brexit happens. MPs to debate Plaid's EU citizenship call Brexit: All you need to know The European Parliament's Guy Verhofstadt held talks on Tuesday in Downing Street The European Parliament has stressed that its preferred option is for the UK to continue to be a member of the single market and customs union after Brexit, in a draft resolution,leaked to the Politico website,external. The parliament does not have a formal role in the Brexit negotiations but does have a veto on the final deal. The European Parliament document, which may be changed before it is adopted, says non-EU members - even if very closely aligned to the bloc - cannot expect the same rights and benefits as EU members. It also warns that the UK's current ""red lines"" in Brexit talks ""would lead to customs checks and verification which would affect global supply chains and manufacturing processes, even if tariff barriers can be avoided"". It says a ""deep and comprehensive"" trade deal, of the kind envisioned by Theresa May, must entail ""a binding interpretation role"" for the European Court of Justice. MPs to debate Plaid's EU citizenship call Brexit: All you need to know MPs in Westminster are, meanwhile, debating a call by Plaid Cymru - who have four MPs in Wales - for UK nationals to be allowed to keep their EU citizenship after Brexit. Plaid said EU citizenship would give holders the right to travel, live, study and work anywhere in the EU even after the UK leaves next year.

It is not known if the burst pipe wasdamaged in recent severe cold weather. Some people in the area had low water pressure or no water supply because of the flooding but repairs have since been completed, Thames Water said. Allow Twitter content?

It comes after thousands of homes were left withoutwater or suffered from low pressure because of freezing weather over the weekend. Writing to Thames Water, London Mayor Sadiq Khan described the shortage as ""unacceptable"". In a letter to the firm's CEO Steve Robertson, Mr Khan said: ""I am extremely concerned to see the supply issues experienced this weekend with significant numbers of Londoners being left without water for up to four days. ""While I appreciate that the weather conditions played a part in the water outages and increase in leaks I would have expected Thames Water to have foreseen this and had appropriate plans in place. ""It is critical that Thames Water reviews and steps up plans to upgrade and maintain your network. ""I expect generous compensation to be issued to those affected and that this will be clearly and proactively communicated as well as issued quickly."" A spokesman for Thames Water, said ""The mayor of London and the Consumer Council for Water have asked us to look at how we compensate customers in these circumstances and we've agreed to do so. ""For now our focus remains on getting every single customer back into supply."" Flooding caused disruption during Wednesday's rush hour Thames Water said its engineers reached the scene in Tooting ""very quickly"" and have stopped the flooding. The A24/Tooting High Street remains closed between Tooting Broadway Station and Hoyle Road while Mitcham Road has reopened.

"Coca-Cola is planning to produce an alcoholic drink for the first time in the company's 125-year history - with an alcopop-style product in Japan. It is keen to cash in on the country's growing taste for Chu-Hi - canned sparkling flavoured drinks given a kick with a local spirit called shochu. The product is typically between 3% and 8% alcohol by volume. A senior Coke executive in Japan said the move was a ""modest experiment for a specific slice of our market"". ""We haven't experimented in the low alcohol category before, but it's an example of how we continue to explore opportunities outside our core areas,"" said Jorge Garduno, Coca-Cola's Japan president. It was unlikely the drink would be sold outside of Japan, he suggested. Coca-Cola pledges to recycle all packaging by 2030 Coca-Cola to cut bottle size but increase price The quiet death of the alcopop Chu-Hi - an abbreviation for shochu highball - has been marketed as an alternative to beer, proving especially popular with female drinkers. The company says it markets dozens of new products on the Japanese market every year Japan's big drinks firms including Kirin, Suntory and Asahi all have varieties of the drink, and continue to experiment with flavours. The most popular flavours are strong citrus ones such as grapefruit or lemon, but the drink can also be made with other fruit flavours like grape, apple and peach. As younger consumers become more health conscious, Coca-Cola has been diversifying from fizzy drinks, including buying water and tea brands. This video can not be played How Coca-Cola became a million dollar idea But last November, Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog speculated that Coca-Cola might move into alcohol, as it looked to ""premium segments such as adult craft beverages"". The phrase alcopop typically refers to sweet but alcoholic drinks, and in 1990s UK brands such as Hooch, Reef, Smirnoff Ice and Bacardi Breezer became hugely popular. But they were controversial, raising concerns that they encouraged young people to drink alcohol in large quantities because they were so easy to consume.

"Kim Jong-nam (pictured in 2001) was late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il's oldest son The half-brother of Kim Jong-un was killed by a chemical attack in Malaysia on the orders of the North Korean government, the US has concluded. Kim Jong-nam died after a bizarre encounter at Kuala Lumpur airport in 2017, when two women smeared his face with VX nerve agent. The women,who say they believed they were carrying out a prank for a TV show,are on trial for murder. The US said it would impose new sanctions on North Korea in response. ""This public display of contempt for universal norms against chemical weapons use further demonstrates the reckless nature of North Korea and underscores that we cannot afford to tolerate a North Korean WMD program of any kind,"" said State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert. The US has consistently accused North Korea of being behind the attack on Kim Jong-nam. North Korea denies any involvement. Kim Jong-un has been pictured smiling with South Korea ministers in Pyongyang in recent days The new sanctions, which came into force on 5 March, are largely symbolic, joining a vast array of punitive economic measures the US has taken against North Korea. The announcement comes a day after a high-level South Korean delegation returned from Pyongyang where they had cordial meetings with Mr Kim. Capitalising on warmer ties after the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, Mr Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in have arranged a landmark meeting for next month. It would be the first such meeting for more than a decade and the first since Kim Jong-un took power in North Korea in 2011. US President Donald Trump has said the developments, includingNorth Korea's suggestion that it might discuss getting rid of its nuclear weapons, ""are positive"" but might be a ""false hope"". In previous programmes to halt its nuclear ambitions, the North has failed to keep its promises. Kim Jong-nam: Main players in mysterious killing The women accused of killing Kim Jong-nam Kim Jong-nam was largely estranged from his family and was bypassed for the leadership in favour of his younger half-brother, Kim Jong-un. He spent most of his time overseas in Macau, mainland China and Singapore. This video can not be played CCTV footage shows the alleged attack at the airport in February 2017 He had spoken out in the past against his family's dynastic control of North Korea and in a 2012 book was quoted as saying he believed his half-brother lacked leadership qualities. He died in February 2017, shortly after Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong accosted him as he checked in for a flight at Kuala Lumpur airport.

"This video can not be played Tusk on Brexit: 'We will be drifting apart' Donald Tusk has insisted the EU ""does not want to build a wall"", but Brexit means ""we will be drifting apart"". The EU Council president said Theresa May wanted to ""demonstrate at any price that Brexit could be a success"", but that was not the EU's objective. He was unveilingdraft guidelines for the EU side,externalof Brexit trade talks. Mr Tusk said the EU wanted an ""ambitious and advanced"" free trade deal - and continued access to UK waters for EU fishing vessels. Kuenssberg: Differences, but room for manoeuvre Reality Check: EU predicts Brexit costs for UK Kamal Ahmed: Hammond's hidden message ""Our agreement will not make trade between the UK and EU frictionless or smoother,"" he said. ""It will make it more complicated and costly than today for all of us. This is the essence of Brexit."" He said it would be the first time in history that a free trade agreement would ""loosen, not strengthen, economic ties"". This video can not be played Donald Tusk: Theresa May's political goal is Brexit success ""at any price"" The draft European Council guidelines call for zero-tariff trade in goods - where the EU has a surplus. The document also says access for services will be limited by the fact that the UK will be outside the EU and will no longer share a common regulatory and judiciary framework. The draft guidelines repeat EU warnings that there can be ""no cherry-picking"" of participation in the single market for particular sectors of industry. The BBC's Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris said the ""narrow negotiating mandate set out in these guidelines suggests that the EU doesn't think it will be much more ambitious than other free trade agreements it has negotiated - Canada is the most obvious example"". Mr Tusk said he wanted continued security and research cooperation and to ensure flights were not grounded. But he added: ""No member state is free to pick only those sectors of the internal market they like, or to accept the role of the ECJ only when it suits their interest."" The draft guidelines also say that the EU will ""preserve its autonomy as regards its decision-making, which excludes participation of the United Kingdom as a third-country to EU Institutions, agencies or bodies"". This video can not be played Theresa May: ""We must bring our country back together"" Mrs May acknowledged in her Mansion House speech on Brexit on Friday that neither side would get everything they want from negotiations. But she also stressed that the UK wanted a bespoke trade deal, rather than an ""off-the-shelf"" model. ""The fact is that every free trade agreement has varying market access depending on the respective interests of the countries involved,"" she said. ""If this is cherry-picking, then every trade arrangement is cherry-picking."" She also said: ""We will also want to explore with the EU, the terms on which the UK could remain part of EU agencies."" This appears to be in conflict with the EU draft guidelines, although BBC Research has found several examples of non-EU members participating - as a member or observer - in EU agencies and bodies, such as the European Environment Agency and the European Medicines Agency. The EU says it wants to maintain ""existing reciprocal access to fishing waters"" - a leading concern of the fishing industry in countries bordering the North Sea. In her Mansion House speech, Mrs May said: ""The UK will regain control over our domestic fisheries management rules and access to our waters."" She added that the UK would want to ""work together to manage shared stocks in a sustainable way and to agree reciprocal access to waters and a fairer allocation of fishing opportunities for the UK fishing industry"". Brexit Secretary David Davis - quizzed on Tuesday by Brexiteer Labour MP Kate Hoey - insisted the government would not betray UK fishing communities by ""trading away fishing rights"" for ""other things"". Asked about the EU's demand to keep access as it is now, Chancellor Philip Hammond said the UK was ""open to discussing with our EU partners about the appropriate arrangements for reciprocal access for our fishermen to EU waters and for EU fishermen to our waters"". Campaign group Fishing for Leave urged the government not to ""cave in"" to the EU demands, saying: ""Nowhere else is access to fisheries included as negotiating collateral for a free trade agreement."" Financial services are not mentioned specifically in the EU draft guidelines, but it is shaping up to be a major sticking point. UK Chancellor Philip Hammond has told European leaders that it is in the ""mutual interest"" of both the UK and the EU to include financial services in a free trade agreement. ""Given the shape of the British economy and our trade balance with the EU 27, it's hard to see how any deal that did not include services could look like a fair and balanced settlement,"" he said in a speech. ""Not only is it possible to include financial services in a trade deal, but this is very much in our mutual interest to do so."" But Donald Tusk appeared to reject the UK proposals. The EU says the UK will be treated like any other ""third country"" after Brexit. Asked about the EU guidelines, which also warn of the ""negative economic consequences"" of Brexit, Mr Hammond said: ""It does not surprise me remotely that what they have set out this morning is a very tough position. That's what any competent, skilled and experienced negotiator would do."" EU deal 'must include financial services' This video can not be played Tusk: Theresa May wants Brexit success ""at any price"" Donald Tusk unveiled his guidelines in a picture-perfect castle in the hills outside Luxembourg. A nice change to the usual venues in Brussels but the same tough message from the EU that the UK's red lines limit what it can get from the final Brexit deal. The best that's on offer is a free trade agreement on goods with no tariffs, and access to the European markets for the UK service sector - but under EU rules and with no specific mention of financial services. I asked a sad-sounding Donald Tusk if his offer came anywhere close to what the prime minister had asked for in her Mansion House speech. His pause was epically long, which suggested he knows it is not. His document is also pretty gloomy, with a spine-chilling warning about the economic costs to the UK. But there is also a big offer tucked away in a later paragraph - there are other options available if the government is prepared to compromise on its red lines. The leaders of the remaining 27 EU states must approve the plans at a Brussels summit on 22 March, setting the template for chief negotiator Michel Barnier for talks with the UK about their future relationship. The UK is due to leave the EU at the end of March 2019, and both sides have said they would like a deal on their future relationship to be agreed by this autumn to allow time for parliaments to approve the deal before Brexit happens. MPs to debate Plaid's EU citizenship call Brexit: All you need to know The European Parliament's Guy Verhofstadt held talks on Tuesday in Downing Street The European Parliament has stressed that its preferred option is for the UK to continue to be a member of the single market and customs union after Brexit, in a draft resolution,leaked to the Politico website,external. The parliament does not have a formal role in the Brexit negotiations but does have a veto on the final deal. The European Parliament document, which may be changed before it is adopted, says non-EU members - even if very closely aligned to the bloc - cannot expect the same rights and benefits as EU members. It also warns that the UK's current ""red lines"" in Brexit talks ""would lead to customs checks and verification which would affect global supply chains and manufacturing processes, even if tariff barriers can be avoided"". It says a ""deep and comprehensive"" trade deal, of the kind envisioned by Theresa May, must entail ""a binding interpretation role"" for the European Court of Justice. MPs to debate Plaid's EU citizenship call Brexit: All you need to know MPs in Westminster are, meanwhile, debating a call by Plaid Cymru - who have four MPs in Wales - for UK nationals to be allowed to keep their EU citizenship after Brexit. Plaid said EU citizenship would give holders the right to travel, live, study and work anywhere in the EU even after the UK leaves next year. A UK government spokesman said only citizens of EU member states could hold EU citizenship.

"Chancellor Philip Hammond has told European leaders that it is in the ""mutual interest"" of both the UK and the EU to include financial services in a free trade agreement. In a speech, Mr Hammond set out his argument against ""sceptics"", saying it is possible to reach a deal. But EU president Donald Tusk flat out rejected the UK proposals. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has argued that such a deal had never been done before. But Mr Hammond said the EU has in the past attempted similar agreements. In December, Mr Barnier said: ""There is not a single trade agreement that is open to financial services. It doesn't exist."" Mr Hammond said on Wednesday that the EU itself tried to include financial services on trade deals with the US and Canada. He said: ""If it could be done with Canada or the USA... it could be done with the UK."" The Chancellor stressed: ""I am clear not only that it is possible to include financial services within a trade deal but that it is very much in our mutual interest to do so."" However,European Union president Donald Tusk issued guidelineson Wednesday telling EU negotiators that the UK will have to settle for a more conventional free trade agreement, such as the EU's deal with Canada. EU 'doesn't want to build a wall' The hidden message in Hammondâs EU speech The UK's stance on leaving the single market means the City having to settle for more limited access to European markets, he said. ""I fully understand and of course I respect Theresa May's [political] objective - to demonstrate at any price that Brexit could be a success and was the right choice. ""But sorry, that is not our objective,"" Mr Tusk added. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier says a trade deal including financial services ""does not exist"". Mr Hammond said: ""The EU is a very skilled negotiator... they've negotiated agreements with many countries. They are very skilled and very disciplined in the way they carry out their negotiation, and it doesn't surprise me remotely that what they've set out this morning is a very tough position. ""That's what any competent, skilled and experienced negotiator would do. I expect that we will have a deep and constructive engagement with them, and I hope that what I've set out here this afternoon will contribute to the discussion that we'll be having."" The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier On Tuesday, French economy minister Bruno Le Maire told the BBC: ""Financial services cannot be in a free trade agreement, for many reasons, for reasons of stability, for the sake of supervision because there are some very specific rules for financial services."" He said that the ""best solution"", would be for a system of ""equivalence"" where both sides recognised each other's standards. But Mr Hammond said: ""It is time to address the sceptics who say a trade deal including financial services cannot be done because it has never been done before. ""To them I say 'every trade deal the EU has ever done has been unique'. ""The EU has never negotiated the same arrangement twice. It has bespoke relationships with Turkey, Canada, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland."" In his speech on UK-EU co-operation post-Brexit, the Chancellor referred to past attempts at forging a free trade agreement between the US and Europe. ""The EU itself pursued ambitious financial services co-operation in its proposals for TTIP [the now aborted Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership],"" Mr Hammond said. ""Which it described as a partnership that would be: 'more than a traditional free trade agreement'."" Mr Hammond argued that if the EU tried it before with a nation which doesn't have regulatory alignment on financial services - America - then surely it can do so with a country that it at present does - the UK. But the Chancellor also said a lot more than that. Because the person who proposed ""regulatory co-operation"" on financial services as part of the EU-US free trade negotiations was one Michel Barnier. Read Kamal's blog here. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: ""The Chancellor has shown his hand, and it is clear he is looking for a TTIP type deal as his blueprint. ""Yet those negotiations took nearly four years and collapsed, which is why a transition period is critical."" Mr Hammond also said: ""A trade deal between the UK and the EU must start from the reality of today, that our economies, including in financial services, are interconnected, that our regulatory frameworks are identical."" Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, the trade body that represents the UK financial services sector, said: ""Thousands of customers and businesses in Europe rely on access to financial services from the UK. It is in everyone's interests for this vital cross-border trade to continue.""

"Ed Sheeran's management pressed for change across the secondary ticketing industry The UK's four main secondary ticketing agencies have been banned from using certain ""misleading"" price strategies. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said they had not been clear enough about extra fees added at the end of the booking. The four largest sites are Get Me In, Viagogo, StubHub and Seatwave. Such firms have attracted increasing criticism and last month Google changed the way the sites are listed after pressure from Ed Sheeran's manager. Secondary ticketing sites are designed to re-sell tickets to concerts, shows and events where the original buyer can no longer attend. The ASA's move is the latest in a string of actions taken against businesses who have been accused of misleading fans by claiming that they are official sellers of tickets, over-charging buyers or selling tickets that are invalid if they are re-sold. This video can not be played Mumford and Sons' Ben Lovett: Ticket touting 'sad' Websites must now make the total ticket price, the VAT-inclusive booking fee and the delivery fee clear from the start. The ASA has also banned Viagogo from claiming that it is an ""official site"" after it misleadingly implied it was an official primary ticket outlet rather than a second-hand ticket website. Viagogo is also banned from offering a ""100% Guarantee"" claim which the ASA said misleadingly suggested that consumers were guaranteed entry. The ASA's chief executive, Guy Parker, said: ""Many of us will recognise the frustration of being happy with the initial price of tickets on a secondary website only to be stung by hefty fees when we come to book. ""The message from our rulings is simple and it's clear: The price you see at the start should be the price you pay at the end."" A StubHub spokeswoman said: ""As a consumer-first ticket marketplace, StubHub supports any measures which make ticket buying easier, more convenient and more transparent for fans."" It said it would be ""fully compliant"" with its decision. Claire Turnham had decided to arrange something special for her children to mark a number of significant birthdays. ""I had this idea because it was my 50th, my son's 16th, my youngest daughter's 13th and my middle daughter's 21st that I would surprise them all with these amazing tickets for Ed Sheeran,"" she said. Claire Turnham thought she was paying Â£263 for Ed Sheeran tickets - it ended up costing Â£1,421 After researching how much the tickets would cost, Ms Turnham went on Google: ""I just saw tickets available and so I naturally clicked on it through the advert at the top of the search engine and typed in four tickets. ""There was a lot of pressure,"" she recalls. ""It said 'last four tickets' and I genuinely believed that I was buying the last four tickets and so I was really, really excited."" She said that the four tickets on the secondary ticket selling site Viagogo came to Â£263, which she said was around the price she expected to pay. ""So I clicked buy and I went from that feeling of elation and joy to suddenly complete panic because what actually flashed up was the total cost was Â£1,421. ""I didn't consent to that at all and in fact I didn't have that much money in my bank account so I went then into sheer panic mode."" As a single parent, Ms Turnham said she is very conscious about spending money but discovered that she could not cancel the transaction with her bank because it was a ""pending payment"". Luckily, a friend stepped in to help out financially to give Ms Turnham time to claw back the money from Viagogo. As a result of her experience, Ms Turnham started a group called Victim of Viagogo to help other people out who suffered the same fate as her. She said: ""The amazing thing is we're now up to Â£250,000 in refunds which is a massive, massive amount."" A spokeswoman for Ticketmaster, which owns Seatwave and GetMeIn, said: ""We will continue to work with both the ASA and the CMA to further develop levels of transparency and consumer protection within the UK ticketing sector."" Last November, the competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), said it would take action against such ticketing websites suspected of breaking consumer law. Last year, Ed Sheeran's promoter, Stuart Galbraith, asked Google to change how it listed secondary sites after Viagogo had paid to be listed top of the Google search, and said wrongly that it was an ""official"" seller of the singer's tickets. Research by the campaign group FanFair Alliance showed that in 77% of searches for popular artists, a secondary website had paid to be top of the Google search result.

Kim Jong-un has been pictured smiling with South Korea ministers in Pyongyang in recent days The new sanctions, which came into force on 5 March, are largely symbolic, joining a vast array of punitive economic measures the US has taken against North Korea. The announcement comes a day after a high-level South Korean delegation returned from Pyongyang where they had cordial meetings with Mr Kim. Capitalising on warmer ties after the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, Mr Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in have arranged a landmark meeting for next month. It would be the first such meeting for more than a decade and the first since Kim Jong-un took power in North Korea in 2011. US President Donald Trump has said the developments, includingNorth Korea's suggestion that it might discuss getting rid of its nuclear weapons, ""are positive"" but might be a ""false hope"". In previous programmes to halt its nuclear ambitions, the North has failed to keep its promises. Kim Jong-nam: Main players in mysterious killing The women accused of killing Kim Jong-nam Kim Jong-nam was largely estranged from his family and was bypassed for the leadership in favour of his younger half-brother, Kim Jong-un. He spent most of his time overseas in Macau, mainland China and Singapore. This video can not be played CCTV footage shows the alleged attack at the airport in February 2017 He had spoken out in the past against his family's dynastic control of North Korea and in a 2012 book was quoted as saying he believed his half-brother lacked leadership qualities. He died in February 2017, shortly after Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong accosted him as he checked in for a flight at Kuala Lumpur airport.

"A tent has been erected around the bench where the pair was found unconscious It is a city known mostly for its cathedral and proximity to Stonehenge. But as it finds itself at the centre of a modern-day mystery, what do the residents of Salisbury make of its new-found fame? Quiet. Normal. Quintessentially English. Words like these make medieval Salisbury seem an unlikely home for a former Russian spy. And yet on Sunday, this small city in Wiltshire found itself the topic of global conversation when current resident Sergei Skripal became ill near the main shopping centre. It would probably not have been newsworthy in itself, except it transpiredhe was once a military intelligence colonelwho was convicted, and later pardoned, for passing the identities of Russian secret agents in Europe to the UK's intelligence service, MI6. When the 66-year-old and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia Skripa were found unconscious on a bench near The Maltings, police soon revealed they believed the pair had been exposed to an ""unknown substance"". Now, around the seat where they were found, a tent has been erected. The nearby branch of Zizzi is closed - a tight-lipped police officer guarding the door. The Mill pub, about 200m from the restaurant, is also shut. Salisbury is home to about 40,000 people The city is typically known for its cathedral and proximity to Stonehenge But far from perturbed by the activity unfolding around them, residents and workers simply zigzag around the cordons. People are more worried about the local pie shop being closed, says Leuene Jackman, peering over the police tape at the forensics team. ""Quite a few shops have been closed, it won't be good for business,"" she remarks. ""You just think this sort of thing happens in other parts of the country. ""This is such a quiet city."" Stall holder Amanda Barlow says it's ""business as usual"" Typically known for its cathedral and proximity to Stonehenge, the city is one of the UK's smallest with a population of about 40,000 people. It has been home to many celebrities with Sting, Madonna and Guy Ritchie among those living in nearby villages. The late author Terry Pratchett and former prime minster Edward Heath also called Salisbury home. Now a far less famous resident has given the city the dubious honour of making it an unwitting backdrop to an unfolding mystery that has the hallmarks of a spy novel. ""It's just weird,"" says Janice Parks on one of the main shopping thoroughfares. ""Salisbury is just so quintessentially English."" Salisbury's market was bustling despite the drama She hurries on, rejoining the other shoppers navigating the narrow alleys and busy marketplace. ""It's business as usual really,"" says stall holder, Amanda Barlow. ""People have been looking up into the sky a bit more than normal, watching the circling helicopter. ""It's such a sleepy, tight-knit place. We were quite surprised but it hasn't put people off visiting."" The hot topic of conversation in the cafes and shops has certainly been about ""that Russian spy"" - who despite the close-knit community clichÃ©, seems relatively unknown to those milling around the streets. ""It goes to show we don't know who we live next door to,"" muses Penny Muxworthy, who lives just outside the city. ""People have jobs that might necessitate them [keeping from] people what it is that they do. ""It could happen anywhere."" The world's media has camped out around the police cordons Penny Muxworthy said ""it goes to show we don't know who we live next door to"" Outside the Mill pub, Frank Carter, agrees. ""Salisbury is out of the way isn't it,"" says the 87-year-old, who has lived there his whole life. ""You wouldn't expect it here."" But many remain seemingly unruffled by the news. ""I'm not nervous for my own safety,"" says Sue Doe, smoking a cigarette a stone's throw from the closed Zizzi restaurant. ""I'm just interested to know what's happened."" Others are less keen about the attention it has attracted. ""You're not from the telly are you? I don't want to be on the telly,"" said a man who did not want to be named. ""There's cameramen and [media] on every street corner, you can't move for them."" For others, the publicity is a welcome moment in the spotlight. ""Well, it's definitely put Salisbury on the map,"" quips Doris Bright, before going about her day. Ex-Russian spy collapsed with daughter Sergei Skripal: Who is the former Russian colonel?

"Col Skripal was convicted of ""high treason in the form of espionage"" by Moscow's military court in August 2006 The mystery illness that has afflicted former Russian agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter has prompted UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to note that the case has ""echoes"" of the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko who was poisoned with radioactive material in London in 2006. A British public inquiry concluded in 2016 that Russian agents had murdered Litvinenkoand that Russian President Vladimir Putin himself ""probably approved"" the operation. Of course, we do not know yet the reason for the Skripals' mystery symptoms. The Russian Embassy in London has denied that their country has had any role. Mr Johnson has insisted that Britain will respond ""robustly"" if evidence of state involvement emerges, describing Russia as ""in many respects a malign and disruptive force"". If Russian involvement is found,the foreign secretary appeared to raise a question mark over England's participation in the World Cup, which will be held in Russia this summer. Though subsequently, British officials were at pains to stress he was referring to official representation rather than a boycott by the football team itself. Who is Sergei Skripal? But his remarks highlight the dilemma facing the UK government in dealing with Moscow. It has few diplomatic levers to pull. Alexander Litvinenko fell ill after meeting former KGB contacts in London in 2006 Relations are already frosty - a hang-over from the Litvinenko affair, compounded by serious differences over Russian policies in Ukraine and Syria, let alone Russia's more aggressive noises towards Nato countries in central and northern Europe. It is hard to see what further steps might be taken to encourage a shift in policy in the Kremlin and certainly not by the United Kingdom alone. Since the Litvinenko affair, British policy towards Russia has swung back and forth. Relations went into the freezer in the wake of the assassination, with diplomats expelled and intelligence co-operation halted. David Cameron's government introduced a partial thaw driven by a desire to maximise trade opportunities - perhaps a forerunner of the sorts of concerns that may loom much larger once the UK leaves the European Union. The Ukraine crisis though proved a major set-back with Britain at the forefront of calls for tough economic sanctions against Moscow. The outcome of the public inquiry into the Litvinenko affair only confirmed the government's suspicions of a direct official role in the killing. Alexander Litvinenko: A deadly trail of polonium How can you tell if ex-spy was poisoned? Putin, power and poison: Russiaâs elite FSB spy club Progress towards a nuclear deal with Iran, in which Russia played a key role, helped to soften some criticism of the Kremlin, but Moscow's growing military role in Syria and its indiscriminate bombing campaign there worsened tensions again. Now Russia and the United States seem to be engaged in a mini-nuclear arms race again; tensions between Nato and Russia are growing; and the UK is in any case distracted by its plans to withdraw from the EU. Should this latest case raise credible suspicions of a Russian official role, London may struggle to find an effective response. Relations are already bad and everything that was done in response to the Litvinenko affair may have failed to fundamentally alter Russian behaviour.

In a letter to the firm's CEO Steve Robertson, Mr Khan said: ""I am extremely concerned to see the supply issues experienced this weekend with significant numbers of Londoners being left without water for up to four days. ""While I appreciate that the weather conditions played a part in the water outages and increase in leaks I would have expected Thames Water to have foreseen this and had appropriate plans in place. ""It is critical that Thames Water reviews and steps up plans to upgrade and maintain your network. ""I expect generous compensation to be issued to those affected and that this will be clearly and proactively communicated as well as issued quickly."" A spokesman for Thames Water, said ""The mayor of London and the Consumer Council for Water have asked us to look at how we compensate customers in these circumstances and we've agreed to do so.

"Ed Sheeran's management pressed for change across the secondary ticketing industry The UK's four main secondary ticketing agencies have been banned from using certain ""misleading"" price strategies. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said they had not been clear enough about extra fees added at the end of the booking. The four largest sites are Get Me In, Viagogo, StubHub and Seatwave. Such firms have attracted increasing criticism and last month Google changed the way the sites are listed after pressure from Ed Sheeran's manager. Secondary ticketing sites are designed to re-sell tickets to concerts, shows and events where the original buyer can no longer attend. The ASA's move is the latest in a string of actions taken against businesses who have been accused of misleading fans by claiming that they are official sellers of tickets, over-charging buyers or selling tickets that are invalid if they are re-sold. This video can not be played Mumford and Sons' Ben Lovett: Ticket touting 'sad' Websites must now make the total ticket price, the VAT-inclusive booking fee and the delivery fee clear from the start. The ASA has also banned Viagogo from claiming that it is an ""official site"" after it misleadingly implied it was an official primary ticket outlet rather than a second-hand ticket website. Viagogo is also banned from offering a ""100% Guarantee"" claim which the ASA said misleadingly suggested that consumers were guaranteed entry. The ASA's chief executive, Guy Parker, said: ""Many of us will recognise the frustration of being happy with the initial price of tickets on a secondary website only to be stung by hefty fees when we come to book. ""The message from our rulings is simple and it's clear: The price you see at the start should be the price you pay at the end."" A StubHub spokeswoman said: ""As a consumer-first ticket marketplace, StubHub supports any measures which make ticket buying easier, more convenient and more transparent for fans."" It said it would be ""fully compliant"" with its decision. Claire Turnham had decided to arrange something special for her children to mark a number of significant birthdays. ""I had this idea because it was my 50th, my son's 16th, my youngest daughter's 13th and my middle daughter's 21st that I would surprise them all with these amazing tickets for Ed Sheeran,"" she said. Claire Turnham thought she was paying Â£263 for Ed Sheeran tickets - it ended up costing Â£1,421 After researching how much the tickets would cost, Ms Turnham went on Google: ""I just saw tickets available and so I naturally clicked on it through the advert at the top of the search engine and typed in four tickets. ""There was a lot of pressure,"" she recalls. ""It said 'last four tickets' and I genuinely believed that I was buying the last four tickets and so I was really, really excited."" She said that the four tickets on the secondary ticket selling site Viagogo came to Â£263, which she said was around the price she expected to pay. ""So I clicked buy and I went from that feeling of elation and joy to suddenly complete panic because what actually flashed up was the total cost was Â£1,421. ""I didn't consent to that at all and in fact I didn't have that much money in my bank account so I went then into sheer panic mode."" As a single parent, Ms Turnham said she is very conscious about spending money but discovered that she could not cancel the transaction with her bank because it was a ""pending payment"". Luckily, a friend stepped in to help out financially to give Ms Turnham time to claw back the money from Viagogo. As a result of her experience, Ms Turnham started a group called Victim of Viagogo to help other people out who suffered the same fate as her. She said: ""The amazing thing is we're now up to Â£250,000 in refunds which is a massive, massive amount."" A spokeswoman for Ticketmaster, which owns Seatwave and GetMeIn, said: ""We will continue to work with both the ASA and the CMA to further develop levels of transparency and consumer protection within the UK ticketing sector."" Last November, the competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), said it would take action against such ticketing websites suspected of breaking consumer law.

"Kim Jong-nam (pictured in 2001) was late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il's oldest son The half-brother of Kim Jong-un was killed by a chemical attack in Malaysia on the orders of the North Korean government, the US has concluded. Kim Jong-nam died after a bizarre encounter at Kuala Lumpur airport in 2017, when two women smeared his face with VX nerve agent. The women,who say they believed they were carrying out a prank for a TV show,are on trial for murder. The US said it would impose new sanctions on North Korea in response. ""This public display of contempt for universal norms against chemical weapons use further demonstrates the reckless nature of North Korea and underscores that we cannot afford to tolerate a North Korean WMD program of any kind,"" said State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert. The US has consistently accused North Korea of being behind the attack on Kim Jong-nam. North Korea denies any involvement. Kim Jong-un has been pictured smiling with South Korea ministers in Pyongyang in recent days The new sanctions, which came into force on 5 March, are largely symbolic, joining a vast array of punitive economic measures the US has taken against North Korea. The announcement comes a day after a high-level South Korean delegation returned from Pyongyang where they had cordial meetings with Mr Kim. Capitalising on warmer ties after the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, Mr Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in have arranged a landmark meeting for next month. It would be the first such meeting for more than a decade and the first since Kim Jong-un took power in North Korea in 2011. US President Donald Trump has said the developments, includingNorth Korea's suggestion that it might discuss getting rid of its nuclear weapons, ""are positive"" but might be a ""false hope"".

"Yulia Skripal and her father Sergei are critically ill in hospital The UK would respond ""robustly"" to any evidence of Russian involvement in the collapse of former spy Sergei Skripal, Boris Johnson has said. Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are critically ill in hospital after being found unconscious in Salisbury, Wiltshire. The foreign secretary said he was not pointing fingers at this stage, but described Russia as ""a malign and disruptive force"". Russia has denied any involvement. Downing Street said Home Secretary Amber Rudd will chair a meeting of Cobra, the government's emergency committee, on Wednesday to discuss the Salisbury investigation. Counter Terrorism Police have taken over the investigation from Wiltshire Police. But in a statement, the unit said the inquiry had not been declared a terrorist incident and there was no risk to the wider public. How will experts know if ex-spy was poisoned? The 'quintessentially English' home of a Russian spy Skripal case highlights UK's Russia dilemma Relatives of Mr Skripal - a former Russian colonel convicted of spying for Britain - have told the BBC Russian Service that he believed the Russian special services might come after him at any time. His wife, elder brother and his son have died in the past two years, some in mysterious circumstances, the family believe. Ms Skripal lives in Moscow and has visited her father in the UK regularly, especially over the past two years. This video can not be played CCTV footage shows a man and woman walking near the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found Mr Skripal and his daughter were found slumped and unconscious on a bench outside a shopping centre on Sunday afternoon. CCTV footage has been released by police which appears to show the pair walking through an alleyway near a Zizzi restaurant shortly before they collapsed. Police have since sealed off the restaurant and The Bishop's Mill pub was also cordoned off as a precaution. On Tuesday evening, police extended the cordon and shut off a bridge. Eyewitness Jamie Paine said the woman he saw was passed out, frothing at the mouth and her eyes ""were wide open but completely white"". He added: ""The man went stiff, his arms stopped moving but he was still looking dead straight."" Two police officers caught up in the suspected contamination have been treated in hospital for minor symptoms, before they were given the all clear. It is understood their symptoms included itchy eyes and wheezing. A third member of the emergency services remains in hospital. Scientists at Porton Down - the UK's secret weapons research facility in Wiltshire - are studying the ""unknown substance"". On Tuesday evening, BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban said there are concerns the pair's conditions could worsen. Despite the sending of samples, scientists have still not identified the substance and one official at Porton Down said ""we are treating symptoms rather than causes"", Urban said. Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, Mr Johnson said: ""Honourable members will note the echoes of the death of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. ""I say to governments around the world that no attempt to take innocent life on UK soil will go unsanctioned or unpunished."" Mr Johnson said the UK was ""in the lead across the world"" in trying to counteract a ""host of malign activity"" by Russia. This video can not be played Russian spy attack: What we know so far Russia has insisted it has ""no information"" about what could have led to the incident, but says it is open to co-operating with British police if requested. In a statement,the Russian embassy in London said,external: ""Media reports create an impression of a planned operation by the Russian special services, which is completely untrue."" Responding to Mr Johnson's comments, the embassy added: ""Looks like the script of yet another anti-Russian campaign has been already written."" BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban said Boris Johnson's strongly-worded statement indicates that the Government is ""party to some kind of intelligence"". ""It's evident from the foreign secretary's statement, and certainly the view in Whitehall is, he would not have gone this far unless the government was party to some kind of intelligence about what had gone on,"" Urban said. Col Skripal, 66, had been living in Salisbury after being released by Russia in 2010 Colonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI as part of a swap. He was later flown to the UK. According to BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban, in recent years Col Skripal gave lectures at military academies offering insight into Russia's foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU. Read more about Sergei Skripal's background here. Putin, power and poison: Russiaâs elite FSB spy club Tony Brenton, the former British ambassador to Russia, suggested that Mr Skripal would have had many enemies - including many former colleagues He said: ""The fact that he blew a whole range of Russian agents, there may be personal animosities there. ""In most Russians' minds he would be categorised as a traitor. There are people there who would be delighted to see him dead."" The possibility of an unexplained substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko. The Russian dissident and former intelligence officer died in London after drinking tea laced with a radioactive substance. Apublic inquiry concludedthat his killing had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Andrei Lugovoi, the former Russian agent accused of poisoning Litvinenko but who denies the claims, told the BBC that Russia would have considered the matter closed when Mr Skripal was flown to the UK as part of a spy swap in 2010. This video can not be played Andrei Lugovoi, a suspect in the Litvinenko poisoning, rejects suggestions that Russia was behind Sergei Skripal's collapse Mr Skripal was pardoned by the Russian President and so the incident was over, Mr Lugovoi said. Igor Sutyagin, who was one of four agents released by Moscow in the exchange, is now a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). He told the BBC's World Tonight programme that he was not yet concerned for his safety and added: ""I don't think that he (Mr Skripal) would be targeted, because he was pardoned."" But Mr Litvinenko's widow, Marina Litvinenko, told the programme that the latest incident felt like ""deja vu"" - and called for those receiving political asylum to be protected by the UK. Meanwhile, the Home Affairs Committeehas asked for a review into 14 deaths,externalthat have not been treated as suspicious by British police but have reportedly been identified as potentially linked to Russia. By BBC Monitoring Russian state TV's coverage of the possible poisoning in the UK of former agent Sergei Skripal has been eccentric, to say the least. State TV remains the main source of news for most Russians. The main official TV channel, Rossiya 1, covered the story early in the day, but studiously ignored any comparison with the poisoning in 2006 of former Russian FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko, which has been a prominent feature of reports in the UK media. This evening, the main primetime bulletin on Rossiya 1 and the two other main Russian TV stations, Channel One and NTV, did not touch the story. The oddities in the coverage did not stop there, though. On Rossiya 24, the country's main news channel and the sister channel to Rossiya 1, the Skripal case was the main story this evening, with a report accusing the UK authorities and media of conspiring to blacken Russia's name. The presenter described the case as a ""new classic in British conspirology"" The popular tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda described the case as ""another scandal with a dash of Russophobia"". Russian news agencies reported the indignation expressed by officials as they criticised Boris Johnson's warning to Russia. ""The demonisation of Russia"", said a Russian embassy press release. ""This is preposterous,"" the Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova was quoted as telling Interfax news agency. Mr Johnson's comments are ""unacceptable"" and in ""extremely bad faith,"" said Konstantin Kosachyov, head of the International Affairs Committee of the Federation Council of the upper house of parliament. By Norman Smith, BBC assistant political editor Although Boris Johnson was careful to stress this was still an ongoing investigation - it's absolutely clear he, and others in government, believe it's highly likely this was a Russian state-sponsored attack. The big question now - how does the government respond? A question made more pressing by accusations that ministers were guilty of appeasement in the wake of Alexander Litvinenko's killing. Mr Johnson suggested there could be targeted sanctions against those close to President Putin. And, perhaps most significantly, in an indication the government could seek to rally international support to make a stand against Russia, Mr Johnson said there could be a co-ordinated response with Nato allies. Whatever measures are eventually decided upon - if Russian involvement is proven - it's clear relations between London and Moscow have plunged to new depths.

"Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are in a critical condition in hospital More is known about the substance used in the suspected poisoning of a former Russian double agent and his daughter, the home secretary has said. Speaking after chairing a meeting of the government's emergency committee Cobra, Amber Rudd said the police would be sharing details later on Wednesday. Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found unconscious in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon and remain critically ill. Police want to speak to anyone who was in the city centre around that time. They are particularly keen to speak to people who ate at Zizzi or drank in The Bishop's Mill pub. Meanwhile, fire and ambulance crews have been called to an office next to the Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury, but police are refusing to say whether this is connected. Russian spy: What we know so far How will experts know if ex-spy was poisoned? The 'quintessentially English' home of a Russian spy Skripal case highlights UK's Russia dilemma Sergei Skripal and the 14 deaths under scrutiny Mr Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter were found slumped on a bench outside the Maltings shopping centre. Scientists at the UK's military research facility at Porton Down have been examining a substance thought to be behind their collapse. This video can not be played Amber Rudd provides an update on the substance that left a Russian man critically ill Referring to what she called ""the terrible events"" in Salisbury, Ms Rudd said: ""We need to keep a cool head and collect all the evidence we can. ""We need to make sure that we respond not to rumour but to all the evidence they collect and then we will have to decide what action to take."" She said the police investigation was likely to be lengthy and it was important to make sure they had the space to continue their investigation. Earlier, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, head of Counter Terrorism Policing, appealed for witnesses, saying: ""Did you see anything out of the ordinary? It may be that at the time, nothing appeared out of place or untoward but with what you now know, you remember something that might be of significance... ""The weather was poor that day so there were not as many people out and about. Every statement we can take is important."" Police in protective equipment responded to the incident Cordons have been erected in and around Salisbury. One, at a business park in Amesbury, a town about 10 miles away, has been removed. Two police officers caught up in the suspected contamination were treated in hospital for minor symptoms - believed to be itchy eyes and wheezing - before they were given the all clear. A third member of the emergency services remains in hospital. Relatives of Colonel Skripal, who was convicted in Russia in 2006 of spying for Britain, have told the BBC Russian Service that he believed the country's special services might come after him at any time. It has been said his only friends in the UK are in the British intelligence services, but he has also joined his local railway club and given lectures at military academies. His wife, elder brother and son have all died in recent years. This video can not be played BBC Rewind looks back at cases of high-profile Russians targeted on foreign soil Ms Skripal lives in Moscow and has visited her father in the UK regularly, especially during the past two years. Family and friends say she did move to the UK but missed Russia so returned to Moscow where she has worked for multinationals, including Nike and PepsiCo. It is thought her latest visit to the UK may have been timed to coincide with her late brother's birthday. Alexander Skripal died aged 43 last July in St Petersburg from liver failure in what relatives believe to have been suspicious circumstances. He is buried in Salisbury close to his mother, Liudmila Skripal, who died from cancer in 2012. The possibility of an unexplained substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko- apublic inquiry concludedthe killing of the Russian dissident was probably carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Former MI5 officer Annie Machon pointed out that the two cases were very different, however. Mr Litvinenko was a whistleblower, dissident and consultant for MI6 actively at the time of his death, she said, whereas Mr Skripal has already been caught, convicted and pardoned and allowed to freely find safe haven in the UK. ""There's no conceivable reason that I can see that the Russian state would have been targeting him at the moment,"" she told BBC's Breakfast. ""That's why we need to think about what else he might have been involved in."" This video can not be played BBC Newsnight visits the graves of Liudmila Skripal and Alexander Skripal in Salisbury Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said: ""These people have been used by the foreign media for an anti-Russian campaign.
