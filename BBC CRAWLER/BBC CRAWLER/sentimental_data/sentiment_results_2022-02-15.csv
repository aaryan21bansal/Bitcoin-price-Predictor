"What comes next for Prince Andrew after he settles the claims against him? If Prince Andrew had gone to court in the US to fight it out with Virginia Giuffre, it would have made headlines as tall as a New York skyscraper. That royal disaster zone has been averted by anout-of-court settlement. But it comes with high costs to Prince Andrew, both financial and reputational, and it will be a long road back before there is any chance of clearing his name in terms of public opinion. He won't get back any of the royal patronages, military links or the HRH title that weretaken away from him. And the many questions raised by hisBBC Newsnight interview- about his connections with Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein and details such as his inability to sweat - will be left unanswered. If not a smoking gun, there is still the unexplained smoke from a Woking pizza oven. The implication of this deal means he is potentially paying millions of dollars to someone he still contends he has no memory of ever meeting. The deal says that Prince Andrew ""regrets his association with Epstein"", but that picture of the prince with the sex offender will continue to haunt him. That even more famous picture of Ms Giuffre, Prince Andrew and Maxwell, taken in London almost 21 years ago, will always be there when his name is mentioned, frozen in digital aspic. Long shadows have been cast which will be hard to shift. This video can not be played Prince Andrew says he cannot recall any incident involving Virginia Roberts Prince Andrew spoke to BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis in 2019 about his relationship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Watch thefull interview on the BBC's YouTube channel,external. Legal experts had been predicting that a settlement was the most likely outcome from this civil court case, in which Ms Giuffre had brought sexual assault claims against Prince Andrew. ""It was the best of the bad options available to him,"" said Gideon Benaim, a partner at law firm Simkins, who specialises in protecting high-profile reputations. ""If it had continued it would have inevitably damaged him even further,"" said Mr Benaim. Prince Andrew settles sex assault claims Ruthless royals move to limit damage Prince Andrew loses HRH and military titles Anna Rothwell at law firm Corker Binning said Prince Andrew's Newsnight interview on its own ""would have given Ms Giuffre's lawyers a wealth of material to use in cross examination"". But where does it leave Prince Andrew now? A few weeks ago his legal team was full of fighting talk about being ready to battle it out in court and wanting to knock down Ms Giuffre's allegations. Now the tone has changed completely to recognising that Ms Giuffre has ""suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks"". The civil claims against Prince Andrew had already produced damaging headlines for the royals But Mr Benaim says the deal avoids any admission of guilt and any personal wrongdoing and stops a case which threatened an endless supply of negative headlines. ""Reputationally he had to get rid of this - almost regardless of the cost,"" said the lawyer. Prince Andrew can maintain his innocence, with nothing proven against him, and he could argue that he was paying a price to protect his family from any further damaging coverage. The number of zeroes in that payment remains confidential, but it's likely to look like a long row of those emojis of popping eyes. There is also some ambiguity about whether it is one or two payments being made. ""The parties will file a stipulated dismissal upon Ms Giuffre's receipt of the settlement (the sum of which is not being disclosed). ""Prince Andrew intends to make a substantial donation to Ms Giuffre's charity in support of victims' rights,"" says the joint statement accompanying the deal. Whether that means separate payments to Ms Giuffre and the charity has not been clarified by Prince Andrew's representatives. Who is paying for the pay-out could be another issue. Kate Macnab, a lawyer at Reeds Solicitors, says: ""It is likely there will be some demands to know where the payment is coming from - public or private purse?"" In terms of what comes next, the settlement contains a line suggesting how he might try to begin restoring his reputation. ""He pledges to demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims."" Although at the moment he might be at risk of losing more links with organisations, than making new ones - particularly anything connected to sex trafficking. There will still be constitutional roles. Prince Andrew remains a counsellor of state, unless legislation is passed to change that, which means he is one of four senior royals who could act in place of the Queen if illness meant she was unable to carry out official duties. From the wider Royal Family there might be relief that the case is over, rather than facing aPlatinum Jubilee yearclouded by allegations and more revelations. But for Prince Andrew it's hard to see any way back to public life. Will he be able to take part in jubilee events or official royal family occasions? Even with no admission of guilt, or any concessions to the claims against him, his future relationship with the public, and any appearances at royal events, will be awkward to say the least.

"About 500 young people could be eligible for the scheme Every 18-year-old leaving care will be offered Â£1,600 a month for two years under a Welsh government basic income pilot. It is expected about 500 people will be eligible to join the scheme, which could cost up to Â£20m. Officials said it was the highest amount offered on a basic income scheme anywhere in the world. The Welsh Conservatives said it was a waste of money while Plaid Cymru called for the pilot to be expanded. The Â£1,600 a month will be taxed and is expected to be counted as income by the UK government, meaning it would affect someone's eligibility for benefits. It will be unconditional and will not be withdrawn if participants get a job. What is a universal basic income? Spain to use basic income to ease crisis pain Most Welsh homes to get Â£150 payment But the Welsh government is no longer calling the plans a pilot of Universal Basic Income (UBI), where a wider group of people would be given a regular sum of money. Ministers want to test out how the payments could help care leavers be better placed for their transition into independence as adults. Social Justice Minister Jane Hutt said the plans would ""deliver financial stability for a generation of young people that need it most"". Milly said the pilot is a ""good opportunity"" for carers A teenager who has foster parents said the pilot could make care leavers ""equal with everyone else"". Milly, 17, represents the National Youth Advocacy service on the Welsh Youth Parliament and has spoken openly about her care experiences. She said the pilot was a good opportunity, adding people in care were ""disadvantaged financially and this will bring us level"". She said it would be a ""safety net"" for those who have been in care who may not have support from their families. ""Many have been damaged, physical and mentally - this can help pay for private counselling or therapy as often public waiting lists for these services are so long."" Although she welcomes the announcement, Milly still has questions about how the payments will be rolled out: ""I'd like to see evidence that everyone in care will be entitled to it."" Every person leaving care at the age of 18 for the first 12 months of the pilot will be offered the chance to take part. They will receive payments for 24 months, amounting to an income worth Â£19,000 before tax annually, with the first payment a month after their 18th birthday. Officials say it is equivalent to thereal living wage,externaland will be taxed at thebasic rate,external. This video can not be played An experiment in Finland saw 2,000 people paid â¬560 (Â£490) a month, instead of their unemployment benefit. Laura Tams, 42, from Pontardawe, who has been fostering for six years, toldBBC Radio Walesadditional support was also needed for young people leaving care. ""These children have been through things that to you and I belong in nightmares. We cannot all of a sudden expect them at 18 to be able to run a house and to spend that money wisely."" Welsh officials are also promising extra support for those taking part, such as financial wellbeing training. There is no date for when the scheme will be launched, although officials said it was likely to be in the summer. Alex Sommerville, who was in care when she was younger, said she was concerned young people would not want to go into education or work Former youth worker Alex Sommerville, who left care when she was younger, toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summersshe did not believe the scheme would encourage care leavers to find work, or study further. Ms Somerville, from Swansea, said: ""Some would still want to go for education or work, but there is a part of me thinking, if you're getting that wage every month, why would you?"" ""I'm very worried about giving young people all of that money and expecting them to know how to spend it in the best way for themselves."" Welsh Conservative spokesman for social partnership Joel James said trials had shown basic income failed to incentivise work and had proven to be a ""waste of public money"". Plaid Cymru's economy spokesman Luke Fletcher said it was a step in the right direction but needed a ""structure around it to enable it to meet the ambition of addressing poverty and unemployment, as well as improving health and financial wellbeing"". The income will be subject to tax UBI is where a government pays all individuals a set amount, regardless of their means. Backers say it could help reduce poverty and be easier and less stressful to navigate than more complex means-tested benefits, but opponents say it is extremely costly and not targeted at those who need it. Once it was announced that the pilot would focus on care leavers, critics argued it was not actually universal. The Welsh government had initially described it as a pilot of UBI, but has now stopped doing so. Asked why it was not a trial of UBI, Social Justice Minister Jane Hutt told BBC Wales that the government needed ""to be realistic"". and the pilot needed to be ""meaningful in terms of the funding"". A basic income for care leavers has been tried in Santa Clara, California, where 72 young adults received $1,000 (Â£739)initially for 12 months,external. In Finland, research on a basic income pilot with jobless people for two years found it did not lead them to find work,although they felt happier. The Welsh government plans were welcomed by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, a charity which researches poverty in the UK. To match the level of basic income for care leavers at about the real living wage is bold. With so many people in Wales paid only the national minimum wage there may well be those who think the offer to care leavers is over-generous. But in economic terms if the project is successful and results in better paid work and healthier lives, the long-term benefits would flow back into the economy. While this is not is a pilot of UBI, its outcomes will be relevant to the debate around that.

"Prince Andrew, Virginia Roberts and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2001 Prince Andrew has settled a civil sexual assault case brought against him in the US by Virginia Giuffre. Ms Giuffre had been suing the Duke of York, claiming he sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17, allegations he has repeatedly denied. A letter filed to the US district court on Tuesday said the duke and Ms Giuffre had reached an out-of-court settlement. It said the duke - who makes no admission of liability - would pay an undisclosed sum to Ms Giuffre. In a letter to US judge Lewis A Kaplan, Ms Giuffre's lawyer David Boies wrote jointly with Prince Andrew's lawyers to say the pair had reached ""a settlement in principle"". A statement included with the letter read: ""The parties will file a stipulated dismissal upon Ms Giuffre's receipt of the settlement (the sum of which is not being disclosed)."" It said the duke would make a ""substantial donation to Ms Giuffre's charity in support of victims' rights"". Prince Andrew, the statement added, had ""never intended to malign Ms Giuffre's character"" and he recognised she had ""suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks"". The duke also pledged to ""demonstrate his regret for his association"" with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein by supporting the ""fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims"". He also commended the ""bravery of Ms Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others"". Prince Andrew's lawyers had previously said he was ready to go before a jury to fight Ms Giuffre's claims, with a trial expected later this year. Who are Virginia Giuffre's powerhouse lawyers? Who is Prince Andrew's Hollywood lawyer? His representatives said he had no comment beyond what was said in the document filed to the court. Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the settlement. Although the exact amount of the financial settlement has not been revealed, reports have speculated that it could run into millions of pounds. It has prompted questions about how the duke - who receives a Royal Navy pension and a stipend from the Queen'sDuchy of Lancaster income- will fund the settlement. Kate Macnab, a lawyer at Reeds Solicitors, says: ""It is likely there will be some demands to know where the payment is coming from - public or private purse?"" Graham Smith from the anti-monarchy group Republic said taxpayers deserved to know where the money for the settlement was coming from. Ms Giuffre, who was previously known as Virginia Roberts, claimed she was the victim of sex trafficking and abuse by financier Epstein from the age of 16. Epstein died in prison in 2019 while awaiting a sex trafficking trial. She said part of the abuse saw her lent out to powerful men, including Prince Andrew, who is the third child of the Queen and ninth in line to the throne. Ms Giuffre, now 38, claimed the duke, 61, sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17 at Ghislaine Maxwell's home in London, in Epstein's mansion in New York and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands. Once the trial was given the nod, it was always going to be uncomfortable, to say the least, for Prince Andrew - but this settlement is about as good as it gets for him, barring going to trial and winning. He avoids having to give a sworn statement, which was scheduled for early next month; he makes no admission of guilt; there will be no civil trial, no further airing of accusations and evidence. He is innocent, because he has not been found guilty of anything. So he is disentangled from any legal threat. But he is still badly damaged by the past few years; his friendship with a convicted paedophile and a convicted child trafficker will always hang over his reputation; the very fact that a civil trial beckoned will, rightly or wrongly, be held against him. There's nothing from the palace tonight about the settlement. Instead journalists were pointed toward the announcement in January that the Prince would lose his Royal titles and patronages. That fits with what sources have indicated for the past few years - that there is no way back for Prince Andrew. In a 2019 interview with BBC Newsnight, Prince Andrew said he had no memory of ever meeting Ms Giuffre and said her account of their London meeting and sex at a house in Belgravia ""didn't happen"". He also saidknowing Epstein had had ""some seriously beneficial outcomes"",at a time when he had left a career in the Navy and begun one as a trade and industry special representative. Ms Giuffre claims the late billionaire financier trafficked her to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17. In January, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New Yorkruled that the civil action over him could go ahead. Buckingham Palace later announced thatPrince Andrew's military titles and royal patronages had been returned to the Queenand that he would defend Ms Giuffre's civil case as a ""private citizen"". A royal source said he would also stop using the title His Royal Highness in an official capacity. Who is Prince Andrew and what titles is he losing? Who is Prince Andrew accuser Virginia Giuffre? Lisa Bloom, a lawyer representing several of Epstein's accusers, welcomed the duke's settlement as a ""victory"" for Ms Giuffre. In a statement on Twitter on behalf of her clients, she wrote: ""We hail Virginia's victory today. She has accomplished what no-one else could: getting Prince Andrew to stop his nonsense and side with sexual abuse victims. We salute Virginia's stunning courage."" The settlement is likely to come as a relief to the Royal Family, BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said, as it means the prospect of a trial will not disrupt the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations. He said the duke could have been under pressure from within his family to settle the case to avoid further public court hearings. This settlement may feel like it has come from nowhere, but it's been hard to find a lawyer who thought that Prince Andrew would fight this case all the way to jury trial. What is remarkable, however, is the wording. A settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing, but the prince does not repeat his oft-repeated insistence that he did nothing wrong. Earlier in the case, he had allowed his lawyers to accuse Ms Giuffre of initiating a ""baseless lawsuit... to achieve another payday at his expense"". She was accused of making so much money from her Epstein allegations that she had a ""compelling motive"" to launch a ""frivolous"" lawsuit against the prince. All that is gone, never to be repeated again: swept away in a 32-word sentence that accepts Virginia Giuffre has been a victim of abuse and her character cannot be questioned. The courtroom drama is over before it began. The court of public opinion will decide what the prince's words mean. In December last year, Maxwell, 60,was found guilty of recruiting and trafficking underage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. Last month,the former British socialite officially requested a retrialafter a juror in the case told the media he used his own experience of being sexually abused to influence jurors reaching a verdict. Virginia Giuffre and Prince Andrew have reached an out-of-court settlement. The parties will file a stipulated dismissal upon Ms Giuffre's receipt of the settlement (the sum of which is not being disclosed). Prince Andrew intends to make a substantial donation to Ms Giuffre's charity in support of victims' rights. Prince Andrew has never intended to malign Ms Giuffre's character, and he accepts that she has suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks. It is known that Jeffrey Epstein trafficked countless young girls over many years. Prince Andrew regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Ms Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others. He pledges to demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims.

"Should people receive a basic income? The idea of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) has sparked a heated debate. The Welsh government pilot is set tofocus on people leaving care. It was anideamooted last year following an increased interest from policymakers and debates across the world, with a number of projects having taken place. Supporters of UBI schemes, usually seen as a sum of money paid to everyone, say it would ensure people do not fall through gaps in the benefit system. Others argue it is not clear whether it would be the best way to ease poverty. The UK government, which controls benefits, has said it did not think it would be an incentive to work. And a cross-party Senedd committee has said the pilot would provide only""limited information""on the concept. But the Welsh government said it would provide ""valuable information"". Did Finland's free money experiment work? Universal credit: 'There isn't enough to survive' A universal basic income (UBI) is where a government pays all individuals a set salary regardless of their means. Currently, most benefits in the UK are determined on several different factors, such as employment, whether someone has children, or whether they have a disability. Under UBI, everyone would get a set amount of money, regardless of circumstances. An important decision would be how much it would pay out - it could be set to be enough to live on, or a partial sum of that. The Welsh government plans a three-year pilot this April with about 250 care leavers A spokesman for the Welsh government said: ""We have followed the progress of universal basic income pilot projects around the world with interest and believe there is an opportunity to test the concept in Wales."" The announcement last year raised questions on social media about whether the suggested pilot was really UBI - because it was focusing on a targeted group. Last May, Tory MP Stephen Crabbtweeted,external: ""There are strong arguments for additional support for care leavers who are far more likely to not be in education, work or training than others. But targeted support is the opposite of UBI theory."" He said it was an ""age old problem with UBI - squaring universality, adequacy and affordability"". This video can not be played An experiment in Finland saw 2,000 people paid â¬560 (Â£490) a month, instead of their unemployment benefit. Yes, but on a small scale. The largest reported experiment has been in Kenya,where 20,000 individuals,externalin 197 villages have received sums of cash from not-for-profit group GiveDirectly. In Finland 2,000 people were given a monthly flat payment of â¬560 (Â£490; $634 at the time) from January 2017 to December 2018. The aim was to see if a guaranteed safety net would help people find jobs, and support them if they had to take insecure work. This video can not be played Stockton in California has trialled a universal basic income scheme Researchers found it left people feeling happier and less stressed, but did not lead them to find work. Stockton - a small city in California - has paid $500 a month (Â£350) to 125 residents. A study theresuggested,externalthose who have received money have had improved job prospects - unlike the Finland experiment. Seven out of 10 win benefits challenges in court Families face 'crisis point' due to rising costs In Wales some councils have called for the Welsh government to hold pilots in their areas - including Labour run-Swansea, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Cardiff - as well as Gwynedd, where Plaid Cymru is in power. Swansea is among the councils that have called for a pilot in their areas In Cardiff's case, leader Huw Thomas said last year that his administration would be ""supportive of a UBI trial taking place in Cardiff in the future because bold solutions are needed to respond to the entrenched inequality and economics hardship facing far too many of our residents"". ""Given that the emerging economic crisis risks significantly exacerbating this already precarious situation, the need for new ideas to improve our benefits system has only become more urgent,"" he told the council in 2020. There has been pressure elsewhere in the Labour party, with a Senedd motion by Alyn and Deeside member Jack Sargeant calling for UK government funding for a Wales-wide UBI trial backed by many of his backbench colleagues, as well as those in Plaid Cymru. Benefits in Wales are controlled from Westminster, rather than Cardiff. Following the Welsh government's initial announcement, a Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ""We have no plans to introduce a universal basic income. ""It would not incentivise work, target those most in need in society, or work for those who need more support, such as disabled people and those with caring responsibilities. ""Meanwhile our approach to welfare recognises the value of supporting people into well paid work, whilst protecting the most vulnerable in society."" Supporters of UBI include the Adam Smith Institute - a think tank more associated with the right of the political spectrum. In a 2013 article, Sam Bowman from the organisation said a basic income would eliminate ""benefit traps"" - where people feel unable to move into work because they will lose more money than remaining on welfare payments. ""The ideal welfare system is a basic income, replacing the existing anti-poverty programmes the government carries out,""he wrote,external. Some have argued that a UBI is needed while automation threatens to put people out of work. Lowri Walters of UBI Lab Wales - a campaign group advocating the idea's adoption in Wales - told BBC Radio Wales that it would give people a ""safety net"". She said it would do away with the means-tested process for benefits which she said had a ""lot of stigma attached"". ""Even with Universal Credit people have to wait five weeks to get that first payment,"" she told Breakfast with Claire Summers. Ms Waters called for a UBI of around Â£100-Â£150 a week, and about Â£60-Â£80 per child, targeting 5,000-10,000 people, ""guided by the Welsh deprivation index"". Anna Coote, principle fellow of the New Economics Foundation, has questioned whether it would be better to invest in services, rather than UBI. Her organisation supported a guarantee that incomes do not fall below a certain point, rather than a payment that goes to everyone. ""Imagine if you had free childcare and social care, and special housing services and free public transport - you could invest in those services, and they would be worth a huge amount more, especially to poor families,"" she told Radio Wales. Could funding free transport be a better way of tackling poverty? Victoria Winckler, of Welsh think tank the Bevan Foundation, said last June that there were ""immediate and deliverable actions"" that could be taken to help people meet their basic needs, which are ""more practical, but much less headline-grabbing"". ""Universal Credit could be increased further, more help provided with housing and childcare costs, and the benefit cap raised or scrapped altogether,"" she saidin an article in 2020,external, written in the midst of the economic upheaval of the pandemic. Ms Winckler said that as a rough estimate a UBI of Â£231 per week - set at a level thought needed for a socially acceptable standard of living - would cost Â£21bn, more than the Welsh government's current budget. But the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, an anti-poverty charity, said it was ""not clear"" whether a UBI was the most effective way to direct and spend a large investment in social security to reduce poverty. ""Much of the recent interest in and support for a universal basic income stems from the increased insecurity many working people now face in our labour market,"" said foundation director Helen Barnard, in response to First Minister Mark Drakeford's initial proposals. ""Changes to social security can treat the symptoms of this problem, which leaves far too many workers trapped on low wages in insecure jobs, but they cannot solve its root causes."" The Welsh Conservatives have argued against the scheme, saying Wales should not be used as a ""petri dish for failed left-wing policies"". Mark Drakeford leads the Welsh government as first minister In an interview with BBC Wales, Mr Drakeford said his pilot would ""see whether the promises that basic income holds out are generally delivered"" in people's lives. He said a pilot would ""need to be carefully designed to make sure that it is genuinely adding income for the group of people we are able to work with"". ""It'll have to be a pilot,"" he said, ""because we don't have all the powers in our own hands to do it on our own. ""It'll have to be carefully crafted to make sure that it is affordable and that it does it within the powers available to the Senedd.""

"Prince Andrew has settled a civil sexual assault case brought against him in the US by Virginia Giuffre. The settlement comes a month after it was announced that Prince Andrew's military titles and royal patronages would be returned to the Queen and he would stop using the title His Royal Highness in an official capacity. The 61-year-old Duke of York is the third child of the Queen and he isninth in line to the throne,external. His elder siblings are Charles, Prince of Wales and Anne, the Princess Royal. He is divorced from Sarah, Duchess of York, with whom he has two daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie. Prince Andrew loses military titles and use of HRH Prince Andrew married Sarah Ferguson in 1986 at Westminster Abbey The Duke of York has been accused of sexual abuse in a civil case in the US. In court documents, Virginia Giuffre says she was the victim of sex trafficking and abuse by Jeffrey Epstein from the age of 16. Part of her abuse involved being lent out to other powerful men - including Prince Andrew, she alleges. Ms Giuffre says the duke sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was under the age of 18. Prince Andrew has consistently denied all the allegations against him. He said in aninterview with BBC Newsnight in 2019that he had no recollection of ever meeting Virginia Giuffre. On 15 February a letter filed to the US district court on Tuesday said the duke and Ms Giuffre hadreached an out-of-court settlement. It said the duke - who makes no admission of liability - would pay an undisclosed sum to Ms Giuffre. Prince Andrew settles US civil sex assault case No details about the size of the settlement and how it will be paid have been made public - although there are reports it couldrun into millions,external. In addition, Prince Andrew has also agreed to make a ""substantial donation to Ms Giuffre's charity in support of victims' rights"". There has already been much speculation about whether Prince Andrew could personally afford to pay the settlement. It's thought Prince Andrew received an annual sum from theSovereign Grant - which covers official duties,external- until 2019, when he stood down as a working Royal. However, the amount was not made public and it is not known whether he now gets money from the Queen's private funds. Prince Andrew also receives an armed forces pension, thought to be about Â£20,000 a year. He is selling a luxury chalet in the Swiss resort of Verbier, which hebought in 2015 for between Â£8m and Â£13m with his ex-wife Sarah, Duchess of York. It is not known how much the sale will raise once any remaining mortgage debt has been deducted. In 2007, Prince Andrewsold his Sunninghill Park home for Â£15m - Â£3m more than the asking price- to Timor Kulibayev, the son-in-law of the then-president of Kazakhstan. The 12-bedroom house near Windsor Castle had been given to Prince Andrew as a wedding present from the Queen. How will Prince Andrew afford the payment? Prince Andrew will no longer be called His Royal Highness, or HRH, a royal source said. LikeHarry and Meghan,Prince Andrew retains his title HRH but will not use it in any official capacity. The duke had a 22-year career in the Royal Navy, and served as a helicopter pilot during the 1982 Falklands War. He also commanded the mine countermeasures vessel HMS Cottesmore. Prince Andrew served as a Royal Navy helicopter pilot for 22 years His military appointments were suspended after he stepped back from public duties in 2019. But he has now lost a series of UK military titles: Colonel of the Grenadier Guards - one of the most senior infantry regiments in the British army. He took this role over from his father Prince Philip in 2017 Honorary air commodore of RAF Lossiemouth Colonel-in-chief of the Royal Irish Regiment Colonel-in-chief of the Small Arms School Corps Colonel-in-chief of The Royal Lancers (Queen Elizabeth's Own) Colonel-in-chief of the Yorkshire Regiment Commodore-in-Chief of the Fleet Air Arm Royal colonel of the Royal Highland Fusiliers Royal colonel of the Royal Regiment of Scotland He has also lost a number of overseas honorary military titles: Colonel-in-Chief of the Queen's York Rangers (Canada) Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Highland Fusiliers of Canada Colonel-in-Chief of the Princess Louise Fusiliers (Canada) Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal New Zealand Army Logistic Regiment Prince Andrew retains his service role as a Vice-Admiral in the Royal Navy. Thejob of a royal patron is to bring publicity to a causeor service. Prince Andrew used to be a patron to about 200 charities and organisations. But after the controversial BBC interview in 2019, in which he denied allegations that he had sex with Virginia Giuffre, many chose to cut ties with him. They included the Outward Bound Trust, English National Ballet, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and London Metropolitan University. Prince Andrew had still been left with dozens of other patronages - including being a patron or member of prestigious golf clubs, schools and cultural trusts. But these have now been returned to the Queen and will be redistributed to other members of the Royal Family. All of Prince Andrew's roles have been immediately returned to his mother, the Queen After retiring from the Navy, Prince Andrew served as the UK's special representative for trade and investment for 10 years. But he gave up the title after he was criticised over his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, who wassentenced to 18 months in prison in 2008 for soliciting a minor for prostitution. He had also attracted criticism for combining business with pleasure on his overseas trips, and some newspapers gave him the nickname ""Airmiles Andy"". The prince's judgement has also been questioned for holding meetings with Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's son Saif, and for entertaining the son-in-law of Tunisia's ousted president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali at Buckingham Palace. And in November 2010, a secret cable published on Wikileaks revealed a US ambassador wrote that he spoke ""cockily"" during an official engagement, leading a discussion that ""verged on the rude"". From 2011 to 2019, Prince Andrew was a working Royal. One focus was Pitch@Palace - an initiative he started to help entrepreneurs seeking investment. In 2020it removed Prince Andrew's name from its website, after prominent supporters distanced themselves amid revelations about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.

"This video can not be played Finland has just completed a major basic income experiment where 2,000 unemployed people were given â¬560 (Â£490) a month for two years, instead of their unemployment benefit. The basic income was paid with no strings attached. Recipients weren't required to seek or accept jobs but still received the payment if they found a job. The Finnish government wanted to see if this financial incentive encouraged people to get jobs or start businesses.

"The spill happened off the north Wales coast on Monday About 500 barrels of oil has leaked from a pipe off the north Wales coast. The pipe, which runs between two platforms named Conwy and Douglas, was shut off following the leak on Monday and remains closed. Operator ENI UK said details of what happened about 20 miles (33km) north of Rhyl, Denbighshire, were still being confirmed, but no-one was affected. The firm said there would be updates as details emerged but the Welsh secretary said no oil should reach Wales' shores. A leak of about 500 barrels is just under 80,000 litres. Petrol and diesel prices reach new record high Homes with oil-powered heating see 50% price rise The Douglas complex consists of three platforms and is located about 15 miles (24km) off the north Wales coast. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said its counter pollution and salvage team, together with the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, was monitoring ENI's response and was ""assisting partner local authorities in an ongoing response"". The spill happened off the north Wales coast on Monday Environment body Natural England said it was monitoring the incident and had ""plans in place"" if any action was needed. Greg Hands, UK minister for Energy, Clean Growth and Climate Change, said he was ""being kept regularly updated"" on the situation and was making sure the ENI fulfilled its legal obligation. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart added: ""Any residual oil is not expected to beach on the north Wales coastline and teams are in place on the Lancashire coast ready to respond if any oil beaches there."" ENI is involved with oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production, as well as in the supply, trading and shipping of natural gas, LNG, electricity and fuels. Through refineries and chemical plants, it processes crude oil to produce fuels, lubricants and chemical products. Dr Peter Robins said oil spills could disperse back and forth with tides Dr Peter Robins, senior lecturer in physical oceanography at Bangor University, said: ""An oil spill will tend to spread out over the surface of the ocean and it'll spread naturally through the mixing of the ocean waters. ""Where it's spilt in the middle of Liverpool Bay, there tends to be stronger flood tides so it might tend to drift eastwards, maybe towards the English coast there. ""At the moment we're experiencing quite strong south-westerly winds and they're going to also tend to push the oil eastwards towards the English coast, I think.""

"This video can not be played Speaking after a Cobra meeting, Boris Johnson says intel on Ukraine is not encouraging Boris Johnson has said there are ""mixed signals"" from Russia, after it said it was pulling back some of its troops from near Ukraine. The PM said talks between Russia and Western powers has shown ""signs of a diplomatic opening"" to avert conflict. But he added latest intelligence on Russian military activity was ""not encouraging"". Russia denies it is planning an attack, despite having more than 100,000 troops at Ukraine's border. The build-up has brought increasingly grave warnings in recent days, with the UK joining the US in saying an invasion could come at any time. LIVE: Latest developments in Ukraine crisis Russia pulls some troops back from Ukraine border Is Russia going to invade Ukraine? Speaking to reporters after an emergency meeting of UK ministers to discuss the situation, Mr Johnson said Russia had shown an ""openness to conversations"" about resolving the crisis diplomatically. But he added that intelligence on Tuesday showed Russian forces were ""being brought closer to the border"" with Ukraine. Intelligence suggests Russia is also constructing field hospitals near the border, he added, in what could only be interpreted as ""as preparation for an invasion"". He said the West wanted to see a ""programme of de-escalation"" from Russia, and had a ""very tough"" set of sanctions ""ready to go"" in the event an invasion takes place. He added that the UK was prepared to target Russian banks and companies, and stop them raising money on London's financial markets. He also said British ministers had made the ""balanced decision"" to keep the UK's embassy open in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv - after the US announced it was relocating its embassy operations to the western city of Lviv. Mr Johnson said the UK had to ""face the fact that there is a risk,"" but added that keeping the embassy going ""for as long as possible"" is ""an important symbol"" of the UK's continued support for Ukraine. He also warned a programme of sanctions was ready to go if Russia did go ahead with an invasion - warning the UK was ready to target ownership of companies and the ability of Russians to raise capital on London's markets. Since 2015, the UK had sent dozens of troops to Ukraine to help train their armed forces. But the remaining UK forces, consisting of about 100 personnel, are now out of Ukraine, the BBC has been told. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace is understood to have confirmed this to MPs on a briefing call on Tuesday afternoon. Ukrainian Armed Forces hold a drill in the eastern part of the country Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to take a ""very tough line on sanctions,"" arguing that Russia needs to know there would be ""serious consequences"" if they took action against Ukraine. Russia's defence minister has said that some of the country's troops positioned on the border with Ukraine would be returning to their bases. Nato's secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said there had been no signs of ""reduced Russian military presence on the borders of Ukraine"". But he added that Moscow's ""willingness to continue to engage in diplomatic efforts"" gave ""reason for cautious optimism"". In a letter to MPs, Foreign Office Secretary Liz Truss said the government judged that an invasion was ""highly likely"" but she also warned ""this stalemate could continue for an extended period"". Conservative MP and former British army officer Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, warned against trusting Russian statements about the situation in Ukraine. Speaking to the BBC's World at One, he said: ""Let's not pretend we can believe anything that comes out of Moscow - they have lied and lied and lied."" Has Putin's war in Ukraine failed?

"This video can not be played Speaking after a Cobra meeting, Boris Johnson says intel on Ukraine is not encouraging Boris Johnson has said there are ""mixed signals"" from Russia, after it said it was pulling back some of its troops from near Ukraine. The PM said talks between Russia and Western powers has shown ""signs of a diplomatic opening"" to avert conflict. But he added latest intelligence on Russian military activity was ""not encouraging"". Russia denies it is planning an attack, despite having more than 100,000 troops at Ukraine's border. The build-up has brought increasingly grave warnings in recent days, with the UK joining the US in saying an invasion could come at any time. LIVE: Latest developments in Ukraine crisis Russia pulls some troops back from Ukraine border Is Russia going to invade Ukraine? Speaking to reporters after an emergency meeting of UK ministers to discuss the situation, Mr Johnson said Russia had shown an ""openness to conversations"" about resolving the crisis diplomatically. But he added that intelligence on Tuesday showed Russian forces were ""being brought closer to the border"" with Ukraine. Intelligence suggests Russia is also constructing field hospitals near the border, he added, in what could only be interpreted as ""as preparation for an invasion"". He said the West wanted to see a ""programme of de-escalation"" from Russia, and had a ""very tough"" set of sanctions ""ready to go"" in the event an invasion takes place. He added that the UK was prepared to target Russian banks and companies, and stop them raising money on London's financial markets. He also said British ministers had made the ""balanced decision"" to keep the UK's embassy open in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv - after the US announced it was relocating its embassy operations to the western city of Lviv. Mr Johnson said the UK had to ""face the fact that there is a risk,"" but added that keeping the embassy going ""for as long as possible"" is ""an important symbol"" of the UK's continued support for Ukraine. He also warned a programme of sanctions was ready to go if Russia did go ahead with an invasion - warning the UK was ready to target ownership of companies and the ability of Russians to raise capital on London's markets. Since 2015, the UK had sent dozens of troops to Ukraine to help train their armed forces. But the remaining UK forces, consisting of about 100 personnel, are now out of Ukraine, the BBC has been told. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace is understood to have confirmed this to MPs on a briefing call on Tuesday afternoon. Ukrainian Armed Forces hold a drill in the eastern part of the country Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to take a ""very tough line on sanctions,"" arguing that Russia needs to know there would be ""serious consequences"" if they took action against Ukraine. Russia's defence minister has said that some of the country's troops positioned on the border with Ukraine would be returning to their bases. Nato's secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said there had been no signs of ""reduced Russian military presence on the borders of Ukraine"". But he added that Moscow's ""willingness to continue to engage in diplomatic efforts"" gave ""reason for cautious optimism"". In a letter to MPs, Foreign Office Secretary Liz Truss said the government judged that an invasion was ""highly likely"" but she also warned ""this stalemate could continue for an extended period"". Conservative MP and former British army officer Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, warned against trusting Russian statements about the situation in Ukraine. Speaking to the BBC's World at One, he said: ""Let's not pretend we can believe anything that comes out of Moscow - they have lied and lied and lied."" Has Putin's war in Ukraine failed?

"Russia's defence ministry says some troops positioned on the border with Ukraine are returning to their bases after completing drills It raises hopes that tensions could ease but military exercises continue and it's unclear how many units are being withdrawn The head of the Nato defence alliance says he hasn't seen de-escalation yet but that signals from Moscow give some cause for optimism President Vladimir Putin tells a news conference that Russia does not want war in Europe UK PM Boris Johnson says there are ""mixed signals"" coming from Russia and that the intelligence on Ukraine ""is still not encouraging"" The EU says it is willing to discuss Russia's security concerns but warns a key Russian gas pipeline to Germany would ""not become operational"" in the event of war Edited by Hugo Bachega We'll be pausing our live coverage shortly so here's a summary of the main developments today:  Today's live page was edited by Hugo Bachega and Lauren Turner and written by Becky Morton, Jennifer Meierhans, Jeremy Gahagan, James Harness and Leo Sands.

way to judge whether Russia's troop withdrawal is real is to watch
what happens over the next few days in Belarus, where Moscow and Minsk are currently conducting joint military drills. Russia
moved thousands of troops to Belarus from Siberia and the Far East for the exercises. The units include fighter jets, air defence systems, and some of Russia's most experienced paratroopers and marines. Those joint drills are due to finish on 20 February. If Russia withdraws its troops after that, it could be a sign that Moscow is serious about reducing its military build-up around Ukraine's borders. Away from the politicking, we've got a Eurovision Song Contest development to bring you. Alina Pash, Ukraine's Eurovision singer, has been ""suspended"" from competing at May's competition in Turin. Ukraine's national broadcaster UA:PBC took the actionafter it was revealed that authorities are investigating a 2015 trip she made to Crimea, an area Russia seized control of in 2014. There are strict travel rules in place over how people enter Crimea. It's not illegal for Ukrainians to visit but it can be frowned upon. Alina has provided authorities with proof of how she entered the region but that's now being scrutinised. While investigations continue, Alina says some people claim she's un-Ukrainian. ""I'm a Ukrainian girl. I'm talking in Ukrainian and my song is about Ukraine,"" she explains. We've now got some details of the phone call held between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia's Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov. A statement from the foreign ministry in Moscow says Lavrov stressed the need for ""pragmatic dialogue over the entire range of issues raised by Russia"". He also told Blinken that ""aggressive rhetoric"" inflated by Washington was unacceptable. But said it was necessary to continue ""joint work"". Websites including the Ukrainian defence ministry and the banks PrivatBank and OshadBank have been subject to a cyber-attack, the Russia's Tass news agency reports. The Ukrainian cybersecurity centre has said Russia could be to blame for the attack, according to Tass. The website of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has also been affected, the Unian news agency reports. Ukrainian websites have been affected by cyber-attacks before with Russia denying any involvement. Helen CattBBC political correspondent UK MPs have been briefed by the Defence
Secretary Ben Wallace this afternoon on the current situation around Russia and
Ukraine. It's understood he repeated the government's
assessment that it was not convinced Russia was standing down despite reports
of troops moving away That's because he said there had been an
uptick in other activity such as stepping up the preparedness of field
hospitals. He apparently warned that, while Russia
could launch an invasion within hours, it wasn't beyond the realms of possibility
that the current situation continues for weeks or months. He's also said to have told them that he
believes that President Putin has still not decided whether to launch an
invasion or not. Wallace is also said to have confirmed that UK troops who were involved in
training in Ukraine are now back in the UK. The UK should ""not believe anything that's coming out of Moscow"", the chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee has said. Earlier today, Russia said some troops positioned on the border with Ukraine were returning to their bases. But Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: ""[Russia] have lied and lied and lied and, surprisingly, are continuing to lie."" Addressing whether Russia would invade Ukraine, he said:
""Only one person knows and he ain't speaking. And that's Vladimir
Putin. We're dealing with a one-man band here."" Tugendhat says Russia's foreign ministry is ""simply
the barking dog outside the house of a mafia don... It's just there to make a
noise"". Viktoriia ZhuhanBBC Ukrainian, Kyiv ""When I see Maxar [satellite] imagery prove the Russian troops' withdrawal, I will believe,"" says mother-of-three Alina Fediai-Zyrianska, from her home in a suburb of Kyiv. Her family were planning to launch a new business this month. But that has been put on hold because of their growing fears of war. Alina is critical of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, but her feelings about the news of Russia withdrawing echo the reaction from authorities there. Mykhailo Podoliak, from the president's office, tells the BBC that state bodies need to assess the scale of the withdrawal in order to confirm if the situation is ""getting back to normal"". Yesterday, Zelensky published yet another video to reassure the nation and call for unity. Such messages are welcomed by his supporters, but some are keen to stress that a grassroots resistance is being formed, regardless of any official statements. Alina says the president's address didn't lift her spirits. Instead, she keeps tracking website FlightRadar open - watching American drones and British planes fly over Ukraine's borders has a soothing effect, she says. This video can not be played We heard earlier from UK PM Boris Johnson, who said tough sanctions were ready to go if Russia invaded Ukraine. Now Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said there needs to be a ""very tough line on sanctions"" from the government after today's Cobra meeting. He says this is important so that Russia ""knows there will be serious consequences"" for any action it chooses to take against Ukraine and called on ""allies to stand together in the face of Russian aggression"". He says ""it's not entirely clear what's happening on the border"". More diplomatic talks to de-escalate tensions over Ukraine are under way between the US and Russia. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia's Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov are on the phone, according to the US state department. We're also hearing that US President Joe Biden will speak on the phone later with France's President Emmanuel Macron. Western military analysts say they need more information
to judge the significance of Russia's movement of some troops back from the Ukrainian border. Henry Boyd of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London tells Reuters news agency: One should maintain an air of cautious scepticism. There have been past discrepancies between Russia's official announcements and its actions on the ground.  Many of the Russian forces in Belarus for drills - due to end on Sunday - have come from thousands of miles away in Russia's central and eastern military districts. Rob Lee, a military analyst who specialises in Russia, tells Reuters the announcement was ""potentially good news"" but it was important to see where those forces went after the culmination of joint exercises between Russia and Belarus. As long as that remains nearby, Russia will have the capacity to conduct a significant escalation, though possibly not on as short notice.  Konrad Muzyka, director of the Poland-based Rochan consultancy, tells Reuters it would take several days to verify the latest moves via satellite imagery. It should also be noted that new trains with equipment from central Russia keep on arriving near the border and that Russian forces continue to move towards staging areas. The announcement stands in a direct opposition to what Russia has been doing for the past few days.  President Putin and German Chancellor Scholz held talks earlier today The news conference by Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has now finished so here's a summary of the main points: Orla GuerinBBC international correspondent, Mariupol If the shops are anything to go by, it's business as usual in the
port city of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine, even though the Russian border is
only 50km (31 miles) away. We found customers ambling through the well-stocked
aisles of one local supermarket. There was no panic buying and no
shortages. Tatiana, aged 74 - who was carefully perusing the sausage
selection - was adamant that fellow Slavs would not attack Ukraine. ""The
invasion is just in our heads,"" she told me. ""Nobody is going to invade.
Nobody will beat their brothers."" The tension may now be easing somewhat, but eastern Ukraine has already
been a battleground for the past eight years. Kremlin backed separatists are dug in
about 15km for Mariupol.  War is already part of the landscape. Some
here say - quietly - that they are now afraid of a much bigger conflict, but
there's no hint of an exodus. Close to the border we saw no sign of trouble on the horizon. The
only thing coming down the road from the Russian border were tractors, not
tanks. But Moscow's designs on Ukraine are a long-term project. People spend time at the coast of Mariupol in Ukraine despite the cold weather Putin is asked about the expansion of Nato. The Russian president says over the last 30 years we've been told there would be no expansion of Nato at all, yet today we see infrastructure ""right on our doorstep"". Putin queries when Ukraineâs Nato membership would be accepted. Ukraine hasn't even started an application process, and experts say the country is far from being in a position to do so. ""We need to resolve this question now, we need to resolve this question over the course of these negotiations,"" he says. ""We hope very much our concern will be heard by our partners and taken seriously."" Russia's core demand now is for the West to guaranteeUkraine will not join Nato, a defensive alliance of 30 countries. Asked about Nord Stream 2, Chancellor Scholz says Germany has made a commitment to ensuring gas transportation in Europe functions. He says Germany wants to make sure there will not be war over Ukraine as this would have ""far reaching consequences"". President Putin has accused Ukraine of committing acts of genocide against areas held by the Moscow-backed rebels in the eastern Donbas region. ""In our view what is now happening in Donbas is genocide,"" he tells the news conference. Putin has made similar accusations before in reference to the issue of discrimination against Russian speakers beyond its borders, many of whom live in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. In December he said that Russophobia was the first step towards genocide. His claims have been
dismissed as propaganda. A bit more from Scholz. He says he wants Vladimir Putin to send his negotiators with a âpositive mandate so we can achieve progressâ. The German chancellor adds âsecurity can only be achieved with Russia, not against Russia.â He says Nato and Europe are united in thinking that a solution must be found, no matter how difficult. We all need to be brave and responsible in our actions, he says. Scholz adds âwar has become unthinkable in Europe and we have to make sure it stays that wayâ.  President Putin is asked if he can exclude the possibility of war in Europe. He references Chancellor Scholz's earlier comments that his generation cannot imagine war in Europe - but points out the continent has seen war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s, which he claims was initiated by Nato. Putin says Russia does not want war and so has put forward proposals to start a negotiation process - but he says there has been no constructive response to Russia's proposals. However, he adds that there are still issues put forward by Nato and the US which could be discussed. We're hearing from German Chancellor Olaf Scholz too. He says the troop build-up on the Ukraine border is seen as a threat and is ""incomprehensible"". He demands ""de-escalation"" in the region and says it's important that ""no war will follow"". Scholz says territorial integrity is ""non-negotiable"" and it's his wish that there is dialogue. Talks must not come to a ""dead end"", he adds. President Putin says basic requirements have not been met by Nato and that it has an obligation not to strengthen its security at the expense of other countries. However, he says he is prepared to discuss the issues of European security and missiles. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Roads and gardens in Crickhowell, Powys, were turned into lakes, after the River Usk burst its banks Record-breaking flooding is becoming ""the new reality"" for communities, according to Natural Resources Wales (NRW). Two years after storms wreaked havoc across Wales, the environmental watchdog warned urgent action was needed to prepare for climate change. ""The need to act now to prepare for climate impacts is more pressing than ever,"" it said. Storms Chiara, Dennis and Jorgeled to record rainfall in February 2020. How are Wales' Storm Dennis flood victims coping? Floods and Covid 'left people traumatised' Storms 'a taste of things to come' for Wales Eleri Griffiths, Plaid Cymru councillor for the Rhondda ward in Rhondda Cynon Taf where 44 houses were flooded, said people had been traumatised by the impact of the storms, just before the pandemic hit Wales. ""Large parts of Rhondda Cynon Taf were completely unrecognisable... and of course the clean-up operation took months, into the period where we entered the Covid lockdowns,"" she said. ""So it was certainly a time of extreme trauma for many people."" Flooding in the 2020 storms destroyed people's homes Ms Griffiths toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfastpeople in her own ward who had been flooded were still ""none the wiser"" about any measures taken to make sure it would not happen again. ""Trehafod people are still waiting for answers. I spoke to one resident in Trehafod yesterday who was flooded and he described to me how him and his wife worry and have anxiety every time it's raining. ""The children are worried. They have conversations about whether should they move half of the furniture upstairs whenever there's any sort of flood alert. ""And he said 'Well we still haven't had answers, have we? What's changed? Nothing's changed'."" She added that public bodies needed to ""react a lot smarter and a lot quicker to the climate changing"". A family is rescued from flooding in Nantgarw ""We know that there's risks of this happening again, as Natural Resources Wales reported,"" she said. Storms Chiara, Dennis and Jorge resulted in record rainfall and river levels across Wales, and some of the most significant and devastating flooding seen since the 1970s with 3,130 properties affected across the country. NRW said these and subsequent storms experienced in Wales since, serve as ""a stark warning that record-breaking flooding is becoming a harsh new reality for Welsh communities in the future"". It warned that ""the need to act now to prepare for climate impacts is more pressing than ever"". This video can not be played Storm Jorge: A landslide, more rain and strong winds The news from NRW came asWales was braced for Storm Dudley and Storm Eunice,with winds of 70mph (113km/hr) expected to cause ""significant disruption"". Chief executive Clare Pillman said: ""Flooding is a deeply personal tragedy, and our thoughts continue to be with those still recovering and rebuilding. ""But as more and more communities affected by flooding each year count the cost of lost belongings, ruined homes and businesses, and as people live with lingering fears of future storms, we know that so much more needs to be done to prepare ourselves to face our future reality."" She added that COP26 and the 'code red' signals from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report gave"" renewed impetus for governments to tackling this pressing issue"". ""The central focus given to climate change in the Welsh government's programme for government, and the emphasis placed on mitigating future flood risk in the Co-operation Agreement between Labour and Plaid Cymru are all welcome strides forward. ""But while progress has certainly been made, the climate problem has also accelerated. Which is why our thinking and our actions to help mitigate and adapt to its impacts needs to go further and faster if we're to secure the improved flood-risk outcomes we need for the people of Wales."" This video can not be played Heavy rain caused ""multiple"" floods and landslides, according to South Wales Police NRW said it has continued to invest in flood defences and response teams, inspecting and repairing where needed, and carrying out maintenance work to increase resilience to future floods. ""Climate scientists have underlined that record floods are not anomalous, they are the beginning of a new normal, and the new records will continue to be exceeded, year after year,"" Ms Pillman added. ""That is why it's crucial that people trust in the data and the knowledge we share, to understand their flood risk and understand the actions they can take to lessen the impacts should the waters start to rise. ""While we welcome the additional funding NRW has received to increase our own capacity to prepare for and respond to these eventualities, we accept that we will never win the war against the forces of nature alone. ""But by working together, we have greater potential to mitigate against the impacts. Difficult decisions will need to be made, and it will take time, significant effort and a cultural and a behavioural shift to make the difference required.""

there's no hint of an exodus. Close to the border we saw no sign of trouble on the horizon. The
only thing coming down the road from the Russian border were tractors, not
tanks. But Moscow's designs on Ukraine are a long-term project. People spend time at the coast of Mariupol in Ukraine despite the cold weather Putin is asked about the expansion of Nato. The Russian president says over the last 30 years we've been told there would be no expansion of Nato at all, yet today we see infrastructure ""right on our doorstep"". Putin queries when Ukraineâs Nato membership would be accepted. Ukraine hasn't even started an application process, and experts say the country is far from being in a position to do so. ""We need to resolve this question now, we need to resolve this question over the course of these negotiations,"" he says. ""We hope very much our concern will be heard by our partners and taken seriously."" Russia's core demand now is for the West to guaranteeUkraine will not join Nato, a defensive alliance of 30 countries. Asked about Nord Stream 2, Chancellor Scholz says Germany has made a commitment to ensuring gas transportation in Europe functions. He says Germany wants to make sure there will not be war over Ukraine as this would have ""far reaching consequences"". President Putin has accused Ukraine of committing acts of genocide against areas held by the Moscow-backed rebels in the eastern Donbas region. ""In our view what is now happening in Donbas is genocide,"" he tells the news conference. Putin has made similar accusations before in reference to the issue of discrimination against Russian speakers beyond its borders, many of whom live in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. In December he said that Russophobia was the first step towards genocide. His claims have been
dismissed as propaganda. A bit more from Scholz. He says he wants Vladimir Putin to send his negotiators with a âpositive mandate so we can achieve progressâ. The German chancellor adds âsecurity can only be achieved with Russia, not against Russia.â He says Nato and Europe are united in thinking that a solution must be found, no matter how difficult. We all need to be brave and responsible in our actions, he says. Scholz adds âwar has become unthinkable in Europe and we have to make sure it stays that wayâ.  President Putin is asked if he can exclude the possibility of war in Europe. He references Chancellor Scholz's earlier comments that his generation cannot imagine war in Europe - but points out the continent has seen war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s, which he claims was initiated by Nato. Putin says Russia does not want war and so has put forward proposals to start a negotiation process - but he says there has been no constructive response to Russia's proposals. However, he adds that there are still issues put forward by Nato and the US which could be discussed. We're hearing from German Chancellor Olaf Scholz too. He says the troop build-up on the Ukraine border is seen as a threat and is ""incomprehensible"". He demands ""de-escalation"" in the region and says it's important that ""no war will follow"". Scholz says territorial integrity is ""non-negotiable"" and it's his wish that there is dialogue. Talks must not come to a ""dead end"", he adds. President Putin says basic requirements have not been met by Nato and that it has an obligation not to strengthen its security at the expense of other countries. However, he says he is prepared to discuss the issues of European security and missiles. Â© 2025 BBC.

way to judge whether Russia's troop withdrawal is real is to watch
what happens over the next few days in Belarus, where Moscow and Minsk are currently conducting joint military drills. Russia
moved thousands of troops to Belarus from Siberia and the Far East for the exercises. The units include fighter jets, air defence systems, and some of Russia's most experienced paratroopers and marines. Those joint drills are due to finish on 20 February. If Russia withdraws its troops after that, it could be a sign that Moscow is serious about reducing its military build-up around Ukraine's borders. Away from the politicking, we've got a Eurovision Song Contest development to bring you. Alina Pash, Ukraine's Eurovision singer, has been ""suspended"" from competing at May's competition in Turin. Ukraine's national broadcaster UA:PBC took the actionafter it was revealed that authorities are investigating a 2015 trip she made to Crimea, an area Russia seized control of in 2014. There are strict travel rules in place over how people enter Crimea. It's not illegal for Ukrainians to visit but it can be frowned upon. Alina has provided authorities with proof of how she entered the region but that's now being scrutinised. While investigations continue, Alina says some people claim she's un-Ukrainian. ""I'm a Ukrainian girl. I'm talking in Ukrainian and my song is about Ukraine,"" she explains. We've now got some details of the phone call held between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia's Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov. A statement from the foreign ministry in Moscow says Lavrov stressed the need for ""pragmatic dialogue over the entire range of issues raised by Russia"". He also told Blinken that ""aggressive rhetoric"" inflated by Washington was unacceptable. But said it was necessary to continue ""joint work"". Websites including the Ukrainian defence ministry and the banks PrivatBank and OshadBank have been subject to a cyber-attack, the Russia's Tass news agency reports. The Ukrainian cybersecurity centre has said Russia could be to blame for the attack, according to Tass. The website of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has also been affected, the Unian news agency reports. Ukrainian websites have been affected by cyber-attacks before with Russia denying any involvement. Helen CattBBC political correspondent UK MPs have been briefed by the Defence
Secretary Ben Wallace this afternoon on the current situation around Russia and
Ukraine. It's understood he repeated the government's
assessment that it was not convinced Russia was standing down despite reports
of troops moving away That's because he said there had been an
uptick in other activity such as stepping up the preparedness of field
hospitals. He apparently warned that, while Russia
could launch an invasion within hours, it wasn't beyond the realms of possibility
that the current situation continues for weeks or months. He's also said to have told them that he
believes that President Putin has still not decided whether to launch an
invasion or not. Wallace is also said to have confirmed that UK troops who were involved in
training in Ukraine are now back in the UK. The UK should ""not believe anything that's coming out of Moscow"", the chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee has said. Earlier today, Russia said some troops positioned on the border with Ukraine were returning to their bases. But Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: ""[Russia] have lied and lied and lied and, surprisingly, are continuing to lie."" Addressing whether Russia would invade Ukraine, he said:
""Only one person knows and he ain't speaking. And that's Vladimir
Putin. We're dealing with a one-man band here."" Tugendhat says Russia's foreign ministry is ""simply
the barking dog outside the house of a mafia don... It's just there to make a
noise"". Viktoriia ZhuhanBBC Ukrainian, Kyiv ""When I see Maxar [satellite] imagery prove the Russian troops' withdrawal, I will believe,"" says mother-of-three Alina Fediai-Zyrianska, from her home in a suburb of Kyiv. Her family were planning to launch a new business this month. But that has been put on hold because of their growing fears of war. Alina is critical of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, but her feelings about the news of Russia withdrawing echo the reaction from authorities there. Mykhailo Podoliak, from the president's office, tells the BBC that state bodies need to assess the scale of the withdrawal in order to confirm if the situation is ""getting back to normal"". Yesterday, Zelensky published yet another video to reassure the nation and call for unity. Such messages are welcomed by his supporters, but some are keen to stress that a grassroots resistance is being formed, regardless of any official statements. Alina says the president's address didn't lift her spirits. Instead, she keeps tracking website FlightRadar open - watching American drones and British planes fly over Ukraine's borders has a soothing effect, she says. This video can not be played We heard earlier from UK PM Boris Johnson, who said tough sanctions were ready to go if Russia invaded Ukraine. Now Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said there needs to be a ""very tough line on sanctions"" from the government after today's Cobra meeting. He says this is important so that Russia ""knows there will be serious consequences"" for any action it chooses to take against Ukraine and called on ""allies to stand together in the face of Russian aggression"". He says ""it's not entirely clear what's happening on the border"". More diplomatic talks to de-escalate tensions over Ukraine are under way between the US and Russia. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia's Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov are on the phone, according to the US state department. We're also hearing that US President Joe Biden will speak on the phone later with France's President Emmanuel Macron. Western military analysts say they need more information
to judge the significance of Russia's movement of some troops back from the Ukrainian border. Henry Boyd of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London tells Reuters news agency: One should maintain an air of cautious scepticism. There have been past discrepancies between Russia's official announcements and its actions on the ground.  Many of the Russian forces in Belarus for drills - due to end on Sunday - have come from thousands of miles away in Russia's central and eastern military districts. Rob Lee, a military analyst who specialises in Russia, tells Reuters the announcement was ""potentially good news"" but it was important to see where those forces went after the culmination of joint exercises between Russia and Belarus. As long as that remains nearby, Russia will have the capacity to conduct a significant escalation, though possibly not on as short notice.  Konrad Muzyka, director of the Poland-based Rochan consultancy, tells Reuters it would take several days to verify the latest moves via satellite imagery. It should also be noted that new trains with equipment from central Russia keep on arriving near the border and that Russian forces continue to move towards staging areas. The announcement stands in a direct opposition to what Russia has been doing for the past few days.  President Putin and German Chancellor Scholz held talks earlier today The news conference by Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has now finished so here's a summary of the main points: Orla GuerinBBC international correspondent, Mariupol If the shops are anything to go by, it's business as usual in the
port city of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine, even though the Russian border is
only 50km (31 miles) away. We found customers ambling through the well-stocked
aisles of one local supermarket. There was no panic buying and no
shortages. Tatiana, aged 74 - who was carefully perusing the sausage
selection - was adamant that fellow Slavs would not attack Ukraine. ""The
invasion is just in our heads,"" she told me. ""Nobody is going to invade.
Nobody will beat their brothers."" The tension may now be easing somewhat, but eastern Ukraine has already
been a battleground for the past eight years. Kremlin backed separatists are dug in
about 15km for Mariupol.  War is already part of the landscape. Some
here say - quietly - that they are now afraid of a much bigger conflict, but
there's no hint of an exodus. Close to the border we saw no sign of trouble on the horizon. The

"Prince Andrew, Virginia Roberts and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2001 Prince Andrew has settled a civil sexual assault case brought against him in the US by Virginia Giuffre. Ms Giuffre had been suing the Duke of York, claiming he sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17, allegations he has repeatedly denied. A letter filed to the US district court on Tuesday said the duke and Ms Giuffre had reached an out-of-court settlement. It said the duke - who makes no admission of liability - would pay an undisclosed sum to Ms Giuffre. In a letter to US judge Lewis A Kaplan, Ms Giuffre's lawyer David Boies wrote jointly with Prince Andrew's lawyers to say the pair had reached ""a settlement in principle"". A statement included with the letter read: ""The parties will file a stipulated dismissal upon Ms Giuffre's receipt of the settlement (the sum of which is not being disclosed)."" It said the duke would make a ""substantial donation to Ms Giuffre's charity in support of victims' rights"". Prince Andrew, the statement added, had ""never intended to malign Ms Giuffre's character"" and he recognised she had ""suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks"". The duke also pledged to ""demonstrate his regret for his association"" with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein by supporting the ""fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims"". He also commended the ""bravery of Ms Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others"". Prince Andrew's lawyers had previously said he was ready to go before a jury to fight Ms Giuffre's claims, with a trial expected later this year. Who are Virginia Giuffre's powerhouse lawyers? Who is Prince Andrew's Hollywood lawyer? His representatives said he had no comment beyond what was said in the document filed to the court. Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the settlement. Although the exact amount of the financial settlement has not been revealed, reports have speculated that it could run into millions of pounds. It has prompted questions about how the duke - who receives a Royal Navy pension and a stipend from the Queen'sDuchy of Lancaster income- will fund the settlement. Kate Macnab, a lawyer at Reeds Solicitors, says: ""It is likely there will be some demands to know where the payment is coming from - public or private purse?"" Graham Smith from the anti-monarchy group Republic said taxpayers deserved to know where the money for the settlement was coming from. Ms Giuffre, who was previously known as Virginia Roberts, claimed she was the victim of sex trafficking and abuse by financier Epstein from the age of 16. Epstein died in prison in 2019 while awaiting a sex trafficking trial. She said part of the abuse saw her lent out to powerful men, including Prince Andrew, who is the third child of the Queen and ninth in line to the throne. Ms Giuffre, now 38, claimed the duke, 61, sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17 at Ghislaine Maxwell's home in London, in Epstein's mansion in New York and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands. Once the trial was given the nod, it was always going to be uncomfortable, to say the least, for Prince Andrew - but this settlement is about as good as it gets for him, barring going to trial and winning. He avoids having to give a sworn statement, which was scheduled for early next month; he makes no admission of guilt; there will be no civil trial, no further airing of accusations and evidence. He is innocent, because he has not been found guilty of anything. So he is disentangled from any legal threat. But he is still badly damaged by the past few years; his friendship with a convicted paedophile and a convicted child trafficker will always hang over his reputation; the very fact that a civil trial beckoned will, rightly or wrongly, be held against him. There's nothing from the palace tonight about the settlement. Instead journalists were pointed toward the announcement in January that the Prince would lose his Royal titles and patronages. That fits with what sources have indicated for the past few years - that there is no way back for Prince Andrew. In a 2019 interview with BBC Newsnight, Prince Andrew said he had no memory of ever meeting Ms Giuffre and said her account of their London meeting and sex at a house in Belgravia ""didn't happen"". He also saidknowing Epstein had had ""some seriously beneficial outcomes"",at a time when he had left a career in the Navy and begun one as a trade and industry special representative. Ms Giuffre claims the late billionaire financier trafficked her to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17. In January, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New Yorkruled that the civil action over him could go ahead. Buckingham Palace later announced thatPrince Andrew's military titles and royal patronages had been returned to the Queenand that he would defend Ms Giuffre's civil case as a ""private citizen"". A royal source said he would also stop using the title His Royal Highness in an official capacity. Who is Prince Andrew and what titles is he losing? Who is Prince Andrew accuser Virginia Giuffre? Lisa Bloom, a lawyer representing several of Epstein's accusers, welcomed the duke's settlement as a ""victory"" for Ms Giuffre. In a statement on Twitter on behalf of her clients, she wrote: ""We hail Virginia's victory today. She has accomplished what no-one else could: getting Prince Andrew to stop his nonsense and side with sexual abuse victims. We salute Virginia's stunning courage."" The settlement is likely to come as a relief to the Royal Family, BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said, as it means the prospect of a trial will not disrupt the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations. He said the duke could have been under pressure from within his family to settle the case to avoid further public court hearings. This settlement may feel like it has come from nowhere, but it's been hard to find a lawyer who thought that Prince Andrew would fight this case all the way to jury trial. What is remarkable, however, is the wording. A settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing, but the prince does not repeat his oft-repeated insistence that he did nothing wrong. Earlier in the case, he had allowed his lawyers to accuse Ms Giuffre of initiating a ""baseless lawsuit... to achieve another payday at his expense"". She was accused of making so much money from her Epstein allegations that she had a ""compelling motive"" to launch a ""frivolous"" lawsuit against the prince. All that is gone, never to be repeated again: swept away in a 32-word sentence that accepts Virginia Giuffre has been a victim of abuse and her character cannot be questioned. The courtroom drama is over before it began. The court of public opinion will decide what the prince's words mean. In December last year, Maxwell, 60,was found guilty of recruiting and trafficking underage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. Last month,the former British socialite officially requested a retrialafter a juror in the case told the media he used his own experience of being sexually abused to influence jurors reaching a verdict. Virginia Giuffre and Prince Andrew have reached an out-of-court settlement. The parties will file a stipulated dismissal upon Ms Giuffre's receipt of the settlement (the sum of which is not being disclosed). Prince Andrew intends to make a substantial donation to Ms Giuffre's charity in support of victims' rights. Prince Andrew has never intended to malign Ms Giuffre's character, and he accepts that she has suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks. It is known that Jeffrey Epstein trafficked countless young girls over many years. Prince Andrew regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Ms Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others. He pledges to demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims.

"UK wage growth continued to lag behind the rising cost of living between October and December, figures show. Wages rose, but when taking inflation into account, pay showed a 0.8% fall from a year earlier,said the Office for National Statistics (ONS).,external Latest figures also show that the unemployment rate fell to 4.1% while job vacancies hit a fresh record high. There are signs that these pressures might feed through to faster wage growth in the coming months. According to the ONS, employees' regular pay, excluding bonuses, grew by 3.7% between October and December from a year earlier - which is high compared with rates seen over the last decade. However, the rising cost of food, energy and household goods has pushed inflation up by 5.4% in the 12 months to December. The ONS said real wages in the October to December period fell by 0.8% from a year earlier. The Bank of England has warned this squeeze on workers will get worse, with inflation set to rise above 7% this year. Why are prices rising so quickly? Fury after Bank boss says don't ask for big pay rise Interest rates rise again in bid to cool prices But the ONS said early estimates suggest employers are starting to push up wages further and faster in response. It said that for workers on payrolls in January, median monthly wages increased by 6.3% compared with the same month last year, and they were 10.3% higher than before the pandemic in February 2020. It added that wage rises for payrolled workers last month appeared to easily outpace inflation in some industries, such as science, finance and insurance, information and communication, and hotels. Employers are having to increase salaries as they face a continuing shortage of workers. Meanwhile the number of job vacancies between November and January hit another record of 1.3 million, the ONS said, with most industries finding it harder to recruit. ""The good news is that the UK economy is continuing to create jobs,"" said Matthew Percival, director for people and skills at the CBI. ""The bad news is that businesses are struggling to hire and pay is failing to keep up with inflation."" Lee Powell, chief executive of GMI Construction Group, which employs 200 people in Leeds, told the BBC that the combination of inflation and skills shortages was a ""headache at the moment"". ""In the construction industry we've seen unbelievably rapid inflation across materials... and we're in a situation now where the demands for wage increases are somewhat eye-watering. Construction firms have seen the costs of raw materials soar ""You'd automatically assume you could pass those prices straight on to the developer or to the end user but it's not as easy as that."" The governor of the Bank of England recently sparked controversywhen he urged workers not to ask for big pay rises, to help stop inflation from rising out of control. Andrew Bailey said that while it would be ""painful"" for workers to accept that prices would rise faster than their wages, he added that some ""moderation of wage rises"" was needed to prevent inflation becoming entrenched. The GMB union branded the idea a ""sick joke"" while the government distanced itself from the comments. Earlier this month,the Bank of England raised interest rates to 0.5%in an attempt to tame inflation. Paul Dales, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said the Bank was likely to take a more aggressive approach to rate increases this year and next given the economic picture. ""Employment has recouped the falls after the furlough scheme, the unemployment rate has fallen to pre-Covid levels, job vacancies are at a record high and wage growth is rising,"" he said. ""That's a recipe for more interest rate hikes, perhaps from 0.5% now to 1.25% this year and to 2% next year."" The latest estimates of wage increases for payrolled employees appear to confirm the Bank of England's fear that pay rises are taking off - one of the biggest reasons they've raised interest rates twice in a row. While they are early estimates and subject to revision, they suggest that pay in January was up by just over 10% compared with February 2020. That is the first time we've heard of double-digit pay rises, even over two years, in a very long time. Part of the reason is the tightest labour market we've had in living memory. Staff quit their jobs at record rates to take a better offer from another employer. Firms that want to keep people are having to pay more to retain them. This is hard to reconcile with the more reliable but less up-to-date quarterly figures, showing pay rises at 3.7%, lagging price inflation. But statistical confusion will work itself out over time. Meanwhile, these figures will do nothing to discourage the Bank of England from raising interest rates a third time the next time its interest rate setters meet.

"Covid-19 restrictions in Northern Ireland are no longer legally binding as of 17:00 GMT on Tuesday. The need for Covid certificates in nightclubs, face coverings, track and trace requirements and the cap on 30 people in private homes are no longer legal requirements. Health Minister Robin Swann saidthe remaining measures would instead be issued as guidance to the public. He warned Covid-19 had not gone away and remained a threat. Speaking earlier, Mr Swann said: ""It is vitally important that we continue to observe the sensible measures we have all learnt to protect ourselves and others."" This video can not be played The NI public has ""a role to play"" in protecting others, Prof Ian Young says Northern Ireland's chief scientific adviser Professor Ian Young said Northern Ireland had reached a key milestone in the pandemic but said it was ""not freedom day"". ""There is still a lot of Covid out there, we all need to do our bit to continue to protect the most vulnerable and wearing face coverings in appropriate settings is an important part of that,"" he said. ""I hope this is a day when people will move from feeling that their behaviours are covered by regulation to using exactly the same behaviours through choice in response to guidance."" Measures, which had previously been guidance rather than law, such as working from home where possible, have not been changed. Meanwhile, it has emerged that in Northern Ireland the need to self-isolate after testing positive for Covid-19 falls under ""very strong guidance"". However, in England, there is a legal requirement to self isolate. It took many journalists by surprise when we learned that self-isolating, following a positive test, falls under guidance rather than a legal requirement. During a press conference on Tuesday, Prof Ian Young answered many questions about what is meant by guidance as opposed to restrictions. I asked surely isolating is still mandatory? To all our surprise the answer was no - instead we were informed that has always come under ""very strong guidance"" except when it was required by law to isolate after taking an international flight. So why didn't we know? According to the Department of Health 'no one ever asked'. The restrictions had been due to expire on 24 March, when the legislation underpinning them expired. The health minister made an order on Tuesday, which revoked the restrictions. Mr Swann also said it was important to retain the ability to reintroduce restrictions again in case a new variant causes concern. He said he would seek to extend the powers granted to the Department of Health by the Coronavirus Act 2020 by six months. Robin Swann warned that the pandemic is still not over BBC News NI political editor Enda McClafferty said businesses remained frustrated that there has been no change to guidance on working from home. This was beyond Mr Swann's control and he has called for the guidance to be reviewed. If individual businesses wish they will still be able to ask people to wear face coverings and enforce measures such as social distancing. Some have said they intend to do so. Hospitality businesses are hoping that trade will return to normal Some hospitality business owners have hailed the easing of regulations as the ""beginning of the end"" of the pandemic and said that they hoped trade would now return to normal. A bar owner said this was a good day for the hospitality industry, but major challenges remained in rebuilding consumer confidence. Stephen Magorrian of the Horatio Group, said: ""We are conscious of the fact that the pandemic hasn't ended, so we still need to be cautious but it is good to see the start of the end. ""The rebuilding of confidence will be the main thing. We need to make sure that our customers still feel safe,"" he said. Aaron Chism, co-owner of Belfast city centre clothes shop Fuzz Vintage, said his hope was for brighter days ahead. He started the business in the middle of the pandemic in October 2020. ""Hopefully there's going to be more people knocking about Belfast and they'll feel more comfortable to go into shops and we'll get more customers,"" he said. ""It's been quiet with lockdowns and stuff and then having to be closed. We opened in the middle of things before a second lockdown - it was a harsh time to open a shop but hopefully it's going back to normal now."" Translink is to continue to encourage passengers to wear face coverings. Meanwhile, train and bus company, Translink, is to continue to encourage passengers to wear face coverings. ""To help keep everyone safe and in line with the latest guidance, we are encouraging our passengers to wear a face covering, if they can, in stations and on-board buses and trains,"" a spokesperson said. Dr Alan Stout sounded a positive note The British Medical Association (BMA) in Northern Ireland, which represents doctors, advised caution especially given that those most vulnerable in society will be worried about the decision. Dr Alan Stout, from the BMA, welcomed the lifting of remaining restrictions. ""I think we've got to look at what's in front of us and what we're dealing with,"" he said. ""The link with the infection and with hospitalisation, with intensive care admission and with death has definitely been weakened. So it puts us in a much more confident position that we can start this journey back to some sort of normality."" What are NI's Covid rules after new relaxations? Relief mixed with concern as Covid rules removed The full Northern Ireland Executive cannot meet becausePaul Givan resigned as first minister, forcing the resignation of Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill because of the joint nature of the office. But individual ministers are still in place and can make some decisions, as long as the issues are not deemed ""significant or controversial"". It is understood ministers from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Sinn FÃ©in, SDLP and Alliance all supported Mr Swann - who is a member of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) - in his bid to remove remaining restrictions.

"UK wage growth continued to lag behind the rising cost of living between October and December, figures show. Wages rose, but when taking inflation into account, pay showed a 0.8% fall from a year earlier,said the Office for National Statistics (ONS).,external Latest figures also show that the unemployment rate fell to 4.1% while job vacancies hit a fresh record high. There are signs that these pressures might feed through to faster wage growth in the coming months. According to the ONS, employees' regular pay, excluding bonuses, grew by 3.7% between October and December from a year earlier - which is high compared with rates seen over the last decade. However, the rising cost of food, energy and household goods has pushed inflation up by 5.4% in the 12 months to December. The ONS said real wages in the October to December period fell by 0.8% from a year earlier. The Bank of England has warned this squeeze on workers will get worse, with inflation set to rise above 7% this year. Why are prices rising so quickly? Fury after Bank boss says don't ask for big pay rise Interest rates rise again in bid to cool prices But the ONS said early estimates suggest employers are starting to push up wages further and faster in response. It said that for workers on payrolls in January, median monthly wages increased by 6.3% compared with the same month last year, and they were 10.3% higher than before the pandemic in February 2020. It added that wage rises for payrolled workers last month appeared to easily outpace inflation in some industries, such as science, finance and insurance, information and communication, and hotels. Employers are having to increase salaries as they face a continuing shortage of workers. Meanwhile the number of job vacancies between November and January hit another record of 1.3 million, the ONS said, with most industries finding it harder to recruit. ""The good news is that the UK economy is continuing to create jobs,"" said Matthew Percival, director for people and skills at the CBI. ""The bad news is that businesses are struggling to hire and pay is failing to keep up with inflation."" Lee Powell, chief executive of GMI Construction Group, which employs 200 people in Leeds, told the BBC that the combination of inflation and skills shortages was a ""headache at the moment"". ""In the construction industry we've seen unbelievably rapid inflation across materials... and we're in a situation now where the demands for wage increases are somewhat eye-watering. Construction firms have seen the costs of raw materials soar ""You'd automatically assume you could pass those prices straight on to the developer or to the end user but it's not as easy as that."" The governor of the Bank of England recently sparked controversywhen he urged workers not to ask for big pay rises, to help stop inflation from rising out of control. Andrew Bailey said that while it would be ""painful"" for workers to accept that prices would rise faster than their wages, he added that some ""moderation of wage rises"" was needed to prevent inflation becoming entrenched. The GMB union branded the idea a ""sick joke"" while the government distanced itself from the comments. Earlier this month,the Bank of England raised interest rates to 0.5%in an attempt to tame inflation. Paul Dales, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said the Bank was likely to take a more aggressive approach to rate increases this year and next given the economic picture. ""Employment has recouped the falls after the furlough scheme, the unemployment rate has fallen to pre-Covid levels, job vacancies are at a record high and wage growth is rising,"" he said. ""That's a recipe for more interest rate hikes, perhaps from 0.5% now to 1.25% this year and to 2% next year."" The latest estimates of wage increases for payrolled employees appear to confirm the Bank of England's fear that pay rises are taking off - one of the biggest reasons they've raised interest rates twice in a row. While they are early estimates and subject to revision, they suggest that pay in January was up by just over 10% compared with February 2020. That is the first time we've heard of double-digit pay rises, even over two years, in a very long time. Part of the reason is the tightest labour market we've had in living memory. Staff quit their jobs at record rates to take a better offer from another employer. Firms that want to keep people are having to pay more to retain them. This is hard to reconcile with the more reliable but less up-to-date quarterly figures, showing pay rises at 3.7%, lagging price inflation. But statistical confusion will work itself out over time. Meanwhile, these figures will do nothing to discourage the Bank of England from raising interest rates a third time the next time its interest rate setters meet.

"Star Hobson died in hospital on 22 September 2020 Social workers at a council criticised over the Star Hobson case were left struggling to cope as bosses failed to fill vacancies, a report has found. Commissioner Steve Walker launched a review of Bradford children's services following the toddler's murder in 2020. Hisrecently published findings,externalhighlighted a reliance on agency staff and a steep rise in caseloads. Mr Walker said improvements had been too slow, but praised council leaders' commitment to investing in the service. He commenced his report last September, a year after 16-month-old Star died followingmonths of ""neglect, cruelty and injury""by her mother and her partner. Relatives criticised the social services response to a number of referrals raising alarm over Star's treatment, with her great-grandmother saying she had warned Bradford Council it faced ""another Baby P"" if no action was taken. More stories from Yorkshire After Star's mother and her partner were jailed over her death,the authority was strippedof control over its children's services department, which will be run by a council-owned trust led by an independent board. The move was among recommendations made in Mr Walker's report, which was handed to Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi last month. Mr Walker found that the city's children's services - rated inadequate by Ofsted in 2018 - had faced ongoing struggles to recruit and retain social workers. When he began writing his report, he said, there were 124 vacancies filled by 173 members of agency staff. This, combined with a 38% increase in caseload since 2018, had affected the stability of the workforce, he said. Star Hobson's babysitter: My warnings were ignored Social workers abused over child murder cases The short life and death of a beloved toddler More also needed to be done to secure a permanent leadership team, he said, noting that the department's director and deputy director both resigned towards the end of last year. Both positions were still being filled by less senior members acting up, he said. While the positions remained unfilled it was ""unsettling for staff and impacts on the ability of children's services to build effective working relationships with partners"", Mr Walker said. Bradford children's services was rated inadequate by Ofsted in 2018 Mr Walker praised the commitment of the council's leadership and their willingness to prioritise requests for extra children's services funding. However, he said spending had outstripped the department's core budget, mainly due to the high use of agency staff and costs of care placements for children. Mr Walker said Bradford had some of the most disadvantaged communities in the country, which have been disproportionately affected by Covid-19, and child poverty rates were rising faster than the national trend. The authority has higher levels of childhood obesity, teenage pregnancy and accidental injury. Infant mortality rates in Bradford are also significantly higher than the comparative value for England, the report said. Mr Walker said improvement had been too slow, and recommended the council work alongside an Executive Commissioner, who would have increased powers to drive improvement. However, the council has told the Department for Education it would prefer to create a trust to run children's services on its behalf. Savannah Brockhill (left) was jailed for life for Star's murder and Frankie Smith was handed an eight-year term for causing or allowing her death Council leader Susan Hinchcliffe said Mr Walker's report highlighted many strengths such as ""the commitment of staff, extra resources, strong political and leadership support and strong safeguarding arrangements"". But it also highlighted challenges such as ""recruiting a stable workforce"", she said, and overcoming these to ""provide better outcomes for children and families and support our front-line staff"" was the authority's ""key focus"".

They are very fit and healthy individuals and decisions they have made have paid off in their career, so itâs easy for them to fall into this âbubbleâ that makes them believe they âknow better than modern medicineâ. But Busch wonders if Djokovic's single-mindedness ""might be part of his downfall over the next future years"". Having heard the views of experts, supporters and opponents of Novak Djokovic on our exclusive interview, we can now hear from the man himself. Writing on Twitter, Djokovic says he is grateful for the ""opportunity to answer questions"" from the BBC's Amol Rajan and to ""set the record straight"". He also thanks fans for their support and patience in the weeks since the controversy over his participation in the Australian Open began. Allow Twitter content?

As people have been reacting to Novak Djokovic interview today, many have been questioning his denial that he is an anti-vaxxer and his attempts to distance himself from that movement. People on social media have pointed out that, whatever the tennis star claims about his views on vaccines, he does publicly oppose Covid jabs and has engaged in spreading anti-vaccination messages.

Let's remember, more than 60% of the world's population - 4.8 billion people - have received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine. All of the approved Covid-19 vaccines have undergone rigorous testing - including large clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people - and continue to be closely monitored. Guy De Launey, BBC Balkans Correspondent Serbian tabloid Blic said Djokovic's comments 'shocked' Amol Rajan The
first interview by Novak Djokovic since his Australian misadventure is making
headlines in all main news outlets in his home country of Serbia. The
Blic tabloid makes much of BBC interviewer Amol Rajan asking the tennis player
âWhy, Novak, why?â as Djokovic insists that he would rather miss defending his
French Open and Wimbledon titles than have a vaccine against Covid-19. Blic
says this declaration âcompletely shocked the journalistâ. The
more upmarket Danas leads with the line that the worldâs top male player would
âsacrifice trophiesâ because of his beliefs. And the state broadcaster, RTS,
headlines with Djokovicâs assertion that âI am not anti-vaccineâ. Serbian
people are already well aware of their sporting iconâs strict approach to
nutrition and lifestyle. But their interest
may be piqued by the playerâs denial that there was anything amiss regarding
his Covid test certificates. Last
week, police arrested a dozen people, including doctors and nurses, for their
involvement in issuing counterfeit documents. Earlier this month, prosecutors
said they had investigated Djokovicâs coronavirus certificates and found no evidence
that they were manipulated. Russell FullerTennis correspondent Novak Djokovic says he âsincerely hopesâ
international Covid regulations will soon change, and certainly within Europe,
travelling is becoming easier for the unvaccinated. His
chances of playing in the French Open and at Wimbledon have improved in recent
days. Under current rules, the unvaccinated no longer need to isolate on
arrival in France if they have travelled from another EU country. Djokovic is
now resident in Spain. And
even though there are more stringent testing requirements for unvaccinated
arrivals in England, the need to quarantine has also been removed. But
the United States remains a serious problem for Djokovic. Vaccination
certificates are compulsory, and there are few exceptions. So
the world number one is likely to miss next monthâs prestigious tour events in
Indian Wells and Miami, and could face further problems in late summer. A
string of tournaments take place in the US in August in the run up to the US
Open, which is the final Grand Slam of the year. In his exclusive interview with the BBC, Novak Djokovic flatly denied reports that there had been efforts to tamper with his positive Covid test in December. His denial follows discrepancies revealed by the BBC that have cast doubt over the exact timing of his positive coronavirus test. Documents submitted to a federal court in Australia during the Serb's deportation hearings included two Covid (PCR) test certificates, one with a positive result on 16 December and one with a negative result on 22 December. But researchers have highlighted that the earlier test had a higher confirmation code than the later one, suggesting that the tests were out of sync. The findings raise questions as to whether Djokovic would have been granted his initial medical exemption. Serbian authorities have also denied that there were any issues with the 34-year-old's test and stated that the tests were authentic. Read more BBC's analysis here. Shaimaa KhalilBBC News, Melbourne Iâm outside Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne Park where Novak
Djokovic was hoping to defend his Australian Open title in January. He made headlines when he arrived in Australia and when he was deported - and
now in his comments about this whole saga, Novak Djokovic has addressed
the Australian people and acknowledged their frustration and anger. There was a great deal of that the moment he announced he was coming
with a vaccine exemption in January. Social media was alight with comments -
many argued that they had endured long and strict lockdowns and had been
required to get the vaccine in order to travel and reunite with their families. Djokovic said he wasnât given special treatment and that he followed
the rules. But Immigration Minister Alex Hawke based his decision to deport
Djokovic not on the rules but on whether his presence would incite anti-vax
sentiment. Djokovic has distanced himself from the anti-vax movement, despite
the protests against vaccine mandates at the time that essentially used him as
a symbol. In their interview, Djokovicwas asked by the BBC's Amol Rajanwhat he would say to anti-vaccination protesters who have adopted him as a figurehead. ""I say that everyone has the right to choose to act and say
whatever they feel is appropriate for them,"" he said. ""I have never said I am part of that
movement. No-one in the whole process, during Australian saga has asked me for
my stance or opinion on vaccination. No-one. ""So I could not really express what
I feel and what my stance is, neither in the legal process or outside, so it is
really unfortunate that there has been this misconception and wrong conclusion made
around the world based on something I completely disagree with."" As we've already reported today, some commentators have pointed out that he does have popular social media profiles, which he has used to share other information. Mike WendlingBBC Trending A Djokovic supporter displays an anti-vaccination mandate sign at a gathering outside his hotel in Melbourne in January Novak Djokovic says heâs not an anti-vaxxer and in the interview
distances himself from the anti-vaccine movement. He says itâs a âmisconceptionâ that he was ever on the side
of hardcore anti-vaxxers â even as they celebrated him as a hero. The tennis star frames his refusal of a Covid vaccination in
terms of personal choice. He wants ultimate control of what goes into his body. That is an argument routinely seen on the most active anti-vaccine
groups, particularly on the messaging app Telegram. But itâs just one of a
hodgepodge of points that regularly makes the rounds. Others - including far
more emotive false posts about sinister global plots and mass deaths - have less
to do with individual liberties and are based purely in pseudoscience. So perhaps itâs not surprising that, in the most conspiracy-addled
groups, so far there hasnât been a huge reaction to Djokovicâs interview. But perhaps the nuance in the world number oneâs
argument will have made him less of a hero to that part of the crowd. Of course, vaccination status is not just an issue for tennis - it is causing many top sports teams and athletes to alter their plans. The Premier League said earlier this month that 80% of its players had been double jabbed, but the minority that haven't are unable to travel to some overseas ties. European champions Chelsea have been facing being without some of their squad for next month's Champions League last-16 match tie away to Lillebecause of French government rules. Kyrie Irving, one of the stars of the NBA basketball league in the United States, has a similar problem, but with his team's home matches. Irving plays for the Brooklyn Nets and New York laws ban unvaccinated people in indoor venues. ""I stay rooted in my decision. It's not going to be swayed just because of one thing in this NBA life,""said Irving in January. Bayern Munich footballer Joshua Kimmich initially opted against vaccination, but, after contracting the virus and suffering some damage to his lungs, revised his opinion. ""Maybe I had to go through what I have now gone through first,""he told ZDF. ""Of course, looking back, I would like to make the vaccination decision earlier, but at the time it wasn't possible for me."" Allow Twitter content?

Daily Mirror associate editor and political commentator Kevin Maguire remains unconvinced by Novak Djokovic's stance. The only requirements to travel to England without being fully vaccinated are tests before and after arrival and a completion of a whereabouts form. French Open organisers said in January that there would be no exemption to allow unvaccinated players to compete. The All England Club, which stages Wimbledon, are yet to announce their own rules. The US tennis legendPam Shriverhas told the BBC that Novak Djokovic's continuing refusal to take a coronavirus vaccine is ""terrible for tennis"". The 22-time doubles Grand Slam doubles champion told 5 Live Breakfast that while it was good to hear Djokovic's rationale for his refusal to take the jab, and noted that we must be ""understanding"" of those who are reluctant to take the jab, she said the interview also raised several questions. âWill he really truly have an open mind to have a vaccine at
a later date?â, Shriver asked. âI hope that the right trusted person, who is an expert in
science and medicine, probably would have to be a Serbian, can sit him down and show him, and walk him through all of the steps that make the science
and the medicine trustworthy and safe to put in his body.â âBecause itâs terrible for tennis, not good for him â and,
really, he does lead. The fact that he doesnât trust it, it does lead a lot
of people, in his own country and throughout the world.â In the interview Djokovic says he should not be associated with the anti-vax movement, but instead supports an individual's right to choose to have a jab. While many support the tennis star's right to choose, medical experts stress the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people, and any vaccine will have to pass rigorous safety tests before being rolled out to the wider population. So what are the risks of having a Covid jab and how are vaccines approved for use?Read more here.  There is unlikely to be any bar on Novak Djokovic playing at Wimbledon according to Tim Henman, who is on the committee of the All England Club who organise the tournament. ""I donât think so,"" Henman told BBC Radio 4 when asked if he foresaw any issue with Djokovic playing at this year's Wimbledon in June. ""To get into the UK at the moment, those
are the guidelines the Championship will be following at this stage. ""At this moment in time it is going to be government-led."" Current rules require visitors to England to be tested before and after arrival and to complete a whereabouts form, but not to quarantine or be vaccinated. Djokovichas told the BBCthat he would skip Wimbledon if the tournament insisted all players must be vaccinated. Six-time Grand Slam semi-finalistTim Henmanhas been giving BBC Radio 4 his reaction toNovak Djokovic's interview. ""I do understand his concerns. I would reiterate it is
absolutely his prerogative to have the vaccine or not. As a former player and a
tennis fan, it was probably not what I wanted to hear in that interview, but probably
what I expected. As he freely admitted, he is going to
be severely restricted as to where he can travel to and therefore play without
being vaccinated. ""By taking himself out of the chance to compete in Grand Slams he is certainly jeopardizing his chances of being the greatest male player of
all time and I think that speaks volumes to his courage, conviction and belief
that this is what is best for him. ""You would have thought that very little is
going to sway his opinion."" This video can not be played Watch: Novak Djokovic's visa drama in 90 seconds For almost two weeks last month the world was gripped by the unfolding drama of Novak Djokovic's battle with Australian authorities. If you need a reminder, here is a quick refresher of how the saga played out:  Ralph Rogers, a sports medicine consultant who was in a Covid bubble with the NBA basketball league in
the United States, has been talking to BBC Radio 4 about Djokovic's stance on vaccination. ""If those are his convictions, then those are his
convictions,"" says Rogers. ""He has a choice and then, based on that choice, other people have
a choice not to allow him to play. So I think it is quite simple. ""As he said
point blank, he is not an anti-vaxxer. His mind is open, and he is looking for
a solution. So maybe his facts are incorrect, I think his facts are incorrect,
but I hope he comes to the right conclusion in the future. ""He is a
great competitor a great tennis player and we would like to see him play."" Novak Djokovicsays he remains open to the possibility of taking a Covid vaccination,if he can be convinced that it is the right choice for him. ""I keep my mind open, there is always the possibility that things will change in the future,"" he told the BBC's Amol Rajan. ""As of today, this is my decision and stance for it and I will suffer the consequences of not travelling to the tournaments, but hopefully things will be able to change in the future. We will see what happens."" Former Daily Telegraph chief sports writer Paul Hayward says he believes a Djokovic-less Wimbledon is a price most people would be willing to pay for effective anti-Covid restrictions.

"Liudmyla Bobova was displaced to Kharkiv by the war. ""I can breathe freely here,"" she said. About half an hour's drive from the centre of Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, in a low-rise industrial area of the city, there are rows of what look like white shipping containers set back from the main road and ringed by a blue metal fence. The rows of containers, blanketed by snow this time of year, are actually a village of temporary housing units for people who already fled the war in Ukraine once, back in 2014 when Russian-backed separatists seized much of the Donbas region by force. The residents of the ""module city"" live in remarkably cramped conditions - imagine a portable cabin you would see on a construction site, with low ceilings and strip lights, divided into a living room, kitchen and bathroom area and occupied by families of two or three or more. ""Yes, the accommodation is depressing,"" said Liudmyla Bobova, a resident who shares a private unit with her husband and elderly mother - a relative luxury compared with their previous unit where they occupied one small room in a communal unit, sleeping on bunk beds and sharing a kitchen and toilet. And yet Bobova and her family are grateful to be here, she said. ""There is occupation,"" she said, referring to the separatist territory they fled. ""Life there is grey, you cannot breathe freely. Here, I can breathe freely."" As for her change in living conditions, she only shrugged. ""That was one life, this is a another life,"" she said. In her previous life, Bobova lived in Molodohvardiisk, a small mining town a stone's throw from the Russian border, where there was little political activity and people were only absent-mindedly pro-Russian, she said. Her family fled the region along with thousands of others when the war began, escaping on foot and by train as shells fell ""like rumbling thunder"". Residents of Kharkiv's 'module city' live in dilapidated temporary units on the outskirts of the city. They ended up in the module city and have lived here since. The modules - paid for by the German government - had a maximum shelf life of three and a half years for human occupation, but seven years on about 175 people remain. ""There's nothing more constant than the temporary,"" said Artur Statsenko, who oversees the units for the local council. ""The state hasn't managed these people at all. For the past eight years we have not received anything from the state budget. We have a special Ministry for Reintegration but they have not given us a penny."" The BBC asked the Ministry for Reintegration - created in 2016 and tasked with caring for internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Donbas - to respond, but they declined to answer questions. For the IDPs, Russia's looming new threat to invade Ukraine brings the prospect of a double displacement. Their temporary homes, just 25 miles from the border, would be squarely in Russia's path. But an invasion appeared to be low down the list of concerns for the module city residents. ""We don't talk about the escalation, or the fact we might have to flee again,"" said Iryna Belinska, a 64-year-old grandmother of nine who lives in a unit with her unwell husband. ""We need a proper roof over our head, not a plastic little house,"" she said, gesturing to her broken ceiling and bowed floor. ""We have much more mundane things on our minds than war."" Iryna Belinska lives with her husband in a module. ""We don't talk about the escalation,"" she said. The war in eastern Ukraine has shifted the cultural identity of Kharkiv, a historically Russian-speaking city 300 miles from Kyiv but just 30 miles from the Russian border. Belinska spoke in Russian, but Bobova only speaks Ukrainian now. She abandoned Russian overnight in 2014 when she was was forced to flee her home - a kind of personal protest against the war. The separatists who seized Donbas attempted to seize Kharkiv too, and briefly they raised their flag on the regional government building in the city centre. The ousted Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych fled here in search of political support, but he was met by street protests and fled again to Crimea, and Kharkiv, Ukraine's second most-populous city, remained undisputed. ""Kharkiv was always pro-Ukrainian,"" said Boris Redin, an avuncular lifelong ""Kharkiver"" who has operated a kind of pro-Ukraine protest tent opposite the local government building since 2014. ""But it has become more pro-Ukrainian since the war started, like every city,"" he said. ""If the Russians want to attack us, they are our guests, we are not afraid."" Kharkiv would be a logical destination for the Russians if they rolled over the border nearby, but Vladimir Putin's troops could face a grinding resistance from the population. Many have enrolled in volunteer battalions and trained to fight, and two weeks ago the city's streets filled with protesters again, this time chanting ""Kharkiv is Ukraine"" and ""stop Russian aggression"". ""People have joined the territorial defence, volunteers continue to go the warzone, all this is working,"" said Svitlana Gorbunova-Ruban, the deputy mayor of Kharkiv. ""We are ready to defend our city in any situation and by all means."" Boris Redin has operated a kind of pro-Ukraine protest tent opposite the local government building since 2014 There is a lot here to defend - 38 universities, museums, a thriving tech sector and vibrant contemporary arts scene. The celebrated Ukrainian writer Oksana Zabuzhko just finished a three-week residency here. ""There was an explosion of art in Kharkiv when the war began,"" said Natalia Ivanova, director of the city's institute of contemporary art. ""It was art of resistance, protest, non-acceptance."" Displaced artists and opera singers from Donetsk and Luhansk were invited to join theatre companies and opera productions in Kharkiv, said Svitlana Oleshko, a local theatre director. ""They were welcomed in Kharkiv,"" she said. ""This is a city of young people and they are more and more pro-Ukrainian and less and less Russian. They can see life in Donetsk and Luhansk and Crimea and they don't want to live that way."" The war is felt here in a way it isn't in cities further west. Troops travel through Kharkiv on the way to the front and return to its hospitals wounded. Families have been estranged across a line that separates the city from the disputed territory, and the influx of people displaced from Donbas - somewhere between 120,000 and 350,000 - has brought its own divisions. How suicide became the hidden toll of the war in Ukraine There were ""undoubtedly cases of discrimination"" against the displaced when they arrived in Kharkiv, said Alla Feshchenko, the head of Station Kharkiv - a local non-governmental organisation. ""People refused to lease their apartments to them for example, because they were afraid they might turn out to be pro-Russian,"" she said. ""But other Kharkivers treated the IDPs wonderfully - they understood that we could have met the same fate, only we were luckier than Luhansk and Donetsk."" In the early days of the war, you would occasionally see cars driving around the city with fabric stretched across the roof or side bearing the world ""children"", Feshchenko said - a sign the car belonged to someone who had driven out of the disputed territory during the fighting. ""They didn't take the fabric off because they could not believe they were no longer under threat,"" she said. Washing hangs outside a the temporary units at the module city on the outskirts of Kharkiv. One thing was certain with regard to the displaced people who came to Kharkiv, Feshchenko said: the federal government had ""totally failed them"". ""The module city is the evilest evil,"" she said. ""People categorically should not be left in such a place. There was complete chaos there - fights, broken windows, showdowns, module vs module. It puts people on the bottom rung."" Gorbunova-Ruban, the deputy mayor, told the BBC the city had been sitting on finalised plans for four years for permanent housing on the site of the module city, after an agreement to split the costs 30% - 70% with the government, but the Ministry for Reintegration was yet to pay any of its part. This is the primary concern of the remaining residents of the module city - getting into proper accommodation. They would like to become real Kharkivers themselves. They hold occasional council meetings to discuss their concerns, and the minister for reintegration comes up more than the prospect of war. Liudmyla Bobova doesn't really miss Molodohvardiisk, she said. Some of her distant relatives are still there, and nothing they've told her makes her want to go back. ""Before the war, my life was full. But all I need here is my own home, and life will be full again,"" she said in Ukrainian. Daria Sipigina contributed to this report.

"Russia's defence ministry says some troops positioned on the border with Ukraine are returning to their bases after completing drills It raises hopes that tensions could ease but military exercises continue and it's unclear how many units are being withdrawn The head of the Nato defence alliance says he hasn't seen de-escalation yet but that signals from Moscow give some cause for optimism President Vladimir Putin tells a news conference that Russia does not want war in Europe UK PM Boris Johnson says there are ""mixed signals"" coming from Russia and that the intelligence on Ukraine ""is still not encouraging"" The EU says it is willing to discuss Russia's security concerns but warns a key Russian gas pipeline to Germany would ""not become operational"" in the event of war Edited by Hugo Bachega We'll be pausing our live coverage shortly so here's a summary of the main developments today:  Today's live page was edited by Hugo Bachega and Lauren Turner and written by Becky Morton, Jennifer Meierhans, Jeremy Gahagan, James Harness and Leo Sands. You can keep up to date with all the latest developmentsin our main story. Olga IvshinaBBC Russian Service One
way to judge whether Russia's troop withdrawal is real is to watch
what happens over the next few days in Belarus, where Moscow and Minsk are currently conducting joint military drills. Russia
moved thousands of troops to Belarus from Siberia and the Far East for the exercises. The units include fighter jets, air defence systems, and some of Russia's most experienced paratroopers and marines. Those joint drills are due to finish on 20 February. If Russia withdraws its troops after that, it could be a sign that Moscow is serious about reducing its military build-up around Ukraine's borders. Away from the politicking, we've got a Eurovision Song Contest development to bring you. Alina Pash, Ukraine's Eurovision singer, has been ""suspended"" from competing at May's competition in Turin. Ukraine's national broadcaster UA:PBC took the actionafter it was revealed that authorities are investigating a 2015 trip she made to Crimea, an area Russia seized control of in 2014. There are strict travel rules in place over how people enter Crimea. It's not illegal for Ukrainians to visit but it can be frowned upon. Alina has provided authorities with proof of how she entered the region but that's now being scrutinised. While investigations continue, Alina says some people claim she's un-Ukrainian. ""I'm a Ukrainian girl. I'm talking in Ukrainian and my song is about Ukraine,"" she explains. We've now got some details of the phone call held between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia's Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov. A statement from the foreign ministry in Moscow says Lavrov stressed the need for ""pragmatic dialogue over the entire range of issues raised by Russia"". He also told Blinken that ""aggressive rhetoric"" inflated by Washington was unacceptable. But said it was necessary to continue ""joint work"". Websites including the Ukrainian defence ministry and the banks PrivatBank and OshadBank have been subject to a cyber-attack, the Russia's Tass news agency reports. The Ukrainian cybersecurity centre has said Russia could be to blame for the attack, according to Tass. The website of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has also been affected, the Unian news agency reports. Ukrainian websites have been affected by cyber-attacks before with Russia denying any involvement. Helen CattBBC political correspondent UK MPs have been briefed by the Defence
Secretary Ben Wallace this afternoon on the current situation around Russia and
Ukraine. It's understood he repeated the government's
assessment that it was not convinced Russia was standing down despite reports
of troops moving away That's because he said there had been an
uptick in other activity such as stepping up the preparedness of field
hospitals. He apparently warned that, while Russia
could launch an invasion within hours, it wasn't beyond the realms of possibility
that the current situation continues for weeks or months. He's also said to have told them that he
believes that President Putin has still not decided whether to launch an
invasion or not. Wallace is also said to have confirmed that UK troops who were involved in
training in Ukraine are now back in the UK. The UK should ""not believe anything that's coming out of Moscow"", the chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee has said. Earlier today, Russia said some troops positioned on the border with Ukraine were returning to their bases. But Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: ""[Russia] have lied and lied and lied and, surprisingly, are continuing to lie."" Addressing whether Russia would invade Ukraine, he said:
""Only one person knows and he ain't speaking. And that's Vladimir
Putin. We're dealing with a one-man band here."" Tugendhat says Russia's foreign ministry is ""simply
the barking dog outside the house of a mafia don... It's just there to make a
noise"". Viktoriia ZhuhanBBC Ukrainian, Kyiv ""When I see Maxar [satellite] imagery prove the Russian troops' withdrawal, I will believe,"" says mother-of-three Alina Fediai-Zyrianska, from her home in a suburb of Kyiv. Her family were planning to launch a new business this month. But that has been put on hold because of their growing fears of war. Alina is critical of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, but her feelings about the news of Russia withdrawing echo the reaction from authorities there. Mykhailo Podoliak, from the president's office, tells the BBC that state bodies need to assess the scale of the withdrawal in order to confirm if the situation is ""getting back to normal"". Yesterday, Zelensky published yet another video to reassure the nation and call for unity. Such messages are welcomed by his supporters, but some are keen to stress that a grassroots resistance is being formed, regardless of any official statements. Alina says the president's address didn't lift her spirits. Instead, she keeps tracking website FlightRadar open - watching American drones and British planes fly over Ukraine's borders has a soothing effect, she says. This video can not be played We heard earlier from UK PM Boris Johnson, who said tough sanctions were ready to go if Russia invaded Ukraine. Now Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said there needs to be a ""very tough line on sanctions"" from the government after today's Cobra meeting. He says this is important so that Russia ""knows there will be serious consequences"" for any action it chooses to take against Ukraine and called on ""allies to stand together in the face of Russian aggression"". He says ""it's not entirely clear what's happening on the border"". More diplomatic talks to de-escalate tensions over Ukraine are under way between the US and Russia. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia's Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov are on the phone, according to the US state department. We're also hearing that US President Joe Biden will speak on the phone later with France's President Emmanuel Macron. Western military analysts say they need more information
to judge the significance of Russia's movement of some troops back from the Ukrainian border. Henry Boyd of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London tells Reuters news agency: One should maintain an air of cautious scepticism. There have been past discrepancies between Russia's official announcements and its actions on the ground.  Many of the Russian forces in Belarus for drills - due to end on Sunday - have come from thousands of miles away in Russia's central and eastern military districts. Rob Lee, a military analyst who specialises in Russia, tells Reuters the announcement was ""potentially good news"" but it was important to see where those forces went after the culmination of joint exercises between Russia and Belarus. As long as that remains nearby, Russia will have the capacity to conduct a significant escalation, though possibly not on as short notice.  Konrad Muzyka, director of the Poland-based Rochan consultancy, tells Reuters it would take several days to verify the latest moves via satellite imagery. It should also be noted that new trains with equipment from central Russia keep on arriving near the border and that Russian forces continue to move towards staging areas. The announcement stands in a direct opposition to what Russia has been doing for the past few days.  President Putin and German Chancellor Scholz held talks earlier today The news conference by Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has now finished so here's a summary of the main points: Orla GuerinBBC international correspondent, Mariupol If the shops are anything to go by, it's business as usual in the
port city of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine, even though the Russian border is
only 50km (31 miles) away. We found customers ambling through the well-stocked
aisles of one local supermarket. There was no panic buying and no
shortages. Tatiana, aged 74 - who was carefully perusing the sausage
selection - was adamant that fellow Slavs would not attack Ukraine. ""The
invasion is just in our heads,"" she told me. ""Nobody is going to invade.
Nobody will beat their brothers."" The tension may now be easing somewhat, but eastern Ukraine has already
been a battleground for the past eight years. Kremlin backed separatists are dug in
about 15km for Mariupol.  War is already part of the landscape. Some
here say - quietly - that they are now afraid of a much bigger conflict, but
there's no hint of an exodus. Close to the border we saw no sign of trouble on the horizon. The
only thing coming down the road from the Russian border were tractors, not
tanks. But Moscow's designs on Ukraine are a long-term project. People spend time at the coast of Mariupol in Ukraine despite the cold weather Putin is asked about the expansion of Nato. The Russian president says over the last 30 years we've been told there would be no expansion of Nato at all, yet today we see infrastructure ""right on our doorstep"". Putin queries when Ukraineâs Nato membership would be accepted. Ukraine hasn't even started an application process, and experts say the country is far from being in a position to do so. ""We need to resolve this question now, we need to resolve this question over the course of these negotiations,"" he says. ""We hope very much our concern will be heard by our partners and taken seriously."" Russia's core demand now is for the West to guaranteeUkraine will not join Nato, a defensive alliance of 30 countries. Asked about Nord Stream 2, Chancellor Scholz says Germany has made a commitment to ensuring gas transportation in Europe functions. He says Germany wants to make sure there will not be war over Ukraine as this would have ""far reaching consequences"". President Putin has accused Ukraine of committing acts of genocide against areas held by the Moscow-backed rebels in the eastern Donbas region. ""In our view what is now happening in Donbas is genocide,"" he tells the news conference. Putin has made similar accusations before in reference to the issue of discrimination against Russian speakers beyond its borders, many of whom live in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. In December he said that Russophobia was the first step towards genocide. His claims have been
dismissed as propaganda. A bit more from Scholz. He says he wants Vladimir Putin to send his negotiators with a âpositive mandate so we can achieve progressâ. The German chancellor adds âsecurity can only be achieved with Russia, not against Russia.â He says Nato and Europe are united in thinking that a solution must be found, no matter how difficult. We all need to be brave and responsible in our actions, he says. Scholz adds âwar has become unthinkable in Europe and we have to make sure it stays that wayâ.  President Putin is asked if he can exclude the possibility of war in Europe. He references Chancellor Scholz's earlier comments that his generation cannot imagine war in Europe - but points out the continent has seen war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s, which he claims was initiated by Nato. Putin says Russia does not want war and so has put forward proposals to start a negotiation process - but he says there has been no constructive response to Russia's proposals. However, he adds that there are still issues put forward by Nato and the US which could be discussed. We're hearing from German Chancellor Olaf Scholz too. He says the troop build-up on the Ukraine border is seen as a threat and is ""incomprehensible"". He demands ""de-escalation"" in the region and says it's important that ""no war will follow"". Scholz says territorial integrity is ""non-negotiable"" and it's his wish that there is dialogue. Talks must not come to a ""dead end"", he adds. President Putin says basic requirements have not been met by Nato and that it has an obligation not to strengthen its security at the expense of other countries. However, he says he is prepared to discuss the issues of European security and missiles. Â© 2025 BBC.

Let's remember, more than 60% of the world's population - 4.8 billion people - have received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine. All of the approved Covid-19 vaccines have undergone rigorous testing - including large clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people - and continue to be closely monitored. Guy De Launey, BBC Balkans Correspondent Serbian tabloid Blic said Djokovic's comments 'shocked' Amol Rajan The
first interview by Novak Djokovic since his Australian misadventure is making
headlines in all main news outlets in his home country of Serbia. The
Blic tabloid makes much of BBC interviewer Amol Rajan asking the tennis player
âWhy, Novak, why?â as Djokovic insists that he would rather miss defending his
French Open and Wimbledon titles than have a vaccine against Covid-19. Blic
says this declaration âcompletely shocked the journalistâ. The
more upmarket Danas leads with the line that the worldâs top male player would
âsacrifice trophiesâ because of his beliefs. And the state broadcaster, RTS,
headlines with Djokovicâs assertion that âI am not anti-vaccineâ. Serbian
people are already well aware of their sporting iconâs strict approach to
nutrition and lifestyle. But their interest
may be piqued by the playerâs denial that there was anything amiss regarding
his Covid test certificates. Last
week, police arrested a dozen people, including doctors and nurses, for their
involvement in issuing counterfeit documents. Earlier this month, prosecutors
said they had investigated Djokovicâs coronavirus certificates and found no evidence
that they were manipulated. Russell FullerTennis correspondent Novak Djokovic says he âsincerely hopesâ
international Covid regulations will soon change, and certainly within Europe,
travelling is becoming easier for the unvaccinated. His
chances of playing in the French Open and at Wimbledon have improved in recent
days. Under current rules, the unvaccinated no longer need to isolate on
arrival in France if they have travelled from another EU country. Djokovic is
now resident in Spain. And
even though there are more stringent testing requirements for unvaccinated
arrivals in England, the need to quarantine has also been removed. But
the United States remains a serious problem for Djokovic. Vaccination
certificates are compulsory, and there are few exceptions. So
the world number one is likely to miss next monthâs prestigious tour events in
Indian Wells and Miami, and could face further problems in late summer. A
string of tournaments take place in the US in August in the run up to the US
Open, which is the final Grand Slam of the year. In his exclusive interview with the BBC, Novak Djokovic flatly denied reports that there had been efforts to tamper with his positive Covid test in December. His denial follows discrepancies revealed by the BBC that have cast doubt over the exact timing of his positive coronavirus test. Documents submitted to a federal court in Australia during the Serb's deportation hearings included two Covid (PCR) test certificates, one with a positive result on 16 December and one with a negative result on 22 December. But researchers have highlighted that the earlier test had a higher confirmation code than the later one, suggesting that the tests were out of sync. The findings raise questions as to whether Djokovic would have been granted his initial medical exemption. Serbian authorities have also denied that there were any issues with the 34-year-old's test and stated that the tests were authentic. Read more BBC's analysis here. Shaimaa KhalilBBC News, Melbourne Iâm outside Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne Park where Novak
Djokovic was hoping to defend his Australian Open title in January. He made headlines when he arrived in Australia and when he was deported - and
now in his comments about this whole saga, Novak Djokovic has addressed
the Australian people and acknowledged their frustration and anger. There was a great deal of that the moment he announced he was coming
with a vaccine exemption in January. Social media was alight with comments -
many argued that they had endured long and strict lockdowns and had been
required to get the vaccine in order to travel and reunite with their families. Djokovic said he wasnât given special treatment and that he followed
the rules. But Immigration Minister Alex Hawke based his decision to deport
Djokovic not on the rules but on whether his presence would incite anti-vax
sentiment. Djokovic has distanced himself from the anti-vax movement, despite
the protests against vaccine mandates at the time that essentially used him as
a symbol. In their interview, Djokovicwas asked by the BBC's Amol Rajanwhat he would say to anti-vaccination protesters who have adopted him as a figurehead. ""I say that everyone has the right to choose to act and say
whatever they feel is appropriate for them,"" he said. ""I have never said I am part of that
movement. No-one in the whole process, during Australian saga has asked me for
my stance or opinion on vaccination. No-one. ""So I could not really express what
I feel and what my stance is, neither in the legal process or outside, so it is
really unfortunate that there has been this misconception and wrong conclusion made
around the world based on something I completely disagree with."" As we've already reported today, some commentators have pointed out that he does have popular social media profiles, which he has used to share other information. Mike WendlingBBC Trending A Djokovic supporter displays an anti-vaccination mandate sign at a gathering outside his hotel in Melbourne in January Novak Djokovic says heâs not an anti-vaxxer and in the interview
distances himself from the anti-vaccine movement. He says itâs a âmisconceptionâ that he was ever on the side
of hardcore anti-vaxxers â even as they celebrated him as a hero. The tennis star frames his refusal of a Covid vaccination in
terms of personal choice. He wants ultimate control of what goes into his body. That is an argument routinely seen on the most active anti-vaccine
groups, particularly on the messaging app Telegram. But itâs just one of a
hodgepodge of points that regularly makes the rounds. Others - including far
more emotive false posts about sinister global plots and mass deaths - have less
to do with individual liberties and are based purely in pseudoscience. So perhaps itâs not surprising that, in the most conspiracy-addled
groups, so far there hasnât been a huge reaction to Djokovicâs interview. But perhaps the nuance in the world number oneâs
argument will have made him less of a hero to that part of the crowd. Of course, vaccination status is not just an issue for tennis - it is causing many top sports teams and athletes to alter their plans. The Premier League said earlier this month that 80% of its players had been double jabbed, but the minority that haven't are unable to travel to some overseas ties. European champions Chelsea have been facing being without some of their squad for next month's Champions League last-16 match tie away to Lillebecause of French government rules. Kyrie Irving, one of the stars of the NBA basketball league in the United States, has a similar problem, but with his team's home matches. Irving plays for the Brooklyn Nets and New York laws ban unvaccinated people in indoor venues. ""I stay rooted in my decision. It's not going to be swayed just because of one thing in this NBA life,""said Irving in January. Bayern Munich footballer Joshua Kimmich initially opted against vaccination, but, after contracting the virus and suffering some damage to his lungs, revised his opinion. ""Maybe I had to go through what I have now gone through first,""he told ZDF. ""Of course, looking back, I would like to make the vaccination decision earlier, but at the time it wasn't possible for me."" Allow Twitter content?

Daily Mirror associate editor and political commentator Kevin Maguire remains unconvinced by Novak Djokovic's stance. The only requirements to travel to England without being fully vaccinated are tests before and after arrival and a completion of a whereabouts form. French Open organisers said in January that there would be no exemption to allow unvaccinated players to compete. The All England Club, which stages Wimbledon, are yet to announce their own rules. The US tennis legendPam Shriverhas told the BBC that Novak Djokovic's continuing refusal to take a coronavirus vaccine is ""terrible for tennis"". The 22-time doubles Grand Slam doubles champion told 5 Live Breakfast that while it was good to hear Djokovic's rationale for his refusal to take the jab, and noted that we must be ""understanding"" of those who are reluctant to take the jab, she said the interview also raised several questions. âWill he really truly have an open mind to have a vaccine at
a later date?â, Shriver asked. âI hope that the right trusted person, who is an expert in
science and medicine, probably would have to be a Serbian, can sit him down and show him, and walk him through all of the steps that make the science
and the medicine trustworthy and safe to put in his body.â âBecause itâs terrible for tennis, not good for him â and,
really, he does lead. The fact that he doesnât trust it, it does lead a lot
of people, in his own country and throughout the world.â In the interview Djokovic says he should not be associated with the anti-vax movement, but instead supports an individual's right to choose to have a jab. While many support the tennis star's right to choose, medical experts stress the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people, and any vaccine will have to pass rigorous safety tests before being rolled out to the wider population. So what are the risks of having a Covid jab and how are vaccines approved for use?Read more here.  There is unlikely to be any bar on Novak Djokovic playing at Wimbledon according to Tim Henman, who is on the committee of the All England Club who organise the tournament. ""I donât think so,"" Henman told BBC Radio 4 when asked if he foresaw any issue with Djokovic playing at this year's Wimbledon in June. ""To get into the UK at the moment, those
are the guidelines the Championship will be following at this stage. ""At this moment in time it is going to be government-led."" Current rules require visitors to England to be tested before and after arrival and to complete a whereabouts form, but not to quarantine or be vaccinated. Djokovichas told the BBCthat he would skip Wimbledon if the tournament insisted all players must be vaccinated. Six-time Grand Slam semi-finalistTim Henmanhas been giving BBC Radio 4 his reaction toNovak Djokovic's interview. ""I do understand his concerns. I would reiterate it is
absolutely his prerogative to have the vaccine or not. As a former player and a
tennis fan, it was probably not what I wanted to hear in that interview, but probably
what I expected. As he freely admitted, he is going to
be severely restricted as to where he can travel to and therefore play without
being vaccinated. ""By taking himself out of the chance to compete in Grand Slams he is certainly jeopardizing his chances of being the greatest male player of
all time and I think that speaks volumes to his courage, conviction and belief
that this is what is best for him. ""You would have thought that very little is
going to sway his opinion."" This video can not be played Watch: Novak Djokovic's visa drama in 90 seconds For almost two weeks last month the world was gripped by the unfolding drama of Novak Djokovic's battle with Australian authorities. If you need a reminder, here is a quick refresher of how the saga played out:  Ralph Rogers, a sports medicine consultant who was in a Covid bubble with the NBA basketball league in
the United States, has been talking to BBC Radio 4 about Djokovic's stance on vaccination. ""If those are his convictions, then those are his
convictions,"" says Rogers. ""He has a choice and then, based on that choice, other people have
a choice not to allow him to play. So I think it is quite simple. ""As he said
point blank, he is not an anti-vaxxer. His mind is open, and he is looking for
a solution. So maybe his facts are incorrect, I think his facts are incorrect,
but I hope he comes to the right conclusion in the future. ""He is a
great competitor a great tennis player and we would like to see him play."" Novak Djokovicsays he remains open to the possibility of taking a Covid vaccination,if he can be convinced that it is the right choice for him. ""I keep my mind open, there is always the possibility that things will change in the future,"" he told the BBC's Amol Rajan. ""As of today, this is my decision and stance for it and I will suffer the consequences of not travelling to the tournaments, but hopefully things will be able to change in the future. We will see what happens."" Former Daily Telegraph chief sports writer Paul Hayward says he believes a Djokovic-less Wimbledon is a price most people would be willing to pay for effective anti-Covid restrictions.

"Donald Trump's accounting firm says a decade of financial statements should not be relied upon Donald Trump's accounting firm has cut ties with the former president and said a decade of financial reports should ""no longer be relied upon"". The firm, Mazars, said in a letter to the Trump Organization that it could not stand behind statements it had prepared for Mr Trump from 2011-20. But Mazars said it had not concluded they contained material discrepancies. The letter was revealed in a court filing as part of a fraud investigation into the Trump Organization. In the filing, New York Attorney General Letitia James repeated her request that the former president and his daughter, Ivanka, give evidence under oath. Her office has already questioned Mr Trump's son, Eric Trump. Ms James last month said her civil inquiry into the Trump family firm had uncovered what she claimed was ""significant evidence"" of misleading business practices, including over-valuing certain assets. In its letter, Mazars wrote that the findings of Ms James' investigation had contributed to the conclusion that the statements should no longer be relied upon. The firm also said it performed its work in ""accordance with professional standards"", and compiled the reports based on information provided by the Trump Organization. ""While we have not concluded that the various financial statements, as a whole, contain material discrepancies, based upon the totality of the circumstances, we believe our advice to you to no longer rely upon those financial statements is appropriate,"" the letter said. It added that the firm would no longer be working with the Trump Organization. The financial documents are at the heart of the New York attorney general's civil investigation and a second, criminal inquiry by the Manhattan District Attorney's office. Trumpâs taxes: Why they matter to a criminal probe Trump blasts NY criminal inquiry as 'witch hunt' In January Ms James, a Democrat, accused the Trump Organization of using ""fraudulent or misleading asset valuations"" to get loans, insurance and tax breaks. Mr Trump's lawyers are trying to stop Ms James from questioning the former US president and his children, and he hassued her to try to halt the probe. A spokesperson for the Trump Organization said the letter from Mazars renders the investigations moot, because it suggests that the financial statements do not contain material discrepancies, according to CBS News. Mr Trump, a Republican, has previously said both inquiries are politically motivated and has referred to Ms James' investigation as a ""hoax"".

"Diplomatic efforts continue to try to halt a possible Russian invasion, but Moscow denies it is planning to attack The US and UK leaders have said not all hope is lost for a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine crisis but warned the situation remained fragile. In a 40-minute call, Joe Biden and Boris Johnson agreed a deal was still possible despite a chorus of warnings of imminent Russian military action. Russia has always denied plans to invade Ukraine, despite massing more than 100,000 troops on the border. On Monday its foreign minister said diplomacy was ""far from exhausted"". As part of diplomatic efforts to ward off a possible invasion, Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz is to meet Russia's President Vladimir Putin later on Tuesday. After being criticised for a slow initial response, Mr Scholz met the Ukrainian president in Kyiv on Monday, saying there was ""no reasonable justification"" for the Russian military build-up. EXPLAINER:Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? ANALYSIS:Five ways out of conflict ON THE GROUND:A Ukrainian city unifies against Russia's threats More than a dozen nations have urged their citizens to leave Ukraine, and the US has said aerial bombardments could begin ""at any time"". But in their conversation, Mr Biden and Mr Johnson said there remained a ""crucial window"" for diplomacy and for Russia to step back from its threats towards Ukraine, according to a Downing Street statement. ""The leaders emphasised that any further incursion into Ukraine would result in a protracted crisis for Russia, with far-reaching damage for both Russia and the world,"" the statement added. Mr Johnson reportedly said that the UK was prepared to do everything it could to help, to which Mr Biden responded: ""We're not going anywhere without you pal."" Mr Johnson is expected to hold a Cobra meeting on Tuesday to discuss the UK's response to the pressures.

""We have something to respond with. We have a great army... this is an army many times stronger than eight years ago."" But he said he wanted to resolve all issues through negotiations and diplomacy. The Ukrainian president ended his speech on an optimistic note: ""Now you may think it's darkness all around. But tomorrow the sun will rise again over our peaceful sky.""

Russia has granted citizenship to more than 700,000 people in Donbas And asked whether there was a chance for agreement with the West, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the ""possibilities are far from being exhausted, they certainly should not continue indefinitely, but I would suggest continuing and ramping them up"". Mr Lavrov's comments, made in a meeting with Mr Putin, are being seen as a clear concession that talks could ease the tensions. But analysts say that without either side moving over the thorny issue of Ukraine potentially joining Nato, there is still deadlock. The Kremlin says it cannot accept that Ukraine - a former Soviet republic with deep social and cultural ties with Russia - could one day join Nato, and has demanded that this be ruled out.

Let's remember, more than 60% of the world's population - 4.8 billion people - have received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine. All of the approved Covid-19 vaccines have undergone rigorous testing - including large clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people - and continue to be closely monitored. Guy De Launey, BBC Balkans Correspondent Serbian tabloid Blic said Djokovic's comments 'shocked' Amol Rajan The
first interview by Novak Djokovic since his Australian misadventure is making
headlines in all main news outlets in his home country of Serbia. The
Blic tabloid makes much of BBC interviewer Amol Rajan asking the tennis player
âWhy, Novak, why?â as Djokovic insists that he would rather miss defending his
French Open and Wimbledon titles than have a vaccine against Covid-19. Blic
says this declaration âcompletely shocked the journalistâ. The
more upmarket Danas leads with the line that the worldâs top male player would
âsacrifice trophiesâ because of his beliefs. And the state broadcaster, RTS,
headlines with Djokovicâs assertion that âI am not anti-vaccineâ. Serbian
people are already well aware of their sporting iconâs strict approach to
nutrition and lifestyle. But their interest
may be piqued by the playerâs denial that there was anything amiss regarding
his Covid test certificates. Last
week, police arrested a dozen people, including doctors and nurses, for their
involvement in issuing counterfeit documents. Earlier this month, prosecutors
said they had investigated Djokovicâs coronavirus certificates and found no evidence
that they were manipulated. Russell FullerTennis correspondent Novak Djokovic says he âsincerely hopesâ
international Covid regulations will soon change, and certainly within Europe,
travelling is becoming easier for the unvaccinated. His
chances of playing in the French Open and at Wimbledon have improved in recent
days. Under current rules, the unvaccinated no longer need to isolate on
arrival in France if they have travelled from another EU country. Djokovic is
now resident in Spain. And
even though there are more stringent testing requirements for unvaccinated
arrivals in England, the need to quarantine has also been removed. But
the United States remains a serious problem for Djokovic. Vaccination
certificates are compulsory, and there are few exceptions. So
the world number one is likely to miss next monthâs prestigious tour events in
Indian Wells and Miami, and could face further problems in late summer. A
string of tournaments take place in the US in August in the run up to the US
Open, which is the final Grand Slam of the year. In his exclusive interview with the BBC, Novak Djokovic flatly denied reports that there had been efforts to tamper with his positive Covid test in December. His denial follows discrepancies revealed by the BBC that have cast doubt over the exact timing of his positive coronavirus test. Documents submitted to a federal court in Australia during the Serb's deportation hearings included two Covid (PCR) test certificates, one with a positive result on 16 December and one with a negative result on 22 December. But researchers have highlighted that the earlier test had a higher confirmation code than the later one, suggesting that the tests were out of sync. The findings raise questions as to whether Djokovic would have been granted his initial medical exemption. Serbian authorities have also denied that there were any issues with the 34-year-old's test and stated that the tests were authentic. Read more BBC's analysis here. Shaimaa KhalilBBC News, Melbourne Iâm outside Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne Park where Novak
Djokovic was hoping to defend his Australian Open title in January. He made headlines when he arrived in Australia and when he was deported - and
now in his comments about this whole saga, Novak Djokovic has addressed
the Australian people and acknowledged their frustration and anger. There was a great deal of that the moment he announced he was coming
with a vaccine exemption in January. Social media was alight with comments -
many argued that they had endured long and strict lockdowns and had been
required to get the vaccine in order to travel and reunite with their families. Djokovic said he wasnât given special treatment and that he followed
the rules. But Immigration Minister Alex Hawke based his decision to deport
Djokovic not on the rules but on whether his presence would incite anti-vax
sentiment. Djokovic has distanced himself from the anti-vax movement, despite
the protests against vaccine mandates at the time that essentially used him as
a symbol. In their interview, Djokovicwas asked by the BBC's Amol Rajanwhat he would say to anti-vaccination protesters who have adopted him as a figurehead. ""I say that everyone has the right to choose to act and say
whatever they feel is appropriate for them,"" he said. ""I have never said I am part of that
movement. No-one in the whole process, during Australian saga has asked me for
my stance or opinion on vaccination. No-one. ""So I could not really express what
I feel and what my stance is, neither in the legal process or outside, so it is
really unfortunate that there has been this misconception and wrong conclusion made
around the world based on something I completely disagree with."" As we've already reported today, some commentators have pointed out that he does have popular social media profiles, which he has used to share other information. Mike WendlingBBC Trending A Djokovic supporter displays an anti-vaccination mandate sign at a gathering outside his hotel in Melbourne in January Novak Djokovic says heâs not an anti-vaxxer and in the interview
distances himself from the anti-vaccine movement. He says itâs a âmisconceptionâ that he was ever on the side
of hardcore anti-vaxxers â even as they celebrated him as a hero. The tennis star frames his refusal of a Covid vaccination in
terms of personal choice. He wants ultimate control of what goes into his body. That is an argument routinely seen on the most active anti-vaccine
groups, particularly on the messaging app Telegram. But itâs just one of a
hodgepodge of points that regularly makes the rounds. Others - including far
more emotive false posts about sinister global plots and mass deaths - have less
to do with individual liberties and are based purely in pseudoscience. So perhaps itâs not surprising that, in the most conspiracy-addled
groups, so far there hasnât been a huge reaction to Djokovicâs interview. But perhaps the nuance in the world number oneâs
argument will have made him less of a hero to that part of the crowd. Of course, vaccination status is not just an issue for tennis - it is causing many top sports teams and athletes to alter their plans. The Premier League said earlier this month that 80% of its players had been double jabbed, but the minority that haven't are unable to travel to some overseas ties. European champions Chelsea have been facing being without some of their squad for next month's Champions League last-16 match tie away to Lillebecause of French government rules. Kyrie Irving, one of the stars of the NBA basketball league in the United States, has a similar problem, but with his team's home matches. Irving plays for the Brooklyn Nets and New York laws ban unvaccinated people in indoor venues. ""I stay rooted in my decision. It's not going to be swayed just because of one thing in this NBA life,""said Irving in January. Bayern Munich footballer Joshua Kimmich initially opted against vaccination, but, after contracting the virus and suffering some damage to his lungs, revised his opinion. ""Maybe I had to go through what I have now gone through first,""he told ZDF. ""Of course, looking back, I would like to make the vaccination decision earlier, but at the time it wasn't possible for me."" Allow Twitter content?

Daily Mirror associate editor and political commentator Kevin Maguire remains unconvinced by Novak Djokovic's stance. The only requirements to travel to England without being fully vaccinated are tests before and after arrival and a completion of a whereabouts form. French Open organisers said in January that there would be no exemption to allow unvaccinated players to compete. The All England Club, which stages Wimbledon, are yet to announce their own rules. The US tennis legendPam Shriverhas told the BBC that Novak Djokovic's continuing refusal to take a coronavirus vaccine is ""terrible for tennis"". The 22-time doubles Grand Slam doubles champion told 5 Live Breakfast that while it was good to hear Djokovic's rationale for his refusal to take the jab, and noted that we must be ""understanding"" of those who are reluctant to take the jab, she said the interview also raised several questions. âWill he really truly have an open mind to have a vaccine at
a later date?â, Shriver asked. âI hope that the right trusted person, who is an expert in
science and medicine, probably would have to be a Serbian, can sit him down and show him, and walk him through all of the steps that make the science
and the medicine trustworthy and safe to put in his body.â âBecause itâs terrible for tennis, not good for him â and,
really, he does lead. The fact that he doesnât trust it, it does lead a lot
of people, in his own country and throughout the world.â In the interview Djokovic says he should not be associated with the anti-vax movement, but instead supports an individual's right to choose to have a jab. While many support the tennis star's right to choose, medical experts stress the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people, and any vaccine will have to pass rigorous safety tests before being rolled out to the wider population. So what are the risks of having a Covid jab and how are vaccines approved for use?Read more here.  There is unlikely to be any bar on Novak Djokovic playing at Wimbledon according to Tim Henman, who is on the committee of the All England Club who organise the tournament. ""I donât think so,"" Henman told BBC Radio 4 when asked if he foresaw any issue with Djokovic playing at this year's Wimbledon in June. ""To get into the UK at the moment, those
are the guidelines the Championship will be following at this stage. ""At this moment in time it is going to be government-led."" Current rules require visitors to England to be tested before and after arrival and to complete a whereabouts form, but not to quarantine or be vaccinated. Djokovichas told the BBCthat he would skip Wimbledon if the tournament insisted all players must be vaccinated. Six-time Grand Slam semi-finalistTim Henmanhas been giving BBC Radio 4 his reaction toNovak Djokovic's interview. ""I do understand his concerns. I would reiterate it is
absolutely his prerogative to have the vaccine or not. As a former player and a
tennis fan, it was probably not what I wanted to hear in that interview, but probably
what I expected. As he freely admitted, he is going to
be severely restricted as to where he can travel to and therefore play without
being vaccinated. ""By taking himself out of the chance to compete in Grand Slams he is certainly jeopardizing his chances of being the greatest male player of
all time and I think that speaks volumes to his courage, conviction and belief
that this is what is best for him. ""You would have thought that very little is
going to sway his opinion."" This video can not be played Watch: Novak Djokovic's visa drama in 90 seconds For almost two weeks last month the world was gripped by the unfolding drama of Novak Djokovic's battle with Australian authorities. If you need a reminder, here is a quick refresher of how the saga played out:  Ralph Rogers, a sports medicine consultant who was in a Covid bubble with the NBA basketball league in
the United States, has been talking to BBC Radio 4 about Djokovic's stance on vaccination. ""If those are his convictions, then those are his
convictions,"" says Rogers. ""He has a choice and then, based on that choice, other people have
a choice not to allow him to play. So I think it is quite simple. ""As he said
point blank, he is not an anti-vaxxer. His mind is open, and he is looking for
a solution. So maybe his facts are incorrect, I think his facts are incorrect,
but I hope he comes to the right conclusion in the future. ""He is a
great competitor a great tennis player and we would like to see him play."" Novak Djokovicsays he remains open to the possibility of taking a Covid vaccination,if he can be convinced that it is the right choice for him. ""I keep my mind open, there is always the possibility that things will change in the future,"" he told the BBC's Amol Rajan. ""As of today, this is my decision and stance for it and I will suffer the consequences of not travelling to the tournaments, but hopefully things will be able to change in the future. We will see what happens."" Former Daily Telegraph chief sports writer Paul Hayward says he believes a Djokovic-less Wimbledon is a price most people would be willing to pay for effective anti-Covid restrictions.

"Russia's defence ministry says some troops positioned on the border with Ukraine are returning to their bases after completing drills It raises hopes that tensions could ease but military exercises continue and it's unclear how many units are being withdrawn The head of the Nato defence alliance says he hasn't seen de-escalation yet but that signals from Moscow give some cause for optimism President Vladimir Putin tells a news conference that Russia does not want war in Europe UK PM Boris Johnson says there are ""mixed signals"" coming from Russia and that the intelligence on Ukraine ""is still not encouraging"" The EU says it is willing to discuss Russia's security concerns but warns a key Russian gas pipeline to Germany would ""not become operational"" in the event of war Edited by Hugo Bachega We'll be pausing our live coverage shortly so here's a summary of the main developments today:  Today's live page was edited by Hugo Bachega and Lauren Turner and written by Becky Morton, Jennifer Meierhans, Jeremy Gahagan, James Harness and Leo Sands. You can keep up to date with all the latest developmentsin our main story. Olga IvshinaBBC Russian Service One
way to judge whether Russia's troop withdrawal is real is to watch
what happens over the next few days in Belarus, where Moscow and Minsk are currently conducting joint military drills. Russia
moved thousands of troops to Belarus from Siberia and the Far East for the exercises. The units include fighter jets, air defence systems, and some of Russia's most experienced paratroopers and marines. Those joint drills are due to finish on 20 February. If Russia withdraws its troops after that, it could be a sign that Moscow is serious about reducing its military build-up around Ukraine's borders. Away from the politicking, we've got a Eurovision Song Contest development to bring you. Alina Pash, Ukraine's Eurovision singer, has been ""suspended"" from competing at May's competition in Turin. Ukraine's national broadcaster UA:PBC took the actionafter it was revealed that authorities are investigating a 2015 trip she made to Crimea, an area Russia seized control of in 2014. There are strict travel rules in place over how people enter Crimea. It's not illegal for Ukrainians to visit but it can be frowned upon. Alina has provided authorities with proof of how she entered the region but that's now being scrutinised. While investigations continue, Alina says some people claim she's un-Ukrainian. ""I'm a Ukrainian girl. I'm talking in Ukrainian and my song is about Ukraine,"" she explains. We've now got some details of the phone call held between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia's Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov. A statement from the foreign ministry in Moscow says Lavrov stressed the need for ""pragmatic dialogue over the entire range of issues raised by Russia"". He also told Blinken that ""aggressive rhetoric"" inflated by Washington was unacceptable. But said it was necessary to continue ""joint work"". Websites including the Ukrainian defence ministry and the banks PrivatBank and OshadBank have been subject to a cyber-attack, the Russia's Tass news agency reports. The Ukrainian cybersecurity centre has said Russia could be to blame for the attack, according to Tass. The website of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has also been affected, the Unian news agency reports. Ukrainian websites have been affected by cyber-attacks before with Russia denying any involvement. Helen CattBBC political correspondent UK MPs have been briefed by the Defence
Secretary Ben Wallace this afternoon on the current situation around Russia and
Ukraine. It's understood he repeated the government's
assessment that it was not convinced Russia was standing down despite reports
of troops moving away That's because he said there had been an
uptick in other activity such as stepping up the preparedness of field
hospitals. He apparently warned that, while Russia
could launch an invasion within hours, it wasn't beyond the realms of possibility
that the current situation continues for weeks or months. He's also said to have told them that he
believes that President Putin has still not decided whether to launch an
invasion or not. Wallace is also said to have confirmed that UK troops who were involved in
training in Ukraine are now back in the UK. The UK should ""not believe anything that's coming out of Moscow"", the chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee has said. Earlier today, Russia said some troops positioned on the border with Ukraine were returning to their bases. But Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: ""[Russia] have lied and lied and lied and, surprisingly, are continuing to lie."" Addressing whether Russia would invade Ukraine, he said:
""Only one person knows and he ain't speaking. And that's Vladimir
Putin. We're dealing with a one-man band here."" Tugendhat says Russia's foreign ministry is ""simply
the barking dog outside the house of a mafia don... It's just there to make a
noise"". Viktoriia ZhuhanBBC Ukrainian, Kyiv ""When I see Maxar [satellite] imagery prove the Russian troops' withdrawal, I will believe,"" says mother-of-three Alina Fediai-Zyrianska, from her home in a suburb of Kyiv. Her family were planning to launch a new business this month. But that has been put on hold because of their growing fears of war. Alina is critical of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, but her feelings about the news of Russia withdrawing echo the reaction from authorities there. Mykhailo Podoliak, from the president's office, tells the BBC that state bodies need to assess the scale of the withdrawal in order to confirm if the situation is ""getting back to normal"". Yesterday, Zelensky published yet another video to reassure the nation and call for unity. Such messages are welcomed by his supporters, but some are keen to stress that a grassroots resistance is being formed, regardless of any official statements. Alina says the president's address didn't lift her spirits. Instead, she keeps tracking website FlightRadar open - watching American drones and British planes fly over Ukraine's borders has a soothing effect, she says. This video can not be played We heard earlier from UK PM Boris Johnson, who said tough sanctions were ready to go if Russia invaded Ukraine. Now Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said there needs to be a ""very tough line on sanctions"" from the government after today's Cobra meeting. He says this is important so that Russia ""knows there will be serious consequences"" for any action it chooses to take against Ukraine and called on ""allies to stand together in the face of Russian aggression"". He says ""it's not entirely clear what's happening on the border"". More diplomatic talks to de-escalate tensions over Ukraine are under way between the US and Russia. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia's Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov are on the phone, according to the US state department. We're also hearing that US President Joe Biden will speak on the phone later with France's President Emmanuel Macron. Western military analysts say they need more information
to judge the significance of Russia's movement of some troops back from the Ukrainian border. Henry Boyd of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London tells Reuters news agency: One should maintain an air of cautious scepticism. There have been past discrepancies between Russia's official announcements and its actions on the ground.  Many of the Russian forces in Belarus for drills - due to end on Sunday - have come from thousands of miles away in Russia's central and eastern military districts. Rob Lee, a military analyst who specialises in Russia, tells Reuters the announcement was ""potentially good news"" but it was important to see where those forces went after the culmination of joint exercises between Russia and Belarus. As long as that remains nearby, Russia will have the capacity to conduct a significant escalation, though possibly not on as short notice.  Konrad Muzyka, director of the Poland-based Rochan consultancy, tells Reuters it would take several days to verify the latest moves via satellite imagery. It should also be noted that new trains with equipment from central Russia keep on arriving near the border and that Russian forces continue to move towards staging areas. The announcement stands in a direct opposition to what Russia has been doing for the past few days.  President Putin and German Chancellor Scholz held talks earlier today The news conference by Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has now finished so here's a summary of the main points: Orla GuerinBBC international correspondent, Mariupol If the shops are anything to go by, it's business as usual in the
port city of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine, even though the Russian border is
only 50km (31 miles) away. We found customers ambling through the well-stocked
aisles of one local supermarket. There was no panic buying and no
shortages. Tatiana, aged 74 - who was carefully perusing the sausage
selection - was adamant that fellow Slavs would not attack Ukraine. ""The
invasion is just in our heads,"" she told me. ""Nobody is going to invade.
Nobody will beat their brothers."" The tension may now be easing somewhat, but eastern Ukraine has already
been a battleground for the past eight years. Kremlin backed separatists are dug in
about 15km for Mariupol.  War is already part of the landscape. Some
here say - quietly - that they are now afraid of a much bigger conflict, but
there's no hint of an exodus. Close to the border we saw no sign of trouble on the horizon. The
only thing coming down the road from the Russian border were tractors, not
tanks. But Moscow's designs on Ukraine are a long-term project. People spend time at the coast of Mariupol in Ukraine despite the cold weather Putin is asked about the expansion of Nato. The Russian president says over the last 30 years we've been told there would be no expansion of Nato at all, yet today we see infrastructure ""right on our doorstep"". Putin queries when Ukraineâs Nato membership would be accepted. Ukraine hasn't even started an application process, and experts say the country is far from being in a position to do so. ""We need to resolve this question now, we need to resolve this question over the course of these negotiations,"" he says. ""We hope very much our concern will be heard by our partners and taken seriously."" Russia's core demand now is for the West to guaranteeUkraine will not join Nato, a defensive alliance of 30 countries. Asked about Nord Stream 2, Chancellor Scholz says Germany has made a commitment to ensuring gas transportation in Europe functions. He says Germany wants to make sure there will not be war over Ukraine as this would have ""far reaching consequences"". President Putin has accused Ukraine of committing acts of genocide against areas held by the Moscow-backed rebels in the eastern Donbas region. ""In our view what is now happening in Donbas is genocide,"" he tells the news conference. Putin has made similar accusations before in reference to the issue of discrimination against Russian speakers beyond its borders, many of whom live in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. In December he said that Russophobia was the first step towards genocide. His claims have been
dismissed as propaganda. A bit more from Scholz. He says he wants Vladimir Putin to send his negotiators with a âpositive mandate so we can achieve progressâ. The German chancellor adds âsecurity can only be achieved with Russia, not against Russia.â He says Nato and Europe are united in thinking that a solution must be found, no matter how difficult. We all need to be brave and responsible in our actions, he says. Scholz adds âwar has become unthinkable in Europe and we have to make sure it stays that wayâ.  President Putin is asked if he can exclude the possibility of war in Europe. He references Chancellor Scholz's earlier comments that his generation cannot imagine war in Europe - but points out the continent has seen war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s, which he claims was initiated by Nato. Putin says Russia does not want war and so has put forward proposals to start a negotiation process - but he says there has been no constructive response to Russia's proposals. However, he adds that there are still issues put forward by Nato and the US which could be discussed. We're hearing from German Chancellor Olaf Scholz too. He says the troop build-up on the Ukraine border is seen as a threat and is ""incomprehensible"". He demands ""de-escalation"" in the region and says it's important that ""no war will follow"". Scholz says territorial integrity is ""non-negotiable"" and it's his wish that there is dialogue. Talks must not come to a ""dead end"", he adds. President Putin says basic requirements have not been met by Nato and that it has an obligation not to strengthen its security at the expense of other countries. However, he says he is prepared to discuss the issues of European security and missiles. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Diplomatic efforts continue to try to halt a possible Russian invasion, but Moscow denies it is planning to attack The US and UK leaders have said not all hope is lost for a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine crisis but warned the situation remained fragile. In a 40-minute call, Joe Biden and Boris Johnson agreed a deal was still possible despite a chorus of warnings of imminent Russian military action. Russia has always denied plans to invade Ukraine, despite massing more than 100,000 troops on the border. On Monday its foreign minister said diplomacy was ""far from exhausted"". As part of diplomatic efforts to ward off a possible invasion, Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz is to meet Russia's President Vladimir Putin later on Tuesday. After being criticised for a slow initial response, Mr Scholz met the Ukrainian president in Kyiv on Monday, saying there was ""no reasonable justification"" for the Russian military build-up. EXPLAINER:Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? ANALYSIS:Five ways out of conflict ON THE GROUND:A Ukrainian city unifies against Russia's threats More than a dozen nations have urged their citizens to leave Ukraine, and the US has said aerial bombardments could begin ""at any time"". But in their conversation, Mr Biden and Mr Johnson said there remained a ""crucial window"" for diplomacy and for Russia to step back from its threats towards Ukraine, according to a Downing Street statement. ""The leaders emphasised that any further incursion into Ukraine would result in a protracted crisis for Russia, with far-reaching damage for both Russia and the world,"" the statement added. Mr Johnson reportedly said that the UK was prepared to do everything it could to help, to which Mr Biden responded: ""We're not going anywhere without you pal."" Mr Johnson is expected to hold a Cobra meeting on Tuesday to discuss the UK's response to the pressures.

""We have something to respond with. We have a great army... this is an army many times stronger than eight years ago."" But he said he wanted to resolve all issues through negotiations and diplomacy. The Ukrainian president ended his speech on an optimistic note: ""Now you may think it's darkness all around.

Russia has granted citizenship to more than 700,000 people in Donbas And asked whether there was a chance for agreement with the West, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the ""possibilities are far from being exhausted, they certainly should not continue indefinitely, but I would suggest continuing and ramping them up"". Mr Lavrov's comments, made in a meeting with Mr Putin, are being seen as a clear concession that talks could ease the tensions. But analysts say that without either side moving over the thorny issue of Ukraine potentially joining Nato, there is still deadlock. The Kremlin says it cannot accept that Ukraine - a former Soviet republic with deep social and cultural ties with Russia - could one day join Nato, and has demanded that this be ruled out.

"Tennis star Novak Djokovic tells the BBC he is willing to forfeit future trophies rather than get vaccinated against Covid In an exclusive interview, the world number one says he does not want to be associated with the anti-vaccination movement but that he supports the individual's right to choose Djokovic was deported from Australia in January after losing a last-ditch attempt to stay in the country and compete at the Australian Open US tennis legend Pam Shriver says Djokovic's continuing refusal to take a coronavirus vaccine is 'terrible for tennis' Meanwhile, Tim Henman says Djokovic's decision to miss out on trophies 'speaks volumes to his conviction' BBC research has cast doubt on the timing of the positive Covid test Djokovic used to enter Australia. The Serb authorities insist they were valid You can watch the whole interview in a BBC One special programme and iPlayer at 20:30 GMT on Tuesday (UK only) Edited by Jasmine Taylor-Coleman We'll soon be winding down the live coverage of reaction to Novak Djokovic's exclusive interview with the BBC's Amol Rajan: If you're just joining us and would like to catch up, here are the key headlines: Sports psychologist Bradley Busch has some interesting thoughts on the mindset of elite athletes in relation to theDjokovic interview. He says thereâs something about the nature of sportsmen and sportswomen that makes them more likely to follow âalternative remediesâ. Athletes at the top of their sport are âconstantly searching for this extra 1%â. Busch saysâsurvivorship biasâcomes into play. They are very fit and healthy individuals and decisions they have made have paid off in their career, so itâs easy for them to fall into this âbubbleâ that makes them believe they âknow better than modern medicineâ. But Busch wonders if Djokovic's single-mindedness ""might be part of his downfall over the next future years"". Having heard the views of experts, supporters and opponents of Novak Djokovic on our exclusive interview, we can now hear from the man himself. Writing on Twitter, Djokovic says he is grateful for the ""opportunity to answer questions"" from the BBC's Amol Rajan and to ""set the record straight"". He also thanks fans for their support and patience in the weeks since the controversy over his participation in the Australian Open began. Allow Twitter content?

As people have been reacting to Novak Djokovic interview today, many have been questioning his denial that he is an anti-vaxxer and his attempts to distance himself from that movement. People on social media have pointed out that, whatever the tennis star claims about his views on vaccines, he does publicly oppose Covid jabs and has engaged in spreading anti-vaccination messages.

Let's remember, more than 60% of the world's population - 4.8 billion people - have received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine. All of the approved Covid-19 vaccines have undergone rigorous testing - including large clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people - and continue to be closely monitored. Guy De Launey, BBC Balkans Correspondent Serbian tabloid Blic said Djokovic's comments 'shocked' Amol Rajan The
first interview by Novak Djokovic since his Australian misadventure is making
headlines in all main news outlets in his home country of Serbia. The
Blic tabloid makes much of BBC interviewer Amol Rajan asking the tennis player
âWhy, Novak, why?â as Djokovic insists that he would rather miss defending his
French Open and Wimbledon titles than have a vaccine against Covid-19. Blic
says this declaration âcompletely shocked the journalistâ. The
more upmarket Danas leads with the line that the worldâs top male player would
âsacrifice trophiesâ because of his beliefs. And the state broadcaster, RTS,
headlines with Djokovicâs assertion that âI am not anti-vaccineâ. Serbian
people are already well aware of their sporting iconâs strict approach to
nutrition and lifestyle. But their interest
may be piqued by the playerâs denial that there was anything amiss regarding
his Covid test certificates. Last
week, police arrested a dozen people, including doctors and nurses, for their
involvement in issuing counterfeit documents. Earlier this month, prosecutors
said they had investigated Djokovicâs coronavirus certificates and found no evidence
that they were manipulated. Russell FullerTennis correspondent Novak Djokovic says he âsincerely hopesâ
international Covid regulations will soon change, and certainly within Europe,
travelling is becoming easier for the unvaccinated. His
chances of playing in the French Open and at Wimbledon have improved in recent
days. Under current rules, the unvaccinated no longer need to isolate on
arrival in France if they have travelled from another EU country. Djokovic is
now resident in Spain. And
even though there are more stringent testing requirements for unvaccinated
arrivals in England, the need to quarantine has also been removed. But
the United States remains a serious problem for Djokovic. Vaccination
certificates are compulsory, and there are few exceptions. So
the world number one is likely to miss next monthâs prestigious tour events in
Indian Wells and Miami, and could face further problems in late summer. A
string of tournaments take place in the US in August in the run up to the US
Open, which is the final Grand Slam of the year. In his exclusive interview with the BBC, Novak Djokovic flatly denied reports that there had been efforts to tamper with his positive Covid test in December. His denial follows discrepancies revealed by the BBC that have cast doubt over the exact timing of his positive coronavirus test. Documents submitted to a federal court in Australia during the Serb's deportation hearings included two Covid (PCR) test certificates, one with a positive result on 16 December and one with a negative result on 22 December. But researchers have highlighted that the earlier test had a higher confirmation code than the later one, suggesting that the tests were out of sync. The findings raise questions as to whether Djokovic would have been granted his initial medical exemption. Serbian authorities have also denied that there were any issues with the 34-year-old's test and stated that the tests were authentic. Read more BBC's analysis here. Shaimaa KhalilBBC News, Melbourne Iâm outside Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne Park where Novak
Djokovic was hoping to defend his Australian Open title in January. He made headlines when he arrived in Australia and when he was deported - and
now in his comments about this whole saga, Novak Djokovic has addressed
the Australian people and acknowledged their frustration and anger. There was a great deal of that the moment he announced he was coming
with a vaccine exemption in January. Social media was alight with comments -
many argued that they had endured long and strict lockdowns and had been
required to get the vaccine in order to travel and reunite with their families. Djokovic said he wasnât given special treatment and that he followed
the rules. But Immigration Minister Alex Hawke based his decision to deport
Djokovic not on the rules but on whether his presence would incite anti-vax
sentiment. Djokovic has distanced himself from the anti-vax movement, despite
the protests against vaccine mandates at the time that essentially used him as
a symbol. In their interview, Djokovicwas asked by the BBC's Amol Rajanwhat he would say to anti-vaccination protesters who have adopted him as a figurehead. ""I say that everyone has the right to choose to act and say
whatever they feel is appropriate for them,"" he said. ""I have never said I am part of that
movement. No-one in the whole process, during Australian saga has asked me for
my stance or opinion on vaccination. No-one. ""So I could not really express what
I feel and what my stance is, neither in the legal process or outside, so it is
really unfortunate that there has been this misconception and wrong conclusion made
around the world based on something I completely disagree with."" As we've already reported today, some commentators have pointed out that he does have popular social media profiles, which he has used to share other information. Mike WendlingBBC Trending A Djokovic supporter displays an anti-vaccination mandate sign at a gathering outside his hotel in Melbourne in January Novak Djokovic says heâs not an anti-vaxxer and in the interview
distances himself from the anti-vaccine movement. He says itâs a âmisconceptionâ that he was ever on the side
of hardcore anti-vaxxers â even as they celebrated him as a hero. The tennis star frames his refusal of a Covid vaccination in
terms of personal choice. He wants ultimate control of what goes into his body. That is an argument routinely seen on the most active anti-vaccine
groups, particularly on the messaging app Telegram. But itâs just one of a
hodgepodge of points that regularly makes the rounds. Others - including far
more emotive false posts about sinister global plots and mass deaths - have less
to do with individual liberties and are based purely in pseudoscience. So perhaps itâs not surprising that, in the most conspiracy-addled
groups, so far there hasnât been a huge reaction to Djokovicâs interview. But perhaps the nuance in the world number oneâs
argument will have made him less of a hero to that part of the crowd. Of course, vaccination status is not just an issue for tennis - it is causing many top sports teams and athletes to alter their plans. The Premier League said earlier this month that 80% of its players had been double jabbed, but the minority that haven't are unable to travel to some overseas ties. European champions Chelsea have been facing being without some of their squad for next month's Champions League last-16 match tie away to Lillebecause of French government rules. Kyrie Irving, one of the stars of the NBA basketball league in the United States, has a similar problem, but with his team's home matches. Irving plays for the Brooklyn Nets and New York laws ban unvaccinated people in indoor venues. ""I stay rooted in my decision. It's not going to be swayed just because of one thing in this NBA life,""said Irving in January. Bayern Munich footballer Joshua Kimmich initially opted against vaccination, but, after contracting the virus and suffering some damage to his lungs, revised his opinion. ""Maybe I had to go through what I have now gone through first,""he told ZDF. ""Of course, looking back, I would like to make the vaccination decision earlier, but at the time it wasn't possible for me."" Allow Twitter content?

Daily Mirror associate editor and political commentator Kevin Maguire remains unconvinced by Novak Djokovic's stance. The only requirements to travel to England without being fully vaccinated are tests before and after arrival and a completion of a whereabouts form. French Open organisers said in January that there would be no exemption to allow unvaccinated players to compete. The All England Club, which stages Wimbledon, are yet to announce their own rules. The US tennis legendPam Shriverhas told the BBC that Novak Djokovic's continuing refusal to take a coronavirus vaccine is ""terrible for tennis"". The 22-time doubles Grand Slam doubles champion told 5 Live Breakfast that while it was good to hear Djokovic's rationale for his refusal to take the jab, and noted that we must be ""understanding"" of those who are reluctant to take the jab, she said the interview also raised several questions. âWill he really truly have an open mind to have a vaccine at
a later date?â, Shriver asked. âI hope that the right trusted person, who is an expert in
science and medicine, probably would have to be a Serbian, can sit him down and show him, and walk him through all of the steps that make the science
and the medicine trustworthy and safe to put in his body.â âBecause itâs terrible for tennis, not good for him â and,
really, he does lead. The fact that he doesnât trust it, it does lead a lot
of people, in his own country and throughout the world.â In the interview Djokovic says he should not be associated with the anti-vax movement, but instead supports an individual's right to choose to have a jab. While many support the tennis star's right to choose, medical experts stress the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people, and any vaccine will have to pass rigorous safety tests before being rolled out to the wider population. So what are the risks of having a Covid jab and how are vaccines approved for use?Read more here.  There is unlikely to be any bar on Novak Djokovic playing at Wimbledon according to Tim Henman, who is on the committee of the All England Club who organise the tournament. ""I donât think so,"" Henman told BBC Radio 4 when asked if he foresaw any issue with Djokovic playing at this year's Wimbledon in June. ""To get into the UK at the moment, those
are the guidelines the Championship will be following at this stage. ""At this moment in time it is going to be government-led."" Current rules require visitors to England to be tested before and after arrival and to complete a whereabouts form, but not to quarantine or be vaccinated. Djokovichas told the BBCthat he would skip Wimbledon if the tournament insisted all players must be vaccinated. Six-time Grand Slam semi-finalistTim Henmanhas been giving BBC Radio 4 his reaction toNovak Djokovic's interview. ""I do understand his concerns. I would reiterate it is
absolutely his prerogative to have the vaccine or not. As a former player and a
tennis fan, it was probably not what I wanted to hear in that interview, but probably
what I expected. As he freely admitted, he is going to
be severely restricted as to where he can travel to and therefore play without
being vaccinated. ""By taking himself out of the chance to compete in Grand Slams he is certainly jeopardizing his chances of being the greatest male player of
all time and I think that speaks volumes to his courage, conviction and belief
that this is what is best for him. ""You would have thought that very little is
going to sway his opinion."" This video can not be played Watch: Novak Djokovic's visa drama in 90 seconds For almost two weeks last month the world was gripped by the unfolding drama of Novak Djokovic's battle with Australian authorities. If you need a reminder, here is a quick refresher of how the saga played out:  Ralph Rogers, a sports medicine consultant who was in a Covid bubble with the NBA basketball league in
the United States, has been talking to BBC Radio 4 about Djokovic's stance on vaccination. ""If those are his convictions, then those are his
convictions,"" says Rogers. ""He has a choice and then, based on that choice, other people have
a choice not to allow him to play. So I think it is quite simple. ""As he said
point blank, he is not an anti-vaxxer. His mind is open, and he is looking for
a solution. So maybe his facts are incorrect, I think his facts are incorrect,
but I hope he comes to the right conclusion in the future. ""He is a
great competitor a great tennis player and we would like to see him play."" Novak Djokovicsays he remains open to the possibility of taking a Covid vaccination,if he can be convinced that it is the right choice for him. ""I keep my mind open, there is always the possibility that things will change in the future,"" he told the BBC's Amol Rajan. ""As of today, this is my decision and stance for it and I will suffer the consequences of not travelling to the tournaments, but hopefully things will be able to change in the future. We will see what happens."" Former Daily Telegraph chief sports writer Paul Hayward says he believes a Djokovic-less Wimbledon is a price most people would be willing to pay for effective anti-Covid restrictions.

"Russia's defence ministry says some troops positioned on the border with Ukraine are returning to their bases after completing drills It raises hopes that tensions could ease but military exercises continue and it's unclear how many units are being withdrawn The head of the Nato defence alliance says he hasn't seen de-escalation yet but that signals from Moscow give some cause for optimism President Vladimir Putin tells a news conference that Russia does not want war in Europe UK PM Boris Johnson says there are ""mixed signals"" coming from Russia and that the intelligence on Ukraine ""is still not encouraging"" The EU says it is willing to discuss Russia's security concerns but warns a key Russian gas pipeline to Germany would ""not become operational"" in the event of war Edited by Hugo Bachega We'll be pausing our live coverage shortly so here's a summary of the main developments today:  Today's live page was edited by Hugo Bachega and Lauren Turner and written by Becky Morton, Jennifer Meierhans, Jeremy Gahagan, James Harness and Leo Sands.

way to judge whether Russia's troop withdrawal is real is to watch
what happens over the next few days in Belarus, where Moscow and Minsk are currently conducting joint military drills. Russia
moved thousands of troops to Belarus from Siberia and the Far East for the exercises. The units include fighter jets, air defence systems, and some of Russia's most experienced paratroopers and marines. Those joint drills are due to finish on 20 February. If Russia withdraws its troops after that, it could be a sign that Moscow is serious about reducing its military build-up around Ukraine's borders. Away from the politicking, we've got a Eurovision Song Contest development to bring you. Alina Pash, Ukraine's Eurovision singer, has been ""suspended"" from competing at May's competition in Turin. Ukraine's national broadcaster UA:PBC took the actionafter it was revealed that authorities are investigating a 2015 trip she made to Crimea, an area Russia seized control of in 2014. There are strict travel rules in place over how people enter Crimea. It's not illegal for Ukrainians to visit but it can be frowned upon. Alina has provided authorities with proof of how she entered the region but that's now being scrutinised. While investigations continue, Alina says some people claim she's un-Ukrainian. ""I'm a Ukrainian girl. I'm talking in Ukrainian and my song is about Ukraine,"" she explains. We've now got some details of the phone call held between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia's Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov. A statement from the foreign ministry in Moscow says Lavrov stressed the need for ""pragmatic dialogue over the entire range of issues raised by Russia"". He also told Blinken that ""aggressive rhetoric"" inflated by Washington was unacceptable. But said it was necessary to continue ""joint work"". Websites including the Ukrainian defence ministry and the banks PrivatBank and OshadBank have been subject to a cyber-attack, the Russia's Tass news agency reports. The Ukrainian cybersecurity centre has said Russia could be to blame for the attack, according to Tass. The website of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has also been affected, the Unian news agency reports. Ukrainian websites have been affected by cyber-attacks before with Russia denying any involvement. Helen CattBBC political correspondent UK MPs have been briefed by the Defence
Secretary Ben Wallace this afternoon on the current situation around Russia and
Ukraine. It's understood he repeated the government's
assessment that it was not convinced Russia was standing down despite reports
of troops moving away That's because he said there had been an
uptick in other activity such as stepping up the preparedness of field
hospitals. He apparently warned that, while Russia
could launch an invasion within hours, it wasn't beyond the realms of possibility
that the current situation continues for weeks or months. He's also said to have told them that he
believes that President Putin has still not decided whether to launch an
invasion or not. Wallace is also said to have confirmed that UK troops who were involved in
training in Ukraine are now back in the UK. The UK should ""not believe anything that's coming out of Moscow"", the chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee has said. Earlier today, Russia said some troops positioned on the border with Ukraine were returning to their bases. But Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: ""[Russia] have lied and lied and lied and, surprisingly, are continuing to lie."" Addressing whether Russia would invade Ukraine, he said:
""Only one person knows and he ain't speaking. And that's Vladimir
Putin. We're dealing with a one-man band here."" Tugendhat says Russia's foreign ministry is ""simply
the barking dog outside the house of a mafia don... It's just there to make a
noise"". Viktoriia ZhuhanBBC Ukrainian, Kyiv ""When I see Maxar [satellite] imagery prove the Russian troops' withdrawal, I will believe,"" says mother-of-three Alina Fediai-Zyrianska, from her home in a suburb of Kyiv. Her family were planning to launch a new business this month. But that has been put on hold because of their growing fears of war. Alina is critical of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, but her feelings about the news of Russia withdrawing echo the reaction from authorities there. Mykhailo Podoliak, from the president's office, tells the BBC that state bodies need to assess the scale of the withdrawal in order to confirm if the situation is ""getting back to normal"". Yesterday, Zelensky published yet another video to reassure the nation and call for unity. Such messages are welcomed by his supporters, but some are keen to stress that a grassroots resistance is being formed, regardless of any official statements. Alina says the president's address didn't lift her spirits. Instead, she keeps tracking website FlightRadar open - watching American drones and British planes fly over Ukraine's borders has a soothing effect, she says. This video can not be played We heard earlier from UK PM Boris Johnson, who said tough sanctions were ready to go if Russia invaded Ukraine. Now Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said there needs to be a ""very tough line on sanctions"" from the government after today's Cobra meeting. He says this is important so that Russia ""knows there will be serious consequences"" for any action it chooses to take against Ukraine and called on ""allies to stand together in the face of Russian aggression"". He says ""it's not entirely clear what's happening on the border"". More diplomatic talks to de-escalate tensions over Ukraine are under way between the US and Russia. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia's Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov are on the phone, according to the US state department. We're also hearing that US President Joe Biden will speak on the phone later with France's President Emmanuel Macron. Western military analysts say they need more information
to judge the significance of Russia's movement of some troops back from the Ukrainian border. Henry Boyd of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London tells Reuters news agency: One should maintain an air of cautious scepticism. There have been past discrepancies between Russia's official announcements and its actions on the ground.  Many of the Russian forces in Belarus for drills - due to end on Sunday - have come from thousands of miles away in Russia's central and eastern military districts. Rob Lee, a military analyst who specialises in Russia, tells Reuters the announcement was ""potentially good news"" but it was important to see where those forces went after the culmination of joint exercises between Russia and Belarus. As long as that remains nearby, Russia will have the capacity to conduct a significant escalation, though possibly not on as short notice.  Konrad Muzyka, director of the Poland-based Rochan consultancy, tells Reuters it would take several days to verify the latest moves via satellite imagery. It should also be noted that new trains with equipment from central Russia keep on arriving near the border and that Russian forces continue to move towards staging areas. The announcement stands in a direct opposition to what Russia has been doing for the past few days.  President Putin and German Chancellor Scholz held talks earlier today The news conference by Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has now finished so here's a summary of the main points: Orla GuerinBBC international correspondent, Mariupol If the shops are anything to go by, it's business as usual in the
port city of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine, even though the Russian border is
only 50km (31 miles) away. We found customers ambling through the well-stocked
aisles of one local supermarket. There was no panic buying and no
shortages. Tatiana, aged 74 - who was carefully perusing the sausage
selection - was adamant that fellow Slavs would not attack Ukraine. ""The
invasion is just in our heads,"" she told me. ""Nobody is going to invade.
Nobody will beat their brothers."" The tension may now be easing somewhat, but eastern Ukraine has already
been a battleground for the past eight years. Kremlin backed separatists are dug in
about 15km for Mariupol.  War is already part of the landscape. Some
here say - quietly - that they are now afraid of a much bigger conflict, but
there's no hint of an exodus. Close to the border we saw no sign of trouble on the horizon. The
only thing coming down the road from the Russian border were tractors, not
tanks. But Moscow's designs on Ukraine are a long-term project. People spend time at the coast of Mariupol in Ukraine despite the cold weather Putin is asked about the expansion of Nato. The Russian president says over the last 30 years we've been told there would be no expansion of Nato at all, yet today we see infrastructure ""right on our doorstep"". Putin queries when Ukraineâs Nato membership would be accepted. Ukraine hasn't even started an application process, and experts say the country is far from being in a position to do so. ""We need to resolve this question now, we need to resolve this question over the course of these negotiations,"" he says. ""We hope very much our concern will be heard by our partners and taken seriously."" Russia's core demand now is for the West to guaranteeUkraine will not join Nato, a defensive alliance of 30 countries. Asked about Nord Stream 2, Chancellor Scholz says Germany has made a commitment to ensuring gas transportation in Europe functions. He says Germany wants to make sure there will not be war over Ukraine as this would have ""far reaching consequences"". President Putin has accused Ukraine of committing acts of genocide against areas held by the Moscow-backed rebels in the eastern Donbas region. ""In our view what is now happening in Donbas is genocide,"" he tells the news conference. Putin has made similar accusations before in reference to the issue of discrimination against Russian speakers beyond its borders, many of whom live in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. In December he said that Russophobia was the first step towards genocide. His claims have been
dismissed as propaganda. A bit more from Scholz. He says he wants Vladimir Putin to send his negotiators with a âpositive mandate so we can achieve progressâ. The German chancellor adds âsecurity can only be achieved with Russia, not against Russia.â He says Nato and Europe are united in thinking that a solution must be found, no matter how difficult. We all need to be brave and responsible in our actions, he says. Scholz adds âwar has become unthinkable in Europe and we have to make sure it stays that wayâ.  President Putin is asked if he can exclude the possibility of war in Europe. He references Chancellor Scholz's earlier comments that his generation cannot imagine war in Europe - but points out the continent has seen war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s, which he claims was initiated by Nato. Putin says Russia does not want war and so has put forward proposals to start a negotiation process - but he says there has been no constructive response to Russia's proposals. However, he adds that there are still issues put forward by Nato and the US which could be discussed. We're hearing from German Chancellor Olaf Scholz too. He says the troop build-up on the Ukraine border is seen as a threat and is ""incomprehensible"". He demands ""de-escalation"" in the region and says it's important that ""no war will follow"". Scholz says territorial integrity is ""non-negotiable"" and it's his wish that there is dialogue. Talks must not come to a ""dead end"", he adds. President Putin says basic requirements have not been met by Nato and that it has an obligation not to strengthen its security at the expense of other countries. However, he says he is prepared to discuss the issues of European security and missiles. Â© 2025 BBC.

It should also be noted that new trains with equipment from central Russia keep on arriving near the border and that Russian forces continue to move towards staging areas. The announcement stands in a direct opposition to what Russia has been doing for the past few days.  President Putin and German Chancellor Scholz held talks earlier today The news conference by Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has now finished so here's a summary of the main points: Orla GuerinBBC international correspondent, Mariupol If the shops are anything to go by, it's business as usual in the
port city of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine, even though the Russian border is
only 50km (31 miles) away. We found customers ambling through the well-stocked
aisles of one local supermarket. There was no panic buying and no
shortages. Tatiana, aged 74 - who was carefully perusing the sausage
selection - was adamant that fellow Slavs would not attack Ukraine. ""The
invasion is just in our heads,"" she told me. ""Nobody is going to invade.
Nobody will beat their brothers."" The tension may now be easing somewhat, but eastern Ukraine has already
been a battleground for the past eight years. Kremlin backed separatists are dug in
about 15km for Mariupol.  War is already part of the landscape. Some
here say - quietly - that they are now afraid of a much bigger conflict, but
there's no hint of an exodus. Close to the border we saw no sign of trouble on the horizon. The
only thing coming down the road from the Russian border were tractors, not
tanks. But Moscow's designs on Ukraine are a long-term project. People spend time at the coast of Mariupol in Ukraine despite the cold weather Putin is asked about the expansion of Nato. The Russian president says over the last 30 years we've been told there would be no expansion of Nato at all, yet today we see infrastructure ""right on our doorstep"". Putin queries when Ukraineâs Nato membership would be accepted. Ukraine hasn't even started an application process, and experts say the country is far from being in a position to do so. ""We need to resolve this question now, we need to resolve this question over the course of these negotiations,"" he says. ""We hope very much our concern will be heard by our partners and taken seriously."" Russia's core demand now is for the West to guaranteeUkraine will not join Nato, a defensive alliance of 30 countries. Asked about Nord Stream 2, Chancellor Scholz says Germany has made a commitment to ensuring gas transportation in Europe functions. He says Germany wants to make sure there will not be war over Ukraine as this would have ""far reaching consequences"". President Putin has accused Ukraine of committing acts of genocide against areas held by the Moscow-backed rebels in the eastern Donbas region. ""In our view what is now happening in Donbas is genocide,"" he tells the news conference. Putin has made similar accusations before in reference to the issue of discrimination against Russian speakers beyond its borders, many of whom live in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. In December he said that Russophobia was the first step towards genocide. His claims have been
dismissed as propaganda. A bit more from Scholz. He says he wants Vladimir Putin to send his negotiators with a âpositive mandate so we can achieve progressâ. The German chancellor adds âsecurity can only be achieved with Russia, not against Russia.â He says Nato and Europe are united in thinking that a solution must be found, no matter how difficult. We all need to be brave and responsible in our actions, he says. Scholz adds âwar has become unthinkable in Europe and we have to make sure it stays that wayâ.  President Putin is asked if he can exclude the possibility of war in Europe. He references Chancellor Scholz's earlier comments that his generation cannot imagine war in Europe - but points out the continent has seen war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s, which he claims was initiated by Nato. Putin says Russia does not want war and so has put forward proposals to start a negotiation process - but he says there has been no constructive response to Russia's proposals. However, he adds that there are still issues put forward by Nato and the US which could be discussed. We're hearing from German Chancellor Olaf Scholz too. He says the troop build-up on the Ukraine border is seen as a threat and is ""incomprehensible"". He demands ""de-escalation"" in the region and says it's important that ""no war will follow"". Scholz says territorial integrity is ""non-negotiable"" and it's his wish that there is dialogue. Talks must not come to a ""dead end"", he adds. President Putin says basic requirements have not been met by Nato and that it has an obligation not to strengthen its security at the expense of other countries. However, he says he is prepared to discuss the issues of European security and missiles. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Covid-19 restrictions in Northern Ireland are no longer legally binding as of 17:00 GMT on Tuesday. The need for Covid certificates in nightclubs, face coverings, track and trace requirements and the cap on 30 people in private homes are no longer legal requirements. Health Minister Robin Swann saidthe remaining measures would instead be issued as guidance to the public. He warned Covid-19 had not gone away and remained a threat. Speaking earlier, Mr Swann said: ""It is vitally important that we continue to observe the sensible measures we have all learnt to protect ourselves and others."" This video can not be played The NI public has ""a role to play"" in protecting others, Prof Ian Young says Northern Ireland's chief scientific adviser Professor Ian Young said Northern Ireland had reached a key milestone in the pandemic but said it was ""not freedom day"". ""There is still a lot of Covid out there, we all need to do our bit to continue to protect the most vulnerable and wearing face coverings in appropriate settings is an important part of that,"" he said. ""I hope this is a day when people will move from feeling that their behaviours are covered by regulation to using exactly the same behaviours through choice in response to guidance."" Measures, which had previously been guidance rather than law, such as working from home where possible, have not been changed. Meanwhile, it has emerged that in Northern Ireland the need to self-isolate after testing positive for Covid-19 falls under ""very strong guidance"". However, in England, there is a legal requirement to self isolate. It took many journalists by surprise when we learned that self-isolating, following a positive test, falls under guidance rather than a legal requirement. During a press conference on Tuesday, Prof Ian Young answered many questions about what is meant by guidance as opposed to restrictions. I asked surely isolating is still mandatory? To all our surprise the answer was no - instead we were informed that has always come under ""very strong guidance"" except when it was required by law to isolate after taking an international flight. So why didn't we know? According to the Department of Health 'no one ever asked'. The restrictions had been due to expire on 24 March, when the legislation underpinning them expired. The health minister made an order on Tuesday, which revoked the restrictions. Mr Swann also said it was important to retain the ability to reintroduce restrictions again in case a new variant causes concern. He said he would seek to extend the powers granted to the Department of Health by the Coronavirus Act 2020 by six months. Robin Swann warned that the pandemic is still not over BBC News NI political editor Enda McClafferty said businesses remained frustrated that there has been no change to guidance on working from home. This was beyond Mr Swann's control and he has called for the guidance to be reviewed. If individual businesses wish they will still be able to ask people to wear face coverings and enforce measures such as social distancing. Some have said they intend to do so. Hospitality businesses are hoping that trade will return to normal Some hospitality business owners have hailed the easing of regulations as the ""beginning of the end"" of the pandemic and said that they hoped trade would now return to normal. A bar owner said this was a good day for the hospitality industry, but major challenges remained in rebuilding consumer confidence. Stephen Magorrian of the Horatio Group, said: ""We are conscious of the fact that the pandemic hasn't ended, so we still need to be cautious but it is good to see the start of the end. ""The rebuilding of confidence will be the main thing. We need to make sure that our customers still feel safe,"" he said. Aaron Chism, co-owner of Belfast city centre clothes shop Fuzz Vintage, said his hope was for brighter days ahead. He started the business in the middle of the pandemic in October 2020. ""Hopefully there's going to be more people knocking about Belfast and they'll feel more comfortable to go into shops and we'll get more customers,"" he said. ""It's been quiet with lockdowns and stuff and then having to be closed. We opened in the middle of things before a second lockdown - it was a harsh time to open a shop but hopefully it's going back to normal now."" Translink is to continue to encourage passengers to wear face coverings. Meanwhile, train and bus company, Translink, is to continue to encourage passengers to wear face coverings. ""To help keep everyone safe and in line with the latest guidance, we are encouraging our passengers to wear a face covering, if they can, in stations and on-board buses and trains,"" a spokesperson said. Dr Alan Stout sounded a positive note The British Medical Association (BMA) in Northern Ireland, which represents doctors, advised caution especially given that those most vulnerable in society will be worried about the decision. Dr Alan Stout, from the BMA, welcomed the lifting of remaining restrictions. ""I think we've got to look at what's in front of us and what we're dealing with,"" he said. ""The link with the infection and with hospitalisation, with intensive care admission and with death has definitely been weakened. So it puts us in a much more confident position that we can start this journey back to some sort of normality."" What are NI's Covid rules after new relaxations? Relief mixed with concern as Covid rules removed The full Northern Ireland Executive cannot meet becausePaul Givan resigned as first minister, forcing the resignation of Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill because of the joint nature of the office. But individual ministers are still in place and can make some decisions, as long as the issues are not deemed ""significant or controversial"". It is understood ministers from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Sinn FÃ©in, SDLP and Alliance all supported Mr Swann - who is a member of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) - in his bid to remove remaining restrictions. On Tuesday,four more Covid-19 related deaths were announced in Northern Ireland, along with 2,987 cases. There are 476 patients with the virus in hospital. END OF RULES:What if I'm still worried?

"UK wage growth continued to lag behind the rising cost of living between October and December, figures show. Wages rose, but when taking inflation into account, pay showed a 0.8% fall from a year earlier,said the Office for National Statistics (ONS).,external Latest figures also show that the unemployment rate fell to 4.1% while job vacancies hit a fresh record high. There are signs that these pressures might feed through to faster wage growth in the coming months. According to the ONS, employees' regular pay, excluding bonuses, grew by 3.7% between October and December from a year earlier - which is high compared with rates seen over the last decade. However, the rising cost of food, energy and household goods has pushed inflation up by 5.4% in the 12 months to December. The ONS said real wages in the October to December period fell by 0.8% from a year earlier. The Bank of England has warned this squeeze on workers will get worse, with inflation set to rise above 7% this year. Why are prices rising so quickly? Fury after Bank boss says don't ask for big pay rise Interest rates rise again in bid to cool prices But the ONS said early estimates suggest employers are starting to push up wages further and faster in response. It said that for workers on payrolls in January, median monthly wages increased by 6.3% compared with the same month last year, and they were 10.3% higher than before the pandemic in February 2020. It added that wage rises for payrolled workers last month appeared to easily outpace inflation in some industries, such as science, finance and insurance, information and communication, and hotels. Employers are having to increase salaries as they face a continuing shortage of workers. Meanwhile the number of job vacancies between November and January hit another record of 1.3 million, the ONS said, with most industries finding it harder to recruit. ""The good news is that the UK economy is continuing to create jobs,"" said Matthew Percival, director for people and skills at the CBI. ""The bad news is that businesses are struggling to hire and pay is failing to keep up with inflation."" Lee Powell, chief executive of GMI Construction Group, which employs 200 people in Leeds, told the BBC that the combination of inflation and skills shortages was a ""headache at the moment"". ""In the construction industry we've seen unbelievably rapid inflation across materials... and we're in a situation now where the demands for wage increases are somewhat eye-watering. Construction firms have seen the costs of raw materials soar ""You'd automatically assume you could pass those prices straight on to the developer or to the end user but it's not as easy as that."" The governor of the Bank of England recently sparked controversywhen he urged workers not to ask for big pay rises, to help stop inflation from rising out of control. Andrew Bailey said that while it would be ""painful"" for workers to accept that prices would rise faster than their wages, he added that some ""moderation of wage rises"" was needed to prevent inflation becoming entrenched. The GMB union branded the idea a ""sick joke"" while the government distanced itself from the comments. Earlier this month,the Bank of England raised interest rates to 0.5%in an attempt to tame inflation. Paul Dales, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said the Bank was likely to take a more aggressive approach to rate increases this year and next given the economic picture. ""Employment has recouped the falls after the furlough scheme, the unemployment rate has fallen to pre-Covid levels, job vacancies are at a record high and wage growth is rising,"" he said. ""That's a recipe for more interest rate hikes, perhaps from 0.5% now to 1.25% this year and to 2% next year."" The latest estimates of wage increases for payrolled employees appear to confirm the Bank of England's fear that pay rises are taking off - one of the biggest reasons they've raised interest rates twice in a row. While they are early estimates and subject to revision, they suggest that pay in January was up by just over 10% compared with February 2020. That is the first time we've heard of double-digit pay rises, even over two years, in a very long time. Part of the reason is the tightest labour market we've had in living memory. Staff quit their jobs at record rates to take a better offer from another employer. Firms that want to keep people are having to pay more to retain them. This is hard to reconcile with the more reliable but less up-to-date quarterly figures, showing pay rises at 3.7%, lagging price inflation. But statistical confusion will work itself out over time. Meanwhile, these figures will do nothing to discourage the Bank of England from raising interest rates a third time the next time its interest rate setters meet.

"Russia's defence ministry says some troops positioned on the border with Ukraine are returning to their bases after completing drills It raises hopes that tensions could ease but military exercises continue and it's unclear how many units are being withdrawn The head of the Nato defence alliance says he hasn't seen de-escalation yet but that signals from Moscow give some cause for optimism President Vladimir Putin tells a news conference that Russia does not want war in Europe UK PM Boris Johnson says there are ""mixed signals"" coming from Russia and that the intelligence on Ukraine ""is still not encouraging"" The EU says it is willing to discuss Russia's security concerns but warns a key Russian gas pipeline to Germany would ""not become operational"" in the event of war Edited by Hugo Bachega We'll be pausing our live coverage shortly so here's a summary of the main developments today:  Today's live page was edited by Hugo Bachega and Lauren Turner and written by Becky Morton, Jennifer Meierhans, Jeremy Gahagan, James Harness and Leo Sands. You can keep up to date with all the latest developmentsin our main story. Olga IvshinaBBC Russian Service One
way to judge whether Russia's troop withdrawal is real is to watch
what happens over the next few days in Belarus, where Moscow and Minsk are currently conducting joint military drills. Russia
moved thousands of troops to Belarus from Siberia and the Far East for the exercises. The units include fighter jets, air defence systems, and some of Russia's most experienced paratroopers and marines. Those joint drills are due to finish on 20 February. If Russia withdraws its troops after that, it could be a sign that Moscow is serious about reducing its military build-up around Ukraine's borders. Away from the politicking, we've got a Eurovision Song Contest development to bring you. Alina Pash, Ukraine's Eurovision singer, has been ""suspended"" from competing at May's competition in Turin. Ukraine's national broadcaster UA:PBC took the actionafter it was revealed that authorities are investigating a 2015 trip she made to Crimea, an area Russia seized control of in 2014. There are strict travel rules in place over how people enter Crimea. It's not illegal for Ukrainians to visit but it can be frowned upon. Alina has provided authorities with proof of how she entered the region but that's now being scrutinised. While investigations continue, Alina says some people claim she's un-Ukrainian. ""I'm a Ukrainian girl. I'm talking in Ukrainian and my song is about Ukraine,"" she explains. We've now got some details of the phone call held between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia's Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov. A statement from the foreign ministry in Moscow says Lavrov stressed the need for ""pragmatic dialogue over the entire range of issues raised by Russia"". He also told Blinken that ""aggressive rhetoric"" inflated by Washington was unacceptable. But said it was necessary to continue ""joint work"". Websites including the Ukrainian defence ministry and the banks PrivatBank and OshadBank have been subject to a cyber-attack, the Russia's Tass news agency reports. The Ukrainian cybersecurity centre has said Russia could be to blame for the attack, according to Tass. The website of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has also been affected, the Unian news agency reports. Ukrainian websites have been affected by cyber-attacks before with Russia denying any involvement. Helen CattBBC political correspondent UK MPs have been briefed by the Defence
Secretary Ben Wallace this afternoon on the current situation around Russia and
Ukraine. It's understood he repeated the government's
assessment that it was not convinced Russia was standing down despite reports
of troops moving away That's because he said there had been an
uptick in other activity such as stepping up the preparedness of field
hospitals. He apparently warned that, while Russia
could launch an invasion within hours, it wasn't beyond the realms of possibility
that the current situation continues for weeks or months. He's also said to have told them that he
believes that President Putin has still not decided whether to launch an
invasion or not. Wallace is also said to have confirmed that UK troops who were involved in
training in Ukraine are now back in the UK. The UK should ""not believe anything that's coming out of Moscow"", the chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee has said. Earlier today, Russia said some troops positioned on the border with Ukraine were returning to their bases. But Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: ""[Russia] have lied and lied and lied and, surprisingly, are continuing to lie."" Addressing whether Russia would invade Ukraine, he said:
""Only one person knows and he ain't speaking. And that's Vladimir
Putin. We're dealing with a one-man band here."" Tugendhat says Russia's foreign ministry is ""simply
the barking dog outside the house of a mafia don... It's just there to make a
noise"". Viktoriia ZhuhanBBC Ukrainian, Kyiv ""When I see Maxar [satellite] imagery prove the Russian troops' withdrawal, I will believe,"" says mother-of-three Alina Fediai-Zyrianska, from her home in a suburb of Kyiv. Her family were planning to launch a new business this month. But that has been put on hold because of their growing fears of war. Alina is critical of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, but her feelings about the news of Russia withdrawing echo the reaction from authorities there. Mykhailo Podoliak, from the president's office, tells the BBC that state bodies need to assess the scale of the withdrawal in order to confirm if the situation is ""getting back to normal"". Yesterday, Zelensky published yet another video to reassure the nation and call for unity. Such messages are welcomed by his supporters, but some are keen to stress that a grassroots resistance is being formed, regardless of any official statements. Alina says the president's address didn't lift her spirits. Instead, she keeps tracking website FlightRadar open - watching American drones and British planes fly over Ukraine's borders has a soothing effect, she says. This video can not be played We heard earlier from UK PM Boris Johnson, who said tough sanctions were ready to go if Russia invaded Ukraine. Now Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said there needs to be a ""very tough line on sanctions"" from the government after today's Cobra meeting. He says this is important so that Russia ""knows there will be serious consequences"" for any action it chooses to take against Ukraine and called on ""allies to stand together in the face of Russian aggression"". He says ""it's not entirely clear what's happening on the border"". More diplomatic talks to de-escalate tensions over Ukraine are under way between the US and Russia. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia's Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov are on the phone, according to the US state department. We're also hearing that US President Joe Biden will speak on the phone later with France's President Emmanuel Macron. Western military analysts say they need more information
to judge the significance of Russia's movement of some troops back from the Ukrainian border. Henry Boyd of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London tells Reuters news agency: One should maintain an air of cautious scepticism. There have been past discrepancies between Russia's official announcements and its actions on the ground.  Many of the Russian forces in Belarus for drills - due to end on Sunday - have come from thousands of miles away in Russia's central and eastern military districts. Rob Lee, a military analyst who specialises in Russia, tells Reuters the announcement was ""potentially good news"" but it was important to see where those forces went after the culmination of joint exercises between Russia and Belarus. As long as that remains nearby, Russia will have the capacity to conduct a significant escalation, though possibly not on as short notice.  Konrad Muzyka, director of the Poland-based Rochan consultancy, tells Reuters it would take several days to verify the latest moves via satellite imagery. It should also be noted that new trains with equipment from central Russia keep on arriving near the border and that Russian forces continue to move towards staging areas. The announcement stands in a direct opposition to what Russia has been doing for the past few days.  President Putin and German Chancellor Scholz held talks earlier today The news conference by Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has now finished so here's a summary of the main points: Orla GuerinBBC international correspondent, Mariupol If the shops are anything to go by, it's business as usual in the
port city of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine, even though the Russian border is
only 50km (31 miles) away. We found customers ambling through the well-stocked
aisles of one local supermarket. There was no panic buying and no
shortages. Tatiana, aged 74 - who was carefully perusing the sausage
selection - was adamant that fellow Slavs would not attack Ukraine. ""The
invasion is just in our heads,"" she told me. ""Nobody is going to invade.
Nobody will beat their brothers."" The tension may now be easing somewhat, but eastern Ukraine has already
been a battleground for the past eight years. Kremlin backed separatists are dug in
about 15km for Mariupol.  War is already part of the landscape. Some
here say - quietly - that they are now afraid of a much bigger conflict, but
there's no hint of an exodus. Close to the border we saw no sign of trouble on the horizon. The
only thing coming down the road from the Russian border were tractors, not
tanks. But Moscow's designs on Ukraine are a long-term project. People spend time at the coast of Mariupol in Ukraine despite the cold weather Putin is asked about the expansion of Nato. The Russian president says over the last 30 years we've been told there would be no expansion of Nato at all, yet today we see infrastructure ""right on our doorstep"". Putin queries when Ukraineâs Nato membership would be accepted. Ukraine hasn't even started an application process, and experts say the country is far from being in a position to do so. ""We need to resolve this question now, we need to resolve this question over the course of these negotiations,"" he says. ""We hope very much our concern will be heard by our partners and taken seriously."" Russia's core demand now is for the West to guaranteeUkraine will not join Nato, a defensive alliance of 30 countries. Asked about Nord Stream 2, Chancellor Scholz says Germany has made a commitment to ensuring gas transportation in Europe functions. He says Germany wants to make sure there will not be war over Ukraine as this would have ""far reaching consequences"". President Putin has accused Ukraine of committing acts of genocide against areas held by the Moscow-backed rebels in the eastern Donbas region. ""In our view what is now happening in Donbas is genocide,"" he tells the news conference. Putin has made similar accusations before in reference to the issue of discrimination against Russian speakers beyond its borders, many of whom live in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. In December he said that Russophobia was the first step towards genocide. His claims have been
dismissed as propaganda. A bit more from Scholz. He says he wants Vladimir Putin to send his negotiators with a âpositive mandate so we can achieve progressâ. The German chancellor adds âsecurity can only be achieved with Russia, not against Russia.â He says Nato and Europe are united in thinking that a solution must be found, no matter how difficult. We all need to be brave and responsible in our actions, he says. Scholz adds âwar has become unthinkable in Europe and we have to make sure it stays that wayâ.  President Putin is asked if he can exclude the possibility of war in Europe. He references Chancellor Scholz's earlier comments that his generation cannot imagine war in Europe - but points out the continent has seen war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s, which he claims was initiated by Nato. Putin says Russia does not want war and so has put forward proposals to start a negotiation process - but he says there has been no constructive response to Russia's proposals. However, he adds that there are still issues put forward by Nato and the US which could be discussed. We're hearing from German Chancellor Olaf Scholz too. He says the troop build-up on the Ukraine border is seen as a threat and is ""incomprehensible"". He demands ""de-escalation"" in the region and says it's important that ""no war will follow"". Scholz says territorial integrity is ""non-negotiable"" and it's his wish that there is dialogue. Talks must not come to a ""dead end"", he adds. President Putin says basic requirements have not been met by Nato and that it has an obligation not to strengthen its security at the expense of other countries. However, he says he is prepared to discuss the issues of European security and missiles. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Criminals are deploying ""psychological tactics"" to con people out of cash amid a rise in scams, Barclays bank says. The tricks include creating illusions of product scarcity or pretending to be an authority to ""socially engineer"" victims, the bank's chief behavioural scientist Dr Pete Brooks warned. He said scammers used dating apps to target people over weeks in some cases to establish ""emotional connections"". Dr Brooks added they preyed on people's biases and personality traits. He told the BBC although the types of scams hadn't changed over decades, criminals were becoming more sophisticated and could use ""many more channels"" to target people. Using dating apps as an example, Dr Brooks said scammers would connect with people they matched with, develop a relationship over time, and then exploit people's personality traits to get them to transfer them money. ""Most of us by default are trusting,"" said Dr Brooks. Dr Brooks said so-called ""purchase scams"", where goods bought online don't exist or never arrive, were the most common type. He said such crimes involved fraudsters creating a ""perceived scarcity and therefore 'value' in what they are selling to motivate consumers to act quickly and not rely on their better judgment"". This might be advertising something as a one-time offer, he added, or a product with a limited-edition price or availability, or ""rushing us into buying something that 'has' to be bought now - even if you've never seen the product in real life"". Barclays said the average amount a person loses through purchase scams totalled Â£980; however, research found scams targeting people investing led to the most money being lost. Figures showed a 17% rise in all reported scams in the last three months, while attempts at conning people increased by 70% in the final three months of 2021. Impersonation scams, Dr Brooks said, involved criminals exploiting a trait found in more than two-thirds of Brits surveyed, as being more likely to comply with a request if they believed it to be from a well-known institution, such as a bank, the police or the NHS. ""In these situations, scammers will harness that sense of authority to instil fear in their victims,"" he said. ""Perhaps suggesting their bank account has been compromised, they are overdue a payment or that they will be fined if they do not pay the full amount. Psychologically, many of us will take these at face-value if they're coming from what we believe to be a reputable institution."" Fraudsters steal Â£4m a day as crime surges 'We lost nearly Â£10k to TV licence scammers' Meanwhile, investment scams, Barclays said, saw a victim lose on average Â£15,788 the last three months of 2021. Dr Brooks said scammers were ""experts at exploiting the fact people want to grow their assets, and that we can sometimes put our better judgement aside for a high return opportunity"". Barclays said that was reflected in its research, with three in 10 people admitting they would be willing to go with an investment or savings provider they'd never heard of if they thought the returns would be higher than their existing provider. Barclays said real phone calls from a bank will never ask customers to share their pin number or security information or to transfer money to a ""safe account"". The bank said its advice was ""always to question whether something appears too good to be true, and not to be afraid to be suspicious"". But it warned ""worryingly"", almost a third of 2,002 people it polled admitted they ""wouldn't know what to do if they found themselves being targeted"".

"Tennis star Novak Djokovic tells the BBC he is willing to forfeit future trophies rather than get vaccinated against Covid In an exclusive interview, the world number one says he does not want to be associated with the anti-vaccination movement but that he supports the individual's right to choose Djokovic was deported from Australia in January after losing a last-ditch attempt to stay in the country and compete at the Australian Open US tennis legend Pam Shriver says Djokovic's continuing refusal to take a coronavirus vaccine is 'terrible for tennis' Meanwhile, Tim Henman says Djokovic's decision to miss out on trophies 'speaks volumes to his conviction' BBC research has cast doubt on the timing of the positive Covid test Djokovic used to enter Australia. The Serb authorities insist they were valid You can watch the whole interview in a BBC One special programme and iPlayer at 20:30 GMT on Tuesday (UK only) Edited by Jasmine Taylor-Coleman We'll soon be winding down the live coverage of reaction to Novak Djokovic's exclusive interview with the BBC's Amol Rajan: If you're just joining us and would like to catch up, here are the key headlines: Sports psychologist Bradley Busch has some interesting thoughts on the mindset of elite athletes in relation to theDjokovic interview. He says thereâs something about the nature of sportsmen and sportswomen that makes them more likely to follow âalternative remediesâ. Athletes at the top of their sport are âconstantly searching for this extra 1%â. Busch saysâsurvivorship biasâcomes into play. They are very fit and healthy individuals and decisions they have made have paid off in their career, so itâs easy for them to fall into this âbubbleâ that makes them believe they âknow better than modern medicineâ. But Busch wonders if Djokovic's single-mindedness ""might be part of his downfall over the next future years"". Having heard the views of experts, supporters and opponents of Novak Djokovic on our exclusive interview, we can now hear from the man himself. Writing on Twitter, Djokovic says he is grateful for the ""opportunity to answer questions"" from the BBC's Amol Rajan and to ""set the record straight"". He also thanks fans for their support and patience in the weeks since the controversy over his participation in the Australian Open began. Allow Twitter content?

As people have been reacting to Novak Djokovic interview today, many have been questioning his denial that he is an anti-vaxxer and his attempts to distance himself from that movement. People on social media have pointed out that, whatever the tennis star claims about his views on vaccines, he does publicly oppose Covid jabs and has engaged in spreading anti-vaccination messages.

Let's remember, more than 60% of the world's population - 4.8 billion people - have received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine. All of the approved Covid-19 vaccines have undergone rigorous testing - including large clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people - and continue to be closely monitored. Guy De Launey, BBC Balkans Correspondent Serbian tabloid Blic said Djokovic's comments 'shocked' Amol Rajan The
first interview by Novak Djokovic since his Australian misadventure is making
headlines in all main news outlets in his home country of Serbia. The
Blic tabloid makes much of BBC interviewer Amol Rajan asking the tennis player
âWhy, Novak, why?â as Djokovic insists that he would rather miss defending his
French Open and Wimbledon titles than have a vaccine against Covid-19. Blic
says this declaration âcompletely shocked the journalistâ. The
more upmarket Danas leads with the line that the worldâs top male player would
âsacrifice trophiesâ because of his beliefs. And the state broadcaster, RTS,
headlines with Djokovicâs assertion that âI am not anti-vaccineâ. Serbian
people are already well aware of their sporting iconâs strict approach to
nutrition and lifestyle. But their interest
may be piqued by the playerâs denial that there was anything amiss regarding
his Covid test certificates. Last
week, police arrested a dozen people, including doctors and nurses, for their
involvement in issuing counterfeit documents. Earlier this month, prosecutors
said they had investigated Djokovicâs coronavirus certificates and found no evidence
that they were manipulated. Russell FullerTennis correspondent Novak Djokovic says he âsincerely hopesâ
international Covid regulations will soon change, and certainly within Europe,
travelling is becoming easier for the unvaccinated. His
chances of playing in the French Open and at Wimbledon have improved in recent
days. Under current rules, the unvaccinated no longer need to isolate on
arrival in France if they have travelled from another EU country. Djokovic is
now resident in Spain. And
even though there are more stringent testing requirements for unvaccinated
arrivals in England, the need to quarantine has also been removed. But
the United States remains a serious problem for Djokovic. Vaccination
certificates are compulsory, and there are few exceptions. So
the world number one is likely to miss next monthâs prestigious tour events in
Indian Wells and Miami, and could face further problems in late summer. A
string of tournaments take place in the US in August in the run up to the US
Open, which is the final Grand Slam of the year. In his exclusive interview with the BBC, Novak Djokovic flatly denied reports that there had been efforts to tamper with his positive Covid test in December. His denial follows discrepancies revealed by the BBC that have cast doubt over the exact timing of his positive coronavirus test. Documents submitted to a federal court in Australia during the Serb's deportation hearings included two Covid (PCR) test certificates, one with a positive result on 16 December and one with a negative result on 22 December. But researchers have highlighted that the earlier test had a higher confirmation code than the later one, suggesting that the tests were out of sync. The findings raise questions as to whether Djokovic would have been granted his initial medical exemption. Serbian authorities have also denied that there were any issues with the 34-year-old's test and stated that the tests were authentic. Read more BBC's analysis here. Shaimaa KhalilBBC News, Melbourne Iâm outside Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne Park where Novak
Djokovic was hoping to defend his Australian Open title in January. He made headlines when he arrived in Australia and when he was deported - and
now in his comments about this whole saga, Novak Djokovic has addressed
the Australian people and acknowledged their frustration and anger. There was a great deal of that the moment he announced he was coming
with a vaccine exemption in January. Social media was alight with comments -
many argued that they had endured long and strict lockdowns and had been
required to get the vaccine in order to travel and reunite with their families. Djokovic said he wasnât given special treatment and that he followed
the rules. But Immigration Minister Alex Hawke based his decision to deport
Djokovic not on the rules but on whether his presence would incite anti-vax
sentiment. Djokovic has distanced himself from the anti-vax movement, despite
the protests against vaccine mandates at the time that essentially used him as
a symbol. In their interview, Djokovicwas asked by the BBC's Amol Rajanwhat he would say to anti-vaccination protesters who have adopted him as a figurehead. ""I say that everyone has the right to choose to act and say
whatever they feel is appropriate for them,"" he said. ""I have never said I am part of that
movement. No-one in the whole process, during Australian saga has asked me for
my stance or opinion on vaccination. No-one. ""So I could not really express what
I feel and what my stance is, neither in the legal process or outside, so it is
really unfortunate that there has been this misconception and wrong conclusion made
around the world based on something I completely disagree with."" As we've already reported today, some commentators have pointed out that he does have popular social media profiles, which he has used to share other information. Mike WendlingBBC Trending A Djokovic supporter displays an anti-vaccination mandate sign at a gathering outside his hotel in Melbourne in January Novak Djokovic says heâs not an anti-vaxxer and in the interview
distances himself from the anti-vaccine movement. He says itâs a âmisconceptionâ that he was ever on the side
of hardcore anti-vaxxers â even as they celebrated him as a hero. The tennis star frames his refusal of a Covid vaccination in
terms of personal choice. He wants ultimate control of what goes into his body. That is an argument routinely seen on the most active anti-vaccine
groups, particularly on the messaging app Telegram. But itâs just one of a
hodgepodge of points that regularly makes the rounds. Others - including far
more emotive false posts about sinister global plots and mass deaths - have less
to do with individual liberties and are based purely in pseudoscience. So perhaps itâs not surprising that, in the most conspiracy-addled
groups, so far there hasnât been a huge reaction to Djokovicâs interview. But perhaps the nuance in the world number oneâs
argument will have made him less of a hero to that part of the crowd. Of course, vaccination status is not just an issue for tennis - it is causing many top sports teams and athletes to alter their plans. The Premier League said earlier this month that 80% of its players had been double jabbed, but the minority that haven't are unable to travel to some overseas ties. European champions Chelsea have been facing being without some of their squad for next month's Champions League last-16 match tie away to Lillebecause of French government rules. Kyrie Irving, one of the stars of the NBA basketball league in the United States, has a similar problem, but with his team's home matches. Irving plays for the Brooklyn Nets and New York laws ban unvaccinated people in indoor venues. ""I stay rooted in my decision. It's not going to be swayed just because of one thing in this NBA life,""said Irving in January. Bayern Munich footballer Joshua Kimmich initially opted against vaccination, but, after contracting the virus and suffering some damage to his lungs, revised his opinion. ""Maybe I had to go through what I have now gone through first,""he told ZDF. ""Of course, looking back, I would like to make the vaccination decision earlier, but at the time it wasn't possible for me."" Allow Twitter content?

Daily Mirror associate editor and political commentator Kevin Maguire remains unconvinced by Novak Djokovic's stance. The only requirements to travel to England without being fully vaccinated are tests before and after arrival and a completion of a whereabouts form. French Open organisers said in January that there would be no exemption to allow unvaccinated players to compete. The All England Club, which stages Wimbledon, are yet to announce their own rules. The US tennis legendPam Shriverhas told the BBC that Novak Djokovic's continuing refusal to take a coronavirus vaccine is ""terrible for tennis"". The 22-time doubles Grand Slam doubles champion told 5 Live Breakfast that while it was good to hear Djokovic's rationale for his refusal to take the jab, and noted that we must be ""understanding"" of those who are reluctant to take the jab, she said the interview also raised several questions. âWill he really truly have an open mind to have a vaccine at
a later date?â, Shriver asked. âI hope that the right trusted person, who is an expert in
science and medicine, probably would have to be a Serbian, can sit him down and show him, and walk him through all of the steps that make the science
and the medicine trustworthy and safe to put in his body.â âBecause itâs terrible for tennis, not good for him â and,
really, he does lead. The fact that he doesnât trust it, it does lead a lot
of people, in his own country and throughout the world.â In the interview Djokovic says he should not be associated with the anti-vax movement, but instead supports an individual's right to choose to have a jab. While many support the tennis star's right to choose, medical experts stress the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people, and any vaccine will have to pass rigorous safety tests before being rolled out to the wider population. So what are the risks of having a Covid jab and how are vaccines approved for use?Read more here.  There is unlikely to be any bar on Novak Djokovic playing at Wimbledon according to Tim Henman, who is on the committee of the All England Club who organise the tournament. ""I donât think so,"" Henman told BBC Radio 4 when asked if he foresaw any issue with Djokovic playing at this year's Wimbledon in June. ""To get into the UK at the moment, those
are the guidelines the Championship will be following at this stage. ""At this moment in time it is going to be government-led."" Current rules require visitors to England to be tested before and after arrival and to complete a whereabouts form, but not to quarantine or be vaccinated. Djokovichas told the BBCthat he would skip Wimbledon if the tournament insisted all players must be vaccinated. Six-time Grand Slam semi-finalistTim Henmanhas been giving BBC Radio 4 his reaction toNovak Djokovic's interview. ""I do understand his concerns. I would reiterate it is
absolutely his prerogative to have the vaccine or not. As a former player and a
tennis fan, it was probably not what I wanted to hear in that interview, but probably
what I expected. As he freely admitted, he is going to
be severely restricted as to where he can travel to and therefore play without
being vaccinated. ""By taking himself out of the chance to compete in Grand Slams he is certainly jeopardizing his chances of being the greatest male player of
all time and I think that speaks volumes to his courage, conviction and belief
that this is what is best for him. ""You would have thought that very little is
going to sway his opinion.""

If you need a reminder, here is a quick refresher of how the saga played out:  Ralph Rogers, a sports medicine consultant who was in a Covid bubble with the NBA basketball league in
the United States, has been talking to BBC Radio 4 about Djokovic's stance on vaccination. ""If those are his convictions, then those are his
convictions,"" says Rogers. ""He has a choice and then, based on that choice, other people have
a choice not to allow him to play. So I think it is quite simple. ""As he said
point blank, he is not an anti-vaxxer. His mind is open, and he is looking for
a solution. So maybe his facts are incorrect, I think his facts are incorrect,
but I hope he comes to the right conclusion in the future. ""He is a
great competitor a great tennis player and we would like to see him play."" Novak Djokovicsays he remains open to the possibility of taking a Covid vaccination,if he can be convinced that it is the right choice for him. ""I keep my mind open, there is always the possibility that things will change in the future,"" he told the BBC's Amol Rajan. ""As of today, this is my decision and stance for it and I will suffer the consequences of not travelling to the tournaments, but hopefully things will be able to change in the future. We will see what happens."" Former Daily Telegraph chief sports writer Paul Hayward says he believes a Djokovic-less Wimbledon is a price most people would be willing to pay for effective anti-Covid restrictions.

"Diplomatic efforts continue to try to halt a possible Russian invasion, but Moscow denies it is planning to attack The US and UK leaders have said not all hope is lost for a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine crisis but warned the situation remained fragile. In a 40-minute call, Joe Biden and Boris Johnson agreed a deal was still possible despite a chorus of warnings of imminent Russian military action. Russia has always denied plans to invade Ukraine, despite massing more than 100,000 troops on the border. On Monday its foreign minister said diplomacy was ""far from exhausted"". As part of diplomatic efforts to ward off a possible invasion, Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz is to meet Russia's President Vladimir Putin later on Tuesday. After being criticised for a slow initial response, Mr Scholz met the Ukrainian president in Kyiv on Monday, saying there was ""no reasonable justification"" for the Russian military build-up. EXPLAINER:Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? ANALYSIS:Five ways out of conflict ON THE GROUND:A Ukrainian city unifies against Russia's threats More than a dozen nations have urged their citizens to leave Ukraine, and the US has said aerial bombardments could begin ""at any time"". But in their conversation, Mr Biden and Mr Johnson said there remained a ""crucial window"" for diplomacy and for Russia to step back from its threats towards Ukraine, according to a Downing Street statement. ""The leaders emphasised that any further incursion into Ukraine would result in a protracted crisis for Russia, with far-reaching damage for both Russia and the world,"" the statement added. Mr Johnson reportedly said that the UK was prepared to do everything it could to help, to which Mr Biden responded: ""We're not going anywhere without you pal."" Mr Johnson is expected to hold a Cobra meeting on Tuesday to discuss the UK's response to the pressures. This video can not be played Watch: The 78-year-old Ukrainian grandmother preparing for a Russian invasion In a defiant speech,externalto the nation on Monday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky declared 16 February - a date cited by US officials as a possible day on which Russia could attack - a ""day of unity"", and praised the strength of the Ukrainian military. ""We have something to respond with. We have a great army... this is an army many times stronger than eight years ago."" But he said he wanted to resolve all issues through negotiations and diplomacy. The Ukrainian president ended his speech on an optimistic note: ""Now you may think it's darkness all around. But tomorrow the sun will rise again over our peaceful sky.""

Russia has granted citizenship to more than 700,000 people in Donbas And asked whether there was a chance for agreement with the West, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the ""possibilities are far from being exhausted, they certainly should not continue indefinitely, but I would suggest continuing and ramping them up"". Mr Lavrov's comments, made in a meeting with Mr Putin, are being seen as a clear concession that talks could ease the tensions. But analysts say that without either side moving over the thorny issue of Ukraine potentially joining Nato, there is still deadlock. The Kremlin says it cannot accept that Ukraine - a former Soviet republic with deep social and cultural ties with Russia - could one day join Nato, and has demanded that this be ruled out.

"Home developers who refuse to pay the costs of removing unsafe cladding could have planning permission and projects blocked under government plans. New powers would also allow cladding companies to be sued and subject to fines for defective products. The proposed measures are part of a Building Safety Bill following the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017. People who are currently facing bills of thousands of pounds to fix their homes welcomed the move. Housing Secretary Michael Gove said it was ""time to bring this scandal to an end"". ""We cannot allow those who do not take building safety seriously to build homes in the future, and for those not willing to play their part they must face consequences,"" he said. The additions to the bill come after Mr Gove announced last month that no leaseholder living in a building higher than 11m - around four to six storeys high - ""will ever face any costs"" for fixing dangerous cladding. He said developers would be expected to pay their fair share to fix dangerous buildings, or face legal or tax changes. This video can not be played ""We are coming for you"" - Michael Gove's warning to firms that cut corners, sought to profiteer and mis-sold dangerous products Under the proposed laws, leaseholders would have up to 30 years to sue builders and product manufacturers for defects in England, but there are plans to extend it UK wide. At the moment it is six years. The courts would also be able to stop developers using ""shadowy shell companies"", the government said, ""which make them difficult to trace or identify who they are run by, so they can avoid taking responsibility for their actions"". Campaigners said the proposals were the ""most positive step forward we have yet seen in the building safety crisis"", but added ""many questions"" remained over costs for some leaseholders needing to fix fire safety defects other than cladding. ""The penny seems to have dropped with the government that leaseholders are the innocent party and that the polluters who caused this crisis must be the ones to pay to fix it,"" End Our Cladding Scandal said. The questions raised by campaigners emerged after the government said there would be a cap on the amount leaseholders would pay to fix safety defects other than dangerous cladding on blocks of flats. The cap will only apply to leaseholders where building owners do not have the resources to pay to fix any defects. Such costs may include fixing other building defects such as missing fire breaks or defective insulation, as well as fire patrols. Why is cladding unsafe and what is it costing residents? Unsafe cladding firms ordered to pay to fix homes The Department for Housing said the cap would be Â£15,000 for leaseholders in London and Â£10,000 in the rest of England. It confirmed developers that own buildings over 11m will still be required to pay the full costs of remedial works, while landlords linked to a developer and building owners, who are not linked to the developer but can afford to pay in full, will also be required to put up the money. It added any money paid out by leaseholders since the Grenfell Tower fire will count towards the cap amount. The BBC has asked the department how many leaseholders are estimated to come under the cap. The End Our Cladding Scandal campaign group questioned why leaseholders should ""have to pay to fix a problem for which they are in no way responsible?"" ""How is this fair? While these may seem small sums to ministers, they are enormous amounts to many ordinary people across the country - especially coming at a time of pay freezes, food price rises and energy cost hikes,"" it said. Andrew Parker, a partner at Forsters law firm which represents both developers and some leaseholder clients, told the BBC it would take ""many years"" to complete any remediation works. He said there was ""huge clamour"" to make buildings safe, but warned ""it's not going to be straight forward"". ""It's not at all obvious the best way to remediate these buildings,"" he said. ""It's not easy."" Mr Parker said the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire showed there was ""a lot of passing the buck"" between different sectors of the construction industry and there need to be discussions over the best way to make buildings safe. He added the developers his firm represents were on board with making their buildings safe, but questioned why the government had mentioned developers and manufacturers in its plans, but not contractors, engineers and designers who he said were ""equally culpable"". The cladding crisis has left many people with crippling bills to fix unsafe homes and there is still no help for the many buildings under 11m high with dangerous cladding. Removing cladding can cost millions of pounds per block, with the cost often being borne by individual flat owners, under the leasehold system in England and Wales. In the wake of the Grenfell fire, which killed 72 people, flammable cladding and other fire safety defects were discovered in hundreds of blocks of flats across the UK. Developers have argued that they met building regulations at the time and should not be liable for the cost of removing unsafe cladding However, some, such as housebuilder Taylor Wimpey, have already promised to foot the bill for issues at their buildings. Unsafe cladding firms ordered to pay to fix homes Taylor Wimpey allocates Â£125m for cladding repairs Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Criminals are deploying ""psychological tactics"" to con people out of cash amid a rise in scams, Barclays bank says. The tricks include creating illusions of product scarcity or pretending to be an authority to ""socially engineer"" victims, the bank's chief behavioural scientist Dr Pete Brooks warned. He said scammers used dating apps to target people over weeks in some cases to establish ""emotional connections"". Dr Brooks added they preyed on people's biases and personality traits. He told the BBC although the types of scams hadn't changed over decades, criminals were becoming more sophisticated and could use ""many more channels"" to target people. Using dating apps as an example, Dr Brooks said scammers would connect with people they matched with, develop a relationship over time, and then exploit people's personality traits to get them to transfer them money. ""Most of us by default are trusting,"" said Dr Brooks. Dr Brooks said so-called ""purchase scams"", where goods bought online don't exist or never arrive, were the most common type. He said such crimes involved fraudsters creating a ""perceived scarcity and therefore 'value' in what they are selling to motivate consumers to act quickly and not rely on their better judgment"". This might be advertising something as a one-time offer, he added, or a product with a limited-edition price or availability, or ""rushing us into buying something that 'has' to be bought now - even if you've never seen the product in real life"". Barclays said the average amount a person loses through purchase scams totalled Â£980; however, research found scams targeting people investing led to the most money being lost. Figures showed a 17% rise in all reported scams in the last three months, while attempts at conning people increased by 70% in the final three months of 2021. Impersonation scams, Dr Brooks said, involved criminals exploiting a trait found in more than two-thirds of Brits surveyed, as being more likely to comply with a request if they believed it to be from a well-known institution, such as a bank, the police or the NHS. ""In these situations, scammers will harness that sense of authority to instil fear in their victims,"" he said.

"Tennis star Novak Djokovic tells the BBC he is willing to forfeit future trophies rather than get vaccinated against Covid In an exclusive interview, the world number one says he does not want to be associated with the anti-vaccination movement but that he supports the individual's right to choose Djokovic was deported from Australia in January after losing a last-ditch attempt to stay in the country and compete at the Australian Open US tennis legend Pam Shriver says Djokovic's continuing refusal to take a coronavirus vaccine is 'terrible for tennis' Meanwhile, Tim Henman says Djokovic's decision to miss out on trophies 'speaks volumes to his conviction' BBC research has cast doubt on the timing of the positive Covid test Djokovic used to enter Australia. The Serb authorities insist they were valid You can watch the whole interview in a BBC One special programme and iPlayer at 20:30 GMT on Tuesday (UK only) Edited by Jasmine Taylor-Coleman We'll soon be winding down the live coverage of reaction to Novak Djokovic's exclusive interview with the BBC's Amol Rajan: If you're just joining us and would like to catch up, here are the key headlines: Sports psychologist Bradley Busch has some interesting thoughts on the mindset of elite athletes in relation to theDjokovic interview. He says thereâs something about the nature of sportsmen and sportswomen that makes them more likely to follow âalternative remediesâ. Athletes at the top of their sport are âconstantly searching for this extra 1%â. Busch saysâsurvivorship biasâcomes into play. They are very fit and healthy individuals and decisions they have made have paid off in their career, so itâs easy for them to fall into this âbubbleâ that makes them believe they âknow better than modern medicineâ. But Busch wonders if Djokovic's single-mindedness ""might be part of his downfall over the next future years"". Having heard the views of experts, supporters and opponents of Novak Djokovic on our exclusive interview, we can now hear from the man himself. Writing on Twitter, Djokovic says he is grateful for the ""opportunity to answer questions"" from the BBC's Amol Rajan and to ""set the record straight"". He also thanks fans for their support and patience in the weeks since the controversy over his participation in the Australian Open began. Allow Twitter content?

As people have been reacting to Novak Djokovic interview today, many have been questioning his denial that he is an anti-vaxxer and his attempts to distance himself from that movement. People on social media have pointed out that, whatever the tennis star claims about his views on vaccines, he does publicly oppose Covid jabs and has engaged in spreading anti-vaccination messages.

Let's remember, more than 60% of the world's population - 4.8 billion people - have received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine. All of the approved Covid-19 vaccines have undergone rigorous testing - including large clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people - and continue to be closely monitored. Guy De Launey, BBC Balkans Correspondent Serbian tabloid Blic said Djokovic's comments 'shocked' Amol Rajan The
first interview by Novak Djokovic since his Australian misadventure is making
headlines in all main news outlets in his home country of Serbia. The
Blic tabloid makes much of BBC interviewer Amol Rajan asking the tennis player
âWhy, Novak, why?â as Djokovic insists that he would rather miss defending his
French Open and Wimbledon titles than have a vaccine against Covid-19. Blic
says this declaration âcompletely shocked the journalistâ. The
more upmarket Danas leads with the line that the worldâs top male player would
âsacrifice trophiesâ because of his beliefs. And the state broadcaster, RTS,
headlines with Djokovicâs assertion that âI am not anti-vaccineâ. Serbian
people are already well aware of their sporting iconâs strict approach to
nutrition and lifestyle. But their interest
may be piqued by the playerâs denial that there was anything amiss regarding
his Covid test certificates. Last
week, police arrested a dozen people, including doctors and nurses, for their
involvement in issuing counterfeit documents. Earlier this month, prosecutors
said they had investigated Djokovicâs coronavirus certificates and found no evidence
that they were manipulated. Russell FullerTennis correspondent Novak Djokovic says he âsincerely hopesâ
international Covid regulations will soon change, and certainly within Europe,
travelling is becoming easier for the unvaccinated. His
chances of playing in the French Open and at Wimbledon have improved in recent
days. Under current rules, the unvaccinated no longer need to isolate on
arrival in France if they have travelled from another EU country. Djokovic is
now resident in Spain. And
even though there are more stringent testing requirements for unvaccinated
arrivals in England, the need to quarantine has also been removed. But
the United States remains a serious problem for Djokovic. Vaccination
certificates are compulsory, and there are few exceptions. So
the world number one is likely to miss next monthâs prestigious tour events in
Indian Wells and Miami, and could face further problems in late summer. A
string of tournaments take place in the US in August in the run up to the US
Open, which is the final Grand Slam of the year. In his exclusive interview with the BBC, Novak Djokovic flatly denied reports that there had been efforts to tamper with his positive Covid test in December. His denial follows discrepancies revealed by the BBC that have cast doubt over the exact timing of his positive coronavirus test. Documents submitted to a federal court in Australia during the Serb's deportation hearings included two Covid (PCR) test certificates, one with a positive result on 16 December and one with a negative result on 22 December. But researchers have highlighted that the earlier test had a higher confirmation code than the later one, suggesting that the tests were out of sync. The findings raise questions as to whether Djokovic would have been granted his initial medical exemption. Serbian authorities have also denied that there were any issues with the 34-year-old's test and stated that the tests were authentic. Read more BBC's analysis here. Shaimaa KhalilBBC News, Melbourne Iâm outside Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne Park where Novak
Djokovic was hoping to defend his Australian Open title in January. He made headlines when he arrived in Australia and when he was deported - and
now in his comments about this whole saga, Novak Djokovic has addressed
the Australian people and acknowledged their frustration and anger. There was a great deal of that the moment he announced he was coming
with a vaccine exemption in January. Social media was alight with comments -
many argued that they had endured long and strict lockdowns and had been
required to get the vaccine in order to travel and reunite with their families. Djokovic said he wasnât given special treatment and that he followed
the rules. But Immigration Minister Alex Hawke based his decision to deport
Djokovic not on the rules but on whether his presence would incite anti-vax
sentiment. Djokovic has distanced himself from the anti-vax movement, despite
the protests against vaccine mandates at the time that essentially used him as
a symbol. In their interview, Djokovicwas asked by the BBC's Amol Rajanwhat he would say to anti-vaccination protesters who have adopted him as a figurehead. ""I say that everyone has the right to choose to act and say
whatever they feel is appropriate for them,"" he said. ""I have never said I am part of that
movement. No-one in the whole process, during Australian saga has asked me for
my stance or opinion on vaccination. No-one. ""So I could not really express what
I feel and what my stance is, neither in the legal process or outside, so it is
really unfortunate that there has been this misconception and wrong conclusion made
around the world based on something I completely disagree with."" As we've already reported today, some commentators have pointed out that he does have popular social media profiles, which he has used to share other information. Mike WendlingBBC Trending A Djokovic supporter displays an anti-vaccination mandate sign at a gathering outside his hotel in Melbourne in January Novak Djokovic says heâs not an anti-vaxxer and in the interview
distances himself from the anti-vaccine movement. He says itâs a âmisconceptionâ that he was ever on the side
of hardcore anti-vaxxers â even as they celebrated him as a hero. The tennis star frames his refusal of a Covid vaccination in
terms of personal choice. He wants ultimate control of what goes into his body. That is an argument routinely seen on the most active anti-vaccine
groups, particularly on the messaging app Telegram. But itâs just one of a
hodgepodge of points that regularly makes the rounds. Others - including far
more emotive false posts about sinister global plots and mass deaths - have less
to do with individual liberties and are based purely in pseudoscience. So perhaps itâs not surprising that, in the most conspiracy-addled
groups, so far there hasnât been a huge reaction to Djokovicâs interview. But perhaps the nuance in the world number oneâs
argument will have made him less of a hero to that part of the crowd. Of course, vaccination status is not just an issue for tennis - it is causing many top sports teams and athletes to alter their plans. The Premier League said earlier this month that 80% of its players had been double jabbed, but the minority that haven't are unable to travel to some overseas ties. European champions Chelsea have been facing being without some of their squad for next month's Champions League last-16 match tie away to Lillebecause of French government rules. Kyrie Irving, one of the stars of the NBA basketball league in the United States, has a similar problem, but with his team's home matches. Irving plays for the Brooklyn Nets and New York laws ban unvaccinated people in indoor venues. ""I stay rooted in my decision. It's not going to be swayed just because of one thing in this NBA life,""said Irving in January. Bayern Munich footballer Joshua Kimmich initially opted against vaccination, but, after contracting the virus and suffering some damage to his lungs, revised his opinion. ""Maybe I had to go through what I have now gone through first,""he told ZDF. ""Of course, looking back, I would like to make the vaccination decision earlier, but at the time it wasn't possible for me."" Allow Twitter content?

Daily Mirror associate editor and political commentator Kevin Maguire remains unconvinced by Novak Djokovic's stance. The only requirements to travel to England without being fully vaccinated are tests before and after arrival and a completion of a whereabouts form. French Open organisers said in January that there would be no exemption to allow unvaccinated players to compete. The All England Club, which stages Wimbledon, are yet to announce their own rules. The US tennis legendPam Shriverhas told the BBC that Novak Djokovic's continuing refusal to take a coronavirus vaccine is ""terrible for tennis"". The 22-time doubles Grand Slam doubles champion told 5 Live Breakfast that while it was good to hear Djokovic's rationale for his refusal to take the jab, and noted that we must be ""understanding"" of those who are reluctant to take the jab, she said the interview also raised several questions. âWill he really truly have an open mind to have a vaccine at
a later date?â, Shriver asked. âI hope that the right trusted person, who is an expert in
science and medicine, probably would have to be a Serbian, can sit him down and show him, and walk him through all of the steps that make the science
and the medicine trustworthy and safe to put in his body.â âBecause itâs terrible for tennis, not good for him â and,
really, he does lead. The fact that he doesnât trust it, it does lead a lot
of people, in his own country and throughout the world.â In the interview Djokovic says he should not be associated with the anti-vax movement, but instead supports an individual's right to choose to have a jab. While many support the tennis star's right to choose, medical experts stress the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people, and any vaccine will have to pass rigorous safety tests before being rolled out to the wider population. So what are the risks of having a Covid jab and how are vaccines approved for use?Read more here.  There is unlikely to be any bar on Novak Djokovic playing at Wimbledon according to Tim Henman, who is on the committee of the All England Club who organise the tournament. ""I donât think so,"" Henman told BBC Radio 4 when asked if he foresaw any issue with Djokovic playing at this year's Wimbledon in June. ""To get into the UK at the moment, those
are the guidelines the Championship will be following at this stage. ""At this moment in time it is going to be government-led."" Current rules require visitors to England to be tested before and after arrival and to complete a whereabouts form, but not to quarantine or be vaccinated. Djokovichas told the BBCthat he would skip Wimbledon if the tournament insisted all players must be vaccinated. Six-time Grand Slam semi-finalistTim Henmanhas been giving BBC Radio 4 his reaction toNovak Djokovic's interview. ""I do understand his concerns. I would reiterate it is
absolutely his prerogative to have the vaccine or not. As a former player and a
tennis fan, it was probably not what I wanted to hear in that interview, but probably
what I expected. As he freely admitted, he is going to
be severely restricted as to where he can travel to and therefore play without
being vaccinated. ""By taking himself out of the chance to compete in Grand Slams he is certainly jeopardizing his chances of being the greatest male player of
all time and I think that speaks volumes to his courage, conviction and belief
that this is what is best for him. ""You would have thought that very little is
going to sway his opinion."" This video can not be played Watch: Novak Djokovic's visa drama in 90 seconds For almost two weeks last month the world was gripped by the unfolding drama of Novak Djokovic's battle with Australian authorities. If you need a reminder, here is a quick refresher of how the saga played out:  Ralph Rogers, a sports medicine consultant who was in a Covid bubble with the NBA basketball league in
the United States, has been talking to BBC Radio 4 about Djokovic's stance on vaccination. ""If those are his convictions, then those are his
convictions,"" says Rogers. ""He has a choice and then, based on that choice, other people have
a choice not to allow him to play. So I think it is quite simple. ""As he said
point blank, he is not an anti-vaxxer. His mind is open, and he is looking for
a solution. So maybe his facts are incorrect, I think his facts are incorrect,
but I hope he comes to the right conclusion in the future. ""He is a
great competitor a great tennis player and we would like to see him play."" Novak Djokovicsays he remains open to the possibility of taking a Covid vaccination,if he can be convinced that it is the right choice for him. ""I keep my mind open, there is always the possibility that things will change in the future,"" he told the BBC's Amol Rajan. ""As of today, this is my decision and stance for it and I will suffer the consequences of not travelling to the tournaments, but hopefully things will be able to change in the future. We will see what happens."" Former Daily Telegraph chief sports writer Paul Hayward says he believes a Djokovic-less Wimbledon is a price most people would be willing to pay for effective anti-Covid restrictions.

"Criminals are deploying ""psychological tactics"" to con people out of cash amid a rise in scams, Barclays bank says. The tricks include creating illusions of product scarcity or pretending to be an authority to ""socially engineer"" victims, the bank's chief behavioural scientist Dr Pete Brooks warned. He said scammers used dating apps to target people over weeks in some cases to establish ""emotional connections"". Dr Brooks added they preyed on people's biases and personality traits. He told the BBC although the types of scams hadn't changed over decades, criminals were becoming more sophisticated and could use ""many more channels"" to target people. Using dating apps as an example, Dr Brooks said scammers would connect with people they matched with, develop a relationship over time, and then exploit people's personality traits to get them to transfer them money. ""Most of us by default are trusting,"" said Dr Brooks. Dr Brooks said so-called ""purchase scams"", where goods bought online don't exist or never arrive, were the most common type. He said such crimes involved fraudsters creating a ""perceived scarcity and therefore 'value' in what they are selling to motivate consumers to act quickly and not rely on their better judgment"". This might be advertising something as a one-time offer, he added, or a product with a limited-edition price or availability, or ""rushing us into buying something that 'has' to be bought now - even if you've never seen the product in real life"". Barclays said the average amount a person loses through purchase scams totalled Â£980; however, research found scams targeting people investing led to the most money being lost. Figures showed a 17% rise in all reported scams in the last three months, while attempts at conning people increased by 70% in the final three months of 2021. Impersonation scams, Dr Brooks said, involved criminals exploiting a trait found in more than two-thirds of Brits surveyed, as being more likely to comply with a request if they believed it to be from a well-known institution, such as a bank, the police or the NHS. ""In these situations, scammers will harness that sense of authority to instil fear in their victims,"" he said. ""Perhaps suggesting their bank account has been compromised, they are overdue a payment or that they will be fined if they do not pay the full amount. Psychologically, many of us will take these at face-value if they're coming from what we believe to be a reputable institution.""

"The payment will go to all households in council tax bands A to D, plus those in the council tax reduction scheme in all tax bands Most households in Wales will receive a Â£150 payment as part of plans to tackle the rising cost of living. The Welsh government said it would match the council tax rebate planned in England for homes in bands A to D. The payments in Wales will also be for people living in all bands who do not pay the tax, unlike across the border. The Bevan Foundation think tank said the money could have been targeted better to help those most in need. But Welsh Economy Minister Rebecca Evans said a million households could benefit from the scheme. This year's Â£200 winter fuel payment scheme will also be repeated next year, as part of a Â£330m package of measures. Nick Davies (back right) has taken on extra work as a football referee to help top up the family funds Sammy Davies, 33, lives with her husband Nick and two children in Newtown, Powys. The family have switched to purchasing food from a cheaper supermarket, reduced their TV package and changed energy supplier after calculating their energy bill would increase by a minimum of Â£70 a month. ""It's kind of like our income comes in one hand and it's going straight out the other to cover for food, childcare and living costs"", she said. ""So we don't really have anything extra that we can take the kids away for a weekend for a treat."" The older people's commissioner for Wales said current plans meant tens of thousands of older people in Wales living on the lowest incomes would miss out. Age Cymru said its adviceline dealt with a record number of inquiries in January with some older people asking for help about energy and benefits entitlement. Charity chief executive Victoria Lloyd said the concern was the extra payments ""won't go far enough with the rising cost of energy bills"". ""People are telling us that this could be the straw that breaks the camel's back,"" she toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. Welsh Labour ministers said their plans go further than those announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak for England earlier this month. Sunak defends response as energy bills soar by Â£693 What help with bills is there in my council tax band? Rebecca Evans said Mr Sunak's offer ""fell short of what people needed"". But HM Treasury said Wales was ""receiving Â£180m in relation to the council tax rebate alongside the Â£200 energy bill discount"" as a result of UK government funding. ""This is on top ofspending review 2021providing the Welsh government with the biggest annual funding settlement since devolution,"" it said. The Â£150 payments to homes in bands A to D in England were part of a set of measures the chancellorset out in response to the rise in the energy cap. A Â£200 discount on electricity bills for homes in October, paid back over five years, will apply in Wales and Scotland as well as England. The Welsh government will match the England council tax rebate, providing a Â£150 payment to all properties in council tax bands A to D, which covers the majority of homes. But those who are in the council tax reduction scheme in all tax bands will also get the payment, unlike in England where individuals who do not pay council tax would not receive the rebate. Citizens Advice Cymru had warned that 230,000 households in Wales would not have benefited from a rebate similar to the UK government's in England. The money will be paid as soon as possible, and will cost ministers Â£152m. A total of 73.3% of residential properties are rated as being in bands A to D for council tax. The Welsh government said it will work with councils to provide more detail on how the scheme will operate. The Discretionary Assistance Fund will also be extended to a wider group of people At a Welsh government briefing Ms Evans revealed that only half of households eligible for the winter fuel payment had applied. The scheme, which gives Â£200 to homes on working-age benefits, remains open until 28 February - applications should be made through local councils. Victoria Winckler, director of the Bevan Foundation, said: ""Nobody, I'm sure, will be disappointed to get the payment but when people are really, really struggling, I think it could have been targeted more effectively."" She said with 73% of households eligible, the money was ""spread very thin"". ""It could have given a Â£1 top-up every day for secondary school pupils who are on free school meals so they could buy breakfast or a snack,"" she toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""I think for the well-off people who happen to live in a band A to D home, it will be a meal out. I think for people on low incomes, it's four weeks shopping."" James Hall, from charity People and Work in Rhondda, said people who needed help often had to turn to the internet but had to chose between ""data and dinner"", so it was offering data sims to provide support. ""People are saying it is getting tougher by the day,"" he said. A further Â£25m will be provided so councils can offer help for specific families they know may be struggling. The chancellor's announcement triggered extra cash worth Â£180m, which became the subject of arowover the amount of money coming to Wales. Calls for Wales to copy English council tax rebate Sunak defends response as energy bills soar by Â£693 Most homes to get energy bill discount of Â£350 Older People's Commissioner for Wales, Helena Herklot said the payments did not go far enough. ""I am disappointed that despite my calls, and calls from a growing number of other organisations, for the Welsh government to widen the eligibility of its Winter Fuel Support Scheme, current plans seem to continue to exclude older people claiming pension credit,"" she said. ""This means that tens of thousands of older people in Wales living on the lowest incomes will miss out."" Sioned Williams, Plaid Cymru's spokesperson for Social Justice and Equalities, also welcomed the announcement, but said the ""broad brush approach of giving Â£150 to all households in council tax bands A-D is not the best way to ensure those who are in the most need, those who will be facing the choice between heating and eating, receive the most help"". Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said he was ""pleased to see the new money that has come from the Conservative UK government has been put to good use by Cardiff Bay ministers as Welsh Conservatives have been calling for. ""It is just a shame Labour couldn't help themselves and have a pop at British ministers who have led the way in finding a resolution to this."" The Welsh government's winter fuel payment scheme, which was recently doubled to provideone-off payments of Â£200to people on universal credit and other working-age benefits, will be re-run next winter. The Discretionary Assistance Fund, which helps people pay for essential costs such as food, gas, electricity, clothing or emergency travel, will also be extended to a wider group of people. Applications can be made on the Welsh government website. Ms Evans said: ""The chancellor's offer at the start of the month fell short of what people needed. We have been able to go above and beyond to provide Welsh households with more help in paying bills, heating homes and putting food on the table. ""In total we are more than doubling the equivalent support provided by the UK government for those who need it the most, reflecting our priority of creating a fairer Wales in which no-one is left behind."" The cost of living crisis is being fuelled by steep rises in the price of oil and gas as well as food. The struggle to make ends meet goes well beyond the poorest with many families, who had been managing, now on a tight budget. Around three-quarters of households in Wales will benefit from the Â£150 payments announced but it goes nowhere near covering the massive increases they have been in fuel bills. Giving financial support for everyday essential bills through council tax band is a blunt tool. It is dangerous to presume that patterns for income and house-size match. But it is at least a mechanism that the Welsh government has in its control.

"Siaosi Sovaleni told the BBC his people were still struggling in the aftermath of the disasters Tonga's Prime Minister Hu'akavemeiliku Siaosi Sovaleni says his island nation is trying to rebuild the lives of its people and not just its infrastructure, in the wake of the devastating volcanic eruption and tsunami. In an exclusive interview with the BBC, the Prime Minister said his people are still struggling to get over the traumatic experience. The devastation from the tsunami and the volcano is thought to have damaged about 18.5% of Tonga's GDP, which the Tongan leader called ""a big hit."" And while the financial costs are piling up, the mental health cost for his people is also formidable. ""Most of their houses were destroyed. The main thing is to actually make sure they are safe,"" he said. ""But relocation comes with its own challenges. It's not an easy choice - trying to decide whether you stay in a vulnerable place or move to a very new place - leaving behind all the memories. We're looking at whether we relocate them over here, or rebuild where they were. ""We recognise that even though we might start rebuilding some of the houses like next month or so, the mental side of it will take a bit longer."" It's only been a few months since Tonga's Prime Minister was appointed to the top job. Within weeks, he had to face a crisis on an unimaginable scale. Reliving the moment, the Tongan leader seemed visibly shaken by his memories. ""We were at home that night, and you know that explosion was like nothing - I mean I haven't heard something like that. It was terrible - and then all of a sudden, it was nightfall."" According to Nasa, the volcanic eruption in Tonga washundreds of times more powerfulthan the atomic bomb the US dropped on Hiroshima during World War Two. The eruption ""obliterated"" a volcanic island north of the Tongan capital Nuku'alofa, the agency said. Satellite view of the eruption of an underwater volcano off Tonga Tonga says more than four-fifths of the population has been affected by the tsunami and falling ash. ""Going through the tsunami that nightâ¦moving from daylight to darkness, in over half an hour because of the ash fall, we recognise that's a problem,"" he told me in an interview for the BBC's Newsday programme. The Tongan leader is also grappling with anoutbreak of Covid cases, which have stalled recovery and foreign aid efforts. The prime minister was adamant that the Covid cases had not come from foreign aid deliveries, as has been previously reported, but from the port instead. He added that the strict containment measures the island nation has taken to prevent Covid cases from rising is taking a toll on relief efforts. How to deliver aid safely to Tonga How the volcano cut off Tonga's access to money ""Right now we have 139 covid cases, that's over the last week,"" he told me. ""It would have been nice to actually have those extra handsâ¦to actually help us with some of the efforts,"" he told me over a Zoom line from his office. ""It definitely has some effect on how we are supporting the affected communities."" One of the countries that has been offering assistance, besides the US and Australia, has been China, which this week is sending warships with aid. Tonga owes more than a hundred million dollars in debt to China - a small amount for many countries, but for the poor Pacific island state, it's a fortune. ""We are discussing how we can move forward addressing the debt we have not just with China, but also our developing partners,"" he said.
