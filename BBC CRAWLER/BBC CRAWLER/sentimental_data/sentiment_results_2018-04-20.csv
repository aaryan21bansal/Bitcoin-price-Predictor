"This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK Theresa May has said that members of the Windrush generation who have been treated unfairly by the Home Office are to be compensated ""where appropriate"". The PM said money will be offered to resolve ""anxieties and problems"". Some immigrants who came to the UK from the Commonwealth decades ago have been threatened with deportation or refused jobs or healthcare. Labour MP David Lammy, who has led the campaign, said more detail on compensation was ""needed urgently"". He tweeted:,external""Compensation must be provided to anyone who has forked out for legal fees or has lost their job, their pension, benefits, access to healthcare or been detained, deported or refused re-entry back to the UK. ""That is justice."" What should Windrush generation do now? 'I'm an Englishman': Windrush stories Reality Check: Could you prove you've been living in the UK? On Thursday, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss,told BBC Question Timethat the government would ""look sympathetically"" at compensation requests from Windrush immigrants. Mrs May's first public mention of remuneration came at a news conference at the end of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (Chogm) in London on Friday. She said: ""On Tuesday, I met with Caribbean leaders, where I gave an absolute commitment that the UK government will do whatever it takes - including where appropriate payment of compensation - to resolve the anxieties and problems which some of the Windrush generation have suffered. ""These people are British, they are part of us, they helped to build Britain and we are all the stronger for their contributions."" More details on the plans are expected to be published within the next week. This video can not be played Windrush migrant Nick Broderick: 'I contemplated suicide' Grenada's Prime Minister Keith Mitchell has also called for ""serious"" compensation in light of the PM's speech, saying her mention of it it was ""highly significant"". He said: ""It's not just: 'I'm sorry.' People lost a lot, people suffered a lot of pain, and they must be given an opportunity to correct this - some serious compensation. ""If they've gone, then the families who have suffered too."" In Pictures: The Windrush generation Meanwhile the government has played down the significance of newly-discovered arrival records held by the National Archives holds on thousands of the Windrush generation. It said those documents - ships' passenger lists rather thanthe landing cards the Home Office destroyed in 2010- do not provide evidence of long-term residency in the UK which was ""key to demonstrating the status of the Windrush generation"". It will review any evidence to help resolve each case, the Home Office added. Immigration lawyer Adam Sinfield agreed the records would be of ""limited use"". He said: ""The ""biggest problem remains the bureaucracy of having to prove their (immigrants')continuous residency in the late '70s and early '80s"". A total of 286 people have contacted the Home Office since Monday, after the department set up a helpline to support those who had concerns about their migration status. So far, eight have been given permanent residence status. Are you part of the Windrush generation?  Will the National Archives locating the arrival records help your case?

"Mack is best known for playing the role of Chloe Sullivan on Smallville's decade-long run Allison Mack, a US actress known for the TV show Smallville, has appeared in court on charges of aiding a sex trafficking operation disguised as a mentoring group. Keith Raniere, the leader of the so-called self-help group, was arrested by the FBI in Mexico in March. Ms Mack is accused of helping him to recruit women who were then exploited ""both sexually and for their labour"", the New York prosecuting attorney said. She pleaded not guilty to all charges. At a brief hearing on Friday evening in a Brooklyn federal court, the judge ordered Ms Mack, 35, to be held in custody.   She will appear in court again on Monday. 'Sex-slave' group leader arrested by FBI The society was supposed to empower and strengthen the women who joined it, according to prosecutors. But they allege Mr Raniere oversaw a ""slave and master"" system in his group called Nxivm, where female members were expected to have sex with him and were branded with his initials. ""Allison Mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere,"" Richard Donoghue, US attorney for the Eastern District in New York, said in a statement. Keith Raniere was detained in Mexico, where he has reportedly been living for several months Prosecutors allege that Nxivm has the features of a pyramid scheme, in which members pay ""thousands of dollars"" for courses to rise within its ranks. ""Mack directly or implicitly required her slaves... to engage in sexual activity with Raniere,"" the statement from the attorney's office claims. ""In exchange for this, Mack received financial and other benefits."" If found guilty, both Ms Mack and Mr Raniere, who has been charged with sex trafficking and is being held without bail, face at least 15 years in prison. Allison Mack was a mainstay of the popular Superman series Smallville, which ran from 2001 to 2011. Within Nxivm, a smaller group called DOS - or Dominus Obsequious Sororium - was created. The quasi-Latin phrase roughly translates as Master Over the Slave Women. The group encouraged women to recruit new slaves ""who in turn owed service not only to their own masters, but also to masters above them"" in the pyramid scheme, prosecutors say. Mr Raniere, 57, is alleged to have stood at the top of that pyramid, as the only man, with Ms Mack at the top level of women, immediately below him. Investigators say Mr Raniere had a rotating group of 15 to 20 sexual partners, who were not allowed to discuss their relationship with him or have one with anyone else. Compliance was assured in part through the use of ""collateral"" which had to be provided when joining - which prosecutors said included damaging information about friends or family, nude photographs, or rights to assets. They allege that ""slaves"" in the group had to eat extremely low-calorie diets because of Mr Raniere's preference for thin women. ""Under the guise of female empowerment, [Ms Mack] starved women until they fit her co-defendant's sexual ideal, and she targeted vulnerable women,"" prosecutor Moira Kim Penza said at Friday's hearing. In late March, Smallville co-star, Kristin Kreuk was forced to deny rumours she had acted as a recruiter for Mr Raniere. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The existence of the group's darker side came to widespread attention in October 2017, when the New York Times published a story including interviews with former members and their families.

"Alfie Evans is in a ""semi-vegetative state"" in Alder Hey Children's Hospital The parents of terminally ill toddler Alfie Evans have lost the latest stage of their legal battle over his life support. Tom Evans and Kate James failed to persuade the Supreme Court that Alfie was being unlawfully detained at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool. The court also refused permission for the parents to appeal the decision. But Mr Evans said they would not give up and had made an ""urgent application"" to the European Court of Human Rights. Judges said,externalthe hospital must be ""free to do what has been determined to be in Alfie's best interests"". The Supreme Court has also approved a plan for withdrawing treatment and bringing the 23-month-old's life to an end. The judges said there was ""no reason for further delay"" and ""there will be no further stay of the Court of Appeal's order"". ""That is the law in this country. No application to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg can or should change that,"" they said. Tom Evans and Kate James want to take Alfie to Rome The couple had made another application to the Supreme Court after losing a second fight over Alfie at the Court of Appeal. They wanted to take Alfie - who has been suffering from an undiagnosed degenerative brain disease - to a hospital in Rome where he would continue to receive palliative care. Alfie's parents had already lost a first round of cases in the High Court, Court of Appeal, Supreme Court and European Court of Human Rights. Speaking outside Alder Hey, Mr Evans said: ""This is not justice. This is a cruel bureaucracy. ""We have instructed our lawyers to submit an urgent application to the European Court of Human Rights, and they have done so today. ""We will not give up. We will continue to fight, by all means available to us within the law, to save our son's life."" Who is Alfie Evans and why are his parents back in court? Alfie Evans hospital 'scary' to visit Hundreds protest at Alfie Evans hospital The Supreme Court justices said: ""Alfie looks like a normal baby, but the unanimous opinion of the doctors who have examined him and the scans of his brain is that almost all of his brain has been destroyed. ""No-one knows why. But that it has happened and is continuing to happen cannot be denied. ""It means that Alfie cannot breathe, or eat, or drink without sophisticated medical treatment. It also means that there is no hope of his ever getting better."" Earlier this week Mr Evans flew to Rometo meet Pope Francis and begged him to ""save our son"". A statement issued by Alder Hey reiterated today's Supreme Court ruling, adding: ""We understand that this decision is very distressing for Alfie's family at this very difficult time."" Andrea Williams, chief executive of the Christian Legal Centre, which is now representing Alfie's family, said: ""We are going to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights hoping we can stay the end-of-life order our courts have made. ""We are appealing today because we have got to act quickly. The parents are devoted parents."" Ms Williams added: ""It is one thing to argue any medical treatment is futile, it is quite another thing to say someone should die because their quality of life is futile.""

"The Queen had given her backing to Prince Charles replacing her as Commonwealth head The Prince of Wales will succeed the Queen as head of the Commonwealth, its leaders have announced. The Queen had said it was her ""sincere wish"" that Prince Charles would follow her in the role. Leaders of the Commonwealth have been discussing the issue at a meeting behind closed doors at Windsor Castle. The head role is non-hereditary so is not automatically passed on when the Queen dies, with suggestions it might have rotated among the 53 leaders. In a statement, the leaders said they ""recognise the role of the Queen in championing the Commonwealth and its people"". Prime Minister Theresa May and Canadian PM Justin Trudeau had earlier given their backing to Prince Charles. Speaking at a news conference marking the end of the summit, Mrs May praised the Queen for her ""vision and duty"" in growing the Commonwealth from eight members to 53. She said it was ""fitting"" Prince Charles would succeed her due to his ""proud support"" of the Commonwealth ""for more than four decades"". Theresa May gave her backing to Prince Charles The leaders also agreed a ""blue charter"" to protect the ocean from pollution and climate change and a ""cyber declaration"" to combat online crime and threats. The meeting during a two-day summit involved 46 heads of Commonwealth governments and foreign ministers from the remaining seven countries. The Commonwealth represents about 2.4bn people, but critics say the organisation is so disparate that it struggles to know what it is for, BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said. He also said the news of the prince's appointment would be ""of great satisfaction"" to the Queen. Commonwealth: Seven things you might not know Reality Check: The nations where it is illegal to be gay Other issues under discussion in London have included trade between the countries with Mrs May saying the leaders agreed to ""fight protectionism"" to expand intra-Commonwealth trade to $2 trillion by 2030. The leaders' statement said they had set ""specific commitments"" which include building peace, promoting gender equality and tackling climate change. They also said they will work to prevent violent extremism and human trafficking, pledged to halve malaria in Commonwealth countries by 2023 and agreed that all boys and girls should receive at least 12 years of education by 2030. The Prime Ministers of New Zealand and Canada joined more than 40 other leaders at the meeting Meanwhile, thegovernment has indicated it would welcome Zimbabwe's re-entryto the Commonwealth after Robert Mugabe pulled the country out in 2003. Foreign secretary Boris Johnson said Zimbabwe's government has ""made impressive progress"" under Mr Mugabe's successor, Emmerson Mnangagwa, but the country would have to deliver ""free and fair elections"" for the people in July. Rwanda has been chosen to host the next summit in 2020. The meeting has been held at the Waterloo Chamber in Windsor Castle The role, currently held by the Queen, is largely a symbolic one and carries no maximum fixed term. It is used to unify the 53 member states and to ensure the core aims of the Commonwealth are fulfilled. These include linking the countries through trade and international co-operation. The head of the Commonwealth usually makes regular visits to the member states to foster these connections personally. A decision on all successive heads has to be made by the Commonwealth leaders. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth Secretary-General and the Secretariat, its central organisation, help to plan many Commonwealth activities.

"Julian Assange (L), the founder of Wikileaks, and Russia's President Vladimir Putin are both named in the lawsuit The Democratic Party in the US is suing Russia, the Trump campaign and the whistle-blowing website Wikileaks for conspiring to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. Documents filed in court allege that the campaign ""gleefully accepted Russia's help"" to win the election. President Donald Trump has repeatedly denied collusion, and Russia has also denied the allegations. The Trump campaign said the lawsuit was without merit and would be dismissed. ""This frivolous lawsuit is a last-ditch effort to substantiate the baseless Russian collusion allegations by a nearly-bankrupt Democratic Party still trying to counter the will of the people in the 2016 presidential election,"" a statement from the Donald J Trump for President campaign said. US intelligence agencies previously concluded Moscow had tried to sway the election in Mr Trump's favour. Several investigations into the matter are already under way. Trump Russia - the saga in 200 words Key questions answered in the Trump Russia affair Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The BBC's Nick Bryant in Washington says the lawsuit by the DNC is seen as a publicity stunt by many there, as it may not unveil anything that is not already being examined in other investigations - but could keep the matter in the public eye. The lawsuit, filed in a federal court in Manhattan, names senior Trump aides including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, strategist Roger Stone and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort as defendants, as well as the Wikileaks founder, Julian Assange. Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez said in a statement that the alleged hacking was ""an act of unprecedented treachery"" and ""an all-out assault on our democracy"". The Washington Post reports that foreign nations usually have immunity from US lawsuits,external, but Democrats argue the rule should not apply in this case because Russia trespassed on private party servers. This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation In May 2016 the first reports emerged of hackers targeting the Democratic Party. Over the next two months, the reports suggested US intelligence agencies had traced the breaches back to Russian hackers. In July, on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, Wikileaks published 20,000 internal emails stolen by the hackers. US intelligence officials said they believed with ""high confidence"" that Russia had been behind the operation but the Trump campaign publicly refused to accept the findings. Earlier on Friday,memos by ex-FBI director James Comey detailing his conversations with Donald Trump were published. He writes that he was asked by Mr Trump to drop an inquiry into links between his former national security advisor, Michael Flynn, and Russia.

"The Hwasong-18 missile uses solid fuel North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un plans to meet President Putin this month about potentially providing Moscow with weapons for its war in Ukraine, according to a US official. There are concerns that in return, North Korea may seek advanced weapons technology from Russia. North Korea has continued regular tests of its missiles this year, after a significant increase in tests carried out in 2022. North Korea has tested a variety of ballistic and cruise missiles in recent years. It's also tested hypersonic missiles, which can fly at several times the speed of sound and at low altitude to escape radar detection, as well as others launched from submarines. In April, North Korea tested what it called ""its most powerful"" missile to date - the Hwasong-18. It's a solid-fuel missile, which are generally quicker to launch than liquid-fuel ones. It reportedly flew about 1,000km on its maiden flight, but its true range is estimated to be in excess of 15,000km, according to the US-based CSIS Missile Defense Project. A second test launch in July 2023 saw a Hwasong-18 reach a claimed altitude of over 6,600km, with a flight time of 74 minutes. In November last year, an intercontinental ballistic missilewas tested at a high angle, short-range trajectory. Launched at a lower trajectory, this same missile could have reached the US mainland, according to the Japanese government. Images from North Korean state media of Kim Jong-un with his daughter at the launch appear to show it was the Hwasong-17 - or possibly a modified version of it. The missile is believed to have a range of 15,000km or more, and could potentially carry three or four warheads, rather than only one. Several earlier attempts to launch the Hwasong-17 are thought to have failed, althoughit may have been used in a test carried out in March 2022.,external In October last year, North Korea fired another type of missile which flew over Japan - thought to have been the intermediate-range Hwasong-12. This can travel up to 4,500km - putting the US island of Guam in the Pacific within range. North Korea has also been testing the Hwasong-14 ballistic missile with a range of 8,000km - although some studies suggest it could travel as far as 10,000km, making it capable of reaching New York. And there is the Hwasong-15 missile, which is believed to have a range of 13,000km, putting all of the continental US in its sights. North Korea tested a record number of missiles in 2022, including ones capable of reaching US territory. The last time North Korea tested a nuclear bomb was in 2017. The explosion at its Punggye-ri test site had a force, or ""yield"", of between 100-370 kilotons. A 100 kiloton bomb is six times more powerful than the one the US dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. North Korea claimed this was its first thermonuclear device- the most powerful of all types of atomic weapon. However, North Korea may be aiming to test a smaller type of nuclear warhead with similar explosive force, according to Joseph Byrne, research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. ""It seems they are now testing a new capability - a miniaturised warhead that can be fitted onto a range of missiles, including short-range missiles"" he says. North Korea says it simulated nuclear strike on South Six underground tests have previously been carried out at Punggye-ri. However, in 2018 North Korea saidit would shut the site down, because it had ""verified"" its nuclear capabilities. Some of the tunnels into the site were subsequently blown up in the presence of foreign journalists. However, North Korea did not invite international experts to verify if it had been put beyond use. In 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un made a promise to then-US president Donald Trumpthat North Korea would destroy all its nuclear material enrichment facilities. However, the UN's atomic energy agency, the IAEA, says satellite images suggest that North Korea has restarted the reactor which makes its weapons-grade plutonium. In September 2022, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said there were signs that a test site at Punggye-ri was open again.

"The meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Kim comes just months after the pair exchanged deeply personal insults US President Donald Trump has accepted an invitation to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, in what appears to be a breakthrough after months of insults, threats and mutual hostility. It could happen as early as May which leaves little time to get things organised, from venues to core negotiations. So it's perhaps not surprising that there are many questions about what happens next. The talks would be unprecedented, marking the first face-to-face meeting between sitting leaders of North Korea and the US.  Former US presidents have met North Korean leaders before, but they were all out of office at that point. ""The [significance of this] could almost be compared to President Nixon meeting China's Chairman Mao, to a lesser degree,"" analyst Michael Madden of the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins SAIS told the BBC. This video can not be played The unlikely triangle: Trump, Rodman and Kim Jong-un Not much. The White House has confirmed that Trump will meet Kim ""by May"", but an exact time and location is yet to be determined. According to Mr Madden, there's a ""speculative chance"" that the meeting might take place at the North Korean truce village of Panmunjom, which sits at the demilitarised zone between the North and the South. However, Dr John Park of the Korea Working Group says that he believes the meeting might instead be held ""in a neutral location"". This could be in China or elsewhere. Analysis: The political gamble of the 21st Century South Korea statement on Kim-Trump meeting in full Are North and South Korea friends again? This is the first time the US has been in direct talks with North Korea about its nuclear program since 2012. Kim Jong-un has never met another foreign leader until now, though he is scheduled to meet South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in April at Panmunjom. Denuclearisation will undoubtedly be the biggest issue that the meeting will hope to address. But while Mr Kim says he is ""committed to denuclearisation"", North Korea has not yet promised to abandon its nuclear weapons completely. ""The US will be pushing for total denuclearisation and South Korea has also said that it is their main objective,"" said Bruce Bennett, an analyst at the RAND Corporation. ""But it's important to remember that Mr Kim has said over and over again that they will not give up their nuclear weapons."" North Korea has rapidly advanced its nuclear missile programme Other points that might be brought up are: US pushing for Americans held in Pyongyang to be brought home, North Korea looking for recognition as a nuclear-capable state and a possible peace treaty being signed. ""A peace treaty would give North Korea reassurance and deprive them of one of the key rationales behind their nuclear program [that they have to defend themselves],"" said Mr Madden. But one of the terms of a potential peace treaty could be the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea, a move which could prove deeply problematic. ""I think Mr Kim anticipates that if a peace treaty is signed, that after say 10 years most of the US troops in South Korea could be withdrawn,"" said Mr Bennett. ""Then maybe if later on he then wanted to forcefully reunify South Korea, [it would be easier] as the US troops would be gone. This would be the safest way to reach his objective."" Analysts agree that it is hard to predict the extent to which sanctions will be lifted or eased, adding that it is dependent on how successful the talks are. ""North Korea is definitely looking for sanctions relief, that will be a key demand of theirs,"" said Mr Bennett. ""The question is, would we lift sanctions in an incremental manner or are we going to insist on total denuclearisation before we lift?"" Mr Bennett also believes that the harsh sanctions placed on North Korea had real effect in bringing them to the table. ""There were reports that North Korea was going to possibly run out of hard currency by this October. So I think the campaign was really causing some pain in the North."" A successful meeting would see an ""agreement"" being signed by all parties, according to Mr Madden. ""If they can reach a point that has certain tangible achievements, like North Korea agreeing to a freeze in nuclear test activities and letting international inspectors in to the country to view their nuclear facilities that would be a success,"" said Mr Madden. But Mr Bennett argues that it is more likely that both sides would reach a compromise where they had ""given things up but also gained"". ""The worst case scenario is North Korea walking out of talks and claiming it's because Trump is being totally unresponsive and the US is being difficult,"" said Mr Bennett. South Korean delegates had earlier met Mr Kim in Pyongyang But a more plausible scenario is the US and North Korea simply failing to make any progress at all. ""I call it the 'kick the can down the road' policy, we just delay discussing this until further down the line with another US President,"" said Mr Bennett. ""By say 2030, North Korea could have 200 nuclear weapons and what happens then if they force the South to surrender? If we kick the can again we're going to have a bigger problem a few years down the road.""

"A man in the UK who caught the world's ""worst-ever"" case of super-gonorrhoea has been cured. Sexual health doctors say he was ""very lucky"" and the case was a ""major wake-up call for everybody"". He picked up the superbug having sex with a woman in South East Asia, despite having a British partner. It was the first-ever case of the infection being incurable with first choice antibiotics, but now two similar cases have been reported in Australia. The original case came to light last monthand was linked to travel earlier in the year. The main antibiotic treatment - a combination of azithromycin and ceftriaxone - failed to treat the disease. A detailed analysis of his infection suggested one last antibiotic might work and he hassince been treated with ertapenem,external. Dr Gwenda Hughes, the head of sexually-transmitted infections at Public Health England, said: ""We are pleased to report that the case of multi-drug resistant gonorrhoea has been successfully treated."" The public health body launched an investigation to track down any further cases - including in his British partner - but says the superbug has not spread in the UK. Discussions between Public Health England, the World Health Organization and the European Centres for Disease Control agreed this was the most serious case of antibiotic-resistant gonorrhoea ever detected. But now two ""similar"" cases have been discovered in Australia. One also had sex in South East Asia, the other reported no foreign travel. Dr Hughes said they will be ""challenging"" to treat and were a ""timely reminder"" to everyone that super-gonorrhoea is likely to be more common in the future. The disease is caused by the bacteriumNeisseria gonorrhoeae. The infection is spread by unprotected vaginal, oral and anal sex. Symptoms can include a thick green or yellow discharge from sexual organs, pain when urinating and bleeding between periods. However, vaginal and rectal infections often have no symptoms. An untreated infection can lead to infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease and can be passed on to a child during pregnancy. Dr Olwen Williams, the president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, said the case was a ""major wake-up call for everybody"". She told the BBC: ""He was very lucky that he still had one remaining antibiotic that was used successfully. ""Our concern is in the future there might be no antimicrobials that will work."" She said people needed to be aware that the risk of picking up superbugs is higher in countries that use antibiotics less carefully. Antibiotics are available to buy over the counter in many countries around the world, unlike in the UK where a prescription from a doctor is needed. It means the drugs are likely to be overused, driving up rates of resistance. Dr Williams said: ""We have to be aware when we travel that is potentially what we pick up. ""If you have unsafe sex anywhere in the world, get checked out when you come back before having sex with other partners."" She also warned cuts to sexual health services were hitting ""in a world where have to tackle multi-drug resistant gonorrhoea and rising incidence of syphilis"" and that was a ""significant concern"".

"The Juke is one of the models made at Nissan's Sunderland plant Nissan is to cut hundreds of jobs at its Sunderland car plant, as diesel sales decline. The carmaker builds its Qashqai and Juke models at the north-eastern England site, where it employs 7,000 people. As well as a fall in the demand for its diesel cars, the job losses relate to a switch in production to newer models. The job cuts follow those at Jaguar Land Rover, which last week said it would shed 1,000 contract staff. A Nissan spokesman said: ""As previously communicated, we are transitioning to a new range of powertrains over the next year. ""As we make the operational changes required to support this, we will be managing a planned short-term reduction in powertrain supply and plant volumes at NMUK in line with our 2018 Business Plan. We are now discussing these operational changes with our employees."" Employees will be offered a financial package and the chance to be retrained if they choose to leave. Across the UKdemand for diesel vehicles fell by a thirdin the first three months of this year. Nissan said it expected production volumes to recover as it begins to make the new models. In 2016, following the vote to leave the European Union, Nissan confirmed it would build new models at its Sunderland plant, the largest vehicle production site in the UK. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it was ""working with the industry to ensure that the UK is at the forefront of new automotive technologies and remains the destination of choice for future investment"". Unite's acting national officer Steve Bush said the union was working with Nissan ""to minimise job losses associated with a short-term reduction in volumes at the carmaker's Sunderland plant"". ""Going forward we expect to see temporary workers at the plant move into permanent positions as volumes pick up again in future years,"" he said.

"Men still receive an average of Â£28 more a week in state pension than women despite reforms starting to narrow the gap, analysis suggests. A retired man typically receives Â£154 a week, compared to Â£126 a week for women, according to Which?. The consumer group studied official data two years after the introduction of the new state pension. One architect of the new pension said the gender gap would be effectively eliminated within a decade. Nearly 13 million people in the UK receive the state pension. ""Many pensioners will be shocked by the differences in average payouts to men and women and those qualifying under the old and new systems. Some pay gaps will close eventually, but not soon enough for some,"" said Harry Rose, editor of Which? Money. The new state pension was introduced in April 2016 and has been paid to new pensioners since then. Existing pensioners continued under the old scheme. The government's long-term aim is simplification, stripping away extras such as the second state pension, but it will also become cheaper, in time, for the government. The system was also designed to halt penalties affecting the state pension of women who took career breaks to look after young children, the self-employed, or those who stopped work to become carers. These groups now see credits on their National Insurance record that usually mean they qualify for the full state pension. Check the state pension calculator,external The Which? analysis found that, among the 546,000 people who receive the new state pension, the typical man received Â£152 a week and the typical woman received nearly Â£144 - a gap of Â£8 a week. The difference is primarily the result of millions of people still receiving add-ons to the basic state pension that they had built up during their working lives, such as the state second pension which was based on earnings. When the reforms were introduced, the government vowed that nobody would lose any of the pension they had already built up. Former pensions minister Sir Steve Webb, who was heavily involved in the reforms, said that it may take another 10 years for the gap to be eliminated. ""The new state pension has been designed to treat men and women equally. Someone with 35 full years in the new system will get exactly the same pension, whether they are male or female,"" he said. ""But, in moving to the new system, it was necessary for transitional rules to honour the typically larger pensions that men had already built up by 2016, which explains the short-term differences in outcomes. ""This should not detract from the radical change which the new system brings, which will stop women being second-class citizens when it comes to state pensions."" The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: ""Around 650,000 women reaching state pension age in the first 10 years will receive an average of Â£8 per week (in 2015/16 earnings terms) more, due to the new state pension valuation of their National Insurance record. ""The statistics currently available on the new state pension are not yet sufficiently representative to draw robust comparisons between the old system and the new one.""

"Gamble made no reaction as he was sentenced but his mother wept in the well of the court A teenager who tricked his way into obtaining the email and phone accounts of senior US intelligence officials has been sentenced. Kane Gamble, 18, targeted CIA, FBI and US Department of Justice databasesfrom his bedroom in Leicestershire. The Old Bailey was told Gamble, who has admitted a number of charges, damaged the ""effectiveness"" of the wider law enforcement community. He will serve two years at a youth detention centre. Live updates from the East Midlands His defence said he was ""naive"" and never meant to ""harm"" any individuals. But the judge, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said Gamble ran a ""campaign of cyber terrorism"". Gamble obtained ""extremely sensitive"" documents on military and intelligence operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the court was told. Using a computer in his bedroom, Gamble accessed and released thousands of security staff details Between June 2015 and February 2016, he targeted the former CIA chief John Brennan and FBI deputy director Mark Giuliano from his home in Linford Crescent, Coalville. The judge was told he impersonated his victims and conned call centres into divulging confidential information. He then sent emails from agents' accounts and accessed sensitive military information. Gamble also leaked some of the information he gathered using various websites including WikiLeaks. Gamble targeted the former director of the CIA John Brennan The court was told Gamble uploaded details of 20,000 FBI employees obtained from the US Department of Justice, with the message ""This is for Palestine"". He bragged ""this is so serious I'm shaking"" and ""this has to be the biggest hack ever"". He even managed to use the TV in the house of then US Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson to post the message ""I own you"". The teenager also left a disturbing voicemail message for Mr Johnson's wife, Susan DiMarco asking ""hi spooky, am I scaring you?"". Kane Gamble posted the message ""I own you"" on Jeh Johnson's home TV Gamble - the founder of hacking group, Crackas With Attitude (CWA) -pleaded guilty in October to 10 charges. Prosecutor, John Lloyd-Jones QC highlighted the level of sophistication and persistence in the attacks, as well as the damage caused. Defending, William Harbage QC said Gamble, who is on the autistic spectrum, was ""naive"" and ""childish"" and his actions were a response to what he had read about in online chat rooms about US policy. Mr Harbage said the teen thought he could get them to change ""as a result of what he was doing from his bedroom"". Gamble accessed the home phone and internet of James Clapper, ex-Director of National Intelligence Mr Harbage had argued for a suspended sentence, saying Gamble was due to sit GCSEs in June and hoped to read computer studies at university and pursue a ""useful"" career.

"This video can not be played Thousands gathered in Stockholm on Saturday to remember Swedish DJ Avicii The death of Swedish DJ Avicii, whose supreme knack for uplifting, melodic pop-house hits made him one of the world's biggest dance producers, has left fans and fellow musicians in deep shock. He was just 28. He headlined arenas, notched up billions of streams and worked with some of the biggest names in music, but suffered health problems and struggled with life on the road. Born Tim Bergling in Stockholm in 1989, his mother is the actress Anki Liden, who starred in Lasse Hallstrom's Oscar-nominated film My Life as a Dog. He once said he was shaped by the Swedish pop sensibility.,external""We grow up singing great folk songs, so the sense of melody is good, and you grow up with that in you. I think it moulds everybody. ""But I also grew up knowing people like Eric Prydz and Swedish House Mafia were in the same neighbourhood."" Fellow DJ Pete Tong spotted Avicii when he entered a talent competition a decade ago. The Swede won by a landslide and Tong released the entry - titled Manman - on his own label. ""Clearly he had a very strong talent for constructing a melody and showed great maturity in the way he put a track together,""Tong told the Evening Standard in 2014,external. ""A natural. My only regret is that I didn't sign him on a longer deal."" After making his name with a string of singles, Avicii's popularity exploded with the song Levels in 2011. The song combines a pulsating, euphoric hook with a sample of Etta James' Something's Got a Hold on Me, and reached platinum status in at least 10 countries. That success snowballed with dancefloor anthems like I Could Be The One with Nicky Romero and the country-tinged Wake Me Up, featuring the vocals of Aloe Blacc - both UK number one singles in 2013. Avicii had a range of influences he could reach for, but his biggest hits had the same elements - insistent, escapist house production; guest vocals to lend accessibility and depth; and, above all, irresistible melodies. When it was suggested that he didn't make ""real music"", he told the Standard: ""You are drawing the melodies, drawing the chord progressions. You are making music. Mozart wrote everything down on a piece of paper. DJs write on computers. I really don't see any difference."" The hits kept coming - in the form of songs like Hey Brother, You Make Me, The Nights and Waiting For Love. As Billboard magazine wrote,external: ""Even when he's being cheesy, it's the kind of cheese you wanna cover your fries in and just give yourself heartburn shoving down your own throat."" Avicii headlined festivals and became the first EDM DJ to pull off a worldwide arena tour, earning $19m in 2015, according to Forbes. Big-name collaborations saw him work with Coldplay, Rita Ora, Sia, Lenny Kravitz, Leona Lewis and Robbie Williams. Last year, he was reported to have been working with disco legend Nile Rodgers on Chic's comeback album. And high-profile gigs included the 2014 World Cup closing ceremony and the wedding of Sweden's Prince Carl Philip. In 2012, the DJ embarked on a 27-date US House for Hunger tour, pledging $1m for the hunger relief charity Feeding America. ""I discovered when I started making money that I didn't really need it,"" he once said. ""When you have such an excess of money you don't need, the most sensible, most human and completely obvious thing is to give to people in need."" He also supported other causes. In 2015, he tackled the issues of human trafficking and gang violence when he directed the videos for his tracks For a Better Day and Pure Grinding. ""All the songs have a story I wanted to tell,"" Avicii said. Avicii's health problems began in January 2012, when he spent 11 days in hospital with acute pancreatitis, reportedly caused by heavy drinking. ""Drinking became routine for me, but it's impossible to keep up touring and drinking at the same time, because you are going to crash,"" he told the Standard. ""Especially when you are playing 320 shows a year.' He went back into hospital in 2013 and was advised to have his gallbladder removed. He declined and continued touring, butwas forced to have the surgery in 2014. Doctors discovered his appendix had ruptured, and removed that at the same time. ""I took a month off, but it wasn't really a month off,""he told Billboard,external. ""I was in the studio 12 hours a day, and then went right back to touring. It's hard to say no in this industry. You want to play everything and be everywhere."" Despite his health problems, the announcement in 2016 that he was retiring from touring still came as a shock. ""To me it was something I had to do for my health,""he told the Hollywood Reporter,external. ""The scene was not for me. It was not the shows and not the music. It was always the other stuff surrounding it that never came naturally to me. ""I'm more of an introverted person in general. It was always very hard for me. I took on board too much negative energy, I think."" After the announcement, he said he had got his ""private life back"" and was ""focusing on myself for the first time in a long time"". ""This was obviously the hardest decision of my life so far,"" he said. ""But so far it has paid off tremendously in terms of well-being for me. I'm happier than I have been in a very very long time."" His final gig was in Ibiza in August 2016, and he released a comeback EP in August 2017.

"Gamble made no reaction as he was sentenced but his mother wept in the well of the court A teenager who tricked his way into obtaining the email and phone accounts of senior US intelligence officials has been sentenced. Kane Gamble, 18, targeted CIA, FBI and US Department of Justice databasesfrom his bedroom in Leicestershire. The Old Bailey was told Gamble, who has admitted a number of charges, damaged the ""effectiveness"" of the wider law enforcement community. He will serve two years at a youth detention centre. Live updates from the East Midlands His defence said he was ""naive"" and never meant to ""harm"" any individuals. But the judge, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said Gamble ran a ""campaign of cyber terrorism"". Gamble obtained ""extremely sensitive"" documents on military and intelligence operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the court was told. Using a computer in his bedroom, Gamble accessed and released thousands of security staff details Between June 2015 and February 2016, he targeted the former CIA chief John Brennan and FBI deputy director Mark Giuliano from his home in Linford Crescent, Coalville. The judge was told he impersonated his victims and conned call centres into divulging confidential information. He then sent emails from agents' accounts and accessed sensitive military information. Gamble also leaked some of the information he gathered using various websites including WikiLeaks. Gamble targeted the former director of the CIA John Brennan The court was told Gamble uploaded details of 20,000 FBI employees obtained from the US Department of Justice, with the message ""This is for Palestine"". He bragged ""this is so serious I'm shaking"" and ""this has to be the biggest hack ever"". He even managed to use the TV in the house of then US Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson to post the message ""I own you"". The teenager also left a disturbing voicemail message for Mr Johnson's wife, Susan DiMarco asking ""hi spooky, am I scaring you?"". Kane Gamble posted the message ""I own you"" on Jeh Johnson's home TV Gamble - the founder of hacking group, Crackas With Attitude (CWA) -pleaded guilty in October to 10 charges. Prosecutor, John Lloyd-Jones QC highlighted the level of sophistication and persistence in the attacks, as well as the damage caused. Defending, William Harbage QC said Gamble, who is on the autistic spectrum, was ""naive"" and ""childish"" and his actions were a response to what he had read about in online chat rooms about US policy. Mr Harbage said the teen thought he could get them to change ""as a result of what he was doing from his bedroom"". Gamble accessed the home phone and internet of James Clapper, ex-Director of National Intelligence Mr Harbage had argued for a suspended sentence, saying Gamble was due to sit GCSEs in June and hoped to read computer studies at university and pursue a ""useful"" career.

"More robust hoardings have begun to replace police cordons, including at The Mill pub Nine locations in Salisbury which are to be decontaminated following the poisoning of an ex-spy and his daughter have been surrounded by new barriers. The Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant are among the places deemed to be still at risk by government scientists. But officials say the city remains ""safe for residents and visitors"" and extra precautions need not be taken. The nerve agent Novichok is believed to have been used in liquid form to target Sergei and Yulia Skripal last month. Former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious on a bench in the Wiltshire city on 4 March. The British government says a military-grade Novichok nerve agent of a type developed by Russia was used in the attack, although Moscow denies any involvement. What happened to Sergei and Yulia Skripal? Who is Sergei Skripal? Yulia Skripal: No-one speaks for me The man who made Novichok The multi-million pound operation to decontaminate the locations is expected to take months. Officials from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), as well as council, police and health representatives, updated Salisbury residents on Thursday evening. Asked whether the chemical remained at a ""lethal"" level, Defra's chief scientific adviser Ian Boyd said it was still present at ""hotspots"" around the city. ""We have to make an assumption that in certain circumstances there will be relatively high concentrations, probably in very, very specific locations, which could be at levels that could be toxic to individuals."" ""We already know there are some high concentrations within those locations,"" he said. But on Friday, a Defra spokesperson urged people not to be concerned: ""As PHE (Public Health England) have stated, Salisbury is safe for residents and visitors. ""All work undertaken on each site will take appropriate measures to ensure that there is no additional risk to the public."" They added that there was ""no need to take any additional precautions"", with cordons in place ""to protect the public from any potential risk"". Different barriers have been erected at the restaurant where the Skripals ate on 4 March More robust hoardings have begun to replace police cordons around the Maltings area in the city centre, the Zizzi restaurant and the Mill pub. Residents were told the Bourne Hill building, home to Salisbury's police station and Wiltshire council's offices, will close for up to eight weeks from Friday. The evidence room and two lockers inside the station, sealed off after the 4 March attack, will be decontaminated. Deputy Chief Constable Paul Mills said it would be ""business as usual"" because they have moved to other sites in the city. By John McManus, BBC News Strolling by the river Avon in the centre of Salisbury in the sunshine, it's hard to imagine a stranger location for the international intrigue that's unfolded here since March. But the evidence for what's happened here is stark - in The Maltings area, hoardings went up overnight, replacing police tape. Wiltshire Council has acknowledged the hit that businesses here are taking. One B&B owner says she's had no bookings for weeks. And many traders say day visitors- in particular Americans who often stop en route to Stonehenge - have disappeared. Some hotel bookings, though, appear to have held up. But Salisbury won't be back to normal for several months. Locals are looking forward to getting their city back - and seeing the back of people like me. Other areas that will be decontaminated include two ambulance stations, a car compound and the home of Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who was left seriously ill after responding to the attack. Mr Skripal's home - where the highest concentration of military grade Novichok was found - will be the last site to be decontaminated. Yulia, 33, left hospital earlier this month.Her 66-year-old father is said to be recovering more slowly but is expected to eventually be discharged. The nerve agent does not evaporate or disappear over time, experts have said, and intense cleaning with caustic chemicals is required to get rid of it. Almost 200 military personnel will help with the decontamination work, which is expected to cost millions of pounds. The Russian ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, said the ""so-called decontamination"" was a means for destroying valuable evidence. He also claimed that the nerve agent must have been injected into the Skripals before investigators took blood samples from them. The name Novichok means ""newcomer"" in Russian, and applies to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. Novichok's existence was revealed by chemist Dr Vil Mirzayanov in the 1990s, via Russian media. He says the nerve agents were designed to escape detection by international inspectors. Novichok agents are liquids, although others are thought to exist in solid form and could be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder. Some of the agents are also said to be ""binary weapons"", meaning the nerve agent is typically stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients that are easier to handle. When these are mixed, they react to produce the active toxic agent which can cause convulsions, shortness of breath, profuse sweating and nausea. What happened to the Skripals? Who is Sergei Skripal?

"This video can not be played The DJ will be remembered for club hits like Levels, Wake Me Up and Hey Brother Swedish DJ Avicii, one of the world's biggest dance music stars, has died in Oman at the age of 28. Avicii's club anthems include Wake Me Up, Levels, and recently, Lonely Together with Rita Ora.

He announced his retirement from touring in 2016, partly because of the health problems. ""I know I am blessed to be able to travel all around the world and perform, but I have too little left for the life of a real person behind the artist,"" he said at the time.

That's not something that happens that often during a DJ set (who needs to see the stage anyway?) but it was a testament to Avicii's ability to enchant an audience. Confetti cannons and bass drops aside, his shows encapsulated the inclusive, everyone-welcome philosophy that led him to collaborate with Coldplay, Nile Rodgers and Antony and the Johnsons as well as bluegrass and metal musicians in the studio. That final show, at Ushuaia Ibiza, was a two-hour greatest hits set, featuring crowd pleasers like Levels and Wake Me Up alongside his remixes of Robyn and Dizzee Rascal. But the DJ, who famously let the cat out of the bag when he revealed most major DJs pre-programmed their sets (comments he later walked back), was also known for dropping unexpected, whimsical tracks into his performances. A bit of Smokey Robinson here; a dash of Chicago there. He approached it all with an energy and optimism that permeated his own recordings. It's no surprise he was one of the most beloved DJs on the circuit. More about Avicii on BBC Music To Billboard Magazine in 2016: ""When I look back on my life, I think: whoa, did I do that? It was the best time of my life in a sense. It came with a price - a lot of stress, a lot of anxiety for me - but it was the best journey of my life"" Post-retirement on his website: ""[Creating music], that is what I live for, what I feel I was born to do... The next stage will be all about my love of making music to you guys. It is the beginning of something new."" Prelude to music video for hit The Nights: ""When I was 16, my father said, 'You can do anything you want with your life, you just have to be willing to work hard to get it.' That's when I decided when I die, I want to be remembered for the life I live, not the money I make.""

"Leaders and representatives from across the Commonwealth are expected to come to London for the Coronation of King Charles III on 6 May. Some of these countries were previously in the British Empire, some are still British dominions, while others had no colonial links to Britain but have chosen to join the global club. Here are seven things you may not know about the Commonwealth. About 2.5 billion people - out of a global population of eight billion -live in the 56 Commonwealth countries,external. More than 60 per cent of the Commonwealth's population is aged 29 or under. Globally, a third of all young people aged between 15 and 29 live in Commonwealth countries. The biggest country by population is India, which accounts for about half of the total. Pakistan, Nigeria and Bangladesh are the next biggest countries by population, with the UK fifth. King Charles is the head of state in 14 Commonwealth countries - or realms - in addition to the UK. Most countries in the club are republics - withBarbados the last to remove the UK monarch as its head of state in 2021. Five countries - Lesotho, Eswatini (previously known as Swaziland), Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia and Tonga - have their own monarch. King Charles remains head of state in Australia, New Zealand and Canada, although for many years there has been an active movement in Australia in favour of becoming a republic. The country's central bank has announced thatCharles will not feature on Australia's new $5 note. What does the King do? Rwanda and Mozambique became members in 2009 and 1995 respectively,although neither were colonised by the British.,externalRwanda was previously under the rule of Germany and Belgium. Rwanda was colonised by Germany and Belgium, not the UK Former French colonies Gabon and Togo are the most recent joiners,becoming members in June 2022,external. Why ex-French colonies are joining the Commonwealth The club has also lost members. South Africa withdrew in 1961 after it was criticised by Commonwealth members for its apartheid policies. It became a member again in 1994. Pakistan was thrown out after a military coup in 1999, but was readmitted in 2004. Membership was suspended again between 2007 and 2008. Former president of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe took his country out in 2003 after its membership was suspended amid reports of election rigging. It applied for re-admission in 2018, but no decision has been reached. The last country to leave wasthe Maldives in 2016, but it re-joined in 2020. The Commonwealth makes up a quarter of the world's land mass. The giant of the group is Canada, the world's second largest country by area. India and Australia are huge too. The late Queen Elizabeth II and Duke of Edinburgh in Tuvalu in 1982 But many of the member countries are small - such as the Pacific island nations of Nauru, Samoa, Tuvalu and Vanuatu, and Antigua and Barbuda, and Dominica in the Caribbean. Thirty-three of the world's 42 small states are part of the Commonwealth. Prince Philip: The Vanuatu tribes mourning the death of their 'god' The UK is no longer the biggest economy in the Commonwealth, according to thelatest GDP numbers from the International Monetary Fund,external, with India overtaking it for the first time in 2022. The combined GDP of the 56 members is more than $13tn (Â£10.8tn). That's more than twice the size of Japan ($5tn, Â£3.75tn), but some way behind the US at $23tn (Â£17.2tn). Trade with the Commonwealth accounted for9% of the UK's total trade in 2021,external- around the same as the UK's total trade with Germany. The UK exported goods and services worth Â£62.6bn to the rest of the Commonwealth, while imports from member states totalled Â£58.2bn The modern Commonwealth was formed in 1949, after ""British"" was dropped from the name and allegiance to the Crown was removed. The Commonwealth heads of government in London in 1969 Only three people have been head of the organisation - King George VI, Queen Elizabeth II and King Charles III. It'snot a hereditary role,although the Commonwealthaccepted King Charles as its head in 2018, when he was Prince of Wales. The organisation is run from London by its secretary-general, currently Baroness Scotland. She was re-elected to a second term in June 2022,despite facing criticism from some member statesover her performance. The other founding members were Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, and Sri Lanka. The Commonwealth Charter was adopted in 2012, andcommits members to the values of democracy, gender equality, sustainable development and international peace and security,external. The Commonwealth has been criticised for being a post-colonial club and for having little influence in the modern world. Supporters argue the benefits which membership brings include developmental support and co-operation on international goals. Russia president Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting with the Commonwealth of Independent States Russia and a number of other former members of the Soviet Union set up the Commonwealth of Independent States in 1991. It aimed to coordinate economic, defence, immigration and foreign policy across the bloc, although this proved difficult in practice. Georgia withdrew in 2009 after Russia seized part of its South Ossetia territory. Ukraine withdrew its membership in 2018.

"Commonwealth members attend a heads of government meeting in Australia in 2011 Formerly known as the British Commonwealth, the Commonwealth of Nations is a loose association of former British colonies and current dependencies, along with some countries that have no historical ties to Britain. The modern Commonwealth has its roots in the Imperial Conferences of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when some of the colonies within the British Empire began to acquire greater autonomy. As some achieved self-government and varying degrees of independence from Britain, a new constitutional definition of their relationship with one another had to be found. It was only after the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947 that the Commonwealth acquired its modern shape. It dropped the word British from its name, the allegiance to the crown from its statute, and became an association for decolonised nations. The British monarch, however, remained the official head of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth had no constitution until it adopted its Charter in 2012, which commits members to 16 core values of democracy, gender equality, sustainable development and international peace and security. Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings (CHOGM) are held every two years to discuss issues of common interest. In between the summits, the London-based Secretariat - the Commonwealth's executive arm - takes responsibility for carrying out programmes agreed upon during the various meetings. The Secretariat is headed by a secretary-general. Head: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II Queen Elizabeth As head of the Commonwealth, the Queen is recognised by its members as the ""symbol of their free association"". The Queen attends Commonwealth summits and the Commonwealth Games, which are held every four years. Her advanced age means that she is no longer likely to attend on a regular basis if travel involves long distances, and may delegate the duty to her heir, Prince Charles. On every Commonwealth Day, the second Monday in March, the Queen broadcasts a message to all member countries. Secretary-general: Patricia Scotland The secretary-general acts as the chief executive of the Commonwealth and is elected by heads of government from among Commonwealth diplomats and foreign ministers for a maximum of two four-year terms.  The Commonwealth has been criticised for being a post-colonial club. But to its members it is a voluntary association of independent states in the business of promoting democracy, good government, human rights and economic development. It has also been criticised for having little influence. Indeed, the Commonwealth does not act as a bloc in international affairs and has little influence over non-members. The Commonwealth Games are a major event for the association However, its influence over its own members derives from the benefits which membership brings in developmental support and cooperation on international goals. Unlike the United Nations, Commonwealth members have no contractual obligations, but members commit themselves to the statements of beliefs set out in the Charter. In 1995 the Commonwealth set up a Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG), comprising eight ministers, whose function is to deal with governments that persistently violate Commonwealth principles. It can take such punitive collective measures as imposing economic sanctions or suspending recalcitrant members. However, the Commonwealth draws its main strength from its moral authority. Committed to racial equality and national sovereignty, it was the focus of the campaign against apartheid in the 1980s. In 1995 it suspended Nigeria's membership after the military regime there passed the death sentence on the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and other activists, and in 2000 it suspended Fiji after the overthrow of the elected government. Zimbabwe was suspended in March 2002, after elections which observers said were marred by violence and intimidation. In December 2003 the suspension was extended indefinitely. The Zimbabwean government responded by announcing the country was leaving the Commonwealth for good. Pakistan was suspended twice during the military rule of President Pervez Musharraf. In 2013 The Gambia announced its withdrawal from what it called a ""neo-colonial institution"". Membership of the Commonwealth brings some practical benefits through the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation (CFTC). This is the main way in which the Commonwealth promotes economic and social development and the alleviation of poverty.

"Kamala Harris has been a vocal supporter of LGBTQ rights US Vice-President Kamala Harris who is on a tour of three African countries - Ghana, Tanzania and Zambia - has drawn criticism over her support for LGBTQ rights. In Ghana, in a speech calling for ""all people be treated equally"" she appeared to criticise a bill before the country's parliament which criminalises advocacy for gay rights and proposes jail terms for those that identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. The country's Speaker Alban Bagbin later called her remarks ""undemocratic"" and urged lawmakers not to be ""intimidated by any person"". In Tanzania, a former minister spoke against US support for LGBTQ rights ahead of the visit and in Zambia some opposition politicians have threatened to hold protests. There are64 countries that have laws that criminalise homosexuality,external, and nearly half of these are in Africa. Some countries, including several in Africa, have recently moved to decriminalise same-sex unions and improve rights for LGBTQ people. In December 2022, Singapore's parliament repealed a controversial law which banned sex between men. In the same month, the high court in Barbadosstruck out laws that criminalised gay sex. In July last year, the courts in Antigua and Barbuda declared a law criminalising same-sex acts between consenting adults unconstitutional. In February 2021, Angola's President Joao Lourenco signed into law a revised penal code to allow same-sex relationships and ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. In 2020, Gabon reversed a law that had criminalised homosexuality and made gay sex punishable with six months in prison and a large fine. Botswana's High Court also ruled in favour ofdecriminalising homosexuality in 2019. Mozambique and the Seychelles have also scrapped anti-homosexuality laws in recent years. But there are countries where existing laws outlawing homosexuality have been tightened, including Nigeria and Uganda. Uganda's parliament recentlypassed a law to crack down on homosexual activities, prompting widespread condemnation. Campaign against LGBTQ rights in some African countries has intensified in recent weeks And in some countries, efforts to get the laws removed have failed. In May 2019, the high court in Kenya upheld laws criminalising homosexual acts.  In February his year Kenya's highest court ruled that it was wrong for authorities to ban the gay community from registering a rights organisation. but it stressed that gay sex remains illegal. Many of the laws criminalising homosexual relations originate from colonial times. And in many places, breaking these laws could be punishable by long prison sentences. Out of the 53 countries in the Commonwealth - a loose association of countries most of them former British colonies  - 29 have laws that criminalise homosexuality. Although the original British laws applied only to men, countries that criminalise homosexuality today also have penalties for women who have sex with women. The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (Ilga) monitors the progress of laws relating to homosexuality around the world. It says the death penalty is the legally prescribed punishment for same-sex sexual acts in Brunei, Iran, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and in some northern states of Nigeria. In five countries - Afghanistan, Pakistan, Qatar, Somalia, and the United Arab Emirates - there is no legal clarity and the death penalty could be applied. An Indian gay rights activist protests against a court ruling in 2013 upholding a law which criminalises gay sex. Sudan repealed the death penalty for consensual same-sex sexual acts in 2020. Some observers note that the risk of prosecution in some places is minimal. For example, a 2017 report on Jamaica by theUK Home Office,externalsaid that Jamaica was regarded as a homophobic society, but that the ""authorities do not actively seek to prosecute LGBT persons"". Activist groups say the ability of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGBT) organisations to carry out advocacy work is being restricted. There is a global trend toward decriminalising same-sex acts. So far, 33 countries in the world recognise same-sex marriages, and 34 others provide for some partnership recognition for same-sex couples, Ilga says. In Africa, same-sex marriages and civil unions are only legal in South Africa, and the French Islands of Mayotte and Reunion.

"Julian Assange (L), the founder of Wikileaks, and Russia's President Vladimir Putin are both named in the lawsuit The Democratic Party in the US is suing Russia, the Trump campaign and the whistle-blowing website Wikileaks for conspiring to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. Documents filed in court allege that the campaign ""gleefully accepted Russia's help"" to win the election. President Donald Trump has repeatedly denied collusion, and Russia has also denied the allegations. The Trump campaign said the lawsuit was without merit and would be dismissed. ""This frivolous lawsuit is a last-ditch effort to substantiate the baseless Russian collusion allegations by a nearly-bankrupt Democratic Party still trying to counter the will of the people in the 2016 presidential election,"" a statement from the Donald J Trump for President campaign said. US intelligence agencies previously concluded Moscow had tried to sway the election in Mr Trump's favour. Several investigations into the matter are already under way. Trump Russia - the saga in 200 words Key questions answered in the Trump Russia affair Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The BBC's Nick Bryant in Washington says the lawsuit by the DNC is seen as a publicity stunt by many there, as it may not unveil anything that is not already being examined in other investigations - but could keep the matter in the public eye. The lawsuit, filed in a federal court in Manhattan, names senior Trump aides including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, strategist Roger Stone and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort as defendants, as well as the Wikileaks founder, Julian Assange. Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez said in a statement that the alleged hacking was ""an act of unprecedented treachery"" and ""an all-out assault on our democracy"". The Washington Post reports that foreign nations usually have immunity from US lawsuits,external, but Democrats argue the rule should not apply in this case because Russia trespassed on private party servers. This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation In May 2016 the first reports emerged of hackers targeting the Democratic Party. Over the next two months, the reports suggested US intelligence agencies had traced the breaches back to Russian hackers. In July, on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, Wikileaks published 20,000 internal emails stolen by the hackers. US intelligence officials said they believed with ""high confidence"" that Russia had been behind the operation but the Trump campaign publicly refused to accept the findings. Earlier on Friday,memos by ex-FBI director James Comey detailing his conversations with Donald Trump were published. He writes that he was asked by Mr Trump to drop an inquiry into links between his former national security advisor, Michael Flynn, and Russia. Mr Trump sacked Mr Comey last year while he was leading an FBI investigation into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Allow Twitter content?

"Sir Cliff says he suffered ""profound and long-lasting damage"" from the BBC's coverage The BBC journalist who broke the story about the police investigation into Sir Cliff Richard has denied being ""heavy-handed"" to get the exclusive. Dan Johnson said he did not pressurise South Yorkshire Police into divulging details of their probe into the singer. Sir Cliff, 77, is suing the BBC after it named him and broadcast helicopter footage of police searching his flat in August 2014. Senior BBC editors are due to give evidence to the High Court on Monday. Sir Cliff, who was in court for the seventh day of the trial, claims the BBC misused his private information and broke data protection rules when covering the raid on his Berkshire home. The BBC coverage was part of its report on a sexual assault inquiry into the singer, after a man alleged to police he had been assaulted by him when he was a child in 1985. Sir Cliff, who strongly denied the allegation, was not arrested or charged. Sir Cliff sat next to one of his solicitors in court as he listened to Dan Johnson give evidence The performer has told the judge that the coverage was a ""very serious invasion"" of his privacy and he wants damages at the ""top end"" of the scale. The BBC disputes his claims. It says the report on the police inquiry was in the public interest, the coverage was accurate and in good faith, and journalists had respected Sir Cliff's ""presumption of innocence"". 'Bosses made decisions' says Cliff reporter I acted fairly, says BBC reporter BBC report sparked conspiracy theories, lawyer says Cliff Richard felt violated by BBC - Gloria Hunniford Giving evidence to the court on Friday morning, Mr Johnson was asked about whether he believed he had pressurised South Yorkshire Police into co-operating on the story. Parts of an internal email between two of Mr Johnson's bosses were read out in court. The email, sent after the raid from former BBC UK news editor Gary Smith to then northern bureau editor Declan Wilson, said there were ""some issues about exactly how (the) relationship with South Yorkshire Police developed"". Dan Johnson defended his work on the Sir Cliff Richard story It reads: ""They [South Yorkshire Police] felt their only course of action to protect their inquiry was to co-operate totally with him [Dan Johnson]. This suggests to me an extreme naivety on their part."" The email went on to suggest Mr Johnson's approach had been ""rather heavy-handed"", and added: ""He seems to have been nailing them to the wall."" Mr Johnson denied acting in a heavy-handed way and said the details had been forthcoming from the police. Asked in court whether he had South Yorkshire Police ""nailed to a wall"" or ""over a barrel"", Mr Johnson denied he had. He said South Yorkshire Police's account that he had pressurised them was ""a concoction"". Mr Johnson previously told the court he had acted fairly On Friday, senior BBC journalist Declan Wilson took to the stand to answer questions from Sir Cliff's lawyer. Mr Wilson said he had seen Mr Johnson's previous work and felt assured he was a ""solid"" journalist and ""calm"". In his witness statement, Mr Wilson said he had a sense of incredulity at receiving information from the police so easily. ""My understanding is that the police had 'opened the books', that is to say they openly gave Dan lots of detail about the investigation,"" Mr Wilson said. The allegation against Sir Cliff was made in late 2013 and was passed on to South Yorkshire Police by the Met in July 2014. The man alleged that Sir Cliff assaulted him during an event at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane football stadium. Sir Cliff refuted the allegation and in June 2016 it was announced he would not face any charges.

"The Kardashians are closing their fashion boutiques, showing that even celebrities can't dodge the retail downturn. Kim Kardashian West and her sisters Kourtney and Khloe opened their first Dash store in 2006 in Calabasas, California. Outlets in Los Angeles, Miami and New York followed later.

"Birmingham's Big Centre TV has been replaced Media regulator Ofcom has proposed scrapping the further roll-out of local TV channels across the UK, citing concerns over ""economic viability"". More than 30 local TV stations have already been set up in the UK as part of a plan laid out in 2011 by then culture secretary Jeremy Hunt. But several of the channels have faced financial difficulties and have struggled to attract an audience. Ofcom has now proposed scrapping the roll-out of further local channels. ""Requiring new infrastructure to be built for additional local TV channels is not, in our current view, economically viable. It could also undermine the many local services already on air,"" a spokeswoman said. Mr Hunt's vision was for major towns and cities in the UK to have their own local TV stations. The business model is successful in the US, but local stations there are usually affiliated with a larger television network such as Fox or NBC. In May 2012, companies were invited to apply for a licence to broadcast in major cities including Belfast, Cardiff, Glasgow and London. That's TV now owns several local licences Money was taken from the TV licence fee to finance some start-up costs, including the cost of building transmission infrastructure. Successful bidders were given a prominent channel number on digital terrestrial television (Freeview), but they were also obliged to produce a quota of local news as part of their licence agreement. Since the first service launched in 2013: several stations - including the capital's service London Live - haveasked Ofcom,externalto reduce their local news obligations many of the stations have been ridiculed for the poor quality of their output or have been reported to Ofcom for breaching broadcasting rules several stations have merged operations and now broadcast non-local programmes to save money STV won the broadcast licence for several cities in Scotland including Glasgow, Aberdeen and Ayr. However, its local STV2 service is loss-making and in March the company said it was conducting a ""strategic review"" of its operations. Ofcom had identified 13 further locations as local TV candidates, but said it was now minded to end the roll-out. ""Most licences for locations with a household coverage of under 50,000 have not managed to attract viable applications,"" it said in its statement. It also suggested the cost of building transmission infrastructure was prohibitive, since the BBC was no longer required to fund it. Ofcom has invited companies torespond to its proposals,external.

"This video can not be played Tomlin has been jailed for throwing acid in the faces of Resham Khan and her cousin. A man who seriously injured a woman and her cousin by throwing acid into their car has been jailed for 16 years. Resham Khan and Jameel Muhktar had been out celebrating Ms Khan's 21st birthday on 21 June when they were attacked in Beckton, east London. John Tomlin, 25, of Colman Road, Canning Town,admitted intentionally causing the pair grievous bodily harm. Ms Khan told Snaresbrook Crown Court her birthday ""turned into a day where my face was taken away from me"". ""I have been looking at myself in the mirror it upsets me, it brings back the incident on the day, it doesn't look like me,"" she added in her victim impact statement. Sentencing Tomlin, Judge Sheelagh Canavan said the injuries were ""dreadful and life changing"". She added: ""It is becoming all too common an occurrence on our streets that members of the public are pouring water over people who have had acid thrown over them, as if this is some sort of fashionable assault that is being carried out."" John Tomlin doused Resham Khan and her cousin Jameel Muhktar with acid through a car window Ms Khan, a Manchester Metropolitan University student, suffered face and neck injuries and was left with damage to her left eye. She will carry lifelong scars and has suffered from severe depression and anxiety as a result of the attack, the court heard. Mr Mukhtar, 37, who had to be placed in an induced coma, has permanent scarring to his head, neck and body and has lost hearing in one of his ears.

Acid attack victim Resham Khan shares recovery photos In his victim statement he told the court he suffers from depression and has tried to take his own life. ""I get flashbacks and am really worried to leave my house, constantly looking over my right shoulder fearing attacks,"" he added. ""I am mentally and physically scarred for life. I can't even have a relationship. It's enough dealing with myself."" Resham Khan and Jameel Muhktar both suffered severe burns to the face and body Tomlin hurled acid through both front windows of the Renault Clio as it pulled up on Tollgate Road. He was seen on CCTV chasing after the car and emptying the bottle of acid over Mr Muhktar as he sped away. Witnesses described seeing the victims ""jumping around as if they were on fire"" in the road as their clothing ""literally melted off them on to the ground"".

"Gamble made no reaction as he was sentenced but his mother wept in the well of the court A teenager who tricked his way into obtaining the email and phone accounts of senior US intelligence officials has been sentenced. Kane Gamble, 18, targeted CIA, FBI and US Department of Justice databasesfrom his bedroom in Leicestershire. The Old Bailey was told Gamble, who has admitted a number of charges, damaged the ""effectiveness"" of the wider law enforcement community. He will serve two years at a youth detention centre. Live updates from the East Midlands His defence said he was ""naive"" and never meant to ""harm"" any individuals. But the judge, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said Gamble ran a ""campaign of cyber terrorism"". Gamble obtained ""extremely sensitive"" documents on military and intelligence operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the court was told. Using a computer in his bedroom, Gamble accessed and released thousands of security staff details Between June 2015 and February 2016, he targeted the former CIA chief John Brennan and FBI deputy director Mark Giuliano from his home in Linford Crescent, Coalville. The judge was told he impersonated his victims and conned call centres into divulging confidential information. He then sent emails from agents' accounts and accessed sensitive military information. Gamble also leaked some of the information he gathered using various websites including WikiLeaks. Gamble targeted the former director of the CIA John Brennan The court was told Gamble uploaded details of 20,000 FBI employees obtained from the US Department of Justice, with the message ""This is for Palestine"". He bragged ""this is so serious I'm shaking"" and ""this has to be the biggest hack ever"". He even managed to use the TV in the house of then US Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson to post the message ""I own you"". The teenager also left a disturbing voicemail message for Mr Johnson's wife, Susan DiMarco asking ""hi spooky, am I scaring you?"". Kane Gamble posted the message ""I own you"" on Jeh Johnson's home TV Gamble - the founder of hacking group, Crackas With Attitude (CWA) -pleaded guilty in October to 10 charges. Prosecutor, John Lloyd-Jones QC highlighted the level of sophistication and persistence in the attacks, as well as the damage caused. Defending, William Harbage QC said Gamble, who is on the autistic spectrum, was ""naive"" and ""childish"" and his actions were a response to what he had read about in online chat rooms about US policy. Mr Harbage said the teen thought he could get them to change ""as a result of what he was doing from his bedroom"". Gamble accessed the home phone and internet of James Clapper, ex-Director of National Intelligence Mr Harbage had argued for a suspended sentence, saying Gamble was due to sit GCSEs in June and hoped to read computer studies at university and pursue a ""useful"" career.

"This video can not be played 'No adequate people around Trump to contain him,' Comey says Memos by ex-FBI director James Comey detailing his conversations with Donald Trump have been published. The memos cover the president's concerns about a lurid intelligence dossier and also go into his relationship with his former National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn. The notes quote the president as saying Mr Flynn had ""serious judgment issues"". Mr Trump tweeted that the memos showed there was no ""collusion and no obstruction"". Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump sacked Mr Comey last year while he was leading an FBI investigation into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Since then the men have been locked into a bitter and public war of words. Mr Comey has painted Mr Trump as ""morally unfit"" to be US president, and suggested he may have obstructed justice by trying to pressure him into dropping any investigation into Mr Flynn. Mr Flynn was forced to resign over charges that he had lied to the FBI about his contacts with Russia. Ways Comey could hurt Trump - or himself Trump's allies trash 'lyin' FBI memoir Analysis: Is Comey really a liar? Mr Comey's partially redacted memos were handed to Congress on Thursday. Details published in Mr Comey's 15 pages of notes are consistent with allegations in his new book, A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership. In his memos, Mr Comey writes that he was asked by Mr Trump to drop an inquiry into links between Mr Flynn and Russia. ""I hope you can let this go,"" Mr Trump is reported to have said after a White House meeting. Mr Trump strongly denies Mr Comey's account. Read the redacted memos in full,external Mr Comey's memos include conversations the pair had had alone Other conversations documented in the memos include Mr Trump's concerns over salacious allegations in an intelligence dossier. At a meeting in Trump Tower in New York just days before Mr Trump's inauguration in January 2017, Mr Comey spoke alone with the then president-elect about details of an alleged encounter involving prostitutes in Russia. Mr Comey writes that he took the allegations seriously, adding that ""portions of the material were corroborated by other intelligence"". The allegations claim that Russia has damaging information about Mr Trump's business interests, and that he had been filmed with prostitutes at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Moscow during the Miss Universe pageant in 2013. According to the notes, the president told Mr Comey that he ""hadn't stayed overnight"" at the Ritz-Carlton but that his concern was ""if his wife had any doubt about it"". Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The Comey memos have been made public at last. The amount of time they took to reach reporters after being handed over to Congress could be measured in minutes, if not seconds. Now both sides on the great Trump-Comey divide are claiming the documents vindicate their views of the matter. The memos offer some additional details of the then-FBI director's interactions with the president, but they largely corroborate Mr Comey's account of the key events that have been public for almost a year. The request for loyalty over a private dinner. The Oval Office pull-aside to ask if the director could back off the investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. That Mr Comey wrote these memos shortly after the events in question either provides damning substantiation of his claims of possible presidential obstruction of justice and improper pressure or proves the then-director was out to get Mr Trump from the start. This video can not be played Trump's love-hate relationship with Comey over a tumultuous year With this latest move and the Comey book media blitz, the public pretty much has the full breadth of the former director's side of the story - and, quite clearly, what he currently thinks of the president's behaviour. What we don't know is whether this will take a lasting political toll on Mr Trump or if there's evidence - discovered by Robert Mueller in the investigation that started after Mr Comey's dismissal - that will lead to further criminal charges against Mr Trump's team. Comey: Six claims about Trump from ex-FBI director Mr Trump has referred to Mr Comey as ""slippery"" and a ""slimeball"" and the ""worst FBI director in history"". He continues to attack him over his ""many lies"" - Mr Trump has even suggested he be jailed over his testimony to Congress. ""Why did he lie to Congress (jail),"" Mr Trump tweeted earlier this month, adding: ""How come he gave up classified information (jail)."" He has also criticised Mr Comey's new memoir, saying the ""badly reviewed book"" raises ""big questions"".

"The remains of the bird were taken to the University of Warwick for analysis The Oxford Dodo - the world's most famous example of the extinct bird - was shot in the head, research has found. Historians believed the flightless creature had been kept alive in a 17th Century London townhouse. But recent forensic analysis of its skull found lead shot pellets, which were typically used to hunt wildfowl. Scientists hope to test the fragments to establish where the bird met its end. Oxford University has held the mummified skull and foot at its Natural History Museum for more than 300 years. Midlands Live: History of WW1 'cowardice feather'; National Trust 'should be radical' Lead shot pellets, typically used to hunt wildfowl during the 17th Century, were found in the skull The violent end of the Oxford dodo The specimen represents the most complete remains of a single dodo, and contains the only soft tissue samples known to exist. It has proved invaluable in learning more about the species, which became extinct 70 years after it was discovered on the island of Mauritius in 1598. But the Oxford Dodo's own fate had remained a mystery. The technology gave an unprecedented level of insight into the remains However, a team at the University of Warwick used forensic CT scanning to create a three-dimensional digital replica of its skull. The technology, which has also been used in criminal trials, showed evidence that the bird had been shot in the back of the head and neck. Prof Mark Williams, of the university's Warwick Manufacturing Group, said: ""When we were first asked to scan the Dodo, we were hoping to study its anatomy and shed some new light on how it existed. ""In our wildest dreams, we never expected to find what we did."" Costa vows 'cup recycling revolution' Is it OK for bars to turn away groups of men? Mum 'goes bananas' over Â£930 bill The Oxford Dodo originally came to the city as part of a collection of specimens and artefacts compiled by John Tradescant in the 17th Century. Its remains ended up in the university museum, where author Lewis Carroll is said to have found inspiration for the dodo character in Alice in Wonderland. Museum director Prof Paul Smith said it was ""a really great surprise"" to learn lead pellets had been found embedded in the skin and the bone of the dodo, which he described as an ""icon of extinction"".

"The fire has destroyed the roof of the care home A resident has died in a fire which broke out at a home for people with learning disabilities. The huge blaze started in Connington Crescent, Chingford, north-east London, at 02:14 BST and was out by 05:24. Eight residents and four carers managed to get out of the three-storey building before firefighters arrived. Iain Duncan Smith, MP for Chingford, said a neighbour called 999 because residents ""didn't know what the number was"". When the ten fire crews arrived, two floors and the roof of the building were alight, London Fire Brigade (LFB) said. The body of the woman, who lived in ""supported living flats"" at Connington Court, was found inside the building. Sequence Care Group, which runs the home, said ""further checks will be carried out"" across all of its services. Ten fire engines were sent to the care home A further 16 people were evacuated from neighbouring properties before firefighters arrived. Mr Duncan Smith described the death as a ""terrible tragedy"", and said ""it could have been worse"" had a neighbour not alerted the emergency services. He said the woman ""saw all the smoke coming out and saw them all running around the place"". ""She asked has anyone called the fire brigade and they said no because they didn't know what the number was,"" he added. ""The fire brigade were here very quickly and thanks to the neighbour they were called, and the ambulances too, so great credit to the neighbour."" Dozens of firefighters were sent to help tackle the blaze At its height, 72 firefighters - from Woodford, Chingford, Walthamstow, Enfield and Leytonstone fire stations - were sent to tackle the blaze. Richard Janssens, station manager for Chigwell, said care home staff were ""desperately trying to evacuate the building"". He added: ""The initial [999] call did come from a neighbour."" Mr Janssens said specialist fire investigators in the building ""are working in close liaisons with the police officers to find out what the cause of the blaze is and what the circumstances were which led to this tragic fatality"". Firefighters are expected to be at the scene in Chingford all day When I arrived at Connington Crescent there were a lot of fire engines and police officers in the area - and I could see eight residents standing outside before they were taken away. The smell of smouldering smoke still lingered in the area until about 07:00. As the morning got lighter, you could see the damaged roof of the care home which is completely gutted. Staff I have seen are visibly shaken and upset, while nearby residents have told me about how shocked they are with the fatality. LFB station manager Keith Williams said firefighters ""have been working hard to contain the spread of the fire which has destroyed the roof"". ""Crews expect to be here into the day, tackling hot spots,"" he added. The Met Police said ""a number of people"" have been treated for smoke inhalation, and that officers remain at the scene. One local resident, who works at another care home, said: ""It is a big concern because you do worry about your actual residents more than you do for yourself and try to get them out. ""So it is extremely sad news that someone has actually died."" The building contains two supported living services, Connington Court and Connington House.

"This video can not be played 'Arsene Who?' - Wenger remembers joining Arsenal Arsene Wenger is to leave Arsenal at the end of the season, ending a near 22-year reign as manager. The Frenchman departs a yearbefore his latest contract was due to expire. The Gunners are sixth in the league and set to miss out on a top-four spot for the second straight season, with their hopes of reaching the Champions League resting on winning the Europa League. Wenger, 68, won three Premier League titles and seven FA Cups, including the Double in 1998 and 2002. ""I am grateful for having had the privilege to serve the club for so many memorable years,"" said Wenger. ""I managed the club with full commitment and integrity. ""To all the Arsenal lovers, take care of the values of the club."" Arsenal say a successor will be appointed ""as soon as possible"". Live: Reaction to Wenger's departure 'The brilliant revolutionary who refused to change himself' 'One of the greatest' - Ferguson on departing 'rival, colleague & friend' Wenger How many Invincibles can you name in three minutes? Pick Wenger's greatest Arsenal XI Arsenal announced Wenger's departure with this tweet Arsenal majority shareholder Stan Kroenke described Friday's announcement as ""one of the most difficult days we have ever had in all our years in sport"". He added: ""One of the main reasons we got involved with Arsenal was because of what Arsene has brought to the club on and off the pitch. ""His longevity and consistency over such a sustained period at the highest level of the game will never be matched."" The American praised Wenger's ""exceptional record"", adding that he ""transformed the identity of our club and of English football with his vision for how the game can be played"". Appointed on 1 October 1996, he is the Premier League's current longest-serving manager and has taken charge of a record 823 games. But some fans have turned on the Frenchman over the past two seasons as a result of their league performances. Sunday's2-1 defeat at Newcastlewas their 11th in the league this season, equalling their worst tally in a campaign under Wenger. They are 33 points behind leaders Manchester City, who have 87 points, and the same number away from bottom side West Brom, who have 21. Arsenal finished outside the top four last term for the first time since Wenger arrived at the club, and are now 14 points behind fourth-placed Tottenham, with five matches remaining. They face Spanish side Atletico Madrid, who are second in La Liga, in the Europa League semi-finals, with the first leg on Thursday. This video can not be played Arsenal players don't listen to Wenger any more - Shearer Wenger won three Premier League titles and four FA Cups in his first nine seasons in charge. In 2003-04, he became the first manager since 1888-89 to lead a team through an English top-flight season unbeaten. But after winning the 2005 FA Cup, they waited another nine years - or 3,283 days - for their next silverware. It came as they beat Hull City to win the 2014 FA Cup, before winning the trophy again the following season. Wenger won his seventh FA Cup last season, beating Chelsea 2-1 at Wembley, but finished 18 points behind Antonio Conte's Premier League champions. His side have struggled in Europe since losing to Barcelona in 2006 Champions League final. They were eliminated at the last-16 stage for the seventh successive season on their last appearance in the competition in 2017, losing 10-2 on aggregate to Bayern Munich. In 2006, they moved into the Â£390m Emirates Stadium after leaving Highbury. The Gunners have consistently spent less than their main Premier League rivals on new signings, but Wenger twice broke the club's transfer record this season. France striker Alexandre Lacazette joined in the summer for Â£46.5m, while his final signing was Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for Â£56m in January.

"Alfie Evans is in a ""semi-vegetative state"" in Alder Hey Children's Hospital The parents of terminally ill toddler Alfie Evans have lost the latest stage of their legal battle over his life support. Tom Evans and Kate James failed to persuade the Supreme Court that Alfie was being unlawfully detained at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool. The court also refused permission for the parents to appeal the decision. But Mr Evans said they would not give up and had made an ""urgent application"" to the European Court of Human Rights. Judges said,externalthe hospital must be ""free to do what has been determined to be in Alfie's best interests"". The Supreme Court has also approved a plan for withdrawing treatment and bringing the 23-month-old's life to an end. The judges said there was ""no reason for further delay"" and ""there will be no further stay of the Court of Appeal's order"". ""That is the law in this country. No application to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg can or should change that,"" they said. Tom Evans and Kate James want to take Alfie to Rome The couple had made another application to the Supreme Court after losing a second fight over Alfie at the Court of Appeal. They wanted to take Alfie - who has been suffering from an undiagnosed degenerative brain disease - to a hospital in Rome where he would continue to receive palliative care. Alfie's parents had already lost a first round of cases in the High Court, Court of Appeal, Supreme Court and European Court of Human Rights. Speaking outside Alder Hey, Mr Evans said: ""This is not justice. This is a cruel bureaucracy. ""We have instructed our lawyers to submit an urgent application to the European Court of Human Rights, and they have done so today. ""We will not give up. We will continue to fight, by all means available to us within the law, to save our son's life."" Who is Alfie Evans and why are his parents back in court? Alfie Evans hospital 'scary' to visit Hundreds protest at Alfie Evans hospital The Supreme Court justices said: ""Alfie looks like a normal baby, but the unanimous opinion of the doctors who have examined him and the scans of his brain is that almost all of his brain has been destroyed. ""No-one knows why. But that it has happened and is continuing to happen cannot be denied. ""It means that Alfie cannot breathe, or eat, or drink without sophisticated medical treatment. It also means that there is no hope of his ever getting better."" Earlier this week Mr Evans flew to Rometo meet Pope Francis and begged him to ""save our son"". A statement issued by Alder Hey reiterated today's Supreme Court ruling, adding: ""We understand that this decision is very distressing for Alfie's family at this very difficult time."" Andrea Williams, chief executive of the Christian Legal Centre, which is now representing Alfie's family, said: ""We are going to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights hoping we can stay the end-of-life order our courts have made. ""We are appealing today because we have got to act quickly. The parents are devoted parents."" Ms Williams added: ""It is one thing to argue any medical treatment is futile, it is quite another thing to say someone should die because their quality of life is futile.""

"This video can not be played Alan Johnson: ""It was an administrative decision taken by the UK Border Agency"" The decision to destroy the landing cards for Windrush migrants was taken under Labour, former home secretary Alan Johnson has said. Asked if he knew about the 2009 decision, he told the BBC: ""No, it was an administrative decision taken by the UK Border Agency."" The cards were then destroyed in 2010, when Theresa May was home secretary. Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn and Mrs May clashed over the issue at prime minister's questions. Inquiry urged over landing cards Who are the Windrush generation? What is the 'hostile environment' policy? What should Windrush generation do now? The government has apologised to the children of Commonwealth citizens, known as the Windrush generation - after the name of the first ship bringing them to the UK in 1948 - for the way they have been treated by the Home Office. Despite being in the UK legally, many have been threatened with deportation, denied access to NHS treatment, benefits and pensions and stripped of their jobs. On Wednesday, Mr Corbyn accused the government of being ""callous and incompetent""  and asked if Mrs May, then home secretary, had ""signed off"" on the decision to destroy the landing cards which was now ""causing such pain and such stress to a whole generation"". She replied that the decision had been taken under the previous Labour government in 2009. This video can not be played Albert Thompson: ""I was denied NHS cancer treatment"" Mr Johnson suggested that Mr Corbyn had been ""misled"" over the issue: ""The previous evening, as I understand it... Number 10 were briefing that this happened in 2010. ""What she had up her sleeve, whether it was deliberate or whatever - all's fair in love and Prime Minister's Questions - was that the decision was taken under us."" Landing cards filled in by Commonwealth citizens were used by officials to help subsequent generations prove they had a right to remain in the UK. They had been stored in a basement for decades before being destroyed in 2010. It emerged that some children of Caribbean migrants had been declared illegal immigrants and threatened with deportation, amid tighter migration rules introduced when Mrs May was home secretary, requiring those without documents to provide evidence of their right to live in the UK. On BBC One's This Week, Mr Johnson - home secretary from June 2009 until May 2010 - said the UK Border Agency had taken the ""administrative decision"" to destroy the landing cards in 2009, although he was unaware of it. ""It wasn't just the Windrush landing cards it was this mass of paperwork that had built up over 50 years. ""And you have to remember, we were introducing a biometric identity card, compulsory, for anyone coming in from outside the European Union, so Windrush weren't involved in any of that, there was no threat to the Windrush generation. This video can not be played ""It was wrong ... and we are sorry"" ""So it was an administrative decision, just at it was a year later, when Theresa May was home secretary - as my successor - and they were destroyed."" Mr Corbyn said on Friday that the prime minister should repeal the 2014 Immigration Act, which introduced requirements on landlords, employers, banks and the NHS to check people's immigration status. Asked what the prime minister should be doing, Mr Corbyn replied: ""Repeal the legislation that brought it about in the first place, act on it very very quickly, and stop the rhetoric which is blaming immigrants for problems they didn't create."" The Home Office has set up a task force to help people formalise their right to remain in the UK and Theresa May has said she is ""genuinely sorry"" for the anxiety caused by the department threatening the children of Commonwealth citizens with deportation. But Home Secretary Amber Rudd has faced calls to quit over the scandal, with Labour saying she had blamed officials rather than taking responsibility for her department's actions. On Monday, she told MPs: ""I am concerned that the Home Office has become too concerned with policy and strategy and sometimes loses sight of the individual."" TheGuardian says it has seen a leaked private memo,externalfrom Ms Rudd to the prime minister in January 2017 in which Ms Rudd pledged to increase the ""number of enforced removals [of illegal immigrants] by more than 10% over the next few years"". Labour has blamed the government's bid to create a ""hostile environment"" for illegal immigrants for the scandal.

Ms Khan told Snaresbrook Crown Court her birthday ""turned into a day where my face was taken away from me"". ""I have been looking at myself in the mirror it upsets me, it brings back the incident on the day, it doesn't look like me,"" she added in her victim impact statement. Sentencing Tomlin, Judge Sheelagh Canavan said the injuries were ""dreadful and life changing"". She added: ""It is becoming all too common an occurrence on our streets that members of the public are pouring water over people who have had acid thrown over them, as if this is some sort of fashionable assault that is being carried out."" John Tomlin doused Resham Khan and her cousin Jameel Muhktar with acid through a car window Ms Khan, a Manchester Metropolitan University student, suffered face and neck injuries and was left with damage to her left eye.

"This video can not be played The bomb was found by workers on a construction site in Heidestrasse German police have defused a World War Two bomb in central Berlin, after some 10,000 people were evacuated. ""A short bang - there was a controlled explosion of the detonator away from the bomb,"" the police said. The British bomb has been removed, the main railway station has reopened and traffic is getting back to normal. The evacuation zone included homes, government ministries, hospitals and museums. The disruption lasted from 09:00 to 13:30 (0700-1130 GMT). During that period trains were unable to stop at the main railway station and vehicles were diverted away from the zone. The police cordon has now been lifted. ""Everything went smoothly without complications, and by the book,"" said police explosives expert Engin Laumer after the 500kg (1,100lb) bomb had been defused. A big digger was used to hoist the bomb away once it was safe It was found last Wednesday during construction work in Heidestrasse. Buildings were cleared in an 800m (2,625ft) radius around the site. Police went door to door to check the area was empty of people before their specialist team began defusing the bomb. Berlin's famous CharitÃ© university hospital and a military hospital were partly shut down. Police tweeted a photo of their bomb disposal team poised to make it safe. Allow Twitter content?

Thousands of unexploded bombs from the 1939-45 war are found every year. Berlin was reduced to ruins in 1945 and about 3,000 unexploded bombs are believed to be still lying buried in the city. In September about 65,000 people were evacuated in Frankfurt because of an unexploded bomb. How much of a threat are unexploded bombs? Frankfurt WW2 bomb successfully defused The evacuation zone included Berlin's Hauptbahnhof Flights to and from Tegel airport - about 7km (4.5 miles) away - were not affected by the evacuation. Tegel, which is Berlin's busiest airport, was briefly closed last August after the discovery of a Soviet World War Two bomb. By Jenny Hill, BBC Berlin correspondent Sitting in the warm sunshine, suitcases beside them, Gabrielle and her sister gazed at the police cordon stretched across the glass faÃ§ade of Berlin's main railway station. ""I hope it doesn't go off!"" she laughed. Like many Germans, Gabrielle was rather sanguine about the presence of unexploded ordnance. ""They defuse World War Two bombs from time to time in Osnabrueck - my home town - too,"" she added. The relics of wartime Germany turn up with surprising regularity. Estimates vary but it is thought that at least one in every 10 Allied bombs dropped on this country during World War Two failed to detonate. They are discovered so frequently, often by builders or farmers, that every German state has a specialist team responsible for their disposal. But rarely do they cause such widespread disruption.

"Leaders and representatives from across the Commonwealth are expected to come to London for the Coronation of King Charles III on 6 May. Some of these countries were previously in the British Empire, some are still British dominions, while others had no colonial links to Britain but have chosen to join the global club. Here are seven things you may not know about the Commonwealth. About 2.5 billion people - out of a global population of eight billion -live in the 56 Commonwealth countries,external. More than 60 per cent of the Commonwealth's population is aged 29 or under. Globally, a third of all young people aged between 15 and 29 live in Commonwealth countries. The biggest country by population is India, which accounts for about half of the total. Pakistan, Nigeria and Bangladesh are the next biggest countries by population, with the UK fifth. King Charles is the head of state in 14 Commonwealth countries - or realms - in addition to the UK. Most countries in the club are republics - withBarbados the last to remove the UK monarch as its head of state in 2021. Five countries - Lesotho, Eswatini (previously known as Swaziland), Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia and Tonga - have their own monarch. King Charles remains head of state in Australia, New Zealand and Canada, although for many years there has been an active movement in Australia in favour of becoming a republic. The country's central bank has announced thatCharles will not feature on Australia's new $5 note. What does the King do? Rwanda and Mozambique became members in 2009 and 1995 respectively,although neither were colonised by the British.,externalRwanda was previously under the rule of Germany and Belgium. Rwanda was colonised by Germany and Belgium, not the UK Former French colonies Gabon and Togo are the most recent joiners,becoming members in June 2022,external. Why ex-French colonies are joining the Commonwealth The club has also lost members. South Africa withdrew in 1961 after it was criticised by Commonwealth members for its apartheid policies. It became a member again in 1994. Pakistan was thrown out after a military coup in 1999, but was readmitted in 2004. Membership was suspended again between 2007 and 2008.

"More robust hoardings have begun to replace police cordons, including at The Mill pub Nine locations in Salisbury which are to be decontaminated following the poisoning of an ex-spy and his daughter have been surrounded by new barriers. The Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant are among the places deemed to be still at risk by government scientists. But officials say the city remains ""safe for residents and visitors"" and extra precautions need not be taken. The nerve agent Novichok is believed to have been used in liquid form to target Sergei and Yulia Skripal last month. Former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious on a bench in the Wiltshire city on 4 March. The British government says a military-grade Novichok nerve agent of a type developed by Russia was used in the attack, although Moscow denies any involvement. What happened to Sergei and Yulia Skripal? Who is Sergei Skripal? Yulia Skripal: No-one speaks for me The man who made Novichok The multi-million pound operation to decontaminate the locations is expected to take months. Officials from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), as well as council, police and health representatives, updated Salisbury residents on Thursday evening. Asked whether the chemical remained at a ""lethal"" level, Defra's chief scientific adviser Ian Boyd said it was still present at ""hotspots"" around the city. ""We have to make an assumption that in certain circumstances there will be relatively high concentrations, probably in very, very specific locations, which could be at levels that could be toxic to individuals."" ""We already know there are some high concentrations within those locations,"" he said. But on Friday, a Defra spokesperson urged people not to be concerned: ""As PHE (Public Health England) have stated, Salisbury is safe for residents and visitors. ""All work undertaken on each site will take appropriate measures to ensure that there is no additional risk to the public."" They added that there was ""no need to take any additional precautions"", with cordons in place ""to protect the public from any potential risk"". Different barriers have been erected at the restaurant where the Skripals ate on 4 March More robust hoardings have begun to replace police cordons around the Maltings area in the city centre, the Zizzi restaurant and the Mill pub. Residents were told the Bourne Hill building, home to Salisbury's police station and Wiltshire council's offices, will close for up to eight weeks from Friday. The evidence room and two lockers inside the station, sealed off after the 4 March attack, will be decontaminated. Deputy Chief Constable Paul Mills said it would be ""business as usual"" because they have moved to other sites in the city. By John McManus, BBC News Strolling by the river Avon in the centre of Salisbury in the sunshine, it's hard to imagine a stranger location for the international intrigue that's unfolded here since March. But the evidence for what's happened here is stark - in The Maltings area, hoardings went up overnight, replacing police tape. Wiltshire Council has acknowledged the hit that businesses here are taking. One B&B owner says she's had no bookings for weeks. And many traders say day visitors- in particular Americans who often stop en route to Stonehenge - have disappeared. Some hotel bookings, though, appear to have held up. But Salisbury won't be back to normal for several months. Locals are looking forward to getting their city back - and seeing the back of people like me. Other areas that will be decontaminated include two ambulance stations, a car compound and the home of Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who was left seriously ill after responding to the attack. Mr Skripal's home - where the highest concentration of military grade Novichok was found - will be the last site to be decontaminated. Yulia, 33, left hospital earlier this month.Her 66-year-old father is said to be recovering more slowly but is expected to eventually be discharged. The nerve agent does not evaporate or disappear over time, experts have said, and intense cleaning with caustic chemicals is required to get rid of it. Almost 200 military personnel will help with the decontamination work, which is expected to cost millions of pounds. The Russian ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, said the ""so-called decontamination"" was a means for destroying valuable evidence. He also claimed that the nerve agent must have been injected into the Skripals before investigators took blood samples from them. The name Novichok means ""newcomer"" in Russian, and applies to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. Novichok's existence was revealed by chemist Dr Vil Mirzayanov in the 1990s, via Russian media. He says the nerve agents were designed to escape detection by international inspectors. Novichok agents are liquids, although others are thought to exist in solid form and could be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder. Some of the agents are also said to be ""binary weapons"", meaning the nerve agent is typically stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients that are easier to handle. When these are mixed, they react to produce the active toxic agent which can cause convulsions, shortness of breath, profuse sweating and nausea. What happened to the Skripals? Who is Sergei Skripal?

"The Queen has endorsed Prince Charles to take over her role as head of the Commonwealth Commonwealth leaders are meeting behind closed doors to discuss whether the Prince of Wales should succeed his mother as head of the 53-nation body. On Thursday the Queen endorsed Prince Charles as future leader at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) at Buckingham Palace. She said it was her ""sincere wish"" that he takes over ""one day"". But therole is not hereditaryand will not pass automatically to the Prince of Wales on the Queen's death. The leaders are expected to approve the move when they meet at Windsor Castle, but there has been no confirmation on whether there will be an announcement following the meeting. 'No other options' for Commonwealth head? Commonwealth: Seven things you might not know BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said there had been some suggestions that the position should be rotated around member states. Meanwhile,South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has cut short his attendanceat the summit in London to deal with violent protests at home. Clashes have taken place in North West province where protesters are demanding jobs, housing and an end to corruption. This video can not be played Some Commonwealth members were never part of the British Empire Opening the summit on Thursday, the Queen said: ""It is my sincere wish that the Commonwealth will continue to offer stability and continuity for future generations, and will decide that one day the Prince of Wales should carry on the important work started by my father in 1949."" The body's outgoing chair-in-office, Maltese prime minister Joseph Muscat, told delegates:  ""We are certain that, when he will be called upon to do so, he will provide solid and passionate leadership for our Commonwealth."" The role, currently held by the Queen, is largely a symbolic one and carries no maximum fixed term. It is used to unify the 53 member states and to ensure the core aims of the Commonwealth are fulfilled. These include linking the countries through trade and international co-operation. The head of the Commonwealth usually makes regular visits to the member states to foster these connections personally. A decision on all successive heads has to be made by the Commonwealth leaders. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth Secretary-General and the Secretariat, its central organisation, help to plan many Commonwealth activities. Sources: The Royal Family, The Commonwealth Prime Minister Theresa May and Canadian PM Justin Trudeau have given their backing to Prince Charles. Other issues under discussion at the two-day summit include ocean conservation, cyber security, and trade between the countries. The leaders gathered in the Buckingham Palace ballroom on Thursday The ceremony is being attended by 46 Commonwealth heads of government, out of the 53 member states, with the remaining attendees being foreign ministers. The Commonwealth represents about 2.4bn people, but critics say the organisation is so disparate that it struggles to know what it is for, BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said. The Queen usually attends CHOGM or is represented by Prince Charles The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting - or CHOGM - usually takes place every two years It is attended by presidents and prime ministers from across the 53 member nations - as well as their family members, lobbyists and journalists This year it is held in London and the previous meeting - in 2015 - took place in Valletta, Malta The latest CHOGM was due to take place in 2017 on the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu - but Cyclone Pam devastated the country two years earlier At the end of two days of deliberations, the leaders usually agree a communique on a major issue SA leader returns home early amid protests Seven things you may not know about the Commonwealth What next for the Commonwealth?

"Barclays boss Jes Staley is facing a fine by UK regulators for breaching rules when he tried to identify a whistleblower at the bank. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) began their probe into Mr Staley's conduct a year ago. Mr Staley, who has apologised for his conduct, has been given time to appeal. Barclays said there was no suggestion Mr Staley acted with ""a lack of integrity"". A statement from Barclays,externalsaid the FCA and PRA ""are not alleging he acted with a lack of integrity or that he lacks fitness and propriety to continue to perform his role as group chief executive officer"". It also said the two bodies would not take enforcement action against Barclays. Barclays said that its ""management continues to have unanimous confidence in Staley and continues to recommend his re-election as a director at the Barclays annual general meeting on May 1"". But Mr Staley does face a financial penalty from within the bank itself, although that will be decided once the FRA and PRA processes are complete. Barclays shares were up 1% in early trading. Jes Staley is found to have been driving Barclays without due care and attention but won't lose his licence. He will face a fine from regulators and a cut to his pay from the board but crucially he's been deemed fit and proper to run a bank. Investors will be relieved - they didn't want to be looking for a fourth chief executive since Bob Diamond was sent packing by the Bank of England in 2012. Staley has accepted the criticism and wants to get on with the job of returning Barclays to the role of last serious European investment bank. The City watchdog may feel some heat. Many will say that sparing a boss who tried to track down a whistleblower will discourage those whistleblowers, who can be such an important tool in policing bad financial behaviour. The board of Barclays supports Staley - we'll find out what the shareholders think at Barclays' AGM in two weeks. The issue dates back to June 2016, when members of the Barclays board received an anonymous letter raising concerns about a senior employee who had been recruited by Barclays earlier that year. The letters, which were being treated as whistleblows, raised concerns of a personal nature about the senior employee, and Mr Staley's knowledge of and role in dealing with those issues at a previous employer. They also raised questions over the appropriateness of the recruitment process followed on this occasion by Barclays. Mr Staley asked Barclays' internal investigation team to attempt to identify the authors of the letters, which the chief executive thought were an unfair personal attack on the senior employee. We know Jes Staley will be fined for trying to unmask an anonymous whistle blower - but how much? Mr Staley will in fact face three financial penalties: one from the Financial Conduct Authority, one from the Prudential Regulation Authority and one from his own board. The FCA and PRA will use a five step formula. 1. Did he derive personal financial gain from the conduct - in this case that's a no. 2. The percentage of annual income a person is fined depends on how deliberate or reckless the conduct is judged to be. Given he has been censured for lack of care and skill, he could well have been deemed to have behaved recklessly. 3. The penalty can be aggravated or mitigated by the level of co-operation the authorities received from the bank. In this case Barclays say they co-operated fully and shared the result of their own internal inquiry - a potential mitigation discount. 4. Is there a case for increasing the fine to act as a deterrent - you bet there is! The FCA/PRA may try to deflect criticism of dealing leniently with him by applying a steep deterrent premium to the fine. 5. If you pay within 28 days - you get a 30% discount. So that's how the PRA and the FCA crunch the numbers. The board of Barclays has already said he may lose a significant chunk of his Â£1.3 million pound bonus for 2016 which is the year in question. Directors decided to defer the decision on how much until the investigation was complete and they knew the outcome and the regulatory penalty imposed. That will be known in the next couple of weeks as the regulators do their calculations and present their final findings to the company. Bottom line - the fine could easily run into seven figures. A hefty fine but certainly not ruinous for a man worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

"The remains of the bird were taken to the University of Warwick for analysis The Oxford Dodo - the world's most famous example of the extinct bird - was shot in the head, research has found. Historians believed the flightless creature had been kept alive in a 17th Century London townhouse. But recent forensic analysis of its skull found lead shot pellets, which were typically used to hunt wildfowl. Scientists hope to test the fragments to establish where the bird met its end. Oxford University has held the mummified skull and foot at its Natural History Museum for more than 300 years. Midlands Live: History of WW1 'cowardice feather'; National Trust 'should be radical' Lead shot pellets, typically used to hunt wildfowl during the 17th Century, were found in the skull The violent end of the Oxford dodo The specimen represents the most complete remains of a single dodo, and contains the only soft tissue samples known to exist. It has proved invaluable in learning more about the species, which became extinct 70 years after it was discovered on the island of Mauritius in 1598. But the Oxford Dodo's own fate had remained a mystery. The technology gave an unprecedented level of insight into the remains However, a team at the University of Warwick used forensic CT scanning to create a three-dimensional digital replica of its skull. The technology, which has also been used in criminal trials, showed evidence that the bird had been shot in the back of the head and neck. Prof Mark Williams, of the university's Warwick Manufacturing Group, said: ""When we were first asked to scan the Dodo, we were hoping to study its anatomy and shed some new light on how it existed. ""In our wildest dreams, we never expected to find what we did."" Costa vows 'cup recycling revolution' Is it OK for bars to turn away groups of men?

Its remains ended up in the university museum, where author Lewis Carroll is said to have found inspiration for the dodo character in Alice in Wonderland. Museum director Prof Paul Smith said it was ""a really great surprise"" to learn lead pellets had been found embedded in the skin and the bone of the dodo, which he described as an ""icon of extinction"".

"The singer released No Tears Left To Cry worldwide at 0500 GMT Ariana Grande has returned with her first new music since the terrorist bombing that killed 22 people outside her Manchester Arena show in May 2017. No Tears Left To Cry  alludes to the attack, while channelling the resilience and optimism of her One Love benefit concert, held just two weeks after the atrocity. ""Ain't got no tears left to cry,"" she sings in the single's soaring chorus. ""So I'm loving, I'm living, I'm picking it up."" Produced by Max Martin, the song transforms from its sombre, gospel-inspired introduction into a summery pop banger - pairing Grande's emotional vocals with a light-footed dance beat. Lyrically, Grande resolves to overcome fear and hatred ""even when it's raining down"". ""We're way too fly to partake in all this hate,"" she sings. ""We out here vibin'."" At the end of the music video, a worker bee - the symbol of Manchester -  flies towards the camera, in homage to the city. Allow YouTube content?

"This video can not be played Alan Johnson: ""It was an administrative decision taken by the UK Border Agency"" The decision to destroy the landing cards for Windrush migrants was taken under Labour, former home secretary Alan Johnson has said. Asked if he knew about the 2009 decision, he told the BBC: ""No, it was an administrative decision taken by the UK Border Agency."" The cards were then destroyed in 2010, when Theresa May was home secretary. Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn and Mrs May clashed over the issue at prime minister's questions. Inquiry urged over landing cards Who are the Windrush generation? What is the 'hostile environment' policy? What should Windrush generation do now? The government has apologised to the children of Commonwealth citizens, known as the Windrush generation - after the name of the first ship bringing them to the UK in 1948 - for the way they have been treated by the Home Office. Despite being in the UK legally, many have been threatened with deportation, denied access to NHS treatment, benefits and pensions and stripped of their jobs. On Wednesday, Mr Corbyn accused the government of being ""callous and incompetent""  and asked if Mrs May, then home secretary, had ""signed off"" on the decision to destroy the landing cards which was now ""causing such pain and such stress to a whole generation"". She replied that the decision had been taken under the previous Labour government in 2009. This video can not be played Albert Thompson: ""I was denied NHS cancer treatment"" Mr Johnson suggested that Mr Corbyn had been ""misled"" over the issue: ""The previous evening, as I understand it... Number 10 were briefing that this happened in 2010. ""What she had up her sleeve, whether it was deliberate or whatever - all's fair in love and Prime Minister's Questions - was that the decision was taken under us."" Landing cards filled in by Commonwealth citizens were used by officials to help subsequent generations prove they had a right to remain in the UK. They had been stored in a basement for decades before being destroyed in 2010. It emerged that some children of Caribbean migrants had been declared illegal immigrants and threatened with deportation, amid tighter migration rules introduced when Mrs May was home secretary, requiring those without documents to provide evidence of their right to live in the UK. On BBC One's This Week, Mr Johnson - home secretary from June 2009 until May 2010 - said the UK Border Agency had taken the ""administrative decision"" to destroy the landing cards in 2009, although he was unaware of it. ""It wasn't just the Windrush landing cards it was this mass of paperwork that had built up over 50 years. ""And you have to remember, we were introducing a biometric identity card, compulsory, for anyone coming in from outside the European Union, so Windrush weren't involved in any of that, there was no threat to the Windrush generation. This video can not be played ""It was wrong ... and we are sorry"" ""So it was an administrative decision, just at it was a year later, when Theresa May was home secretary - as my successor - and they were destroyed."" Mr Corbyn said on Friday that the prime minister should repeal the 2014 Immigration Act, which introduced requirements on landlords, employers, banks and the NHS to check people's immigration status. Asked what the prime minister should be doing, Mr Corbyn replied: ""Repeal the legislation that brought it about in the first place, act on it very very quickly, and stop the rhetoric which is blaming immigrants for problems they didn't create."" The Home Office has set up a task force to help people formalise their right to remain in the UK and Theresa May has said she is ""genuinely sorry"" for the anxiety caused by the department threatening the children of Commonwealth citizens with deportation. But Home Secretary Amber Rudd has faced calls to quit over the scandal, with Labour saying she had blamed officials rather than taking responsibility for her department's actions. On Monday, she told MPs: ""I am concerned that the Home Office has become too concerned with policy and strategy and sometimes loses sight of the individual."" TheGuardian says it has seen a leaked private memo,externalfrom Ms Rudd to the prime minister in January 2017 in which Ms Rudd pledged to increase the ""number of enforced removals [of illegal immigrants] by more than 10% over the next few years"".

"The government estimated the cost in pounds, but the bill will be paid in euros The total cost of the Brexit ""divorce"" bill remains uncertain, auditors say, as much depends on future events. The National Audit Office said the Â£35bn-Â£39bn range put forward by the government was ""a reasonable estimate"". But even ""relatively small changes"" to things such as inflation, the exchange rate and the UK's future economic performance could push it up or down. The government said the settlement would be ""fair to UK taxpayers"" and would honour commitments made. The UK is due to leave the European Union at the end of March 2019  - but a ""transitional"" period is expected to last until 31 December 2020, during which most of the current trade arrangements would continue. Why Brussels seems relaxed about the Brexit end game Ministers suffer first Lords Brexit defeat Senior MPs to force customs union vote Brexit: All you need to know It has agreed to continue to pay into the EU's annual budget until December 2020, and to cover a share of outstanding commitments and liabilities at that date. The largest liability - the pension scheme for EU officials - is likely to mean payments continuing until at least 2064, although about 60% of the financial settlement is expected to be paid by the end of 2021. Chancellor Philip Hammond has set out what he calls a ""reasonable central estimate"" of the settlement's value as falling between Â£35bn and Â£39bn - although no final figure is mentioned in the joint report agreed by the UK and EU in December. But the National Audit Office said it was not possible to define the total cost ""until there is greater certainty around future events"". These include: The exchange rate - the final settlement will be paid in euros and the Treasury's estimate was based on the exchange rate in place when the agreement was reached, in December 2017 The UK's future economic performance - how much the UK pays into the EU budget in 2019 and 2020 is calculated on its economic performance compared with that of other member states. Those contributions also partly determine how much the UK will pay towards outstanding liabilities and commitments after 2020 How much the UK will have to pay into the EU pension pot is also based on assumptions about life-expectancy, salary increases and valuation estimates ""Relatively small changes to some of these assumptions would cause HM Treasury's central estimate to be outside its Â£35bn to Â£39bn range,"" the report says. The NAO report,externaladds that some costs are not included in the estimate - such as a commitment to the European Development Fund, expected to cost Â£2.9bn, because it was not established under EU treaties. However, the estimate does include about Â£7.2bn of funds to be paid out by the EU to the UK that will actually go straight to the private sector, not government accounts. The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019 The report says the ""vast majority"" of financial commitments will be paid by 2026 and the UK will receive its share of paid-in capital in the European Investment Bank - worth Â£3.1bn - in 12 annual instalments from 2019. Head of the NAO Amyas Morse said the Treasury's estimate ""reflects a number of moving parts, so the range of costs in it could have been wider than Â£35bn to Â£39bn"". But he added: ""Overall we think it is a reasonable estimate."" A government spokesman said: ""We have always been clear that we will honour commitments made while being part of the EU, and we have negotiated a settlement that is fair to UK taxpayers and means we will not pay for any additional EU spending beyond what we signed up to as a member. ""The NAO has confirmed that our estimated figure is a reasonable calculation, and we are now discussing our future relationship."" Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said:  ""Boris Johnson's claim that the EU can 'go whistle' over a divorce bill looks, even by his standards, to be a piece of particularly bilious buffoonery. ""The NAO have confirmed the cost of divorce, whilst likely to be in the government's stated range of Â£35bn to Â£39bn, could be higher.""

"Barclays boss Jes Staley is facing a fine by UK regulators for breaching rules when he tried to identify a whistleblower at the bank. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) began their probe into Mr Staley's conduct a year ago. Mr Staley, who has apologised for his conduct, has been given time to appeal. Barclays said there was no suggestion Mr Staley acted with ""a lack of integrity"". A statement from Barclays,externalsaid the FCA and PRA ""are not alleging he acted with a lack of integrity or that he lacks fitness and propriety to continue to perform his role as group chief executive officer"". It also said the two bodies would not take enforcement action against Barclays. Barclays said that its ""management continues to have unanimous confidence in Staley and continues to recommend his re-election as a director at the Barclays annual general meeting on May 1"". But Mr Staley does face a financial penalty from within the bank itself, although that will be decided once the FRA and PRA processes are complete. Barclays shares were up 1% in early trading. Jes Staley is found to have been driving Barclays without due care and attention but won't lose his licence. He will face a fine from regulators and a cut to his pay from the board but crucially he's been deemed fit and proper to run a bank. Investors will be relieved - they didn't want to be looking for a fourth chief executive since Bob Diamond was sent packing by the Bank of England in 2012. Staley has accepted the criticism and wants to get on with the job of returning Barclays to the role of last serious European investment bank. The City watchdog may feel some heat. Many will say that sparing a boss who tried to track down a whistleblower will discourage those whistleblowers, who can be such an important tool in policing bad financial behaviour. The board of Barclays supports Staley - we'll find out what the shareholders think at Barclays' AGM in two weeks. The issue dates back to June 2016, when members of the Barclays board received an anonymous letter raising concerns about a senior employee who had been recruited by Barclays earlier that year. The letters, which were being treated as whistleblows, raised concerns of a personal nature about the senior employee, and Mr Staley's knowledge of and role in dealing with those issues at a previous employer. They also raised questions over the appropriateness of the recruitment process followed on this occasion by Barclays. Mr Staley asked Barclays' internal investigation team to attempt to identify the authors of the letters, which the chief executive thought were an unfair personal attack on the senior employee. We know Jes Staley will be fined for trying to unmask an anonymous whistle blower - but how much? Mr Staley will in fact face three financial penalties: one from the Financial Conduct Authority, one from the Prudential Regulation Authority and one from his own board. The FCA and PRA will use a five step formula. 1. Did he derive personal financial gain from the conduct - in this case that's a no. 2. The percentage of annual income a person is fined depends on how deliberate or reckless the conduct is judged to be. Given he has been censured for lack of care and skill, he could well have been deemed to have behaved recklessly. 3. The penalty can be aggravated or mitigated by the level of co-operation the authorities received from the bank. In this case Barclays say they co-operated fully and shared the result of their own internal inquiry - a potential mitigation discount. 4. Is there a case for increasing the fine to act as a deterrent - you bet there is! The FCA/PRA may try to deflect criticism of dealing leniently with him by applying a steep deterrent premium to the fine. 5. If you pay within 28 days - you get a 30% discount. So that's how the PRA and the FCA crunch the numbers. The board of Barclays has already said he may lose a significant chunk of his Â£1.3 million pound bonus for 2016 which is the year in question. Directors decided to defer the decision on how much until the investigation was complete and they knew the outcome and the regulatory penalty imposed. That will be known in the next couple of weeks as the regulators do their calculations and present their final findings to the company. Bottom line - the fine could easily run into seven figures. A hefty fine but certainly not ruinous for a man worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

"This video can not be played Tessa Jowell opens up about living with brain cancer Baroness Tessa Jowell has become the first person to donate her medical information to a new global database. The ex-culture secretary, who has an aggressive brain tumour, said she hoped that the Universal Cancer Databank would help develop better treatments. She feels a ""sense of responsibility"" to pave the way for others, her daughter Jess Mills said. Researchers will be able to access the anonymised data in the UCD, set up by an Australian billionaire, for free. Baroness Jowell was diagnosed with brain cancer in May last year. She earned a minute-long standing ovation in the House of Lords in January, after making a plea for more cancer treatments to be made available through the NHS. On Thursday, she returned to the House of Commons and watched MPs pay tribute to her bravery during a debate on cancer treatment. How do you get work when your cancer won't go away? They told me I had cancer - then they said I was pregnant 'Breakthrough' breast cancer drugs get NHS approval Baroness Jowell said: ""It is my hope that through my cancer journey and sharing of my data, we will be able to develop better treatments for cancer and speed up the discovery of new ones."" Ms Mills said her mother, who has been campaigning for better treatment for cancer patients, wanted to give a voice to others. She said: ""Her bravery, her dignity, her ferocious sense of mission, her selflessness and her courage and her vision and her ability to lead at a moment where others would quite simply withdraw. ""So we are doing this for her, with her, we are doing this for all of us."" This video can not be played Ex-MP Tessa Jowell gets a minute-long standing ovation in the House of Lords Health minister Steve Brine said it was ""vital"" that patient data was shared more effectively around the world. Andrew Forrest, an Australian philanthropist and founder of the Eliminate Cancer Initiative and the database,  said Baroness Jowell's pledge was an ""incredibly selfless act"". ""We hadn't met, we didn't know each other, and I put the idea to her that she could be the first to step out and contribute her data, knowing that it's going to go into a global bank which will be freely accessible to researchers all over the world,"" he said. ""The energy in her conviction literally crackled down that phone line. ""She said: 'I'm going to do this Andrew, this is exactly what the world needs.'"" The UCD database is a project by the Eliminate Cancer Initiative and part-funded by the Minderoo Foundation. Australian philanthropist Andrew Forrest, pictured with Baroness Jowell's daughter Jess Mills, set up the database On Thursday, Labour MP Sarah Jones, who used to work for Baroness Jowell, tabled a motion that called for greater sharing of health data and more adaptive clinical trials to improve outcomes for brain tumour patients. She finished the debate by reading a note from Baroness Jowell, who was watching with her family from the gallery. The note said: ""Living with cancer has taught me so much.

"The National Trust owns land in picturesque Borrowdale in the Lake District The National Trust needs to be more radical, the charity's new director-general has told the BBC. Hilary McGrady said the organisation needed to reach out to people living in towns and cities. In her first interview since getting the job, she said: ""The people that need beauty the most, are the ones that have least access to it."" Mrs McGrady is now at the helm of the largest charity in the UK, with a membership of more than five million. On the stony footpath up towards Scafell Pike, the highest mountain in England, she talks of her childhood growing up during the Troubles in Northern Ireland and being unable to enjoy the surrounding landscape because it was private land. She is now in charge of Britain's largest private landowner. The National Trust owns land equivalent in size to Dorset, or twice the size of Greater Manchester. It also looks after 300 historic houses and almost 800 miles of coastline. The National Trust for Scotland is a separate entity. Mrs McGrady explained: ""I want to reach more people, and more people live in urban areas. The days of walking in to one of our beautiful houses and saying a family lived here, that's not going to do it. ""We need to think about what's relevant - why would someone in the middle of Birmingham say that's interesting? What is it in Birmingham that they would get more value from?"" Dyffryn House in the Vale of Glamorgan is one of 300 historic houses looked after by the National Trust She sees a future where the trust broadens its approach to conservation by working with other organisations in urban areas, such as local authorities and community groups. It is working with Newcastle City Council to improve how it runs its parks, and also with Birmingham City Council, exploring how to secure the future of that city's Moseley Road Baths. ""It's got to be radical. But rather than change it I want to add to it,"" Mrs McGrady said. However, for her, this change shouldn't mean alienating current members. ""Our core supporters are what make this possible, and I'm not going to lose them,"" she said. Hilary McGrady says she wants to reach more people The charity certainly has deep pockets. Last year it generated almost Â£600m in income from membership, property and legacies. That's in addition to assets of about Â£1.3bn. It also has an army of volunteers - more than 65,000 people regularly give up their time to help. Last year about Â£140m was spent on maintaining its land and properties. Mrs McGrady has worked for the trust for 12 years, and jokes that she is the only DG not to have gone to Oxbridge. It's thought she will have a different style to her predecessor, Dame Helen Ghosh, who left to become Master of Balliol College, Oxford. A yearly membership costs Â£69 for adults, Â£34.50 for young adults aged 18-25, and Â£10 for children. A record 24.5 million visited the National Trust's paid-for-entry properties last year, but despite its popularity, it has also faced criticism. Last year, the prime minister said it was ""absolutely ridiculous"" thatthe National Trust dropped the word ""Easter"" from its annual Easter egg hunt- although the charity denied it had downplayed the significance of Easter. It was also accused of being like a ""mafia"" by former Education Secretary Lord Patten, after it bought farmland in the Lake District for well over the market price, a move that split it off from its ancient farmhouse. The National Trust owns one fifth of the Lake District National Park, which is now a World Heritage site Mrs McGrady acknowledged that the trust had made mistakes but said it had also learned lessons. ""The reality is, with five million members and 200 million people coming to our properties, somebody somewhere is likely to be annoyed with us. I quite like that, I like the debate, if people are not passionate about the trust then it's a sad day,"" she said. However, ecologist Alexander Lees, a lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, views the imposing peaks and valleys of the Lake District as ""desolate, and devoid of bird life"". He said: ""I think it is an environmental crime. We need to look at it as a wounded landscape. It has been changed over millennia by lots of different forces, and we are not letting it bounce back to the exciting wildlife-filled area it could be."" Alexander Lees, a university lecturer, has also worked in the Brazilian and Peruvian Amazon Dr Lees has worked for years in the Brazilian and Peruvian Amazon. ""Sheep moors or grouse-shooting estates are just like eucalyptus and cattle pastures. ""They are analogous. There has been a huge amount of indoctrination over 100 years, convincing people that this is what landscape looks like,"" he said. ""But look at anywhere else in the world, this is a crime against nature. The National Trust has helped to rubber-stamp this vision as to how we should see the countryside."" Mrs McGrady responded: ""I think everyone wants to make sure that nature can thrive and survive. But it is about that common ground, how can you do it together? ""There isn't a part of Britain that hasn't been shaped by man. That will continue, farming will continue, so how do we do that in a way that doesn't harm nature - that can mean that farming in whatever shape or form can continue?""

"This video can not be played The bomb was found by workers on a construction site in Heidestrasse German police have defused a World War Two bomb in central Berlin, after some 10,000 people were evacuated. ""A short bang - there was a controlled explosion of the detonator away from the bomb,"" the police said. The British bomb has been removed, the main railway station has reopened and traffic is getting back to normal. The evacuation zone included homes, government ministries, hospitals and museums. The disruption lasted from 09:00 to 13:30 (0700-1130 GMT). During that period trains were unable to stop at the main railway station and vehicles were diverted away from the zone. The police cordon has now been lifted. ""Everything went smoothly without complications, and by the book,"" said police explosives expert Engin Laumer after the 500kg (1,100lb) bomb had been defused. A big digger was used to hoist the bomb away once it was safe It was found last Wednesday during construction work in Heidestrasse. Buildings were cleared in an 800m (2,625ft) radius around the site. Police went door to door to check the area was empty of people before their specialist team began defusing the bomb. Berlin's famous CharitÃ© university hospital and a military hospital were partly shut down. Police tweeted a photo of their bomb disposal team poised to make it safe. Allow Twitter content?

Thousands of unexploded bombs from the 1939-45 war are found every year. Berlin was reduced to ruins in 1945 and about 3,000 unexploded bombs are believed to be still lying buried in the city. In September about 65,000 people were evacuated in Frankfurt because of an unexploded bomb. How much of a threat are unexploded bombs? Frankfurt WW2 bomb successfully defused The evacuation zone included Berlin's Hauptbahnhof Flights to and from Tegel airport - about 7km (4.5 miles) away - were not affected by the evacuation. Tegel, which is Berlin's busiest airport, was briefly closed last August after the discovery of a Soviet World War Two bomb. By Jenny Hill, BBC Berlin correspondent Sitting in the warm sunshine, suitcases beside them, Gabrielle and her sister gazed at the police cordon stretched across the glass faÃ§ade of Berlin's main railway station. ""I hope it doesn't go off!"" she laughed. Like many Germans, Gabrielle was rather sanguine about the presence of unexploded ordnance. ""They defuse World War Two bombs from time to time in Osnabrueck - my home town - too,"" she added. The relics of wartime Germany turn up with surprising regularity. Estimates vary but it is thought that at least one in every 10 Allied bombs dropped on this country during World War Two failed to detonate. They are discovered so frequently, often by builders or farmers, that every German state has a specialist team responsible for their disposal. But rarely do they cause such widespread disruption.

"The singer released No Tears Left To Cry worldwide at 0500 GMT Ariana Grande has returned with her first new music since the terrorist bombing that killed 22 people outside her Manchester Arena show in May 2017. No Tears Left To Cry  alludes to the attack, while channelling the resilience and optimism of her One Love benefit concert, held just two weeks after the atrocity. ""Ain't got no tears left to cry,"" she sings in the single's soaring chorus. ""So I'm loving, I'm living, I'm picking it up."" Produced by Max Martin, the song transforms from its sombre, gospel-inspired introduction into a summery pop banger - pairing Grande's emotional vocals with a light-footed dance beat. Lyrically, Grande resolves to overcome fear and hatred ""even when it's raining down"". ""We're way too fly to partake in all this hate,"" she sings. ""We out here vibin'."" At the end of the music video, a worker bee - the symbol of Manchester -  flies towards the camera, in homage to the city. Allow YouTube content?

The 24-year-old has been teasing the song on social media since Tuesday, when she tweeted a teardrop emoji followed by a message telling fans, ""missed you."" Subsequent messages contained the title in an upside-down, back-to-front font; and the single's artwork - a greyed-out photograph of Grande, with a rainbow smudged across her eyes. Speaking earlier this year, Grande's manager, Scooter Braun, said the star had ""cried for days"" over the loss of life in Manchester. ""She felt everything - every face they announced, every name, she wore on her sleeve. Every bit of emotion because that's who she is."" Grande also said she had been reluctant to return to the studio following the attacks,telling Billboard magazine,externalthat concluding her world tour had ""been a lot emotionally"". ""It would be nice to really hold my loved ones close for a little while, stay home for a little bit,"" she added.

""I'm loving, I'm living and I like it.""

"More robust hoardings have begun to replace police cordons, including at The Mill pub Nine locations in Salisbury which are to be decontaminated following the poisoning of an ex-spy and his daughter have been surrounded by new barriers. The Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant are among the places deemed to be still at risk by government scientists. But officials say the city remains ""safe for residents and visitors"" and extra precautions need not be taken. The nerve agent Novichok is believed to have been used in liquid form to target Sergei and Yulia Skripal last month. Former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious on a bench in the Wiltshire city on 4 March. The British government says a military-grade Novichok nerve agent of a type developed by Russia was used in the attack, although Moscow denies any involvement. What happened to Sergei and Yulia Skripal? Who is Sergei Skripal? Yulia Skripal: No-one speaks for me The man who made Novichok The multi-million pound operation to decontaminate the locations is expected to take months. Officials from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), as well as council, police and health representatives, updated Salisbury residents on Thursday evening. Asked whether the chemical remained at a ""lethal"" level, Defra's chief scientific adviser Ian Boyd said it was still present at ""hotspots"" around the city. ""We have to make an assumption that in certain circumstances there will be relatively high concentrations, probably in very, very specific locations, which could be at levels that could be toxic to individuals."" ""We already know there are some high concentrations within those locations,"" he said. But on Friday, a Defra spokesperson urged people not to be concerned: ""As PHE (Public Health England) have stated, Salisbury is safe for residents and visitors. ""All work undertaken on each site will take appropriate measures to ensure that there is no additional risk to the public."" They added that there was ""no need to take any additional precautions"", with cordons in place ""to protect the public from any potential risk"". Different barriers have been erected at the restaurant where the Skripals ate on 4 March More robust hoardings have begun to replace police cordons around the Maltings area in the city centre, the Zizzi restaurant and the Mill pub. Residents were told the Bourne Hill building, home to Salisbury's police station and Wiltshire council's offices, will close for up to eight weeks from Friday. The evidence room and two lockers inside the station, sealed off after the 4 March attack, will be decontaminated. Deputy Chief Constable Paul Mills said it would be ""business as usual"" because they have moved to other sites in the city. By John McManus, BBC News Strolling by the river Avon in the centre of Salisbury in the sunshine, it's hard to imagine a stranger location for the international intrigue that's unfolded here since March. But the evidence for what's happened here is stark - in The Maltings area, hoardings went up overnight, replacing police tape. Wiltshire Council has acknowledged the hit that businesses here are taking. One B&B owner says she's had no bookings for weeks. And many traders say day visitors- in particular Americans who often stop en route to Stonehenge - have disappeared. Some hotel bookings, though, appear to have held up. But Salisbury won't be back to normal for several months. Locals are looking forward to getting their city back - and seeing the back of people like me. Other areas that will be decontaminated include two ambulance stations, a car compound and the home of Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who was left seriously ill after responding to the attack. Mr Skripal's home - where the highest concentration of military grade Novichok was found - will be the last site to be decontaminated. Yulia, 33, left hospital earlier this month.Her 66-year-old father is said to be recovering more slowly but is expected to eventually be discharged. The nerve agent does not evaporate or disappear over time, experts have said, and intense cleaning with caustic chemicals is required to get rid of it. Almost 200 military personnel will help with the decontamination work, which is expected to cost millions of pounds. The Russian ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, said the ""so-called decontamination"" was a means for destroying valuable evidence. He also claimed that the nerve agent must have been injected into the Skripals before investigators took blood samples from them. The name Novichok means ""newcomer"" in Russian, and applies to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. Novichok's existence was revealed by chemist Dr Vil Mirzayanov in the 1990s, via Russian media. He says the nerve agents were designed to escape detection by international inspectors. Novichok agents are liquids, although others are thought to exist in solid form and could be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder. Some of the agents are also said to be ""binary weapons"", meaning the nerve agent is typically stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients that are easier to handle. When these are mixed, they react to produce the active toxic agent which can cause convulsions, shortness of breath, profuse sweating and nausea. What happened to the Skripals? Who is Sergei Skripal?

"This video can not be played Rubber bullets have been fired as police clash with anti-corruption and social justice protesters South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has cut short his attendance at the Commonwealth summit in London to deal with violent protests at home. Police fired rubber bullets on Friday to break up crowds of protesters shortly before he was arrived in the troubled North West province. Clashes have taken place in the area where protesters are demanding jobs, housing and an end to corruption. Shops have been looted, roads barricaded and vehicles set alight. Africa Live: More on this and the rest of Africa's news Commonwealth: Queen hopes Prince Charles will succeed her Ramaphosa: union leader, mine boss, president Zuma's fall a chance to take moral leadership in Africa Protests erupted North West province on Wednesday as demonstrators demanded the resignation of provincial Premier Supra Mahumapelo - a member of Mr Ramaphosa's governing African National Congress (ANC). Mahikeng has been at the centre of the latest disturbances - dubbed ""service delivery protests"" - and streets were reported to be deserted on Thursday after bouts of looting and clashes with police. Mr Ramaphosa has called for calm and ordered police to exercise restraint. He has held talks with provincial ANC leaders in an attempt to restore calm. South African media said officers used tear gas to disperse protesters who had set light to a bus, stoned vehicles and blocked roads with burning tyres. Nine people have been arrested since Wednesday, South Africa's Timeslive reported,externalciting police spokesperson Adele Myburgh. Analysis by Pumza Fihlani, BBC News Johannesburg These violent protests in the small town of Mahikeng are no more serious than we have had here in the past. But they are the worst since Mr Ramaphosa took office and he needs to be seen as hearing out people's grievances. Some of the main problems in the North West province are a hang-up from former President Jacob Zuma's administration: a lack of service delivery, government contract irregularities and all problems in the province's public industries, including the near collapse of healthcare. Schools and some businesses have been closed for the day due to the unrest and residents are calling for provincial head Supra Mahumapelo's immediate removal. His administration has been accused of corruption and the misuse of state funds - accusations he denies. Some see the protests as a cry for help to the president - he has promised clean governance and many see Mr Mahumapelo as a compromised man. Nationally, the ANC has been plagued by divisions, factionalism and allegations of corruption. Mr Ramaphosa, who has only been party president since December, is also hoping to use the meeting to bring unity within the ANC in the North West province ahead of elections next year. Cyril Ramaphosa has been attending the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London Mathole Motshekga, a member of the ANC's National Executive Committee, told the BBC's Newsday programme that the protests were a ""rude awakening"" for the party's leadership. ""They want President Ramaphosa to lead a clean government. He has inherited people they suspect of being corrupt,"" Mr Motshekga said. He added that the ANC's leadership needs ""to deal with the people that are reasonably suspected to be corrupt within the ranks of the organisation."" Mr Mahumapelo's office has denounced the protests as an attempt to discredit him. ""[It is] an anti-Supra Mahumapelo political campaign which seeks to intimidate residents of Mahikengâ"" spokesman Brian Setswambung said, according to Timeslive. Neighbouring Botswana said it had closed exit points along its shared border with North West province. South Africa's faltering economy has been a priority for Mr Ramaphosa since he took over from former President Jacob Zuma. Growth had been weak and unemployment painfully high as Mr Zuma's leadership was dogged by years of corruption allegations. In a recent interview with Bloomberg in London,external, Mr Ramaphosa said he was seeking $100bn (Â£71bn) in investment to help kick-start the economy.

"The foundations for the Prince of Wales to take the lead had been laid The Queen's very public plea that the Prince of Wales should succeed her as head of the Commonwealth may have surprised some of the government leaders sitting in the ballroom of Buckingham Palace. But it came as no surprise to those within Whitehall who had been planning and campaigning for this moment for years. In theory, the decision is entirely up to the Commonwealth heads of government. It is not an hereditary role. Yet Thursday's meeting showed the culmination of a concerted operation by the British government and royal establishment to present this decision as a fait accompli against which it would be almost impossible to argue. On Friday, the leaders are expected to sign off the deal when they meet for private discussions at Windsor Castle. Queen wants Charles to lead Commonwealth What next for the Commonwealth? Seven things you might not know First, Prince Charles led the groundwork in recent years by assiduously visiting Commonwealth countries and cultivating their leaders. His website and twitter feed pump out pictures of these trips and events. And in front of the world leaders, he yet again reinforced his credentials as a candidate. He said: ""For my part, the Commonwealth has been a fundamental feature of my life for as long as I can remember, beginning with my first visit to Malta when I was just five years old. ""I consider myself fortunate over the years to have been able to meet and talk with so many of the giants of the Commonwealth - Sir Robert Menzies; Kwame Nkrumah; Sir Keith Holyoake; Jomo Kenyatta; Pierre Trudeau; Kenneth Kaunda; Julius Nyerere; Lee Kuan Yew and many more. ""On the foundations they laid, the modern Commonwealth has a vital role to play in building bridges between our countries, fairer societies within them and a more secure world around them."" The decision over who succeeds Her Majesty needs to be unanimous In politics, that could easily be mistaken for a stump speech. Crucially, the Prince has worked hard to secure the support of India by going out of his way last year to visit the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to convince him to come to this summit. India is a key and growing player in the Commonwealth, one of its largest economies with almost half its population. So its voice matters. And insiders say that India is onside. The Queen did not hold a private audience with Mr Modi on Thursday and host him for dinner for nothing. Second, the Queen herself has played a significant role. At the last Commonwealth summit in Malta in 2015, she made her views very clear, saying she could not ""wish to have been better supported and represented in the Commonwealth than by the Prince of Wales who continues to give so much to it with great distinction"". This week, though, is almost certainly the last time the 91-year-old monarch will chair the Commonwealth's biennial conference, known by its inelegant acronym, CHOGM. That and the fact that the royal kitchen sink has been thrown at this summit gave her even greater authority to ask for her son to succeed her. Who could possibly refuse the direct and public request of such a host amid the grandeur of Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle? This is a moment of great leverage for the sovereign. Third, Joseph Muscat, the prime minister of Malta and outgoing chair of the Commonwealth, was roped in to canvas opinion. He has played a key role in these deeply private discussions. It was significant that it was he and not Her Majesty who first indicated where the wind was blowing. Was this her farewell applause? It takes some guts to scoop Her Majesty the Queen. Mr Muscat told his fellow Commonwealth leaders: ""We are equally elated by the vigour with which His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales actively participates in Commonwealth affairs and puts a strong Commonwealth dimension in his various national and global initiatives. ""We are certain that when he will be called upon to do so, he will provide solid and passionate leadership for our Commonwealth."" And finally, Downing Street played its part, making it very clear on Monday that Prince Charles' succession would be discussed this week. The Queen's reign may not end for many years but a Downing Street spokesman was adamant about the urgency: ""This is obviously a decision that is taken later in the week, and a decision taken by all the members together. I think that all happens on Friday."" For we should not underestimate the importance the British government places in the Commonwealth and the potential risks of severing its links with British royalty. After Brexit, ministers are looking to the Commonwealth as a source of greater trade and a global institution in which they can project soft power as part of its much maligned ""Global Britain"" foreign policy. Thus was the campaign laid. One Commonwealth source said: ""There has been a co-ordinated push to make this happen. It was presented as a done deal."" There are risks in this. Commonwealth countries do not always like being pushed around. All it would take is for one country to raise a wrinkled eyebrow of doubt to throw a spanner in the works. This, of course, has to be a unanimous decision. And there has, in the past, been debate about whether the end of the Queen's reign should be a moment for the Commonwealth to reform its leadership, making it less Anglocentric, less connected to its imperial past, perhaps by having elected rotating symbolic leadership. But there has also been the view that even if the Prince of Wales were seen in a different light to the Queen, the British monarchy provides the Commonwealth with a vital element of continuity and shared institutional memory that is beyond politics. This is a loosely aligned body of 53 diverse countries with many different values, cultures and beliefs, divided by wealth, geography and size. The role is not hereditary and so could go to any leader of the 53 countries In that context, the Commonwealth is choosing to hold onto one of the few ties that binds it together. There is also no alternative candidate to the Prince of Wales. And there is also this simple fact: Commonwealth leaders spend enough time scrapping over where their summits should be held and who should chair their secretariat. There is not much appetite for adding to that electoral burden. So, barring unforeseen objections, the Prince of Wales looks likely to succeed the Queen as head of the Commonwealth. But note this: the government leaders could have decided that the organisation should always be led by the British head of state, whoever he or she may be. That, however, I am told, is not going to happen. They will back Prince Charles for now but they will not write a blank cheque to the British royal family in perpetuity. In other words, if the Duke of Cambridge wants the job one day, he is going to have to work for it like his father.

"The fire has destroyed the roof of the care home A resident has died in a fire which broke out at a home for people with learning disabilities. The huge blaze started in Connington Crescent, Chingford, north-east London, at 02:14 BST and was out by 05:24. Eight residents and four carers managed to get out of the three-storey building before firefighters arrived. Iain Duncan Smith, MP for Chingford, said a neighbour called 999 because residents ""didn't know what the number was"". When the ten fire crews arrived, two floors and the roof of the building were alight, London Fire Brigade (LFB) said. The body of the woman, who lived in ""supported living flats"" at Connington Court, was found inside the building. Sequence Care Group, which runs the home, said ""further checks will be carried out"" across all of its services. Ten fire engines were sent to the care home A further 16 people were evacuated from neighbouring properties before firefighters arrived. Mr Duncan Smith described the death as a ""terrible tragedy"", and said ""it could have been worse"" had a neighbour not alerted the emergency services. He said the woman ""saw all the smoke coming out and saw them all running around the place"". ""She asked has anyone called the fire brigade and they said no because they didn't know what the number was,"" he added. ""The fire brigade were here very quickly and thanks to the neighbour they were called, and the ambulances too, so great credit to the neighbour."" Dozens of firefighters were sent to help tackle the blaze At its height, 72 firefighters - from Woodford, Chingford, Walthamstow, Enfield and Leytonstone fire stations - were sent to tackle the blaze. Richard Janssens, station manager for Chigwell, said care home staff were ""desperately trying to evacuate the building"". He added: ""The initial [999] call did come from a neighbour."" Mr Janssens said specialist fire investigators in the building ""are working in close liaisons with the police officers to find out what the cause of the blaze is and what the circumstances were which led to this tragic fatality"". Firefighters are expected to be at the scene in Chingford all day When I arrived at Connington Crescent there were a lot of fire engines and police officers in the area - and I could see eight residents standing outside before they were taken away. The smell of smouldering smoke still lingered in the area until about 07:00. As the morning got lighter, you could see the damaged roof of the care home which is completely gutted. Staff I have seen are visibly shaken and upset, while nearby residents have told me about how shocked they are with the fatality. LFB station manager Keith Williams said firefighters ""have been working hard to contain the spread of the fire which has destroyed the roof"". ""Crews expect to be here into the day, tackling hot spots,"" he added. The Met Police said ""a number of people"" have been treated for smoke inhalation, and that officers remain at the scene. One local resident, who works at another care home, said: ""It is a big concern because you do worry about your actual residents more than you do for yourself and try to get them out. ""So it is extremely sad news that someone has actually died."" The building contains two supported living services, Connington Court and Connington House. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said the two homes, both run by Sequence Care Group, catered for ""adults with learning disabilities who may also have autism, complex needs or behaviours that challenge services"".

"This video can not be played Rubber bullets have been fired as police clash with anti-corruption and social justice protesters South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has cut short his attendance at the Commonwealth summit in London to deal with violent protests at home. Police fired rubber bullets on Friday to break up crowds of protesters shortly before he was arrived in the troubled North West province. Clashes have taken place in the area where protesters are demanding jobs, housing and an end to corruption. Shops have been looted, roads barricaded and vehicles set alight. Africa Live: More on this and the rest of Africa's news Commonwealth: Queen hopes Prince Charles will succeed her Ramaphosa: union leader, mine boss, president Zuma's fall a chance to take moral leadership in Africa Protests erupted North West province on Wednesday as demonstrators demanded the resignation of provincial Premier Supra Mahumapelo - a member of Mr Ramaphosa's governing African National Congress (ANC). Mahikeng has been at the centre of the latest disturbances - dubbed ""service delivery protests"" - and streets were reported to be deserted on Thursday after bouts of looting and clashes with police. Mr Ramaphosa has called for calm and ordered police to exercise restraint. He has held talks with provincial ANC leaders in an attempt to restore calm. South African media said officers used tear gas to disperse protesters who had set light to a bus, stoned vehicles and blocked roads with burning tyres. Nine people have been arrested since Wednesday, South Africa's Timeslive reported,externalciting police spokesperson Adele Myburgh. Analysis by Pumza Fihlani, BBC News Johannesburg These violent protests in the small town of Mahikeng are no more serious than we have had here in the past. But they are the worst since Mr Ramaphosa took office and he needs to be seen as hearing out people's grievances. Some of the main problems in the North West province are a hang-up from former President Jacob Zuma's administration: a lack of service delivery, government contract irregularities and all problems in the province's public industries, including the near collapse of healthcare. Schools and some businesses have been closed for the day due to the unrest and residents are calling for provincial head Supra Mahumapelo's immediate removal. His administration has been accused of corruption and the misuse of state funds - accusations he denies. Some see the protests as a cry for help to the president - he has promised clean governance and many see Mr Mahumapelo as a compromised man. Nationally, the ANC has been plagued by divisions, factionalism and allegations of corruption. Mr Ramaphosa, who has only been party president since December, is also hoping to use the meeting to bring unity within the ANC in the North West province ahead of elections next year. Cyril Ramaphosa has been attending the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London Mathole Motshekga, a member of the ANC's National Executive Committee, told the BBC's Newsday programme that the protests were a ""rude awakening"" for the party's leadership. ""They want President Ramaphosa to lead a clean government. He has inherited people they suspect of being corrupt,"" Mr Motshekga said. He added that the ANC's leadership needs ""to deal with the people that are reasonably suspected to be corrupt within the ranks of the organisation."" Mr Mahumapelo's office has denounced the protests as an attempt to discredit him. ""[It is] an anti-Supra Mahumapelo political campaign which seeks to intimidate residents of Mahikengâ"" spokesman Brian Setswambung said, according to Timeslive. Neighbouring Botswana said it had closed exit points along its shared border with North West province. South Africa's faltering economy has been a priority for Mr Ramaphosa since he took over from former President Jacob Zuma. Growth had been weak and unemployment painfully high as Mr Zuma's leadership was dogged by years of corruption allegations. In a recent interview with Bloomberg in London,external, Mr Ramaphosa said he was seeking $100bn (Â£71bn) in investment to help kick-start the economy. He said his government was determined to tackle corruption.

"This video can not be played Bank of England governor says people should prepare for a few interest rate rises The governor of the Bank of England has said that an interest rate rise is ""likely"" this year, but any increases will be gradual. Mark Carney said major decisions had to be taken on Brexit, including on the detail of the implementation period and the shape of a final deal. There would also be a parliamentary vote on the future relationship between Britain and rest of the EU. All those events would weigh on how fast interest rates rises would occur. Following Mr Carney's comments the pound fell by nearly a cent against the dollar, as markets reacted to the idea that interest rate rises might not be as imminent as some had thought. The more general performance of the economy, such as on wages, business confidence and inflation, will also be important factors. ""Prepare for a few interest rate rises over the next few years,"" he told me. ""I don't want to get too focused on the precise timing, it is more about the general path. ""The biggest set of economic decisions over the course of the next few years are going to be taken in the Brexit negotiations and whatever deal we end up with. ""And then we will adjust to the impact of those decisions in order to keep the economy on a stable path."" Mr Carney said that some data on the economy had been ""softer"" such as on retail sales and that inflation had fallen more rapidly than the Bank forecast in February. But he said it was important to look through short term volatility and consider the overall momentum of the economy. ""We have had some mixed data,"" he said. ""On the softer side some of the business surveys have come off. Retail sales have been a bit softer - we are all aware of the squeeze that is going on in the high street. ""We'll sit down calmly and look at it all in the round. ""I am sure there will be some differences of view but it is a view we will take in early May [at the next meeting of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee], conscious that there are other meetings over the course of this year."" Many economists and investors in the markets believe that the MPC will vote for a 0.25% rate rise at its May meeting. But Mr Carney said that although people should be prepared for a possible rate rise this year, there was still a lot of data to consider before they needed to make the decision which will be announced on 10 May. The strength of global growth would also be taken into consideration. He said that there was lots of good news on the economy - on jobs, on some wage increases - but there was still significant Brexit uncertainty. Read more from Kamal here ""Most recently it has been the uncertainty around Brexit that has prevented what would otherwise have been a surge in investment in this economy akin to the big pick ups in business investment we have seen in other economies. ""Since the start of 2016 up until now we have seen much less investment than would have expected. Unfortunately that means in the short term that the speed limit is not increasing. Productivity is not increasing, which will limit the rate at which people's wages can pick up."" Listening to the governor, I sensed that he was a little more doveish on the possibility of an interest rate rise next month than he had been previously. It will be a finely balanced decision and the next important statistic to look at will be the three monthly economic growth figure next week. If that is weaker than expected, then the chances of an interest rate rise before the summer will recede. What happens now that a deal's been done?

"American magician David Copperfield has been forced to reveal a famous trick after a participant claimed he'd been injured during a Las Vegas performance. British tourist Gavin Cox, 58, filed a negligence lawsuit after falling while participating in the famed magician's ""Lucky #13"" trick. Mr Cox suffered a dislocated shoulder and claims he has since suffered chronic pain and brain injury. Mr Copperfield has performed the trick thousands of times without incident. The 61-year-old's  ""Lucky #13"" trick involves making 13 audience members, chosen at random, disappear on stage. Then, the grand surprise - spoiler alert - is when the illusionist reveals the 13 at the back of the room. Mum 'goes bananas' over Â£930 bill Minister says India invented internet Surf event cancelled after shark attacks Elon Musk: Just walk out of bad meetings Lawyers for Mr Copperfield,the world's highest paid magician, argued that revealing the trick would financially harm the magician, but a Las Vegas district court judge demanded an explanation. Chris Kenner, Mr Copperfield's executive producer, spilled the secrets of the trick in court on Tuesday. After curtains come down on the 13 participants on stage, they are hurried through passageways that lead them around the Las Vegas MGM resort. They leave the building and emerge again at the back of the theatre. Mr Cox, a resident of Kent, fell while being led through these passages by stagehands. He was taken to hospital with a dislocated shoulder at the time. He said doctors later diagnosed him with a brain lesion. Mr Cox's lawsuit claimed he has spent over $400,000 (Â£239,000) on medical bills,according to NBC News,external. Benedict Morelli, Mr Cox's attorney, said in his opening statements that ""there was a duty by the defendants to provide a safe environment to the audience participants"". When Mr Morelli asked Mr Copperfield whether or not a participant's injury was his fault, Mr Copperfield responded: ""It would depend on what happened. If I did something wrong, it would be my fault."" Mr Cox alleges there was construction debris and dust in the passageways his client used, but Mr Copperfield said he walked the same path earlier and it was clear. The Las Vegas resort MGM is also a defendant in the lawsuit, and claimed its passageways were clear. The resort's attorney, Jerry Popovich, said: ""Mr Cox did not slip; he tripped."" The trial will continue, with Mr Copperfield expected to testify again on Tuesday.

"This video can not be played The bomb was found by workers on a construction site in Heidestrasse German police have defused a World War Two bomb in central Berlin, after some 10,000 people were evacuated. ""A short bang - there was a controlled explosion of the detonator away from the bomb,"" the police said. The British bomb has been removed, the main railway station has reopened and traffic is getting back to normal. The evacuation zone included homes, government ministries, hospitals and museums. The disruption lasted from 09:00 to 13:30 (0700-1130 GMT). During that period trains were unable to stop at the main railway station and vehicles were diverted away from the zone. The police cordon has now been lifted. ""Everything went smoothly without complications, and by the book,"" said police explosives expert Engin Laumer after the 500kg (1,100lb) bomb had been defused. A big digger was used to hoist the bomb away once it was safe It was found last Wednesday during construction work in Heidestrasse. Buildings were cleared in an 800m (2,625ft) radius around the site. Police went door to door to check the area was empty of people before their specialist team began defusing the bomb. Berlin's famous CharitÃ© university hospital and a military hospital were partly shut down. Police tweeted a photo of their bomb disposal team poised to make it safe. Allow Twitter content?

Thousands of unexploded bombs from the 1939-45 war are found every year. Berlin was reduced to ruins in 1945 and about 3,000 unexploded bombs are believed to be still lying buried in the city. In September about 65,000 people were evacuated in Frankfurt because of an unexploded bomb. How much of a threat are unexploded bombs? Frankfurt WW2 bomb successfully defused The evacuation zone included Berlin's Hauptbahnhof Flights to and from Tegel airport - about 7km (4.5 miles) away - were not affected by the evacuation. Tegel, which is Berlin's busiest airport, was briefly closed last August after the discovery of a Soviet World War Two bomb. By Jenny Hill, BBC Berlin correspondent Sitting in the warm sunshine, suitcases beside them, Gabrielle and her sister gazed at the police cordon stretched across the glass faÃ§ade of Berlin's main railway station. ""I hope it doesn't go off!"" she laughed. Like many Germans, Gabrielle was rather sanguine about the presence of unexploded ordnance. ""They defuse World War Two bombs from time to time in Osnabrueck - my home town - too,"" she added. The relics of wartime Germany turn up with surprising regularity. Estimates vary but it is thought that at least one in every 10 Allied bombs dropped on this country during World War Two failed to detonate. They are discovered so frequently, often by builders or farmers, that every German state has a specialist team responsible for their disposal. But rarely do they cause such widespread disruption.

"This video can not be played Tessa Jowell opens up about living with brain cancer Baroness Tessa Jowell has become the first person to donate her medical information to a new global database. The ex-culture secretary, who has an aggressive brain tumour, said she hoped that the Universal Cancer Databank would help develop better treatments. She feels a ""sense of responsibility"" to pave the way for others, her daughter Jess Mills said. Researchers will be able to access the anonymised data in the UCD, set up by an Australian billionaire, for free. Baroness Jowell was diagnosed with brain cancer in May last year. She earned a minute-long standing ovation in the House of Lords in January, after making a plea for more cancer treatments to be made available through the NHS. On Thursday, she returned to the House of Commons and watched MPs pay tribute to her bravery during a debate on cancer treatment. How do you get work when your cancer won't go away? They told me I had cancer - then they said I was pregnant 'Breakthrough' breast cancer drugs get NHS approval Baroness Jowell said: ""It is my hope that through my cancer journey and sharing of my data, we will be able to develop better treatments for cancer and speed up the discovery of new ones."" Ms Mills said her mother, who has been campaigning for better treatment for cancer patients, wanted to give a voice to others. She said: ""Her bravery, her dignity, her ferocious sense of mission, her selflessness and her courage and her vision and her ability to lead at a moment where others would quite simply withdraw. ""So we are doing this for her, with her, we are doing this for all of us."" This video can not be played Ex-MP Tessa Jowell gets a minute-long standing ovation in the House of Lords Health minister Steve Brine said it was ""vital"" that patient data was shared more effectively around the world. Andrew Forrest, an Australian philanthropist and founder of the Eliminate Cancer Initiative and the database,  said Baroness Jowell's pledge was an ""incredibly selfless act"". ""We hadn't met, we didn't know each other, and I put the idea to her that she could be the first to step out and contribute her data, knowing that it's going to go into a global bank which will be freely accessible to researchers all over the world,"" he said. ""The energy in her conviction literally crackled down that phone line. ""She said: 'I'm going to do this Andrew, this is exactly what the world needs.'"" The UCD database is a project by the Eliminate Cancer Initiative and part-funded by the Minderoo Foundation. Australian philanthropist Andrew Forrest, pictured with Baroness Jowell's daughter Jess Mills, set up the database On Thursday, Labour MP Sarah Jones, who used to work for Baroness Jowell, tabled a motion that called for greater sharing of health data and more adaptive clinical trials to improve outcomes for brain tumour patients. She finished the debate by reading a note from Baroness Jowell, who was watching with her family from the gallery. The note said: ""Living with cancer has taught me so much. ""I've been so lucky to be surrounded by such love from family, friends and fellow cancer patients. ""So remember our battle cry - living with, not dying of cancer, for more people, for longer.""
