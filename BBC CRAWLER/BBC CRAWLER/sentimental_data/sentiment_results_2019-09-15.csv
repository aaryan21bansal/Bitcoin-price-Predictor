"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We are now in the stage where we have to start really accelerating the work"" The Brexit process has turned into a ""nightmare"", the prime minister of Luxembourg has said after holding talks with UK PM Boris Johnson. Xavier Bettel said Mr Johnson had failed to put forward any serious plans to allow a deal by 31 October. But Mr Johnson, who cancelled his press conference because of the noise from protesters, said ""there's been a lot of work"" and ""papers have been shared"". He urged the EU to make ""movement"" in its opposition to scrap the backstop. Mr Johnson said his joint press conference was cancelled over fears the two leaders would have been ""drowned out"" by pro-EU protesters. ""I don't think it would have been fair to the prime minister of Luxembourg,"" he said. ""I think there was clearly going to be a lot of noise and I think our points might have been drowned out."" Political editor Laura Kuenssberg said that Number 10 had asked for the press conference to be held inside, according to sources. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Bettel, who conducted the planned press conference alone, said the ""only solution"" was the existing withdrawal agreement. Johnson backed Leave to help career, says Cameron How are the UK's talks with the EU going? What will happen with Brexit in the next month? Kuenssberg: Is PM's Brexit deadline impossible? Where do the parties stand on Brexit? He said there were ""no concrete proposals at the moment on the table"" from the UK and said the EU ""needs more than just words"". ""We need written proposals and the time is ticking so stop speaking and act,"" he said. ""But we won't accept any agreement that goes against a single market, who will be against the Good Friday Agreement."" This video can not be played Luxembourg's PM spoke beside the empty podium where Boris Johnson was due to appear Away from the crowds, Mr Johnson said the EU must make ""movement"" in its opposition to scrap the Irish backstop, but insisted there was ""just the right amount of time"" to get a deal done. When asked what concrete proposals he had made, Mr Johnson said ""there's been a lot of work"" and ""papers have been shared"". ""We've got to manage this carefully. Yes, we've got a good chance of a deal. Yes, I can see the shape of it. Everybody could see roughly what could be done,"" he said. He reiterated that the UK will come out of the EU on 31 October ""deal or no deal"". As soon as we arrived at the office of the prime minister of Luxembourg it became obvious a planned outdoor news conference could not go ahead. The anti-Brexit protesters in the square numbered fewer than a hundred but their music and megaphones made it sound like a lot more and they occasionally used language you wouldn't want to hear on the news. Behind the scenes the British and Luxembourgish delegations grappled with a diplomatic dilemma - move the event inside but exclude the majority of the journalists? Gamble that the demonstrators could pipe down for a bit? Silence the host to save the guest's blushes? The end result saw Mr Johnson do a short interview at the ambassador's residence to be shared with everyone while Mr Bettel took to the stage next to an empty podium. He used the moment in the spotlight to deliver an impassioned speech, made all the more dramatic by the fact he's famed as one of the EU's most smiley, mild-mannered leaders. Earlier, both Mr Johnson and Mr Juncker - who met for the first time since the PM took office in July - agreed the discussions between the UK and EU ""needed to intensify"" and meetings ""would soon take place on a daily basis"". But regardless of the outcome, No 10 said the PM would take the UK out of the EU on 31 October. Downing Street also said Mr Johnson confirmed his commitment to the Good Friday Agreement - the peace deal brokered in Northern Ireland - and still had a ""determination to reach a deal with the backstop removed, that UK parliamentarians could support"". This is the first official meeting between the two men since Mr Johnson took office Mr Johnson has called the Irish backstop ""undemocratic"" and said it needed to be removed from any deal with the EU. A Downing Street spokesperson said Mr Johnson also reiterated he would not request an extension and would take the UK out of the EU on 31 October. The EU has said it is willing to look at alternatives, but that an insurance policy like the backstop must be in place. The backstop is the controversial policy in the existing withdrawal agreement, rejected three times by MPs, which would require the UK to follow the EU's customs rules to ensure there are no physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Last week MPs passed a law that would force the prime minister to ask the EU for an extensionto the 31 October deadline if a deal was not agreed by 19 October. But the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""The position of the PM is that we comply with the law, but that we are leaving on 31 October whatever the outcome."" They also confirmed that the current date set for a transition period - the time for the UK and EU to negotiate their future relationship after officially leaving - of December 2020 would not be extended. The two men dined at restaurant Le Bouquet Garni Over the weekend Mr Johnson told a newspaper that the UK would break out of its ""manacles"" like cartoon character The Incredible Hulk - with or without a deal. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the issue of whether the UK had the legal right to leave on 31 October - come what may - could end up in court. Reports have suggested Mr Johnson is considering a plan to keep Northern Ireland more closely aligned to the EU after Brexit, as an alternative to the current Irish backstop. A simple guide to Brexit Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? The Democratic Unionist Party - which supports the Conservatives in Parliament - hasrejected any plan that would see Northern Ireland treated differently to the rest of the UK. The PM's spokesman would not give details, but said the government had ""put forward workable solutions in a number of areas"". The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also attended the meeting Writing in Monday's Daily Telegraph, Mr Johnson said,externalhe believed he could strike a deal with the EU within weeks and was working ""flat out to achieve one"". A simple guide to Brexit Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? ""If we can make enough progress in the next few days, I intend to go to that crucial summit... and finalise an agreement that will protect the interests of business and citizens on both sides of the channel, and on both sides of the border in Ireland,"" he wrote. Many MPs have also questioned how serious the government is about getting a deal, such as former justice secretary David Gauke who said ""detailed proposals"" had yet to be put forward. ""It still remains the case the UK government has not produced detailed proposals as to how it wants to replace the Irish backstop,"" he told Radio 4's Today. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the PM would stress he wanted a deal, but there had to be ""some finality"" to it. He said claims from the EU side that the UK was dragging its feet were part of the ""tactical posturing that goes on in any negotiation"". He told Today the UK had been clear the ""anti-democratic backstop"" had to be removed from the current withdrawal agreement, and the outline of future trading relationship set out in the political declaration had to be much more ambitious. A simple guide to Brexit Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? ""The EU knows our position. Lots of the detail has been talked through at technical and political level,"" he said. ""The framework is very clear. ""But of course the nature of these negotiations is that there will be a tendency to rubbish things we put forward in order to exact further demands. We are not going to get involved in that.""

"This video can not be played Abqaiq is the site of Aramco's largest oil processing plant Oil prices ended nearly 15% higher on Monday, with the Brent benchmark seeing its biggest jump in about 30 years. The rise came after two attacks on Saudi Arabian facilities on Saturday knocked out about 5% of global supply. Brent crude initially surged 20% at the start of trading, but eased back to end at $69 a barrel, up 14.6%. US oil prices finished up 14.7%, the biggest jump since 2008. Prices fell back after President Donald Trump vowed to release US reserves. The strike, which the US blames on Iran, has sparked fears of increased risk to energy supplies in the region. However, prices remain below Brent's 12-month high of $86.29 a barrel seen last October, when West Texas Intermediate also climbed to more than $76 a barrel. The drone attacks on plants in the heartland of Saudi Arabia's oil industry hit the world's biggest petroleum-processing facility as well as a nearby oil field, both of which are operated by energy giant Aramco. Together they account for about 50% of Saudi Arabia's oil output, or 5% of daily global oil production. It could take weeks before the facilities are fully back on line. Aneeka Gupta, commodities strategist at the fund manager Wisdom Tree, said that higher oil prices would not have an immediate impact on consumers as they ""could take a bit of time of feed through"". However, she says that if the outage lasts for more than six weeks, oil prices could hit ""north of"" $75 a barrel. Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group and a former energy adviser in George W. Bush's administration, told the BBC: ""I think it's going to last.  As long as the United States and Saudi Arabia on one hand and Iran on the other remain in this escalatory conflict then we're going to build in a risk premium because it's getting very serious."" Saudi oil attacks: US says intelligence shows Iran involved Will Saudi oil attacks raise fuel prices? Attack on Saudis destabilises already volatile region Iran-US tensions: What's going on? US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed that Tehran was behind the attacks. Iran accused the US of ""deceit."" Later, Mr Trump said in a tweet the US knew who the culprit was and was ""locked and loaded"" but waiting to hear from the Saudis about how they wanted to proceed. Allow Twitter content?

In another tweet he said there was ""plenty of oil!"". The Saudis have provided little detail about the attacks, apart from saying there were no casualties, but have given a few more indications about oil production. Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said some of the fall in production would be made up by tapping huge storage facilities. The kingdom is the world's biggest oil exporter, shipping more than seven million barrels daily. Saudi stocks stood at 188 million barrels in June, according to official data. ""Saudi authorities have claimed to control the fires, but this falls far short of extinguishing them,"" said Abhishek Kumar, head of analytics at Interfax Energy in London. ""The damage to facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais appears to be extensive, and it may be weeks before oil supplies are normalised."" However, Jeffery Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda, said the disruption would not affect crude supplies in the near-term. ""There's enough capacity in storage to meet the shortfall in the short-term."" Drivers will not immediately see an increase at the pump, according to international energy policy expert Prof Nick Butler. ""The direct impact of the attacks could be short-lived,"" he said. ""The market has adjusted without blinking over the last two years to the loss for political reasons of over two millions barrels a day of production from Venezuela and Iran."" In the UK, 40% of the price of a litre of petrol is made up of oil, fuel production and profit. The rest is tax. ""There are currently savings in the wholesale price that have only just started to be passed on to drivers by retailers,"" says Simon Williams from the RAC. ""Many retailers cut their prices by 3p on Friday and we believe that average prices were six pence too high before that, so the impact of these fires may not be too great."" But Mr Halley said that global fuel prices are likely to increase: ""You'll see price hikes in gasoline all over world. Consumers will first notice it quite quickly in higher petrol prices."" He also warned to ""watch airline fuel surcharges"" which could also rise, depending on an airline's fuel price hedging policies. The US held 644.8 million barrels of oil in storage as of 6 September, according to the Department of Energy. The US Strategic Petroleum Reserve,externalkeeps the oil in underground salt caverns across four sites in Texas and Louisiana along the Gulf of Mexico coast. The cylindrical caverns are typically 200 foot in diameter and 2,000 foot high, and in total they can store up to 727 million barrels of oil. A salt cavern in Louisiana where the US stores millions of barrels of oil The US also has around 416.1 million barrels of oil in commercial storage held by the likes of oil producers and refineries, based on data from theUS Energy Information Administration,external. In Saudi Arabia, oil production has plunged by 5.7 million barrels a day because of the attacks. It has around 188 million barrels of oil in reserve, according to energy consultancy the Rapidan Energy Group. US says data shows Iran behind Saudi oil attacks What makes fuel prices go up or down?

"A revised Brexit deal, acceptable to both UK and EU negotiators, remains elusive. Only a few people know exactly what has been discussed behind closed doors, and the legal text of any proposed agreement has not been made public. But it's worth bearing in mind that most of the deal hammered out by Theresa May's government -the withdrawal agreementand the accompanying political declaration - would remain in place. The main changes Boris Johnson's government wants to see concern the Irish border, and the type of relationship it wishes the UK to have with the EU in the future. All sides have ruled out customs checks at the land border in Ireland (between Northern Ireland and the Republic), and Mr Johnson's suggestion that checks could take place at ""designated locations"" away from the border was rejected by the EU. That means there would have to be some customs checks within the UK instead, at ports along the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. That's a big UK concession. But Mr Johnson also insists that Northern Ireland has to leave the EU customs union, along with the rest of the UK, to allow it to take advantage of any future trade deals the government manages to negotiate. The suggested compromise is that the legal customs border between the UK and the EU would be at the land border in Ireland. But the practical border, where checks would actually take place, would be in the Irish Sea. Diplomats say that means Northern Ireland would remain legally in the UK customs territory but it would apply EU customs processes on goods arriving from Great Britain. There would be exemptions, including on personal items and other goods, to be agreed at a later date by the UK and the EU. So it's a dual customs system, which has no obvious parallel anywhere else in the world, and it raises plenty of technical and legal issues which will take some time to pin down. There's also the issue of political consent in Northern Ireland. Both sides agree that any new economic status for Northern Ireland, which sets it apart from the rest of the country, needs to win democratic approval. But the EU won't accept anything that appears to give a veto to one party in Northern Ireland, in this case the government's allies in the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). That, in the EU's view, would mean the entire proposed settlement on the Irish border could be unexpectedly torn up with nothing to replace it. The Northern Ireland Assembly has not been sitting for more than 1,000 days For its part, the DUP has been arguing that the Good Friday agreement, which forms the basis of the Northern Ireland peace process, provides for a dual majority (in other words a majority among both unionist and nationalist representatives) on controversial issues in the Northern Ireland assembly. Others in Northern Ireland argue that if a dual majority is needed, then the prospect of Northern Ireland leaving the EU should also be subject to similar dual consent. Diplomats say the latest draft agreement outlines a plan which would give the Northern Ireland Assembly a consent vote four years after the Brexit transition period ends in 2020. If it voted to continue the new arrangements by a simple majority, another vote would be held four years later. If the vote was carried with a dual majority it would be held again eight years later. Diplomats say that if the Assembly voted to end the arrangements, the UK and the EU would have two years to negotiate a new method to avoid a hard border. All of this would replace the so-called backstop- the proposed guarantee to avoid a hard border in Ireland under all circumstances. But so far, the DUP has made it pretty clear that it cannot accept the proposals as they stand. The UK has submitted a new draft of the political declaration on the future relationship. Again, the text has not been made public, but Mr Johnson has made it clear that he wants a looser economic relationship with the EU in the future than Mrs May was seeking. Diplomats say the political declaration will point towards a free trade agreement between the UK and the EU with zero tariffs or quotas, but one which is embedded in a framework for economic competition that is ""fair"". One of the key phrases to watch out for here is the ""level playing field"" - the degree to which the UK will agree to stick closely to EU regulations on things like social and environmental policies. Mr Johnson wants to make fewer level playing field guarantees, and the EU fears that could mean he will seek to undercut EU regulation in the future to gain a competitive advantage. And that in turn has made a number of EU countries even more determined that any solution for the Irish border is legally watertight and fully thought through, before they sign up to any amended Brexit deal. In any complex negotiation, there is nearly always an issue bubbling under the surface which emerges as a last-minute hitch. This time it is VAT, and how to prevent fraud involving goods crossing any new border arrangement. On all of these issues, time is against the negotiators and their political masters. Mr Johnson still says he is determined to leave the EU on 31 October. But if the House of Commons has not voted in favour either of a deal or of leaving with no deal by 19 October, then UK law says he must seek an extension to the Brexit process. The EU has said it will not negotiate directly with Mr Johnson during the summit, which begins on Thursday. But the next few days are obviously crucial. Brexit - British exit - refers to the UK leaving the EU. A public vote was held in June 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain.

"This video can not be played Gareth Thomas reveals he is HIV positive Former Wales rugby captain Gareth Thomas has revealed he is HIV positive, saying he wants to ""break the stigma"" around the condition. He said he wants to show how people with HIV are misrepresented as ""walking around with walking sticks who are close to dying"". He has also spoken about ""shame"" and ""fear"" of keeping his condition secret. He completed the Ironman triathlon in Pembrokeshire after making the announcement - cheered on by crowds. He finished the gruelling challenge in 12 hours and 18 minutes with high emotion at times. There was a warm embrace for the former Wales rugby captain before he continued his race In  aTwitter video posted,externalon Saturday night, Thomas said he was compelled to make the announcement after threats were made to to him by ""evils"" to reveal his HIV status. Since making the announcement, support for the 45-year-old ex-British and Irish Lions skipper flooded in. It included a message from the Duke of Sussex, Prince Harry, on the social platform Instagram where he said: ""Gareth, you are an absolute legend! In sharing your story of being HIV+, you are saving lives and shattering stigma, by showing you can be strong and resilient while living with HIV. ""We should all be appalled by the way you were forced to speak your truth, it is yours and yours alone to share on your terms and I and millions stand with you.

"This video can not be played Abqaiq is the site of Aramco's largest oil processing plant Iran has accused the US of ""deceit"" after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tehran was behind damaging drone attacks on two Saudi oil facilities. Mr Pompeo had rejected claims by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels that they had carried out the attacks. Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said that ""blaming Iran won't end the disaster"" in Yemen. Saudi Arabia said Saturday's strikes hadsuspended the production of 5.7 million barrels of oil a day,external. All eyes will be on the markets when they reopen on Monday, with experts expecting a significant rise in price. Will Saudi oil attacks raise fuel prices? Yemen conflict explained in 400 words Why is there a war in Yemen? Yemen war: Has anything been achieved? Meanwhile on Sunday eveningUS President Donald Trump said he had authorised the release of oil  from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve,externalif needed, ""in a to-be-determined amount sufficient to keep the markets well-supplied"". Since ousting Yemen's president in 2015, the Houthis have been fighting a Saudi-led and Western-backed coalition. They said they had deployed 10 drones to attack the Abqaiq processing plant and the Khurais oilfield early on Saturday. But Mr Pompeo said there was ""no evidence"" the drones came from Yemen and instead accused Iran. The US has blamed Iran for other attacks on oil supplies in the region this year, amid continuing tension following Mr Trump's decision to reinstate sanctions after abandoning the landmark international deal which limited Tehran's nuclear activities. Mr Zarif took to Twitter to deride the US secretary of state, saying that ""having failed at max pressure, Sec Pompeo's turning to max deceit"". He was referring to the Trump administration's stated ""maximum pressure campaign"" which has targeted Iran with sanctions. A Nasa satellite image shows smoke from fires following the drone attacks Mr Zarif said the US and its allies were ""stuck in Yemen because of the illusion that weapon superiority will lead to military victory"". ""What is happening in the region today, which has also worried the world, is in fact because of the wrong policies adopted by the US and the plots hatched by the country,"" he said. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has said prevention of US ""aggression"" is the only way to ensure regional security. The US secretary of state gave no specific evidence to back up his accusations, simply saying: ""We call on all nations to publicly and unequivocally condemn Iran's attacks."" The US would work with its allies to ensure ""Iran is held accountable for its aggression"", he said. The US has previously accused Iran of attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf in June and July, as well as on another four in May. Tehran rejected the allegations in both cases. Gulf of Oman tanker attacks: What we know Iran-US tensions: What's going on? If the Houthi rebels had deployed the drones from Yemen, they would have to have flown them hundreds of miles. However, one element of the Houthi statement on the attacks did thank ""co-operation with the honourable people inside the kingdom"". The distance from the nearest point on the Yemen border to the closest target, the Khurais oilfield, is about 770km, well beyond the range of the normal Houthi attack drone, the Qatef-1. However, UN investigators have highlighted the existence of a new Houthi drone, the UAV-X, which could reach up to 1,500km. The Wall Street Journal has said experts are also investigating whether the attacks could have been carried out from the north - either by Iran or its Shia allies in Iraq - using cruise missiles rather than drones. If so, it seems unlikely they would have escaped detection. This video can not be played The BBC's Frank Gardner looks at the evidence the US says proves Iran's involvement in attacks on two tankers in June On Sunday, Iraq's Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi denied ""what is circulated on social media networks that its territory was used to attack Saudi oil facilities with drones"". The Washington Post newspaper said the US government believed that 15 buildings at Abqaiq had been damaged on the west-northwest sides, not the southern sides facing Yemen. The Saudis have not gone into any detail about the attacks, barring saying there were no casualties, but have given a few more indications about oil production. Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said some of the fall in production would be made up by tapping huge storage facilities. Saudi stocks stood at 188 million barrels in June, according to official data. The kingdom is the world's biggest oil exporter, shipping more than 7 million barrels daily. Experts say these could be used for several weeks, although that may well also be the time it takes to get production back to normal. The Tadawul All-Shares Index lost 200 points - about 3% - when it opened on Sunday, but had checked the fall to about a 1% loss by mid-afternoon. Yemen has been at war since 2015, when President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi was forced to flee the capital Sanaa by the Houthis. Saudi Arabia backs President Hadi, and has led a coalition of regional countries against the rebels. The coalition launches air strikes almost every day, while the Houthis often fire missiles into Saudi Arabia. Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said on Saturday that operations against Saudi targets would ""only grow wider and will be more painful than before, so long as their aggression and blockade continues"". Saudi-led coalition air strikes regularly target Houthis in Yemen He said Saturday's attack was one of the biggest operations the Houthi forces had undertaken inside Saudi Arabia.

"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

"An inquest into student Ceara Thacker's death opens on Monday Universities should be bound by law to meet the mental health needs of their students, an ex-health minister says. Information gathered by Sir Norman Lamb's office reveals a ""complex and fragmented"" picture of mental health provision across UK universities. Many of the 110 universities which responded said they did not record all relevant key statistics, such as their budgets or waiting times. Universities said they could not deal with the issue of mental health alone. They added that they were already working on a voluntary mental health charter. It comes as an inquest into the death of a 19-year-old student opened on Monday. Parents 'should be told of student mental health' New system to spot troubled uni students Graduates 'need mental health support' Ceara Thacker, originally from Bradford, took her own life in May 2018 while studying at Liverpool University after her mental health deteriorated. She had struggled with it earlier in her teenage years, and attempted suicide in the February before her death. Mental health campaigner Sir Norman obtained information from 110 universities, under freedom of information laws, on the demand for, and investment in, mental health support for their students. The responses revealed that many universities did not monitor how well services were used, or whether they were meeting the needs of students. And while some, such as Bristol, Kingston and Sussex, are spending more than Â£1m a year on well-being services, including counselling, others have a budget of less than half that. Many did not even know how much they spent on mental health, and only a handful of universities could supply information on how long students were waiting for counselling. For the few that did, the longest wait was, on average, 43 days - more than half the length of a standard university term. Sir Norman praised some universities, including Cambridge and Northumbria, for taking their responsibilities seriously, but said many others were not doing enough to measure the scale of the problem. ""If we are operating in a fog, if we have no idea how long students are waiting... this is putting students at risk,"" he added. ""We know from the data that the longest waiting times could be over half a term for some students. ""We know also that there have been some tragedies among some student populations - students who have taken their own lives. ""If that happens while they are waiting for support, that's utterly intolerable."" He added: ""These are young people at a vulnerable age, many living away from home for the first time. There is a risk of some students self-harming, or some students finding themselves in a desperate situation and taking their own lives."" He pointed out that students paying high fees had every reason to expect a duty of care from their universities. He is calling for a legally binding charter with minimum standards that universities are required to meet, so parents know their adult children will be safe. A spokesman for Universities UK said: ""Funding to support mental health services at universities will vary depending on the needs of each student population. ""Universities cannot address these challenges alone. ""The NHS must provide effective mental health care to students, and Universities UK is working closely with NHS England to ensure that commitments in the NHS long-term plan are implemented.""

"This video can not be played The 18-carat golden toilet was previously displayed at the Guggenheim Museum in New York Blenheim Palace's security measures ""need to be challenged"" after an 18-carat gold toilet was stolen from the stately home, its chief executive said. Dominic Hare said a gang ""mounted a very fast smash-and-grab raid"" at the Oxfordshire palace early on Saturday. The artwork - which Mr Hare said was worth $5m to $6m - has not been found. Its creator, conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan, once the subject of aBBC documentary called the Art World's Prankster, insisted it was not a stunt. In an email toThe New York Times,externalhe wrote: ""I wish it was a prank."" He added: ""At first, when they woke me up this morning with the news, I thought it was a prank: Who's so stupid to steal a toilet? ""I had forgotten for a second that it was made out of gold."" The fully-working toilet - entitled America - went on show at the 18th Century palace on Thursday as part of anexhibition by the Italian artist. Visitors had been invited to book three-minute slots to use the throne for its intended purpose. Blenheim Palace has now reopened to the public after being shut on Saturday ""'America' was the 1% for the 99%, and I hope it still is,"" Mr Cattelan said. ""I want to be positive and think the robbery is a kind of Robin Hood-inspired action.""

A 66-year-old man was arrested on Saturday in connection with the theft, Thames Valley Police said. He remains in police custody in the West Mercia area. The burglary caused ""significant damage and flooding"" because the toilet was plumbed into the building, police said. Mr Hare told BBC 5 live it was the ""first theft of this type in living memory"" from the stately home - the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill - adding it had ""a sophisticated security system"". ""But what has happened has happened,"" he said. ""So clearly we need to challenge ourselves on that."" Blenheim Palace, a World Heritage Site, was shut on Saturday after the burglary but reopened on Sunday. Mr Hare said the artwork - famously offered to US President Donald Trump in 2017 - was a ""comment on the American dream"". ""[It's] the idea of something that's incredibly precious and elite being made accessible, potentially to everybody, as we all need to go when we need to go,"" he said. ""And it's ironic really that two days after this was made accessible, it was snatched away."" Mr Hare said it was ""not out of the question [the toilet] would be melted down"" by the thieves. Police said thieves used at least two vehicles in the raid and urged anyone with information to contact them. Det Insp Jess Milne said: ""We are following a number of lines of inquiry and there will continue to be a police presence in and around the area of Blenheim Palace while our investigations continue.

"This video can not be played Abqaiq is the site of Aramco's largest oil processing plant US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has blamed Iran for Saturday's drone attacks on Saudi oil facilities. He dismissed a claim by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels that they had attacked the two facilities, run by state-owned company Aramco. Iran's foreign minister accused Mr Pompeo of ""deceit"". Saudi Arabia's energy minister said the strikes had reduced crude oil production by 5.7 million barrels a day - about half the kingdom's output. Correspondents say they could have a significant impact on world oil prices. The main Saudi stock exchange plummeted 3% on opening on Sunday, before recovering. Yemen conflict explained in 400 words Why is there a war in Yemen? Yemen war: Has anything been achieved? Saturday's drone attacks hit Abqaiq, site of Aramco's largest oil processing plant, and the Khurais oilfield. The Saudis lead a Western-backed military coalition supporting Yemen's government, in opposition to the Houthi rebel movement. The attacks also come against a backdrop of continuing tension between the US and Iran, following US President Donald Trump's abandonment of a deal limiting Iran's nuclear activities and reinstatement of sanctions. In a tweet, he said there was ""no evidence"" the drones came from Yemen. He described the attack as ""an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply"". Allow Twitter content?

""We call on all nations to publicly and unequivocally condemn Iran's attacks,"" Mr Pompeo added. The US would work with its allies to ensure energy markets remained well supplied and ""Iran is held accountable for its aggression"", he added. The White House said Mr Trump had offered US support to help Saudi Arabia defend itself. Mr Pompeo provided no specific evidence to back up his accusations. They do follow a pattern of the US blaming Iran for recent attacks involving oil supplies in the region. A Nasa satellite image shows smoke from fires following the drone attacks The US said Iran was behind attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf in June and July, as well as on another four in May. Tehran rejected the accusations in both cases. Gulf of Oman tanker attacks: What we know Iran-US tensions: What's going on? If the rebels had deployed the drones from Yemen, they would have to have flown hundreds of miles. One element of the Houthi statement on the attacks did however thank ""co-operation with the honourable people inside the kingdom"". The Wall Street Journal has said experts are investigating whether the attacks could have been carried out from the north - either by Iran or its Shia allies in Iraq - using cruise missiles rather than drones. If so, it seems unlikely they would have escaped detection. This video can not be played The BBC's Frank Gardner looks at the evidence the US says proves Iran's involvement in attacks on two tankers in June The Washington Post said the US government believed that 15 buildings at Abqaiq had been damaged on the west-northwest sides, not the southern sides facing Yemen. A 2018 UN report concluded that the Houthis' Qatef-1 suicide drone was ""virtually identical"" to Iran's Ababil-T. The Ababil-T is considered a low-tech drone with a maximum range of about 150km (93 miles). The distance from the nearest point of the Saudi Arabia-Yemen border to the closest target - Khurais - is about 770km. On Sunday, Iraq denied its territory had been used to launch the attacks. Foreign Minister Javad Zarif replied on Twitter, saying that ""having failed at max pressure, Sec Pompeo's turning to max deceit"". He was referring to the Trump administration's stated ""maximum pressure campaign"" targeting the Iranian regime with sanctions. Mr Zarif said that ""blaming Iran won't end the disaster"" in Yemen. Earlier, foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said that Mr Pompeo's ""blind accusations and remarks are incomprehensible and meaningless"". Mr Mousavi said Saudi Arabia had ""repeatedly violated Yemen"" and that the ""Yemenis have shown resistance to aggression"". It has provided very little information from the two sites. A spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition fighting in Yemen said investigations were still ongoing to determine who had carried them out. Officials have said there were no casualties. Saudi state media reported that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had told President Trump in a telephone conversation that the kingdom was ""willing and able to confront and deal with this terrorist aggression"". The Tadawul All-Shares Index lost 200 points when it opened on Sunday, but had checked the 3% fall to about a 1% loss by midday. A military spokesman said the rebels had deployed 10 drones in the attacks. Yahya Sarea told al-Masirah TV, owned by the Houthi movement and based in Beirut, that operations against Saudi targets would ""only grow wider and will be more painful than before, so long as their aggression and blockade continues"". Saudi-led coalition air strikes regularly target Houthis in Yemen He said Saturday's attack was one of the biggest operations the Houthi forces had undertaken inside Saudi Arabia. Yemen has been at war since 2015, when President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi was forced to flee the capital Sanaa by the Houthis. Saudi Arabia backs President Hadi, and has led a coalition of regional countries against the rebels. The coalition launches air strikes almost every day, while the Houthis often fire missiles into Saudi Arabia. Houthi fighters were blamed for drone attacks on the Shaybah natural gas liquefaction facility last month, and on other oil facilities in May. Analysis by BBC business correspondent Katie Prescott Aramco is not only the world's biggest oil producer, it is also one of the world's most profitable businesses. The Khurais oilfield produces about 1% of the world's oil, and Abqaiq is the company's largest facility - with the capacity to process 7% of the global supply. Even a brief or partial disruption could affect the company, and the oil supply, given their size. There was a sharp intake of breath as analysts I spoke to digested the information that reports suggest that half of Saudi Arabia's oil production could have been knocked offline by these attacks. The country produces 10% of the world's crude oil. Cutting this in half could have a significant effect on the oil price come Monday when markets open. The success of the drone strike shows the vulnerability of Aramco's infrastructure, at a time when it is trying to show itself in its best light while gearing up to float on the stock market. And it raises concerns that escalating tensions in the region could pose a broader risk to oil, potentially threatening the fifth of the world's supply that goes through the critical Strait of Hormuz.

"Few young people have been seen voting Polling booths have closed in Tunisia, which is holding its second free presidential poll since the 2011 uprising that toppled ex-president Ben Ali and sparked the Arab Spring. Twenty-six candidates, including two women, are running in the election. Exit polls suggest an independent outsider, Kais Saied, has done well in the first round of votes. Turnout has been low at 45%, despite an earlier call for young Tunisians to get out and vote. The election was brought forwardafter the death in July of Beji Caid Essebsi, the first democratically elected president, who took office in 2014. It is widely viewed as a test of one of the world's youngest democracies, but there were reports that few of those travelling to polling booths were young. ""Where are the young people? This is their country, their future,"" Adil Toumi, a man in his 60s who came to vote, told the AFP news agency. Official results are not expected until Tuesday. The outcome is difficult to predict but early exit polls suggest that Kais Saied, a 61-year-old law professor and independent, and Nabil Karoui - a media magnate currently in jail - could be well placed to make it to the second round. Tunisia: What you need to know Obituary: The world's oldest sitting president Mr Essebsi won Tunisia's first free presidential elections in 2014 and was credited with largely maintaining stability in the country during his almost five-year rule. At 92, he was the oldest sitting president in the world at the time of his death. Mr Essebsi had previously confirmed that he was not planning to run for re-election. His wife, Chadlia Saida Farhat, died on Sunday morning, aged 83, their son announced on Facebook as voting was getting under way. Parliament speaker Mohamed Ennaceur is currently acting as interim president. A candidate needs a majority of votes to win the election. If no-one gets a majority in the first round, the two candidates with most votes will face a second, decisive round. Presidential candidates have held campaign events across the country The winning candidate will be appointed to office for a five-year term. The constitution states that Tunisia's president has control over defence, foreign policy and national security. The prime minister, chosen by parliament, is responsible for other portfolios. Parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place in October. Some of the most prominent candidates include: Youssef Chahed: He became Tunisia's youngest-ever prime minister when he took office in 2016. Since then, the 43-year-old has carried out a series of cuts to public spending in a bid to reduce Tunisia's public debt. He has banned the wearing of the niqab, which covers the entire face apart from the eyes, in government offices, citing security reasons. Mr Chahed split from the government and formed his own secular party, Tahya Tounes (Long Live Tunisia), earlier this year. Nabil Karoui:The 56-year-old media mogul is running for office from behind bars after being detained last month on charges of money laundering and tax fraud, which he has denied. He founded a charity focused on fighting poverty - a central theme of his campaign. Critics have accused him of using the charity and his TV channel to further his political ambitions. On Saturday, a court rejected his request to be freed from detention pending a verdict in his case. He is still able to stand for election despite his arrest, but will not be able to vote unless he is allowed out of prison.  He began a hunger strike earlier this week to demand his freedom. Abdelfattah Mourou: He is the Tunisian lawyer who co-founded the moderate Islamist Ennahda party, which was banned for decades before the uprising. The 71-year-old is the first presidential candidate for Ennahda, which is now the largest party in Tunisia. Abir Moussi: One of two female candidates in the running, Ms Moussi is a 43-year-old lawyer who was a supporter of Tunisia's ousted ruler Ben Ali. She is known for her opposition to Tunisia's Islamists and has reportedly said she wants to change the constitution to ban parties based on religion. Abdelkarim Zbidi:The 69-year-old is a trained medical doctor who studied in France and has held the post of defence minister twice since 2011. He was a close friend of the late president, Essebsi. In a recent interview with Reuters news agency, he said he wanted to amend the constitution to end the ""unreasonable"" division of power between the prime minister and president. Moncef Marzouki:He was Tunisia's provisional leader after the Arab Spring uprising and Mr Marzouki now wants to take up the role of president again. The former human rights activist and opposition leader has accused other candidates of ""fighting each other with methods unworthy of democracy."" He told the Associated Press news agency that dirty money was his ""most formidable rival"". The country has won praise as the only democracy to emerge from the Arab Spring uprisings that began in Tunisia, before spreading across the Middle East and North Africa. In what was hailed as a sign of its successful democratic transition, Tunisia this month held its first-ever televised debate of presidential candidates. The campaign period featured the first ever televised debate of presidential candidates However, it has not all been smooth sailing. In recent years, the country has suffered attacks by Islamists and economic problems, with unemployment a persistent issue. In 2018, protesters across the country took to the streets to oppose the government's austerity measures. Prime Minister Youssef Chahed told Reuters news agency that economic opportunities must improve ""if Tunisia is to join the club of strong democracy"". The revolution that didn't deliver for women Arab uprisings: Which country could be next? Tunisia is the birthplace of what has become known as the Arab Spring uprisings. Widespread discontent at economic hardship, decades of autocratic rule and corruption erupted into mass demonstrations in December 2010 after a street vendor set himself on fire when officials confiscated his cart. The unrest led to the ousting in 2011 of President Ben Ali, who had been in power for 23 years. Three years later,Tunisia's parliament approved a new constitution, which detailed how the new democracy would be run. The text was hailed by the United Nations as a ""historic milestone"". Significant aspects included the recognition of equality between men and women, guaranteeing personal freedoms and splitting power between the president and prime minister.

"This video can not be played The 18-carat golden toilet was previously displayed at the Guggenheim Museum in New York Blenheim Palace's security measures ""need to be challenged"" after an 18-carat gold toilet was stolen from the stately home, its chief executive said. Dominic Hare said a gang ""mounted a very fast smash-and-grab raid"" at the Oxfordshire palace early on Saturday. The artwork - which Mr Hare said was worth $5m to $6m - has not been found. Its creator, conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan, once the subject of aBBC documentary called the Art World's Prankster, insisted it was not a stunt. In an email toThe New York Times,externalhe wrote: ""I wish it was a prank."" He added: ""At first, when they woke me up this morning with the news, I thought it was a prank: Who's so stupid to steal a toilet? ""I had forgotten for a second that it was made out of gold."" The fully-working toilet - entitled America - went on show at the 18th Century palace on Thursday as part of anexhibition by the Italian artist. Visitors had been invited to book three-minute slots to use the throne for its intended purpose. Blenheim Palace has now reopened to the public after being shut on Saturday ""'America' was the 1% for the 99%, and I hope it still is,"" Mr Cattelan said.

"This video can not be played Gareth Thomas reveals he is HIV positive Former Wales rugby captain Gareth Thomas has revealed he is HIV positive, saying he wants to ""break the stigma"" around the condition. He said he wants to show how people with HIV are misrepresented as ""walking around with walking sticks who are close to dying"". He has also spoken about ""shame"" and ""fear"" of keeping his condition secret. He completed the Ironman triathlon in Pembrokeshire after making the announcement - cheered on by crowds.

In sharing your story of being HIV+, you are saving lives and shattering stigma, by showing you can be strong and resilient while living with HIV.

"Creggan is largely a republican community not far from the centre of Londonderry Creggan in Derry is seen as a dissident republican stronghold. It's wherejournalist Lyra McKee was murdered earlier this year, a bomb was found in a car last week and police officers have been attacked. What do local people think about their neighbourhood being in the headlines? James is working in his garden. Across the street is graffiti on the wall that reads: ""New IRA here to stay"". He says he had to leave his home on Monday night as streets were cordoned off. Young people threw petrol bombs at PSNI Land Rovers on Monday ""Young people then started to throw petrol bombs at police Land Rovers,"" he says. Police officers found a bomb on Monday during a security searchtargeting the New IRA. Police said a crowd of between 60 and 100 young people also gathered in Creggan that evening. Some of them attacked the police with petrol bombs and stones. Others stood by watching. At least two of the young people suffered burn injuries. ""At midday I was planting flowers in my garden. At midnight, I was running away to a community centre from a bomb,"" says James, who did not want his full name being used. ""I am sick to the back teeth with this carry on. I'm elderly now and I've seen a lot through the Troubles. The vast majority of people in Creggan do not want this thuggery. ""A friend from England called me to ask how I was. All I could say was: 'Planting flowers and avoiding bombs'."" The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has said, on a number of occasions, that it believes most of the violence in Creggan is orchestrated and that some of the young people are being exploited by paramilitaries. A bomb, containing commercial explosives, was found in a car on Monday At the heart of Creggan there's a school. Not too far from the school gates is a sign saying ""informants will be shot"". Some community workers act as mediators with dissident republicans on a regular basis in order to prevent further violence. The anti-British and anti-police messages are clearly visible when you arrive in the area. Many families were also directly affected during Northern Ireland's conflict -known as The Troubles. One community worker told BBC News NI that dissident republicans - who are prepared to use violence to achieve their aim of a united Ireland - ""like to think they are recruiting young people to push their message forward"". Timeline of Irish dissident activity PSNI numbers at 'dangerous' level says former chief PSNI chief Simon Byrne calls for more officers The New IRA admitted carrying out themurder of journalist Lyra McKeein April in Creggan. One 24-year-old woman says she was standing ""a couple of hundred yards"" from where Ms McKee was shot. The woman, who wanted to remain anonymous, told BBC News NI she was by no means happy with the fact that Ms McKee was killed, but that she did support the PSNI being attacked with petrol bombs. ""A lot of people don't realise what we go through here. I have no job. My family went through a lot during the Troubles. I feel strongly about them leaving us alone in Creggan."" Lyra McKee wanted to write about the affects of violence on young people in Derry The woman was able to show BBC News NI footage on her phone of the police being targeted in recent months and years. ""We share it in group chats. We don't appreciate their attendance here during the day or at night. I know I don't speak for every young person."" A PSNI spokesperson said: ""We are there for the safety of all communities."" A 25-year-old man walks past Creggan shops listening to music. He is on his way to a body combat class in the local community centre. ""I struggle to understand why some of the young people want to cause bother,"" he says. ""I've lived here all my life, too. I went into the town on Monday night to get away from it all. All I can say to them is: 'Move on'. There are better things to be doing in Creggan and across the city."" Graffiti features on a number of walls throughout Creggan and across the city Outside the community centre, known locally as the corn beef tin, are five women having a cigarette. They are waiting for one of their weekly classes to start. ""I've lived here since I was born and there are many, many positive people here in Creggan,"" Karen Doherty says. ""Negative headlines are broadcast about us around the world and it makes me feel sick to the stomach. The good things never get discussed. There are many wonderful people here and things to do. ""Yes, there are big issues, but it involves a small minority. We are a close community. ""During the Troubles there were soldiers here, bombs and tanks, but we were almost safer then than we are now. I'm not sure if it's because we were immune to it back then, but the young people now are uncontrollable."" Kathleen Dalzell (left) and Karen Doherty have lived in Creggan all of their lives Kathleen Dalzell says some of the young people in Creggan are being exploited. ""There's a bigger picture here,"" she adds. ""Those dissidents need to back off. No one in Derry wants to see this. I had a great upbringing here. ""We all help each other out in the hour of need. That's the real Creggan."" Fr Joseph Gormley is based at St Mary's in Creggan Fr Joseph Gormley, who was called to the scene of Lyra McKee's shooting, says had the bomb on Monday not been found and diffused, ""we could have had another loss of life"". ""This community has been through a lot,"" Fr Gormley adds. ""Many people are knackered and fed up with the constant negative headlines but we can't shy away from the fact these things are happening. ""Those responsible should be able to see that Creggan does not want to go backwards. Let Creggan flourish the way it deserves to.""

"This video can not be played Abqaiq is the site of Aramco's largest oil processing plant Saudi Arabia has cut oil and gas production following drone attacks on two major oil facilities run by state-owned company Aramco. Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said the strikes had reduced crude oil production by 5.7m barrels a day - about half the kingdom's output. A Yemeni Houthi rebel spokesman said it had deployed 10 drones in the attacks. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed the attacks on Iran saying there was no evidence they came from Yemen. The Saudis lead a Western-backed military coalition supporting Yemen's government, while Iran backs the Houthi rebels. In a statement carried by the Saudi Press Agency (SPA), Prince Abdulaziz said the attacks ""resulted in a temporary suspension of production at Abqaiq and Khurais plants"". He said that part of the reduction would be compensated for by drawing on Aramco's oil stocks. The situation was under control at both facilities, Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said, adding that no casualties had been reported in the attacks. In a tweet, Mike Pompeo described the attack as ""an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""We call on all nations to publicly and unequivocally condemn Iran's attacks,"" Mr Pompeo added. The US would work with its allies to ensure energy markets remain well supplied and ""Iran is held accountable for its aggression"", he added. Tensions between the US and Iran have escalated since Mr Trump abandoned a deal limiting Iran's nuclear activities last year and reinstated sanctions. The Houthi spokesman, Yahya Sarea, told al-Masirah TV, which is owned by the Houthi movement and is based in Beirut, that further attacks could be expected in the future. He said Saturday's attack was one of the biggest operations the Houthi forces had undertaken inside Saudi Arabia and was carried out in ""co-operation with the honourable people inside the kingdom"". TV footage showed a huge blaze at Abqaiq, site of Aramco's largest oil processing plant, while a second drone attack started fires in the Khurais oilfield. ""At 04:00 (01:00 GMT), the industrial security teams of Aramco started dealing with fires at two of its facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais as a result of... drones,"" the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported. ""The two fires have been controlled."" Later, the SPA reported that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had told US President Donald Trump in a telephone conversation that the kingdom was ""willing and able to confront and deal with this terrorist aggression"". The White House said Mr Trump had offered US support to help Saudi Arabia defend itself. United Nations envoy Martin Griffiths described the attacks as ""extremely worrying"" in a statement in which he called on all parties in the Yemen conflict to exercise restraint.+ Abqaiq is about 60km (37 miles) south-west of Dhahran in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province, while Khurais, some 200km further south-west, has the country's second largest oilfield. Saudi security forces foiled an attempt by al-Qaeda to attack the Abqaiq facility with suicide bombers in 2006. Analysis by BBC business correspondent Katie Prescott Aramco is not only the world's biggest oil producer, it is also one of the world's most profitable businesses. The Khurais oilfield produces about 1% of the world's oil, and Abqaiq is the company's largest facility - with the capacity to process 7% of the global supply. Even a brief or partial disruption could affect the company, and the oil supply, given their size. There was a sharp intake of breath as analysts I spoke to today digested the information that reports suggest that half of Saudi Arabia's oil production could have been knocked offline by these attacks. The country produces 10% of the world's crude oil. Cutting this in half could have a significant effect on the oil price come Monday when markets open. The success of the drone strike shows the vulnerability of Aramco's infrastructure, at a time when it is trying to show itself in its best light while gearing up to float on the stock market. And it raises concerns that escalating tensions in the region could pose a broader risk to oil, potentially threatening the fifth of the world's supply that goes through the critical Strait of Hormuz. This latest attack underlines the strategic threat posed by the Houthis to Saudi Arabia's oil installations. The growing sophistication of the Houthis' drone operations is bound to renew the debate as to where this capability comes from. Have the Houthis simply weaponised commercial civilian drones or have they had significant assistance from Iran? The Trump administration is likely to point the finger squarely at Tehran, but experts vary in the extent to which they think Iran is facilitating the drone campaign. The Saudi air force has been pummelling targets in Yemen for years. Now the Houthis have a capable, if much more limited, ability to strike back. It shows that the era of armed drone operations being restricted to a handful of major nations is now over. Drone technology, albeit of varying degrees of sophistication, is available to all - from the US to  China, Israel and Iran - and from the Houthis to Hezbollah. The Iran-aligned Houthi rebel movement has been fighting the Yemeni government and a Saudi-led coalition. Yemen has been at war since 2015, when President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi was forced to flee the capital Sanaa by the Houthis. Saudi Arabia backs President Hadi, and has led a coalition of regional countries against the rebels. Yemen conflict explained in 400 words Why is there a war in Yemen? Yemen war: Has anything been achieved? The coalition launches air strikes almost every day, while the Houthis often fire missiles into Saudi Arabia. Mr Sarea, the Houthi group's military spokesman, told al-Masirah that operations against Saudi targets would ""only grow wider and will be more painful than before, so long as their aggression and blockade continues"". Saudi-led coalition air strikes regularly target Houthis in Yemen Houthi fighters were blamed for drone attacks on the Shaybah natural gas liquefaction facility last month, and on other oil facilities in May. There have been other sources of tension in the region, often stemming from the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Saudi Arabia and the US both blamed Iran for attacks in the Gulf on two oil tankers in June and July, allegations Tehran denied. Gulf of Oman tanker attacks: What we know Iran-US tensions: What's going on? In May four tankers, two of them Saudi-flagged, were damaged by explosions within the UAE's territorial waters in the Gulf of Oman. Tension in the vital shipping lanes worsened when Iran shot down a US surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz in June, leading a month later to the Pentagon announcingthe deployment of US troops to Saudi Arabia.

The US would work with its allies to ensure energy markets remained well supplied and ""Iran is held accountable for its aggression"", he added. The White House said Mr Trump had offered US support to help Saudi Arabia defend itself. Mr Pompeo provided no specific evidence to back up his accusations. They do follow a pattern of the US blaming Iran for recent attacks involving oil supplies in the region. A Nasa satellite image shows smoke from fires following the drone attacks The US said Iran was behind attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf in June and July, as well as on another four in May. Tehran rejected the accusations in both cases. Gulf of Oman tanker attacks: What we know Iran-US tensions: What's going on? If the rebels had deployed the drones from Yemen, they would have to have flown hundreds of miles. One element of the Houthi statement on the attacks did however thank ""co-operation with the honourable people inside the kingdom"". The Wall Street Journal has said experts are investigating whether the attacks could have been carried out from the north - either by Iran or its Shia allies in Iraq - using cruise missiles rather than drones. If so, it seems unlikely they would have escaped detection. This video can not be played The BBC's Frank Gardner looks at the evidence the US says proves Iran's involvement in attacks on two tankers in June The Washington Post said the US government believed that 15 buildings at Abqaiq had been damaged on the west-northwest sides, not the southern sides facing Yemen. A 2018 UN report concluded that the Houthis' Qatef-1 suicide drone was ""virtually identical"" to Iran's Ababil-T. The Ababil-T is considered a low-tech drone with a maximum range of about 150km (93 miles). The distance from the nearest point of the Saudi Arabia-Yemen border to the closest target - Khurais - is about 770km. On Sunday, Iraq denied its territory had been used to launch the attacks. Foreign Minister Javad Zarif replied on Twitter, saying that ""having failed at max pressure, Sec Pompeo's turning to max deceit"". He was referring to the Trump administration's stated ""maximum pressure campaign"" targeting the Iranian regime with sanctions. Mr Zarif said that ""blaming Iran won't end the disaster"" in Yemen. Earlier, foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said that Mr Pompeo's ""blind accusations and remarks are incomprehensible and meaningless"". Mr Mousavi said Saudi Arabia had ""repeatedly violated Yemen"" and that the ""Yemenis have shown resistance to aggression"". It has provided very little information from the two sites. A spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition fighting in Yemen said investigations were still ongoing to determine who had carried them out. Officials have said there were no casualties. Saudi state media reported that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had told President Trump in a telephone conversation that the kingdom was ""willing and able to confront and deal with this terrorist aggression"". The Tadawul All-Shares Index lost 200 points when it opened on Sunday, but had checked the 3% fall to about a 1% loss by midday.

"Few young people have been seen voting Polling booths have closed in Tunisia, which is holding its second free presidential poll since the 2011 uprising that toppled ex-president Ben Ali and sparked the Arab Spring. Twenty-six candidates, including two women, are running in the election. Exit polls suggest an independent outsider, Kais Saied, has done well in the first round of votes. Turnout has been low at 45%, despite an earlier call for young Tunisians to get out and vote. The election was brought forwardafter the death in July of Beji Caid Essebsi, the first democratically elected president, who took office in 2014. It is widely viewed as a test of one of the world's youngest democracies, but there were reports that few of those travelling to polling booths were young. ""Where are the young people? This is their country, their future,"" Adil Toumi, a man in his 60s who came to vote, told the AFP news agency. Official results are not expected until Tuesday. The outcome is difficult to predict but early exit polls suggest that Kais Saied, a 61-year-old law professor and independent, and Nabil Karoui - a media magnate currently in jail - could be well placed to make it to the second round. Tunisia: What you need to know Obituary: The world's oldest sitting president Mr Essebsi won Tunisia's first free presidential elections in 2014 and was credited with largely maintaining stability in the country during his almost five-year rule. At 92, he was the oldest sitting president in the world at the time of his death. Mr Essebsi had previously confirmed that he was not planning to run for re-election. His wife, Chadlia Saida Farhat, died on Sunday morning, aged 83, their son announced on Facebook as voting was getting under way. Parliament speaker Mohamed Ennaceur is currently acting as interim president. A candidate needs a majority of votes to win the election. If no-one gets a majority in the first round, the two candidates with most votes will face a second, decisive round. Presidential candidates have held campaign events across the country The winning candidate will be appointed to office for a five-year term. The constitution states that Tunisia's president has control over defence, foreign policy and national security. The prime minister, chosen by parliament, is responsible for other portfolios. Parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place in October. Some of the most prominent candidates include: Youssef Chahed: He became Tunisia's youngest-ever prime minister when he took office in 2016. Since then, the 43-year-old has carried out a series of cuts to public spending in a bid to reduce Tunisia's public debt. He has banned the wearing of the niqab, which covers the entire face apart from the eyes, in government offices, citing security reasons. Mr Chahed split from the government and formed his own secular party, Tahya Tounes (Long Live Tunisia), earlier this year. Nabil Karoui:The 56-year-old media mogul is running for office from behind bars after being detained last month on charges of money laundering and tax fraud, which he has denied. He founded a charity focused on fighting poverty - a central theme of his campaign. Critics have accused him of using the charity and his TV channel to further his political ambitions. On Saturday, a court rejected his request to be freed from detention pending a verdict in his case. He is still able to stand for election despite his arrest, but will not be able to vote unless he is allowed out of prison.  He began a hunger strike earlier this week to demand his freedom. Abdelfattah Mourou: He is the Tunisian lawyer who co-founded the moderate Islamist Ennahda party, which was banned for decades before the uprising. The 71-year-old is the first presidential candidate for Ennahda, which is now the largest party in Tunisia. Abir Moussi: One of two female candidates in the running, Ms Moussi is a 43-year-old lawyer who was a supporter of Tunisia's ousted ruler Ben Ali. She is known for her opposition to Tunisia's Islamists and has reportedly said she wants to change the constitution to ban parties based on religion. Abdelkarim Zbidi:The 69-year-old is a trained medical doctor who studied in France and has held the post of defence minister twice since 2011. He was a close friend of the late president, Essebsi. In a recent interview with Reuters news agency, he said he wanted to amend the constitution to end the ""unreasonable"" division of power between the prime minister and president. Moncef Marzouki:He was Tunisia's provisional leader after the Arab Spring uprising and Mr Marzouki now wants to take up the role of president again. The former human rights activist and opposition leader has accused other candidates of ""fighting each other with methods unworthy of democracy."" He told the Associated Press news agency that dirty money was his ""most formidable rival"". The country has won praise as the only democracy to emerge from the Arab Spring uprisings that began in Tunisia, before spreading across the Middle East and North Africa. In what was hailed as a sign of its successful democratic transition, Tunisia this month held its first-ever televised debate of presidential candidates. The campaign period featured the first ever televised debate of presidential candidates However, it has not all been smooth sailing. In recent years, the country has suffered attacks by Islamists and economic problems, with unemployment a persistent issue. In 2018, protesters across the country took to the streets to oppose the government's austerity measures. Prime Minister Youssef Chahed told Reuters news agency that economic opportunities must improve ""if Tunisia is to join the club of strong democracy"". The revolution that didn't deliver for women Arab uprisings: Which country could be next? Tunisia is the birthplace of what has become known as the Arab Spring uprisings. Widespread discontent at economic hardship, decades of autocratic rule and corruption erupted into mass demonstrations in December 2010 after a street vendor set himself on fire when officials confiscated his cart. The unrest led to the ousting in 2011 of President Ben Ali, who had been in power for 23 years. Three years later,Tunisia's parliament approved a new constitution, which detailed how the new democracy would be run. The text was hailed by the United Nations as a ""historic milestone"". Significant aspects included the recognition of equality between men and women, guaranteeing personal freedoms and splitting power between the president and prime minister.

"This video can not be played Sam Gyimah is introduced as a Lib Dem MP at their party conference Former Conservative MP Sam Gyimah has joined the Liberal Democrats. Six MPs have defected to the party in recent weeks, including former Tory MP Philip Lee, and ex-Labour MPs Luciana Berger and Chuka Umunna. Mr Gyimah was one of the 21 Tories who had the Conservative whip removed after rebelling against Boris Johnson in a bid to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Last December, the East Surrey MP quit as science and universities minister in a row over Theresa May's Brexit deal. The 43-year-old briefly stood in the race to become Conservative Party leader after Mrs May quit. The Lib Dems currently have 18 MPs, having been boosted by a victory in theBrecon and Radnorshire by-electionand the defections. Five things to look out for at Lib Dem conference Lib Dem members to vote on 'scrap Brexit' policy Mr Gyimah told BBC News that ""the hard Brexiteers have won in the Conservative party - it is a hard Brexit party"". ""There just aren't enough Conservatives like me,"" he said, explaining his decision to join the Liberal Democrats. ""If I want to fight for the values for which I came into politics.. the values of tolerance, the values of being sensible and pragmatic and acting in the interest of the country, then the Liberal Democrats is where I can do that from."" Not long ago at Westminster, if you were on the hunt for a smile, you wouldn't bother with the Lib Dems. There weren't many of them, for a start, and those left were the last survivors of a near apocalypse for the party; shrivelled, ignored and drowned out. Not any more. They are bouncy, tiggerish and expanding. They hope their clarity on Brexit - win an election and scrap it - will win favour with Remain inclined voters who may find Labour's pitch rather more ambiguous. But their newbies face a big challenge: can they, realistically, win the seats they currently hold as Liberal Democrats? Or will they go hunting for more fertile Lib Dem territory elsewhere - potentially dislodging long standing local party stalwarts? Addressing the Liberal Democrats conference in Bournemouth, Mr Gyimah said: ""There is now no orderly way for the UK to leave the EU on October 31. ""If the prime minister got a deal at the European Council on October 17 and 18, it would not be possible for us to leave on October 31 in an orderly way."" He added that the government has been left in a position where ""no-deal"" is the only outcome that can be delivered. He said he had been ""disheartened"" by the way the whipping process ""had been framed... for us MPs to choose our careers, in other words our own salaries, over putting the country first."" Mr Gyimah, who has been sitting as an Independent after losing the Conservative whip, has been a prominent advocate for a second referendum. He previously signalled his intention to stand as an independent candidate in East Surrey in the event of a snap general election. Mr Gyimah was born in Beaconsfield, in Buckinghamshire. When he was six years old, his parents split up and he moved with his mother to her native Ghana, while his father remained in the UK. He attended Achimota school, a state school in the capital of Accra, before returning to the UK to complete his GCSEs and A-levels at Freman College, a comprehensive in Hertfordshire. Mr Gyimah went on to win a place at Somerville College, Oxford, to read philosophy, politics and economics (PPE), and served as president of the Oxford Union in 1997. An Arsenal fan, he worked for Goldman Sachs for five years as an investment banker before moving into politics, standing unsuccessfully for Camden council elections in 2006. In 2010 he became the MP for East Surrey and had been in Westminster for two years when he was made parliamentary private secretary to the then PM David Cameron. He went on to become a government whip in 2013 and childcare and education minister a year later, before becoming prisons minister in 2016 and universities minister after that. The married father-of-two quit as universities minister in December last year over Theresa May's Brexit deal. He was introduced to delegates at the conference by the party's leader Jo Swinson as the ""newest Liberal Democrat MP"". Speaking to the conference, Mr Gyimah said he did not take the decision to join the Lib Dems lightly and had started reconsidering his position in the Tories while Mrs May negotiated her deal with the EU. But he said his concerns with the Conservative party now ""go beyond Brexit"". ""The values we have taken for granted for so long in our country... are under threat,"" Mr Gyimah said. ""What Jo and I discussed are the Liberal Democrats have a unique opportunity to fight to defend those values and create a new force in British politics. That is why I find myself here today."" He said ""the problem is not just on the Conservative side. When I look across the aisle, I also see on the Labour benches the same issue I have seen on the Conservative side, a doctrinaire, intolerant approach which means centrists are being squeezed out"". Mr Gyimah's move was welcomed by Lib Dem MPs. Mr Umunna tweeted he was ""absolutely delighted"" and Layla Moran said: ""Welcome... So delighted to have you on the team"". Allow Twitter content?

Chris White, a former government adviser, told the BBC it was ""extremely disappointing"" to see Mr Gyimah join the Lib Dems because he ""stood on a manifesto pledge to deliver the referendum and here he is switching to a party which is manifestly not going to do that"". A bid by Mr Johnson for an autumn general election has so far been rejected by MPs who wanted to first make sure a bill designed to avoid a no-deal Brexit became law. But since the bill, which seeks to force Mr Johnson to ask for a extension to the deadline, has been given Royal Assent, opposition MPs are preparing to start their general election campaigns. As the Lib Dem conference opened, Ms Swinson said the party's anti-Brexit message should be ""unequivocal"" in a general election campaign. She expressed her hopes that members would back her policy proposal of scrapping Brexit without another referendum.

"This video can not be played Abqaiq is the site of Aramco's largest oil processing plant Saudi Arabia has cut oil and gas production following drone attacks on two major oil facilities run by state-owned company Aramco. Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said the strikes had reduced crude oil production by 5.7m barrels a day - about half the kingdom's output. A Yemeni Houthi rebel spokesman said it had deployed 10 drones in the attacks. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed the attacks on Iran saying there was no evidence they came from Yemen. The Saudis lead a Western-backed military coalition supporting Yemen's government, while Iran backs the Houthi rebels. In a statement carried by the Saudi Press Agency (SPA), Prince Abdulaziz said the attacks ""resulted in a temporary suspension of production at Abqaiq and Khurais plants"". He said that part of the reduction would be compensated for by drawing on Aramco's oil stocks. The situation was under control at both facilities, Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said, adding that no casualties had been reported in the attacks. In a tweet, Mike Pompeo described the attack as ""an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""We call on all nations to publicly and unequivocally condemn Iran's attacks,"" Mr Pompeo added. The US would work with its allies to ensure energy markets remain well supplied and ""Iran is held accountable for its aggression"", he added. Tensions between the US and Iran have escalated since Mr Trump abandoned a deal limiting Iran's nuclear activities last year and reinstated sanctions. The Houthi spokesman, Yahya Sarea, told al-Masirah TV, which is owned by the Houthi movement and is based in Beirut, that further attacks could be expected in the future. He said Saturday's attack was one of the biggest operations the Houthi forces had undertaken inside Saudi Arabia and was carried out in ""co-operation with the honourable people inside the kingdom"". TV footage showed a huge blaze at Abqaiq, site of Aramco's largest oil processing plant, while a second drone attack started fires in the Khurais oilfield. ""At 04:00 (01:00 GMT), the industrial security teams of Aramco started dealing with fires at two of its facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais as a result of... drones,"" the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported. ""The two fires have been controlled."" Later, the SPA reported that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had told US President Donald Trump in a telephone conversation that the kingdom was ""willing and able to confront and deal with this terrorist aggression"". The White House said Mr Trump had offered US support to help Saudi Arabia defend itself. United Nations envoy Martin Griffiths described the attacks as ""extremely worrying"" in a statement in which he called on all parties in the Yemen conflict to exercise restraint.+ Abqaiq is about 60km (37 miles) south-west of Dhahran in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province, while Khurais, some 200km further south-west, has the country's second largest oilfield. Saudi security forces foiled an attempt by al-Qaeda to attack the Abqaiq facility with suicide bombers in 2006. Analysis by BBC business correspondent Katie Prescott Aramco is not only the world's biggest oil producer, it is also one of the world's most profitable businesses. The Khurais oilfield produces about 1% of the world's oil, and Abqaiq is the company's largest facility - with the capacity to process 7% of the global supply. Even a brief or partial disruption could affect the company, and the oil supply, given their size. There was a sharp intake of breath as analysts I spoke to today digested the information that reports suggest that half of Saudi Arabia's oil production could have been knocked offline by these attacks. The country produces 10% of the world's crude oil. Cutting this in half could have a significant effect on the oil price come Monday when markets open. The success of the drone strike shows the vulnerability of Aramco's infrastructure, at a time when it is trying to show itself in its best light while gearing up to float on the stock market. And it raises concerns that escalating tensions in the region could pose a broader risk to oil, potentially threatening the fifth of the world's supply that goes through the critical Strait of Hormuz. This latest attack underlines the strategic threat posed by the Houthis to Saudi Arabia's oil installations. The growing sophistication of the Houthis' drone operations is bound to renew the debate as to where this capability comes from. Have the Houthis simply weaponised commercial civilian drones or have they had significant assistance from Iran? The Trump administration is likely to point the finger squarely at Tehran, but experts vary in the extent to which they think Iran is facilitating the drone campaign. The Saudi air force has been pummelling targets in Yemen for years. Now the Houthis have a capable, if much more limited, ability to strike back. It shows that the era of armed drone operations being restricted to a handful of major nations is now over. Drone technology, albeit of varying degrees of sophistication, is available to all - from the US to  China, Israel and Iran - and from the Houthis to Hezbollah. The Iran-aligned Houthi rebel movement has been fighting the Yemeni government and a Saudi-led coalition. Yemen has been at war since 2015, when President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi was forced to flee the capital Sanaa by the Houthis. Saudi Arabia backs President Hadi, and has led a coalition of regional countries against the rebels. Yemen conflict explained in 400 words Why is there a war in Yemen? Yemen war: Has anything been achieved? The coalition launches air strikes almost every day, while the Houthis often fire missiles into Saudi Arabia. Mr Sarea, the Houthi group's military spokesman, told al-Masirah that operations against Saudi targets would ""only grow wider and will be more painful than before, so long as their aggression and blockade continues"". Saudi-led coalition air strikes regularly target Houthis in Yemen Houthi fighters were blamed for drone attacks on the Shaybah natural gas liquefaction facility last month, and on other oil facilities in May. There have been other sources of tension in the region, often stemming from the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Saudi Arabia and the US both blamed Iran for attacks in the Gulf on two oil tankers in June and July, allegations Tehran denied. Gulf of Oman tanker attacks: What we know Iran-US tensions: What's going on? In May four tankers, two of them Saudi-flagged, were damaged by explosions within the UAE's territorial waters in the Gulf of Oman. Tension in the vital shipping lanes worsened when Iran shot down a US surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz in June, leading a month later to the Pentagon announcingthe deployment of US troops to Saudi Arabia.
