"This video can not be played The Covid uncertainty is ""awful"", pub owner Sian Shepphard says Pubs, restaurants and bars will be subject to stricter Covid-19 restrictions in the run up to Christmas, the first minister has said. The new restrictions, which have not yet been finalised, will come into force from Friday, 4 December. They may be based on the system in some parts of Scotland where no alcohol can be served. Cinemas, bowling alleys and indoor entertainment venues will also have to shut before the festive break. A date for these to close has not yet been agreed. Mark Drakeford said action was needed as case rates continued to rise in the run up to Christmas. But the Welsh Conservatives said any new restrictions would be a ""real blow"" for businesses who had already ""suffered greatly"", while Plaid Cymru said the lack of detail was leaving employers unable to prepare. Pubs, bars and restaurants had only reopened on 9 November after the Wales-wide 17-day lockdown, and are currently made to close at 22:00 GMT. Ahead of the announcement people working in the hospitality industry had warned any further restrictionsbefore Christmas would be a ""big blow"". Plans for the new rules have not yet been finalised, but BBC Wales understands one option being considered is the ""level three"" Scottish system, where venues are banned from selling alcohol and have to close at 18:00. The R rate - the number of people each infected person passed the virus on to - has risen again to 1.4 in Wales, with the rate needing to be below one for the number of cases to fall. This video can not be played ""We need to reduce Covid spread before Christmas"" In England about55 million people are being placed under the tightest level of lockdown rules from 2 December, when an England-wide lockdown ends and a new tiered system is introduced. Speaking at the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said Wales had to use the ""coming weeks"" to reduce the spread of the virus, to ""create more headroom for the Christmas period"". Mr Drakeford said while case rates had fallen following the 17-day firebreak, as people had resumed socialising it they had risen ""faster and further than we anticipated"", and action was needed. A further major package of financial support for businesses affected will be announced on Monday ""This does not mean a return to the firebreak arrangements, but the cabinet has agreed to take further specific and targeted action to reinforce the current national measures we have place,"" he said. Mr Drakeford said he could ""not rule anything out for the future"" in a bid to curb the spread of the virus. Non-essential retail, hairdressers, gyms and leisure centres will stay open, it was confirmed. Speaking of the new measures for pubs, bars and restaurants, Mr Drakeford added: ""I know this will be a worrying time for all working in the industry. ""We will be working over the weekend with partners to finalise the details of the new arrangements and to put in place a further major package of financial support to respond to those changes. ""I will give further details about the package on Monday."" Claire Vaughan, programme manager at Chapter cinema in Cardiff, said: ""Globally no cases of coronavirus have been traced back to a visit to the cinema. ""Cinemas are a low-risk way of spending time outside the house at a time when the mental health of people in Wales is a huge concern. People will watch Mared Williams outside the venue ""Masks are worn, there are air circulation units and no one is facing another person... Not everyone is living in a warm, safe home - many people need these spaces to be open."" Liam Evans-Ford, Theatr Clwyd's executive director, added the announcement had been a ""huge surprise"". ""This is devastating for our business, for our employees, for our freelancers and for our communities,"" he said. Sian Shepphard, owner of the Horse and Jockey in Pontypool, opened the pub in August so has not been eligible for government support. Sian Shepphard is worried about her staff ""The main problem is we are trying to get people to stay at home but it is ruining our businesses,"" she said. ""I employ over 25 staff here - we are a really family-run business. We are all family - how am I supposed to put food on the table for them?"" Phil James, a customer at the pub, said the potential changes would affect his Christmas plans. ""We just don't know what arrangement to make at the end of the day - people have to know. You come out to socialise - people want to be social for Christmas, alcohol is a part of it."" Phil James says pubs play a big part in his festive celebrations Simon Buckley, chairman of The Brewers of Wales, said: ""Is this finally the straw that will break the industry's back? ""We as an industry are being thrown to the wind, and the looming prospect of significant job losses seems to count for nothing."" Plaid's economy spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones said: ""They [pubs and restaurants] don't know if they're being asked to close altogether again, to only do takeaways, to have restricted opening without alcohol. ""So, they can't really prepare. They need to be given the maximum length of time to prepare."" Clwyd West member of the Senedd Darren Millar called for a targeted rather than a Wales-wide blanket approach. ""It is grossly unfair to impose the same level of restrictions in Conwy and Denbighshire as Covid-19 hotspots in south Wales,"" he said. ""The virus is circulating at different rates in different parts of the country."" Mr Drakeford insisted there were no plans to introduce regionalised ""tiered"" restrictions, similar to those coming into force in England. He said there was no case for aligning the Welsh and English systems to ensure no-one was left out of UK-wide Treasury schemes that offer financial assistance to businesses affected by lockdown measures. ""We don't lose out on any UK system by having a single tier for Wales, so there is no disadvantage to us in that,"" he said. He added: ""The advice we have is that a single set of arrangements for Wales works best, is easiest to communicate and delivers benefits in all parts of Wales."" Pembrokeshire councillor John Davies welcomed the restrictions after a spike in cases in his ward, Cilgerran, linked to the recent outbreak in nearby Cardigan. He told Newyddion 9: ""If people aren't willing to exercise common sense and be citizens of responsibility towards each other, there is no other option. ""We've seen what happens in this part of the world when people act in a selfish manner."" Children are currently in ""class bubbles"" during school Mr Drakeford said he had no plans to allow schools to close early for Christmas. Teaching union UCAC hadcalled for classrooms to be shuton 11 December and for lessons to be moved online amid fears teachers and pupils may have to isolate on Christmas Day. But Mr Drakeford said ministers would do ""everything we can"" to keep schools working up until the Christmas holiday. He added: ""It is more important for our children not to miss out further on the education that is planned for them for the whole of the rest of this term and that's what we will be working to achieve.""

"Drinkers visiting pubs in tier two regions will have to leave when they finish eating, under new restrictions being introduced from 2 December, No 10 has confirmed. Under the post-lockdown guidance, pubs in those high risk areas can only open if they function as a restaurant. And alcohol can only be served as part of a ""substantial meal"". Pubs and restaurants are currently closed across England, apart from for takeaways. What are you allowed to do in each tier? Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier? Has England's lockdown worked? The prime minister's official spokesman, asked how long drinkers can stay in a pub after buying a meal, said: ""We've been clear that, in tier two I believe, that you need to have a substantial meal if ordering any alcohol and it remains the case that the guidance says that once the meal is finished, it is at that point [you have to leave]."" People can currently meet in Wales for a drink When the current lockdown ends, the rules will change according to where you live. In tier two regions, pubs and restaurants must shut at 23:00 GMT, with last orders an hour earlier. You can only socialise inside with people you live with, or those in your support bubble if you live alone. Groups of up to six can meet outside, but social distancing must be adhered to. In tier three, very high risk areas, you cannot mix with anyone outside your household either indoors or in pub gardens or private gardens. Hospitality venues - such as bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants - must stay closed, except for delivery and takeaway services. In tier one, medium level, people can meet inside or outside in groups of up to six. Most of England is in tier two or three, however, with only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly in tier one. 'Rules have changed in the middle of the game' Stricter measures for pubs, restaurants and bars willcome into force in Waleson 4 December, it was announced on Friday. Northern Ireland is currently in a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, with cafes, coffee shops, pubs, bars and restaurants closed, except for takeaways and deliveries. And in Scotland, the rules on pubs and restaurants depend where your region is placed in the four-tier system.

"Quizzes rather than board games are one of the recommendations from scientists for a Covid-safe Christmas. Earlier this week,the government announced up to three households will be allowed to form a ""Christmas bubble""from 23 to 27 December. But the government's scientific advisory committee, Sage, warns coronavirus could easily spread during the festive relaxation of the rules. They say people should still weigh up if an event could be postponed. If not, meeting online or outdoors where the risks of transmission are lower, could be a better option. But if you do go ahead, they say, it's important to include everyone taking part in drawing up a plan for how to manage the event. Covid: How to keep the virus at bay this Christmas Christmas Covid rules: Who are you allowed to see? Christmas Covid rules 'not an instruction to meet up' They highlight the particular importance of involving women in the decision-making. The document says:,external""Women carry the burden of creating and maintaining family traditions and activities at Christmas. ""Messaging should be supportive of women adapting traditions and encouraging those around them to share the burden and to be supportive of any alterations to adapt for Covid-19 restrictions."" The advisers recognise that negotiating these arrangements may ""create tensions"". But they suggest a series of measures, ranging from minimising the numbers getting together to keeping events brief to avoiding physical contact. Maintaining social distancing, keeping surfaces clean and opening windows to allow in fresh air are all highlighted. There are also practical suggestions: Children should meet their grandparents outside where possible If staying overnight, children should share bedrooms with their parents, not the children of another household Be aware of the risk of spreading the virus by board games which involve lots of shared pieces - maybe try quiz games instead But there's a warning that no single measure will guarantee that Christmas is risk-free. Scientists warn that, within households, one infected person can pass the virus to as many as 50% of the rest. And they say that the spread of the disease could multiply as the newly-infected people return to their usual lives after the break. In one paper,external, the advisers spell out that ""this is not a theoretical risk"". They point to earlier research into how other respiratory diseases such as pneumonia increase as older family members are exposed during the school holidays. That's why they conclude that cases are set to rise. ""The prevalence could easily double during a few days of the festive season, with further multiplicative increases as new infections go back to their ""routine"" networks."" Anotherdocument published by Sage,externalmakes clear that most coronavirus infections happen during prolonged indoor gatherings of people who are familiar with each other. That creates what's called an ""intimacy paradox"" in which we let our guard down because we don't see our loved ones as a potential dangers. Covid: What can and should you do this Christmas?

"This video can not be played President Trump once again alleged ""massive fraud"" without evidence to reporters on Thanksgiving A US federal appeals court has firmly rejected the Trump campaign's attempt to block President-elect Joe Biden from being declared winner in Pennsylvania. The panel of three judges deemed the case was without merit, saying the Trump campaign had not made specific allegations or provided proof. The ruling is another major setback for President Trump in his attempts to overturn the 3 November election. On Thursday he said he would give way if Mr Biden was declared the winner. But on Friday he again made unfounded allegations of ""massive voter fraud"", tweeting: ""Biden can only enter the White House as President if he can prove that his ridiculous '80,000,000 votes' were not fraudulently or illegally obtained."" The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals had been asked to consider a lower court's decision to dismiss the Trump campaign's attempts to invalidate millions of mail-in votes in Pennsylvania. The lower court ruling had paved the way for the battleground state to certify Joe Biden's win, giving him 20 vital electoral college votes and effectively the presidency. In giving the appeal court's opinion, Judge Stephanos Bibas wrote: ""Free, fair elections are the lifeblood of our democracy. Charges of unfairness are serious. But calling an election unfair does not make it so."" ""Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here,"" wrote Judge Bibas, who was nominated by Trump. Can Trump overturn the election result? Five US election fraud claims fact-checked What is the electoral college? Following the ruling, Trump campaign lawyer Jenna Ellis wrote: ""On to SCOTUS!"" referring to the Supreme Court. This video can not be played How to move on after the US election The Trump campaign has filed a slew of lawsuits alleging voter fraud in several states, but with little success. Mr Biden is projected to defeat President Trump 306 to 232 in the US electoral college, which determines who becomes president - far above the 270 he needs to win. How is President Trump challenging the result? Time is running out as states have until 8 December to resolve election disputes before the Electoral College meets on 14 December to formally declare the victor. President Trump's refusal to concede has upended the process that normally follows a US election.

"This video can not be played The road near Tehran where gunmen opened fire on Mohsen Fakhrizadeh Iran's most senior nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh has been assassinated near the capital Tehran, the country's defence ministry has confirmed. Fakhrizadeh died in hospital after an attack in Absard, in Damavand county. Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, has condemned the killing ""as an act of state terror"". Western intelligence agencies believe Fakhrizadeh was behind a covert Iranian nuclear weapons programme. ""If Iran ever chose to weaponise (enrichment), Fakhrizadeh would be known as the father of the Iranian bomb,"" one Western diplomat told Reuters news agency in 2014. Iran insists its nuclear programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes. But news of the killing comes amid fresh concern about the increased amount of enriched uranium that the country is producing. Enriched uranium is a vital component for both civil nuclear power generation and military nuclear weapons. Trump 'asked about attacking Iran nuclear site' Iran's enriched uranium stockpile '12 times limit' After Trump, what will Biden do about Iran? Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words A 2015 deal with six world powers had placed limits on its production, but since President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018, Iran has been deliberately reneging on its agreements. Joe Biden has pledged to reengage with Iran when he becomes US president in January, despite longstanding opposition from Israel . Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, pictured in an undated photo, was head of the ministry of defence's research and innovation organisation Between 2010 and 2012, four Iranian nuclear scientists were assassinated and Iran has accused Israel of complicity in the killings. Fakhrizadeh's name was specifically mentioned in Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's presentation about Iran's nuclear programme in April 2018. There has been no comment from Israel on the news of the assassination. The Pentagon has also declined to comment, according to Reuters. In a statement on Friday, Iran's defence ministry said: ""Armed terrorists targeted a vehicle carrying Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, head of the ministry's research and innovation organisation. ""After a clash between the terrorists and his bodyguards, Mr Fakhrizadeh was severely injured and rushed to hospital. ""Unfortunately, the medical team's efforts to save him were unsuccessful and minutes ago he passed away."" Iranian media reports said the attackers opened fire on the scientist in his car. Fars news agency earlier reported there was a car explosion in Absard town, with witnesses reporting that ""three to four individuals, who are said to have been terrorists, were killed"". By Paul Adams, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent As head of the ministry of defence's research and innovation organisation, Fakhrizadeh was clearly still a key player. Hence Benjamin Netanyahu's warning, two years ago, to ""remember his name"". Since Iran started breaching its commitments under the terms of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the country has moved ahead rapidly, building stockpiles of low-enriched uranium and enriching to a purity above the level permitted under the deal. Iranian officials have always said such moves are reversible, but developments in research and development are harder to eradicate. ""We cannot go backwards,"" Iran's former ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Ali Asghar Soltanieh, said recently. If Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was the key player Israel alleges, then his death could represent someone's effort to put the brakes on Iran's forward momentum. With the US president-elect, Joe Biden, talking about taking Washington back into the deal with Iran, the assassination could also be aimed at complicating any future negotiations. ""Terrorists murdered an eminent Iranian scientist today,""Iran's foreign minister said in a tweet,external. ""This cowardice - with serious indications of Israeli role - shows desperate warmongering of perpetrators."" Mr Zarif called on the international community to ""condemn this act of state terror"". The scene of the attack in Damavand, near Tehran The commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has said that Iran will avenge the killing of the scientist. ""Assassination of nuclear scientists is the most obvious violation of the global hegemony to prevent our access to modern sciences,"" said Maj Gen Hossein Salami. Former head of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), John Brennan, said the killing of the scientist was a ""criminal"" and ""highly reckless"" act that risks inflaming conflict in the region. In aseries of tweets,external, he said the scientist's death ""risks lethal retaliation and a new round of regional conflict"". Mr Brennan added that he did not know ""whether a foreign government authorised or carried out the murder of Fakhrizadeh"". Fakhrizadeh was the most renowned Iranian nuclear scientist and a senior officer of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. He has long been spoken about by Western security sources as extremely powerful and instrumental in Iran's nuclear programme. According to secret documents obtained by Israel in 2018, he led a programme to create nuclear weapons. At the time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he identified Fakhrizedeh as the head scientist in the programme, and urged people to ""remember that name"". This video can not be played In 2018, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled what he claimed to be Iran's secret atomic archive In 2015,the New York Times compared him to J. Robert Oppenheimer,external, the physicist who directed the Manhattan Project that during World War Two produced the first atomic weapons. A professor of physics, Fakhrizadeh is said to have led Project Amad, the alleged covert programme that was established in 1989 to research the potential for building a nuclear bomb. It was shut down in 2003, according to the IAEA, though Mr Netanyahu said the documents retrieved in 2018 showed Fakhrizadeh led a programme which secretly continued Project Amad's work. The IAEA has long wanted to speak to him as part of its investigations into Iran's nuclear programme. Suspicions that Iran was using the programme as a cover to develop a nuclear bomb prompted the EU, US and UN to impose crippling sanctions in 2010. The 2015 deal that Iran reached with the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany saw it limit its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief. Since President Donald Trump abandoned the deal, it has floundered. Earlier this month, the IAEA said Iran had more than 12 times the amount of enriched uranium than permitted under the deal. Meanwhile, tensions between the US and Iran have escalated, peaking in January with America's assassination of Gen Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' Quds force.

"Mass testing plans in England threaten to be a ""distraction"" from other priorities such as the rollout of a vaccine, health leaders have warned. The PM has said mass community testing, as seen in Liverpool,will be offered to all areasin tier three after lockdown ends. But experts have questioned whether this is possible due to the ""enormous"" resources it requires. The government said it will work with local authorities to support plans. In a joint statement, the Faculty of Public Health and the Association of Directors of Public Health said improving NHS Test and Trace must remain the top focus for testing. Where will mass testing be available? Hundreds get wrong results due to Covid test error PM: Tougher post-lockdown rules 'strike a balance' Mass testing of people without symptoms using new rapid ""lateral flow"" tests - which give a result in about 20 minutes, without the need for a lab - has been piloted in Liverpool. So far more than 100,000 people without symptoms have been tested using the new rapid tests, withjust over 700 positive results,external. Now thousands of rapid tests have been sent to more than 90 local authorities in England as part of an expansion of the Liverpool scheme, which was supported by 2,000 members of the military. One of those is Liverpool's neighbour, the borough of Sefton, which has half as many residents. But the area says it only has a team of 12 people to carry out mass testing and has been offered no other support. Postcode check - what is the new tier for your area? What are you allowed to do in each Covid tier? The Faculty of Public Health and the Association of Directors of Public Health said: ""The additional capacity provided to Liverpool to set up and manage testing sites alone has been enormous and it is difficult to envisage how or even whether this could be replicated at the pace being proposed across the country. ""This threatens to be a distraction from other activities, like planning and rolling out vaccines."" Their statement added: ""The key priority needs to be targeted community testing... in settings or locations of higher risk of transmission or where the consequence of infection is higher."" The government is asking local leaders and directors of public health in tier three to put forward proposals and said it will work with them to make sure they're resourced. It said it is not expecting to see Liverpool replicated up and down the country. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:What tests are available? Liverpool's mass testing pilot began earlier this month. Prof Louise Kenny, pro vice chancellor at Liverpool University, which is running the pilot scheme with the city council, said they were delighted with the results. ""It was a pilot, we had very few expectations about how it would turn out. But I'm really pleased by how the city has embraced it from all corners,"" she said. ""Yes, it's been lower in some areas but we're addressing that by making the testing more available, we assess what the barriers are, that's a work in progress. ""And I think the fact that we have identified over 700 of our residents who were positive, didn't know it, were at risk to their fellow citizens is a hugely encouraging thing.""

"The R number for coronavirus has fallen to between 0.9 and 1 for the first time since mid-August, which means the epidemic is thought to be no longer growing. 'R' is calculated by the government's scientific advisers,external, and represents how many extra people each infected person passes the virus onto. The aim is to keep R below 1 until a vaccine is rolled out. During the first peak in the spring, R was thought to be around 3. The latest estimate of the growth rate of the virus has also fallen, to between -2% and 0%, which indicates that the number of new infections each day is coming down. On Friday in the UK, 521 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test,external. There were also 16,022 new cases reported - a 25% fall on the previous week. However cases in some regions of England are still high, particularly the North West, the North East and Yorkshire and the Humber. When lockdown ends on 2 December,most of England will move into the two toughest tiers of restrictions. What is the UK's R number and why does it matter? How many cases are there in your area? When does lockdown actually end? And other questions An R or reproduction number of 1 means that, on average, every person with the virus will infect one other person. So an R number between 0.9 and 1.0 means that on average every 10 people infected will infect between 9 and 10 other people, indicating it is shrinking. With the four nations of the UK following different policies on restrictions, the government says the estimate for R for the whole of the UK has become ""less meaningful in recent weeks"". It says the impact of the second lockdown in England, which began on 5 November, cannot be fully evaluated yet, and adds that R ""may be below 1 for all regions already"" in England. R is estimated using a range of data, including testing numbers, hospital admissions, intensive care deaths andestimates of how many people are infected in households across the country. Scientists from different universities then use this data to estimate the spread of infections. There is always a slight time lag in the R number of a matter of weeks - the latest estimate is based on data up to 24 November. The UK government has said in the past that the R number was one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. From Wednesday in England, more than 32 million people are due to be living under tier two restrictions, banning indoor meetings between households. A further 23 million people will be placed under the highest - tier three - restrictions, which further limit contact between people outdoors. Boris Johnson has defended the approach, arguing the country needs ""simplicity and clarity"" and the restrictions would ""drive"" Covid down until a vaccine is available. R was last below 1 on the 14 August Prof Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology, from the University of Edinburgh, said the R numbers across the UK ""may decrease further as the full impact of lockdown becomes apparent"". ""It is worth noting that the falls in R began in the second half of September which may indicate that measures taken during that month did have some impact in some regions of the UK,"" he said. However he added that the data raised the question ""of whether the earlier implementation of measures short of full lockdown would have been sufficient to keep the epidemic in check and prevent local NHS Trusts from being overwhelmed.""

"Alexander Lukashenko has ruled Belarus since 1994 Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko has hinted he may be prepared to leave power, after months of protests against his disputed re-election in August. Mr Lukashenko, who has ruled for 26 years, said he supported changing the constitution to considerably weaken the role of any future president. He said he would ""not be president"" after this - but gave no timescale. On Thursday, Russia - Mr Lukashenko's key backer - again urged him to press ahead with reform. That message was delivered by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov during his visit to the Belarusian capital Minsk. Belarus protesters battered, bruised but defiant 'If you croak we don't care': Brutality in Belarus Kremlin looks to keep Belarus in Moscow's orbit EU slaps sanctions on Belarus leader Lukashenko Belarusian opposition leaders - who say the 9 August presidential election was rigged - dismissed Mr Lukahenko's comments as a mere stalling tactic. They have been pushing for the authoritarian leader to resign immediately. This video can not be played Three months on from the Belarus election, opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya reflects on how her life has changed (first published November 2020) A number of leading opposition figures have been detained, while others - like Svetlana Tikhanovskaya - have been forced to go into exile. Belarusian police have been accused of brutality during the mass street protests in the former Soviet republic. On Friday, Mr Lukashenko, 66, said the country's constitution should be reformed to reduce the considerable powers of the presidency. Handing the current system to an ""unknown"", as he put it, would spell trouble. And he stressed that this proposed reform was not for him, personally, as he would not be president under the new system. This video can not be played Hundreds were arrested at the protest in Minsk on 15 November But Mr Lukashenko is now under pressure from his closest ally, too. In Minsk, Mr Lavrov reminded him that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ""repeatedly stressed"" his desire to see constitutional reform in Belarus. So this seems like a nod of consent from Alexander Lukashenko, the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow says. It looks like a sign that he got the hint, and is ready to map his own path out of power. But Mr Lukashenko has proven to be highly unpredictable in his rule, and perfectly capable of a U-turn, should that suit him, our correspondent adds. The exile sacrificing everything for her country.

"NHS Test and Trace incorrectly told 1,311 people they had tested positive Hundreds of people have been wrongly told they have coronavirus by NHS Test and Trace after a laboratory error. More than 1,300 people who gave samples between 19 and 23 November received positive results, when the tests were actually void. All of those affected will be told to take another test, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said. Duncan Larcombe, whose daughter received the wrong result, said it was ""more than an inconvenient mistake"". The PR company director, from Maidstone, Kent, said his two children, aged 14 and nine, were both sent home from school to self-isolate and he was unable to work. He said his 14-year-old daughter had not left her bedroom for four days, with meals being left outside her door, until the family learned the result was void on Thursday. ""We were taking it very seriously,"" he said. Mr Larcombe, a former royal editor at the Sun newspaper, said the mistake ""brings into question for me whether or not this testing system is competent"". ""The entire economy is relying on the competence of the testing laboratories and if they are not doing their job they need to be held to account,"" he said. DHSC said it was an ""isolated incident"" caused by an ""issue with a batch of testing chemicals"" which had affected tests taken across the UK. It is ""being fully investigated to ensure this does not happen again,"" the department said. Mr Larcombe's daughter has now received a negative result after taking a second test on Thursday. ""Given that [the government] have just decided to put the whole of Kent in tier 3, you just wonder, is their modelling flawed,"" he said. Asked if the 1,311 incorrect results would affect regional figures for infection rates, which are represented as the number of cases per 100,000 people, DHSC issued a statement saying: ""Any impact on regional figures would be minimal, but in any event this incident was taken into account when the tiering discussions took place.""

"The zoo will move from its Clifton site in 2022 Bristol Zoo has announced it will relocate from its current site to the outskirts of the city to ""safeguard its future"". The site in Clifton will be sold, and the zoo will move to its Wild Place Project site, near junction 17 of the M5 in South Gloucestershire. The zoo has been at Clifton since it began in 1836. Bosses said the site will stay open until late 2022, and the new zoo would open in early 2024. Bristol Zoological Society, which owns and operates both Bristol Zoo Gardens in Clifton and Wild Place Project, said the zoo had ""suffered years of declining visitor numbers"", and had made an operating loss in four of the past six years. The society's chief executive, Dr Justin Morris, said 2020 had been ""by far the most challenging year the society has faced"" in its 185-year history. The zoo has a special place in people's hearts He said the zoo had been ""struggling with fundamental and persistent challenges"" which had had an ""enormous impact"" on its finances. ""Namely an inability to meet the changing needs of the animals within the available space and infrastructure, and declining visitor numbers."" He added the impact of Covid-19 has caused the society to ""radically rethink"" its plans for the future. ""We know Bristol Zoo Gardens has a special place in the hearts of many, and lots of people have fond memories of visiting the zoo. ""But a lot has changed and many of the animals associated with these memories are no longer at Bristol Zoo Gardens, for very valid reasons. The zoo will move to the Wild Place Project site in South Gloucestershire ""This new strategy presents an opportunity to create a world-class zoo that sets the standard for a modern, forward-looking zoo in the 21st century."" He said the new zoo would have ""conservation and sustainability at its heart, where animals will have the space and facilities to thrive"". Bosses said they will seek planning permission to create housing on the Clifton site in existing buildings, and the existing gardens will be largely unchanged. The zoo's iconic main entrance building would become an ""'urban conservation hub"", a spokesperson added. Follow BBC West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"This video can not be played President Trump once again alleged ""massive fraud"" without evidence to reporters on Thanksgiving A US federal appeals court has firmly rejected the Trump campaign's attempt to block President-elect Joe Biden from being declared winner in Pennsylvania. The panel of three judges deemed the case was without merit, saying the Trump campaign had not made specific allegations or provided proof. The ruling is another major setback for President Trump in his attempts to overturn the 3 November election. On Thursday he said he would give way if Mr Biden was declared the winner. But on Friday he again made unfounded allegations of ""massive voter fraud"", tweeting: ""Biden can only enter the White House as President if he can prove that his ridiculous '80,000,000 votes' were not fraudulently or illegally obtained."" The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals had been asked to consider a lower court's decision to dismiss the Trump campaign's attempts to invalidate millions of mail-in votes in Pennsylvania. The lower court ruling had paved the way for the battleground state to certify Joe Biden's win, giving him 20 vital electoral college votes and effectively the presidency. In giving the appeal court's opinion, Judge Stephanos Bibas wrote: ""Free, fair elections are the lifeblood of our democracy. Charges of unfairness are serious. But calling an election unfair does not make it so."" ""Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here,"" wrote Judge Bibas, who was nominated by Trump.

"Michel Barnier at St Pancras railway station in London on Friday The UK and EU will resume face-to-face Brexit trade talks in London this weekend, as negotiators race to reach a deal before a looming deadline. It comes after EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier left a period of self-isolation after a colleague tested positive for Covid last week. Ahead of travelling to the UK, he said the""same significant divergences persist"",externalin negotiations. After arriving, he said he would work with ""patience and determination"". Earlier, Boris Johnson insisted the likelihood of a deal depended on the EU. Speaking on Friday, the prime minister told reporters that ""there's a deal there to be done if they want to do it"". But he added ""substantial and important differences"" remained between the two sides, with just over a month left before a December deadline. Negotiators are striving to strike a deal to govern their trading relationship once the UK's post-Brexit transition period ends in January 2021. Progress in tough areas of Brexit talks - EU chief Two government defeats in Lords over Brexit bill Brexit talks suspended after positive Covid test Talks have been continuing via video link for the past week or so, after the positive Covid-19 test in a member of Mr Barnier's team. Mr Barnier travelled to London after briefing EU ambassadors and members of the European Parliament on talks. ""In line with Belgian rules, my team and I are no longer in quarantine. Physical negotiations can continue,"" he wrote on Twitter. Ahead of in-person talks getting back under way, his UK counterpart Lord David Frost pledged to ""do my utmost"" see if a deal is possible. ""It is late, but a deal is still possible, and I will continue to talk until it's clear that it isn't,"" he tweeted on Friday. He added that any deal would have to ""fully respect UK sovereignty,"" including over fishing waters and a regime for subsidising businesses. ""An agreement on any other basis is not possible,"" he added. If the UK is holding off making compromises, in the hope of squeezing more last-minute concessions out of Brussels, it might be successful when it comes to fish. On Friday, we heard talk of Michel Barnier being about to propose that between 15% and 18% of the fish quota caught in UK waters by EU fleets would be restored to the UK under a free trade agreement. That was later dismissed by a number of European diplomats, as merely one of ""many proposals doing the rounds"". But whatever happens on the fish front - and Brussels knows it has some big compromises to make - as much as the EU wants a deal with the UK, it's unlikely to let go of its insistence on two other issues: common competition regulations and a tough means of policing them. Read more from Katya. Asked about the chances of an agreement, Mr Johnson said the ""likelihood of a deal is very much determined by our friends and partners in the EU"". He added that a trade agreement would ""benefit people on both sides of the Channel,"" but insisted the UK could ""prosper mightily"" without one. ""Everybody's working very hard - but clearly there are substantial and important differences to be bridged, but we're getting on with it."" The UK left the EU on 31 January, but it is continuing to follow the bloc's rules until the end of the year as part of an 11-month transition period. If a trade deal is not agreed by then, trading between the two will default to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. The EU and UK can keep negotiating if they want to after this, but the two sides would face import taxes on goods traded between them. The UK would have no access to the EU's energy market, and no agreement on police and judicial co-operation. Fishing has been a major flashpoint in the talks, along with post-Brexit competition rules and how any deal would be enforced. The two sides are also at odds over how closely the UK should have to follow the EU's social, labour, and environmental standards after the transition.

"Diggers tipped piles of dead mink into trenches in Jutland Opposition MPs in Denmark have urged the government to dig up millions of mink that were buried in mass graves amid Covid-19 fears. The two burial sites in Jutland are highly controversial - one is near a bathing lake and the other not far from a source of drinking water. The discovery of a mutated form of the virus prompted a cull of nearly 17 million mink, devastating the Danish fur industry - the largest in the EU. The burial decision was judged illegal. The new Agriculture Minister, Rasmus Prehn, said on Friday he supported the idea of exhuming the mink and incinerating them. But that would require the environmental protection agency's approval, he added. His predecessor Mogens Jensen resigned last week in the furore over the government's legal basis for the cull, as more than 10,000 tonnes of dead mink were hastily buried.

"Alexander Lukashenko has ruled Belarus since 1994 Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko has hinted he may be prepared to leave power, after months of protests against his disputed re-election in August. Mr Lukashenko, who has ruled for 26 years, said he supported changing the constitution to considerably weaken the role of any future president. He said he would ""not be president"" after this - but gave no timescale. On Thursday, Russia - Mr Lukashenko's key backer - again urged him to press ahead with reform. That message was delivered by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov during his visit to the Belarusian capital Minsk. Belarus protesters battered, bruised but defiant 'If you croak we don't care': Brutality in Belarus Kremlin looks to keep Belarus in Moscow's orbit EU slaps sanctions on Belarus leader Lukashenko Belarusian opposition leaders - who say the 9 August presidential election was rigged - dismissed Mr Lukahenko's comments as a mere stalling tactic. They have been pushing for the authoritarian leader to resign immediately. This video can not be played Three months on from the Belarus election, opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya reflects on how her life has changed (first published November 2020) A number of leading opposition figures have been detained, while others - like Svetlana Tikhanovskaya - have been forced to go into exile. Belarusian police have been accused of brutality during the mass street protests in the former Soviet republic. On Friday, Mr Lukashenko, 66, said the country's constitution should be reformed to reduce the considerable powers of the presidency. Handing the current system to an ""unknown"", as he put it, would spell trouble. And he stressed that this proposed reform was not for him, personally, as he would not be president under the new system. This video can not be played Hundreds were arrested at the protest in Minsk on 15 November But Mr Lukashenko is now under pressure from his closest ally, too. In Minsk, Mr Lavrov reminded him that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ""repeatedly stressed"" his desire to see constitutional reform in Belarus. So this seems like a nod of consent from Alexander Lukashenko, the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow says. It looks like a sign that he got the hint, and is ready to map his own path out of power.

"Paul Farrell is alleged to have targeted victims between 1985 and 2018 A former Great Ormond Street Hospital porter has admitted sexual offences against six boys over 35 years. Paul Farrell, 55, pleaded guilty to 58 sex offences against children carried out between 1985 and 2020. The charges relate to six victims, who cannot be named, who are now aged between eight and 43. Farrell, from Camden, appearing at Wood Green Crown Court, admitted charges including attempted rape and the sexual assault of a child aged under 13. He pleaded guilty to 33 charges, having previously admitted 25 counts at an earlier hearing. He has denied a further 21 charges, including rape. The court heard Farrell held a number of positions, including working as a porter at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) between 1994 and 2020. At least two victims allege they were sexually abused by Farrell at the hospital. Judge Noel Lucas said: ""The prosecution have made it clear that this is not a case where it is alleged that Mr Farrell was targeting children at the Great Ormond Street Hospital. ""Rather that children were abused in parts of the hospital in which he had access."" Police arrested Farrell on 16 January. According to the charges, Farrell continued to offend until June this year. One boy, under the age of 13, says he was sexually assaulted ""during lockdown"". In a statement the hospital said: ""These charges relating to a former member of GOSH staff are awful. ""It is upsetting to hear in court today that some of the charges relate to the hospital site. ""It is important to stress, as stated by the judge today, that GOSH patients were not targeted. ""Due to the ongoing legal proceedings, we are really limited in what we can say, but we can confirm again that Paul Farrell was dismissed from the Trust.""

"This video can not be played President Trump once again alleged ""massive fraud"" without evidence to reporters on Thanksgiving Donald Trump has said he will leave the White House if Joe Biden is formally confirmed as the next US president. Answering reporters' questions for the first time since losing the 3 November vote, Mr Trump insisted, however, that ""this race is far from over"". He has refused to concede, citing unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. Individual states are currently certifying their results, after Mr Biden was projected as the winner with an unassailable lead. The Democrat leads Mr Trump 306 votes to 232 under the electoral college system that is used to pick US presidents. The tally is far more than the 270 needed to win, and Mr Biden also leads the popular vote by more than six million. Electors will meet to formalise the result on 14 December, with Mr Biden due to be sworn in as president on 20 January. What is the presidential transition? A simple guide to the electoral college What Biden's new foreign policy team tells us The president and his supporters have lodged a number of legal challenges over the election, but most have been dismissed. Earlier this week, Mr Trump finally agreed to allow the formal transition to President-elect Biden's team to begin, following several weeks of uncertainty. The decision means Mr Biden is able to receive top security briefings and access key government officials and millions of dollars in funds as he prepares to take over. Following a video call with military personnel on the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, Mr Trump faced questions from reporters at the White House. Mr Trump spoke with members of the US military - at home and abroad - via video link for the Thanksgiving holiday He was asked whether he would agree to leave the White House if he lost the electoral college vote. ""Certainly I will, certainly I will and you know that,"" he said. However, the president went on to say that ""if they do [elect Joe Biden], they made a mistake"", and suggested he may never accept defeat. ""It's going to be a very hard thing to concede because we know there was massive fraud,"" he said, an allegation he has stood by without offering proof. It is not a requirement for Mr Trump to concede in order for Mr Biden to be sworn in as the 46th US president. What do we know about Trump's legal challenges? Fact-checking Trump team's main fraud claims Mr Trump did not say whether he would run for president again in 2024, or whether he would attend Mr Biden's inauguration. The normally routine process of transitioning from one president to another and confirming the result has been derailed by President Trump's refusal to concede. Under the US electoral system, voters do not directly choose the next president. Instead, they vote for 538 officials, who are allocated to American states based on their population size. This video can not be played Explaining the Electoral College and which voters will decide who wins The electors almost always vote for the candidate who won the most votes in their states, and although it is possible for some to disregard the voters' pick, no result has ever been changed this way. Mr Trump also said that he was planning to hold a rally in Georgia on Saturday in support of two Republicans in key runoff elections that will decide which party controls the Senate. The elections in Georgia are due to be held on 5 January. The president-elect celebrated a quiet Thanksgiving on Thursday, as coronavirus cases in the US continue to rise. ""This year, our turkey will be smaller and the clatter of cooking a little quieter,""Mr Biden and his wife Jill said in an op-ed published by CNN,external. ""Like millions of Americans, we are temporarily letting go of the traditions we can't do safely. ""It is not a small sacrifice. These moments with our loved ones - time that's lost - can't be returned. Yet, we know it's the price of protecting each other and one we don't pay alone."" This video can not be played ""We're at war with a virus, not with one another"": President-elect Biden calls on Americans to unite against Covid-19 Earlier this week, Mr Biden urged Americans to hold smaller celebrations, saying: ""I know that we can and will beat this virus."" He has said that tackling the pandemic will be his main priority when he takes office. Mr Biden has already nominated a number of top officialsfor when he takes over and said that co-operation from the White House over the transition had been ""sincere"". Speaking in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, on Wednesday, he said that the US ""won't stand"" for any attempt to derail the election. Americans ""have full and fair and free elections, and then we honour the results,"" he said. Trump accepts transition to Biden must begin Why does US presidential transition matter?

"Topshop owner Arcadia is in talks with lenders to secure around Â£30m in funding following the second coronavirus lockdown in England. The discussions,revealed by Sky News,external, are understood to be progressing and a deal could be close to being reached. Another report suggested,externalthat Arcadia is drawing up plans to place the business into administration. But the company said: ""It is not true that administrators are about to be appointed."" ""Clearly, the second UK lockdown presents a further challenge for all retailers and we are taking all appropriate steps to protect our employees and other stakeholders from its consequences."" It is understood that Arcadia - led by Sir Philip Green - has contingency plans in place regarding the future of the business but there is confidence it will secure financing to continue trading. As well as Topshop, the group also owns the chains Topman, Miss Selfridge, Evans, Burton and Dorothy Perkins. Non-essential retailers in England have been forced to close for four weeks until 2 December to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Coronavirus: Which shops will be allowed to open in lockdown? Clothes and book sellers furious at lockdown rules During the first country-wide lockdown, Arcadia furloughed the vast majority of its 13,000-strong workforce across more than 500 outlets. Sir Philip Green leads Arcadia while his wife, Lady Cristina Green, is its biggest shareholder Staff at its shops in England have been placed back on the government's wage subsidy scheme though its stores in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have now reopened. Arcadia said: ""We are continuing to trade online through our own channels as well as through those of our partners."" However, Debenhams, a major Arcadia partner which sells a number of its brands, is facing its own challenges. The department store chain is in administration and is in talks to find a buyer. Arcadia underwent restructuring last year through a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). It agreed to shut 50 shops, secured a rent cut with landlords on property and struck a deal with the Pension Protection Fund to put money into the company's pension schemes. At the time, the pension scheme deficit was estimated to be around Â£700m but the Sunday Times reported it is now Â£350m on a buyout basis. In a deal with the Pensions Regulator, trustees of Arcadia's pension schemes were granted security over Â£210m worth of assets by the company. Sir Philip's wife, Lady Cristina Green, who is Arcadia's biggest shareholder, agreed to pump Â£100m into the schemes over three years while Arcadia said it would inject a further Â£75m. Sir Philip faced controversy over the pension scheme at one of his other businesses, BHS, which he sold to Dominic Chappell for Â£1 in 2015. BHS collapsed a year later, with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of Â£571m. Sir Philip reached a deal with the Pensions Regulator to inject Â£363m into that scheme. More recently,Chappell was sentenced to six years in prisonafter being found guilty of tax evasion. Which shops are allowed to open?

"This video can not be played Monaco, models and money â who is retail mogul Sir Philip Green? Sir Philip Green, once known as the 'King of the High Street' is facing his biggest challenge yet. His Arcadia retail empire is teetering on the brink of collapse, the latest saga in a colourful career that once saw him branded as the ""unacceptable face of capitalism"". The retail tycoon's life story to date is rich in character and anecdote, from his failed attempts to take over M&S, to a lavish lifestyle that has attracted accusations of tax avoidance. But questions now swirl over the fate of his empire, and its 13,000 employees. Despite being born into a well-to-do family in south London, Sir Philip prided himself on having worked his way to the top. His competitive streak was apparent from an early age, noticed by school mates at Carmel College, his exclusive boarding school, nicknamed the ""Jewish Eton"". School friend Tony Rauch recalls Sir Philip making a beeline for the table-tennis table at break time and losing a tussle with another boy who had been trying to get the best bat. ""He got very angry; cried a little bit,"" Mr Rauch told BBC Radio 4'sProfileprogramme in 2012. ""He wasn't physically hurt, I think he was just very angry at having lost."" Sir Philip left school aged 15 and began working on the forecourt of the petrol station that his mother managed. He then went on to learn business basics as an apprentice in a shoe warehouse. At 23 years old, he set up his own business importing and selling jeans. Staff leaving the BHS headquarters after being told the company would go into administration Stuart Lansley, the author of an unauthorised biography of Sir Philip, described those early days for Radio 4. ""He had a very mixed track record of starting up companies, and closing them down, working with other people, falling out with people,"" said Mr Lansley. ""He travelled a lot, learning a lot about the supply chain, who the cheaper suppliers were and so on - but he certainly wasn't a household name."" It was BHS, known then as British Home Stores, that marked the moment Sir Philip Green finally ""arrived"" in 2000. He paid Â£200m for what was already a slightly faded, dowdy chain. ""He borrowed very large sums of money, invested a little bit himself, and bought up companies that were relatively cheap, because they weren't doing very well. He turned them around, paying off his debt, and then tripling - quadrupling - the money he put in, in a matter of a couple of years,"" Mr Lansley said. Two years later, he copied that model when he bought the giant retail empire Arcadia, which owns brands such as Burton, Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge, and of course, Topshop and Topman. Sir Philip Green's most ambitious move came in 2004, when he put together Â£10bn, much of it from investment banks, to make an offer for Marks and Spencer. Even Sir Stuart Rose - then his rival and at the helm of Marks at the time - was impressed. ""Philip is not only a first-class retailer, he is absolutely pre-eminent in his generation in terms of his financial nous and ability,"" Sir Stuart toldProfile. ""If I wanted to be slightly uncharitable, I could say that he came to the market to raise a very, very large sum of money at a time when money was cheap and freely available - but only Philip could have put that together."" As chairman of Marks and Spencer, Sir Stuart Rose (L) faced two takeover bids from Sir Philip Green (R) Sir Stuart Rose also has first-hand experience of his reportedly very short fuse. Sir Philip reportedly grabbed the then M&S boss by the lapels during his second unsuccessful takeover bid in 2004. ""There was a fairly physical occasion one morning, yes. I think tension had got quite high during the bid and Philip got upset about something,"" said Sir Stuart. ""He wasn't above ringing me up during the height of the bid and singing 'if I were a rich man' down the telephone to me, trying to point out the error of my ways [for not selling]... that I would make more money. ""He used to say, 'The only jet you know is Easyjet.'"" Sir Philip is not shy about enjoying the trappings of his success. He commutes into London from Monaco in a private jet, has a super-yacht called Lionheart, and has been known for throwing extravagant parties for friends and family in exotic places, with entertainment from the likes of Beyonce and Jennifer Lopez. What has attracted the most controversy though is not the lavish lifestyle, but his tax affairs. In 2005, his company paid a Â£1.2bn dividend to the owner of Arcadia - Sir Philip's wife, Cristina. Since she is a resident of Monaco, she paid no tax in the UK. In 2010,activists demonstrated outside the flagship Topshop and BHS storesin central London after Sir Philip was chosen by then Prime Minister David Cameron to conduct agovernment efficiency review. They thought his tax arrangements made him the wrong choice. Despite their anger, however, Arcadia has paid significant sums in corporation tax. Activists targeted BHS, Topshop and Topman in 2010 But some of Arcadia's glamour has waned in recent years. Critics say that Sir Philip, reportedly averse to electronic gadgets, has not embraced online shopping as aggressively as competitors such as Asos or Boohoo. While sales remained steady through the group, BHS was seen as the weakest link, and was sold for Â£1. Questions were asked following the sale over just how much money Sir Philip had taken out of the company in the years before. At the time, Angela Eagle, the former shadow business secretary, said: ""In this situation, it appears this owner extracted hundreds of millions of pounds from the business and walked away to his favourite tax haven, leaving the Pension Protection Scheme to pick up the bill."" BHS went bust in April 2016, leaving a Â£571m pensions deficit. Sir Philipagreed a Â£363m cash settlementwith the Pensions Regulator in 2017 to plug the gap in the BHS pension scheme.

"Music producer Michel Zecler spoke to reporters outside the National Police General Inspectorate in Paris President Emmanuel Macron says footage of three police officers beating up a black music producer in Paris is ""unacceptable"" and ""shameful"". He demanded quick proposals from the government aimed at rebuilding trust between police and citizens. France should never ""resign itself to violence"" or ""let hatred or racism prosper"", he said. The three officers identified in the video beating Michel Zecler have been suspended and are under investigation. They were questioned in police custody on Friday. Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin has told French television that he will press for the officers' dismissal, saying they had ""soiled the uniform of the republic"". The incident has led to fresh scrutiny of the security forces. Stars of the French World Cup football team are among a number of public figures who have spoken of their anger after the footage captured in the French capital was made public. Earlier on Friday, French media reported that a presidential official had described Mr Macron as being visibly upset by the incident. In a series of tweets Mr Macron said proposals were also needed to fight more effectively against all types of discrimination. ""Those who apply the law must respect the law. I will never accept that the gratuitous violence of some stains the professionalism of the men and women who work courageously to protect us in our daily lives,"" he said. Tough French immigration bill approved On Thursday, French football star Kylian MbappÃ©, who is black, joined national teammates and fellow athletes in condemning the latest incident. ""Unbearable video, unacceptable violence. Say no to racism,""he wrote on Twitter,externalnext to a picture of the bloodied face of the injured producer. The security camera video was published on Thursday by the online news site Loopsider. It shows three officers kicking, punching and using their truncheons on the man after he entered his studio. Loopsider said he had initially been stopped for not wearing a mask. This video can not be played Music producer Michel Zecler is seen being beaten up by officers in his studio Mr Zecler said he was also subjected to racist abuse during the five minute beating. He was detained and charged with violence and resisting arrest, but prosecutors threw the charges out and instead opened an investigation against the officers. As he arrived at police headquarters on Thursday with his lawyer to file a complaint, Mr Zecler told reporters: ""People who should have been protecting me attacked me. I did nothing to deserve this. I just want these three people to be punished according to the law."" Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said she was ""profoundly shocked"" by the ""intolerable act"". Earlier this week, Mr Darmanin also ordered police to provide a full report after they violently dismantled a makeshift migrant camp in the capital, clashing with migrants and activists. He tweeted that some of the scenes were ""shocking"". This video can not be played Police tipped some migrants out of their flimsy tents Meanwhile, the French government is pressing ahead with its controversial security bill, which opponents say could undermine the media's ability to scrutinise police behaviour. Article 24 of the bill makes it a criminal offence to post images of police or soldiers on social media which are deemed to target them as individuals. Critics of the legislation say that without such images, none of the incidents which took place over the past week would have come to light. No new 'Jungle' camp in Calais - Macron How the migrant crisis changed Europe The government argues that the new bill does not jeopardise the rights of the media and ordinary citizens to report police abuses. But in the face of criticism the government added an amendment, specifying that Article 24 ""will only target the dissemination of images clearly aimed at harming a police officer's or soldier's physical or psychological integrity"". People found guilty could be punished by a year in prison or a fine of up to â¬45,000 (Â£40,000). Paris police break up migrant camp amid scuffles.

"Christopher Wilson admitted having sex with a woman who was reporting a crime at Launceston Police Station A police constable is facing a prison sentence after having sex with a crime victim in a disabled toilet at his station. PC Christopher Wilson, 43, invited the woman to the toilet via text on 2 December, Exeter Crown Court was told. He told her sex inside the police station in Launceston, Cornwall, was ""the naughty bit which makes it more exciting"". Wilson, of Saltash, East Cornwall, admitted misconduct in a public office. The woman was reporting a crime when Wilson approached her, asking if she wanted to ""get with a man in uniform"". She followed him into the unisex disabled toilet where they engaged in sexual activity, the court heard. Judge Timothy Rose told Wilson he was likely to be sent straight to jail when he returned for sentencing in January. ""Obviously, the court will consider other options but I don't want to mislead you. You must come back realising that prison is very high on the agenda,"" he said. Mr James le Grys, prosecuting, said messages were found in which Wilson discussed sex with another woman. He also sent sexual messages to the woman after she left the police station, the court heard. Susannah Stevens, defending, said Wilson had not expected the woman to follow him into the toilet but accepted acting improperly when she did.

Friday's coverage has been brought to you by: Joseph Lee, Katie Wright, Lauren Turner, Robin Levinson King, Alice Evans and Rob Corp. Here are some of the main UK stories from today.    Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen found the plight of mink farmers overwhelming Here's a quick recap of some of the coronavirus headlines from around the world today. The announcement of the new coronavirus restrictions for England, which will come into force from 2 December, has prompted questions and concerns from business owners and families. ""They have changed the rules in the middle of the game,"" says Amanda Thompson, managing director of amusement park Blackpool Pleasure Beach in Lancashire, which will go into the toughest tier of measures - tier three. Amanda has been trying to work out how she will make it to Christmas. ""I had a pantomime due to start next week, a dinner show due to begin, a lot of people who have been unemployed all year because they are performers unable to perform."" The visitor attraction, which is almost 125 years old, has survived two world wars only to be bought to a ""grinding halt"" this year. ""Without Blackpool Pleasure Beach there is no Blackpool. Perhaps people don't find it interesting in London but it is of interest to the millions of people who come here."" While the resort had been operating in a Covid-secure way over the summer, Amanda says it will now be closed until next year unless restrictions are relaxed. ""Â£250,000 of cancellations came in yesterday,"" she adds. Read more about how others are coming to terms with the new measures.  Jayne Nash is part of the team which has taken over the Never Say Die pub Why, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, would anybody decide to take over a pub? ""Crazy? We probably are,"" says Jayne Nash, from the village of Jaywick, on the Essex coast. ""But it was an opportunity we couldn't miss."" For years, she has been a regular at the Never Say Die, which sits 20m (60ft) from the beach. But now she is on the other side of the bar, as part of a team that reopened the ""community pub"" on 1 August, supported initially by grants from a number of organisations. ""We had a week to get going. It was all hands on deck,"" says Jayne. ""It was brilliant."" Takings reached about Â£1,000 per night, but within weeks of reopening, the team received the worst possible news in the form of a second lockdown. However, Jayne remains positive about the pub's future. ""We want to make it grow,"" she says. ""We've had so many volunteers come forward since we started. People know what we're doing and they want to help."" Read the full story here. Black Friday started earlier this year asUK shoppers turned to online services during the pandemic. The number of parcels being delivered started increasing sharply from the end of October. By last week, it had already surpassed last year's post-Black Friday peak, according to new data. Metapack, which acts as a go-between for retailers and couriers, said parcel volumes were already up by 70% this week, compared with the same week last year. In a normal year, retailers would expect the week in which Black Friday falls to be the most profitable of the year. But sales were already up by between 50 and 60% in each of the first three weeks of November, according to IMRG, which collects data from online retailing companies. Hundreds of people in England have beenwrongly told they have coronavirus by NHS Test and Traceafter a ""laboratory error"". More than 1,300 people who gave samples between 19 and 23 November received positive results, when the tests were actually void. All of those affected will be told to take another test, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said. Duncan Larcombe, said his two children, aged 14 and nine, were both sent home from school to self-isolate and he was unable to work. His 14-year-old daughter who tested positive ""had not left her bedroom"" for four days, with meals being left outside her door, until learning the result was void on Thursday. ""We were taking it very seriously,"" he said. DHSC said it was an ""isolated incident"" caused by an ""issue with a batch of testing chemicals"" which had affected tests taken across the UK. Shaimaa KhalilAustralia correspondent Matt Lanigan says the lockdown was ""pretty grim"" Melbourne's second lockdown, which began in July, went on to become one of the longest and strictest in the world until it ended last month. ""The streets were completely deserted. It was like something out of [post-apocalyptic film] Mad Max,"" says Matt Lanigan, who owns a cafe on Chapel St, the city's iconic shopping strip. ""It was brutal,"" Matt says of trying keep his business afloat. ""It was like I was in a boxing match and I just got knocked to the floor. For a moment there, I felt like maybe it wasn't worth getting up."" But things are slowly turning around. Earlier today, Melbourne and the state of Victoria reported the 28th consecutive day with no new infections. After seeing daily cases soar above 700 in July and August,the city is seen as an example for the rest of the world on how to handle a second outbreak. Melbourne's Chapel St is buzzing again Now on reopened Chapel St, music and chatter fill the air as people enjoy their Sunday brunches. But despite the high spirits, everywhere you look there are signs of how battered this city has been. Many businesses are still shut, and others are open but half empty. Matt says the real economic and mental health toll will become clearer in the months to come, especially when government wage subsidy schemes end. Er Shun, above, and Da Mao spent time at Toronto Zoo before being sent to Calgary A Canadian zoo is sending two pandas back to their previous home in China due to a bamboo shortage caused by the pandemic. The Calgary Zoo had hoped to return Er Shun and Da Mao earlier, as bamboo
 supplies dwindled, but there were significant delays in obtaining the 
permits to ship them home. ""Today is the day!"" the zoo posted on Facebook on Friday. The zoo had raised concerns in May that the pandemic was impacting supplies. Giant pandas eat about 40kg of fresh bamboo a day. Er Shun and Da Mao arrived in Canada in 2014, as part of a 10-year loan from China. They spent the first five years at a Toronto Zoo, where they gave birth birth to two cubs,Jia Panpan and Jia Yueyue. The adult pandas were meant to spend the next five years in Calgary. More vaccines need to be developed in the fight against coronavirus, the World Health Organization's chief scientist has said. Dr Soumya Swaminathan said some vaccines might benefit certain group such as pregnant women or older people more than others, while alternative jabs might give better immunity or be more affordable. She said potential vaccines at relatively early stages of development must continue to be trialled so that there is then ""a choice, a basket of vaccines that we can choose from and be able to target them to different situations in countries with different populations"". This video can not be played Tiffany Pearson-Gills took over the Junction pub in September The landlords of two pubs in an English village that sits on a county border say it makes no sense thatonly one of them can open under coronavirus measures coming into force next week. Groombridge has two pubs, but the Crown Inn is in Kent's tier three and the Junction is in East Sussex's tier two. In tier three, pubs must close apart from offering takeaway or delivery services, but in tier two, they can open as long as they serve substantial meals. Under next week's rules, residents on either side of Groombridge, home to about 1,600 people, should not cross over the county border at a bridge over the River Grom - meaning Kent villagers cannot enjoy the reopening of the East Sussex pub. Steve Harmes, at the Crown, says not being able to open is ""very frustrating"". ""We were not in such a bad position before, but now, being put in this position, it's really hard for us to move forward."" He said even if the tiers were reviewed in December, the pub would not be able to prepare and take advantage of the busy Christmas period. A seven-minute walk away - or 0.4 miles - at the Junction pub, landlady Tiffany Pearson-Gills calls the new rules ""perplexing"". The Crown Inn is in Kent, so will go into tier three next week ""For such a small village... it just doesn't make any sense at all,"" she said. She took over the Junction in September and spent several weeks renovating it but had to put off an opening on 5 November. She said the pub had been fortunate, adding: ""It's great for us, but it doesn't make sense that the Crown up the road cannot [open]. It's just so close, it's a really, really difficult one."" Cardiff city centre has been gearing up for Christmas In Wales, while rules are in place, people can still go to the pub, meet others at a social distance and head out to buy presents. But from 2 December, across the border in England, about 55 million people will be living under strict rules. So what do England's tiers mean for those living and working in Wales? Next Wednesday as the lockdown ends in England, areas will be placed under tiers, from one to three, depending on how high their case rate is. But while the rules do not apply in Wales, the changes over the border could affect your family, work or business over the coming days. We've taken a look at what the changes could mean for you.Read more here.  A further 521 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, the UK government has announced. By this measure, that brings the total number of Covid deaths in the country to 57,551. Meanwhile,the government also reported,externala further 16,022 new cases of the virus in the past 24 hours. More than 1.5 million cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the UK since the epidemic began. Teachers have warned ofa ""collapse"" in secondary school attendanceafter the second wave of the pandemic spread across the UK during autumn. Relatively few pupils have tested positive, but hundreds of thousands have had to learn from home after being required to self-isolate. We have been taking a look at what impact that is having on schools, parents and pupils themselves, as many prepare for exams. Merseyside, for example, has been one of the areas worst-hit in the UK's second wave of the pandemic. And at The Prescot School in Knowsley that has meant a collective 700 days in the classroom lost for the year 11 students preparing for exams in the summer. One student, Ben, told the BBC: ""Year 11 is such a crucial year, you've got exams and mock exams and that's the main thing that's going to set you for life. ""As someone who's self-isolated already, I think it's really stressful to even think about the exams that we've got to do in a few months' time when we've missed out a large chunk of school.""  Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Slopes in ski resorts in Switzerland are already open Across the Alps, countries are agonising over how to control the spread of coronavirus while allowing the winter sports season to begin. Germany has suggestedkeeping all ski resorts closed over the festive season,while Italy would like to wait to open them until mid-January. In Switzerland however, the slopes are already open â despite the country having one of the highest infection rates in Europe. The idea of closing the ski slopes has caused indignation in Switzerland - perhaps especially since closures are being proposed by its bigger European neighbours. The idea is almost as bad, harrumphed one editorial, as joining the EU itself. Switzerlandâs ski resorts seem convinced of their safety measures: masks on all lifts, strict distancing while waiting, and no apres-ski bars. The Swiss government knows the strategy is risky. With everywhere else closed, skiers from across Europe might come to Switzerland, catch the virus, and then take it home â a nightmarish, Europe-wide superspreader event. But there is method in what seems like madness. If the Christmas and New Year ski weeks go safely, Switzerland stands to make a tidy profit while its neighbours are left empty-handed. Now for some news onthe global race to develop and distribute a coronavirus vaccine, to help bring an end to the pandemic. Canada's federal government has said that as many as three million people in the country could be vaccinated by early 2021 - but how this will happen remains unclear. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was criticised this week after he said Canada's pharmaceutical industry is not equipped to produce Covid vaccines domestically. It means Canada will likely have to import the vaccine from the US, and will therefore be second in line. The government has tried to reassure Canadians, noting that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine could be approved by December and that three million people - less than 10% of the population - could be vaccinated by early next year. However, supplies will be limited to begin with, and early vaccines will be distributed to high-priority groups only. Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News According to the governmentâs scientific advisory group, Sage, England's former three-tiered system was not controlling the spread of the virus. That was largely because cases were rising in tier one areas, so it would only be a matter of time before those areas would have to move up a tier. Itâs now expected to work the other way round â with theareas with the tighter restrictions expected to move down a tieras infections decrease. Ministers have promised a review of their tier allocations every two weeks - with the first one expected on 16 December. But some Sage experts have said today that they believe mid-December is too soon to make any significant changes. The next assessment will be after the UK-widerelaxation of measures for the Christmas period, which is likely to see a rise in cases. Depending on how much of a surge there is, itâs likely to be mid-January at the very earliest before significant numbers of regions could be moved to lower tiers - with some possibly even going up one. An eight-year-old boy who wrote to Boris Johnson asking if Santa would be able to visit as usual said he was""shocked"" that the ""busiest man in the country""had replied. Monti, from Cockermouth, Cumbria, asked if the government had ""thought about Santa coming this Christmas"" - and received a reply saying Father Christmas was ""ready and raring to go"". ""In June I heard the pandemic might go on for a long time and it could reach up to Christmas,"" he said. ""I got a bit worried so I wondered if I should write to the prime minister, so I did. ""I asked him if everyone has to put hand sanitiser by the cookies and if he can actually come and keep the Christmas spirit alive. ""If the Christmas spirit isn't kept alive then no one will be happy.""  We've been busy answering questions you have about the restrictions in place - including the end of England's lockdown, and the new tougher tiers. Kevin from Norwichwanted to know whether businesses can reopen on 2 December - or if they have to wait til the following day. The government has confirmed that the new tiers system will âcome into effect from the beginning of Wednesday 2 Decemberâ, marking the end of the lockdown. In all tiers, all non-essential retail, including indoor and outdoor markets and car boot sales, can reopen from Wednesday, but must continue to follow Covid-19 secure guidelines.

Nottingham Trent University students Laura Puttock (left) and Emma de Duve say they are ""absolutely gutted"" Nottinghamshire residents have expressed theirdisappointment at returning to the top tier of England's Covid-19 restrictionswhen the national lockdown ends on Wednesday. The city and county moved into tier three in October, but has seen the rate of positive cases drop since lockdown began. However, the government said rates in Nottinghamremain ""very high"" among those over 60. Nottingham Trent University students Laura Puttock and Emma de Duve said they were ""absolutely gutted"" at the news. ""It's our 21st [birthdays] in December,"" said Laura. ""It's our last year of uni and we thought we could have a last celebration, but now it's going to have to be a takeaway. ""It's hardly the 21st I'd dreamed of. It just feels [as if] we've done our bit, cases are going down, but we're still not seeing any change."" Pat West, 63, from Newark, said she did not understand why the region was still in tier three. ""I'm really disappointed,"" she said. ""My grandchildren can't come round to see me at home. I'm not seeing them grow up."" Read up on the rules in each tier here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Quizzes rather than board games are one of the recommendations from scientists for a Covid-safe Christmas. Earlier this week,the government announced up to three households will be allowed to form a ""Christmas bubble""from 23 to 27 December. But the government's scientific advisory committee, Sage, warns coronavirus could easily spread during the festive relaxation of the rules. They say people should still weigh up if an event could be postponed. If not, meeting online or outdoors where the risks of transmission are lower, could be a better option. But if you do go ahead, they say, it's important to include everyone taking part in drawing up a plan for how to manage the event.

""Messaging should be supportive of women adapting traditions and encouraging those around them to share the burden and to be supportive of any alterations to adapt for Covid-19 restrictions."" The advisers recognise that negotiating these arrangements may ""create tensions"". But they suggest a series of measures, ranging from minimising the numbers getting together to keeping events brief to avoiding physical contact. Maintaining social distancing, keeping surfaces clean and opening windows to allow in fresh air are all highlighted. There are also practical suggestions: Children should meet their grandparents outside where possible If staying overnight, children should share bedrooms with their parents, not the children of another household Be aware of the risk of spreading the virus by board games which involve lots of shared pieces - maybe try quiz games instead But there's a warning that no single measure will guarantee that Christmas is risk-free. Scientists warn that, within households, one infected person can pass the virus to as many as 50% of the rest. And they say that the spread of the disease could multiply as the newly-infected people return to their usual lives after the break. In one paper,external, the advisers spell out that ""this is not a theoretical risk"". They point to earlier research into how other respiratory diseases such as pneumonia increase as older family members are exposed during the school holidays. That's why they conclude that cases are set to rise. ""The prevalence could easily double during a few days of the festive season, with further multiplicative increases as new infections go back to their ""routine"" networks."" Anotherdocument published by Sage,externalmakes clear that most coronavirus infections happen during prolonged indoor gatherings of people who are familiar with each other. That creates what's called an ""intimacy paradox"" in which we let our guard down because we don't see our loved ones as a potential dangers. Covid: What can and should you do this Christmas?

"The zoo will move from its Clifton site in 2022 Bristol Zoo has announced it will relocate from its current site to the outskirts of the city to ""safeguard its future"". The site in Clifton will be sold, and the zoo will move to its Wild Place Project site, near junction 17 of the M5 in South Gloucestershire. The zoo has been at Clifton since it began in 1836. Bosses said the site will stay open until late 2022, and the new zoo would open in early 2024. Bristol Zoological Society, which owns and operates both Bristol Zoo Gardens in Clifton and Wild Place Project, said the zoo had ""suffered years of declining visitor numbers"", and had made an operating loss in four of the past six years. The society's chief executive, Dr Justin Morris, said 2020 had been ""by far the most challenging year the society has faced"" in its 185-year history. The zoo has a special place in people's hearts He said the zoo had been ""struggling with fundamental and persistent challenges"" which had had an ""enormous impact"" on its finances. ""Namely an inability to meet the changing needs of the animals within the available space and infrastructure, and declining visitor numbers."" He added the impact of Covid-19 has caused the society to ""radically rethink"" its plans for the future. ""We know Bristol Zoo Gardens has a special place in the hearts of many, and lots of people have fond memories of visiting the zoo. ""But a lot has changed and many of the animals associated with these memories are no longer at Bristol Zoo Gardens, for very valid reasons. The zoo will move to the Wild Place Project site in South Gloucestershire ""This new strategy presents an opportunity to create a world-class zoo that sets the standard for a modern, forward-looking zoo in the 21st century."" He said the new zoo would have ""conservation and sustainability at its heart, where animals will have the space and facilities to thrive"". Bosses said they will seek planning permission to create housing on the Clifton site in existing buildings, and the existing gardens will be largely unchanged. The zoo's iconic main entrance building would become an ""'urban conservation hub"", a spokesperson added. Follow BBC West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"This video can not be played School holiday Christmas decision will be reached ""as soon as we can"" Discussions have been taking place about whether the Christmas school holidays could be extended in Scotland. It has been suggested that the dates could be standardised across the country, with all schools closing on 18 December and reopening on 11 January. Holiday dates vary between different council areas, with most schools due to return between the 5 and 7 January. The proposal is designed to limit the spread of Covid after families get together for Christmas. The issue was discussed at the Scottish government's education recovery group, but no decisions have yet been made. The group brings together a number of stakeholders in the education sector, including unions, councils and the government. Latest updates on Covid in Scotland What are the rules for forming bubbles at Christmas? Keeping level 4 schools open 'is vital for pupils' A document from Thursday's meeting wasleaked to the Daily Record newspaper.,external The memo says the government is considering a national extension to the holidays, with schools either remaining closed or introducing remote learning for a temporary period. At the daily briefing, Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the Scottish government was very conscious that parents, teachers and pupils wanted to know what was going to happen. The length of Christmas holidays is being discussed by the education recovery group ""We will make sure that we reach a view based on the advice from that expert recovery group, and make sure that we reach a view as soon as we can so that people do have advance notice,"" she said. ""We want to give people as much notice as possible if there is to be any change at all, but at this point that decision hasn't been reached."" Ms Freeman said it would be wrong to ""overly speculate or jump to conclusions"" just because they were looking at the issue. ""The deputy first minister (John Swinney) and his colleagues will be working through what they think is the best way for schools to enter the Christmas break and come out of the Christmas break - and that applies to colleges and universities as well,"" she added. There are a number of important issues to be discussed about changing the holiday dates. First of all parents will want clarity - changes to the dates could mean people having to arrange childcare or take time off work. Secondly, if schools return a few days later than planned in January, some secondary schools may want to change prelim dates. Thirdly, councils are protective of their role in the education system. They would want to ensure any standardisation of dates in an emergency does not set a precedent. And there is, of course, also the question of whether an extended school holiday would by itself make any meaningful difference to the efforts to control coronavirus. The BBC understands councils will discuss the matter again on Friday. It is expected that the education recovery group will meet on Wednesday to discuss the potential impact on exams, and that a decision could be made on the holiday extension next week. While many schools are already due to close on 18 December, others are set to remain open until 23 December. The dates for returning to school in January also vary. The memo says that extending the holidays would act as a break following the relaxation of rules over the festive period. However, concerns are raised over the time needed to set up the remote learning, and the potential impact caused by the loss of emergency childcare which had previously been provided by school staff. School holidays have traditionally varied in different council areas across Scotland, but the start of the autumn term was standardised in August asschools reopened for the first time since March. Scottish Greens co-leader Alison Johnstone told the BBC's daily briefing programme that parents and pupils needed clarity on extending the Christmas school holidays. ""We have learned about this today through a leak to a newspaper so I think transparency and clarity are key here,"" she said. The Scottish Conservatives' education spokesman Jamie Greene said any further ""watering down"" of pupils' time in class would need to be ""properly catered for at home"". He added: ""Every child should have access to proper IT equipment and learning materials to ensure they don't fall behind with their studies.""

"Maria Mester denies conspiracy to burgle and money laundering charges An escort accused of helping burglars steal property worth Â£26m from celebrities was only in the UK for a client, a court has heard. Maria Mester, 47, a Romanian national, denies conspiring to carry out raids on homes including Tamara Ecclestone's. She told Isleworth Crown Court she had agreed to spend a week with a ""generous"" man, as it also allowed her to see her son. Ms Mester also denies money laundering charges. The court was previously told that she, her son Emil Bogdan Savastru, and two other men were part of a plot to target the homes of Tamara Ecclestone, Chelsea manager Frank Lampard and the former Leicester City chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha. Three alleged burglars - who cannot be named for legal reasons - are said to have carried out the raids between 1 and 13 December last year. The homes of Frank and Christine Lampard, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and Tamara Ecclestone and her husband were all broken into last December Giving evidence through an interpreter, Ms Mester told the court she was paid up to Â£5,300 to accompany one of the alleged burglars, who was one of her regular clients, to London for a week. ""I knew he was a sweet client, I thought 'why not?',"" she said. She knew her son would also be in the capital at time. Ms Mester told the court her client said he was in London ""on business"". She said he was ""very generous"" and would give her presents. A Cartier bangle worth Â£80,000 was reportedly stolen in the burglary of Tamara Ecclestone's home Asked whether she had conversations with any of the alleged burglars about carrying out the raids, she replied: ""No. About all these burglaries, I found out from the lawyers and here in court."" Defence counsel Leonard Smith then asked: ""Did you ever have any knowledge at all prior to being arrested that you may have come into contact with property from those burglaries?"" ""No, no,"" Ms Mester replied. Ms Mester and Mr Savastru, 30, are accused alongside Alexandru Stan, 49, and Sorin Marcovici, 52, who also deny conspiracy to burgle. The trial continues.

"In Wales people are still out and about shopping, but what is happening over the border? It's the run up to a Christmas like no other and we are all trying to figure out what we can and cannot do to get ready, while keeping others safe. Welsh pubs, restaurants and cafeswill be banned from serving alcoholic drink apart from takeaways from Fridayand will be unable to open to customers beyond 18:00 GMT in a bid to curb a rise in coronavirus cases. People in Wales will be able totravel to parts of Englandfrom Friday. So what do England's tiers mean for those living and working in Wales? Yes. In a word. There will be restrictions but as cross-border travel rules are relaxed on Friday from 18:00, you can go toplaces in tiers one and two,external- but not to areas under the strictest measures in tier three. Travel allowed between Wales and parts of England Wales 'must act now' to curb Covid spread What do the new rules mean for pubs in Wales? Shops allowed to open 24-hours a day over Christmas It means travel to places like London, Liverpool, Chester, Cheltenham and Bath will be possible within the new rules - which start at 18:00 on Friday - but not to Manchester, Birmingham or Bristol. There are caveats, though. While pubs intwo of England's three 'tiers'can now open - and every English county that borders Wales is in tier two - youcan only buy alcohol as part of a ""substantial meal"". One cabinet minister did say drinkers in those tier two areas of England canorder a Scotch egg with their pintto keep in line with post-lockdown rules. Thetier two rules,externalalso mean you cannot ""mix with anyone who is not part of your household or support bubble"" when indoors. The Welsh Government is urging people against cross-border travel in an attempt to curb rising coronavirus rates. ""We are advising people in Wales not to travel into those parts of England and Scotland where the infection rate is lower, to help prevent them taking coronavirus with them,"" First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. ""Coronavirus doesn't respect borders - we all have a part to play in keeping Wales and the UK safe. Please think carefully about where you are going and what you are doing. This virus thrives wherever we come together with others."" Well, it depends what area of England they live in. The rise in Wales' coronavirus infection rate slowed down due to the 'firebreak' lockdown You can see loved ones in England's tier one, within the local rules of that area. But you can't go to see family or friends if they live in England's highest tier - which is most of the north east and west, Yorkshire and the Humber, parts of the West Midlands and parts of the south east and west of England. However, if you've a loved one in England in your support bubble, you can still visit them no matter what tier they are in. Up to three households can form an exclusive ""bubble"" to meet indoors during the Christmas period But people are being urged not to take that trip unless they have to. How many Covid deaths and cases have there been in Wales? Postcode check: What tier do my friends or relatives live in? What tier is your area in? There are exceptions in all of England's tiers for childcare andsupport bubbles,external. If you do travel to visit your support bubble, once in England you will need to follow the rules that apply there. Travel into Scotland's top tiers,external- levels three and four - is not allowed, much like England's tier three areas, except for essential reasons. So places like Glasgow, Stirling and Livingston are among the eleven local authority areas with the highest Covid measures as all non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants and gyms are shut until 11 December. This video can not be played Abby wants her family to be together at Christmas - but there are too many households At level three, alcohol sales are not allowed and cafes and restaurants can only serve food and non-alcoholic drinks and must close at 18:00. Buttravel into those areas is bannedunless you're part of an ""extended household"". No. Atwo-week circuit-breaker took effect on 27 November,externalto try to reduce transmission of the virus and Welsh legislations prevents travel Are you fed up of all that online shopping and fancy a look around some real shops? People are advised by governments to shop locally if they go Christmas shopping Well, you can do that in any area of the UK - as long as it isn't under the strictest Covid measures. So places like Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow and Northern Ireland are out of bounds. But you can can shop anywhere else although governments are advising people to remain in their local regions. How lovely would it be to have a little bit of winter sun? Well, international travel is allowed again but the government advises that you don't unless it is ""essential"". Festive breaks or getaways abroad are now allowed subject to possible quarantine on return People will be subject toexisting 14-day quarantine rules on return, depending on where you've been, but the outright ban on travelling abroad is gone. For those wanting to drive home to see family and friends to celebrate over the festive period,new rules will be introduced. From 23 to 27 December, people from across the UK will be able to meet. But with numbers limited to three households, some larger families, and those who have relatives who have separated, this may lead to difficult choices when arranging the dinner table.

"This video can not be played Parents are torn over early Christmas school closures Schools must be closed early ahead of the festive break to help children and teachers avoid having to self-isolate on Christmas Day, a union has warned. The UCAC teaching union said coronavirus cases in schools could force whole class ""bubbles"" into self-isolation over the holidays. The union said schools should close on 11 December and move lessons online. First Minister Mark Drakeford said there were no plans to close schools early. In a letter to Education Minister Kirsty Williams, the union said there were ""serious concerns"" among UCAC members ""that pupils and students will continue to attend an educational setting a week before Christmas Day"". Most schools are due to break up in the week starting 14 December, but if positive cases are found in pupils' class bubbles, children would have to self-isolate for two weeks, meaning some may have to isolate on Christmas Day. ""If a pupil or student tested positive with Covid-19 during the last week of term, it would mean that the whole bubble would have to self-isolate, preventing them from joining their extended family for Christmas,"" General Secretary Dilwyn Roberts-Young said in the letter. ""The same could be true for the education workforce. ""In addition, Test, Trace and Protect could continue to contact school and colleges leaders on Christmas Day, which is totally unacceptable."" The union said that closing schools early would give families ""greater reassurance"" that they could get together to celebrate during the five day Christmas travel rules. ""We are acutely aware of the need to ensure continuity of learning for all pupils and students in Wales, particularly in the wake of the disruption earlier in the year, which has continued to some extent since September,"" the letter said. ""We believe that making an early announcement on this would not only allow the workforce to prepare thoroughly for that week, but also enable families to make alternative childcare arrangements as needed."" Christmas Covid rules 'not an instruction to meet up' Tighter Covid restrictions in Wales before Christmas considered Masks compulsory in Welsh schools communal areas It said a survey of members prompted a thousand responses with 75% in favour of online learning in the final week of term. The union has also asked the minister to consider an alternative or parallel move to offer Covid tests to staff members once contact with pupils and students has come to an end, from 18 December onwards. Some local authorities are also believed to be in favour of closing school sites a week early, though provision for children of key workers and vulnerable children would be one potential concern. The latest Public Health Wales figures show that 50.3% of primary schools and 87.9% of secondary schools have had at least one Covid-19 case since the start of term. There were 414 positive tests amongst school pupils or staff in the week up to 25 November. Face masks are now compulsory in communal areas in schools across Wales However Mr Drakeford said he had ""no intention"" in allowing schools to close early. ""We will do everything we can to keep our schools working up until Christmas,"" he said during the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing on Friday. ""We'll do that alongside the unions, the head teachers and the local education authorities. ""It is more important for our children not to miss out further on the education planned for them for the whole of the rest of this term. That's what we will be working to achieve.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson addresses criticism of ""tough"" tiers plan Boris Johnson has defended his decision to place 55 million people in England into the two highest tiers of Covid restrictions, arguing the country needs ""simplicity and clarity"". The PM said measures due to come in when lockdown ends on Wednesday were more ""relaxed"" but would ""drive"" Covid down until a vaccine is available. But a group of Tory MPs is threatening to rebel in a Commons vote on Tuesday. If Labour backs them, this could threaten the government's majority. There is concern that the government is adopting a ""one-size-fits all"" approach, which does not reflect local levels of infection. Almost all of England facing tough virus rules Postcode check - what is my tier? Tiers and Christmas - a recipe for disaster? From Wednesday, more than 32 million people are due to be living under tier two restrictions, banning indoor meetings between households. A further 23 million people would be placed under the highest - tier three - restrictions, which further limit contact between people outdoors. Just over 1% of England's population would enter the lowest - tier one - restrictions, under which the ""rule of six"" applies both indoors and outdoors. Conservative MP and former cabinet minister Damian Green, who represents Ashford, in Kent, which is set to go into tier three, told the BBC he would vote against the government unless it provided ""new and convincing evidence"". ""Instead of having these wide county-based areas, where people are put in tiers, then we should do it on a borough basis,"" he said. ""In an area like mine, the incidence is less than it is in Liverpool, which has just been released down into tier two. So, as it stands, the current policy, the current allocation of tiers on these wide bases, are just not evidence-based."" This video can not be played How you and your family can celebrate Christmas and minimise the spread of coronavirus Speaking on a visit to Public Health England laboratories, at Porton Down, Wiltshire, Mr Johnson said he understood the ""frustration"" of those in higher-tier areas, whose own town or village did not have high levels of the disease. But he added that the government ""cannot divide the country up into loads and loads of very complicated sub-divisions"" and had to ensure ""some simplicity and clarity"". ""Unless you beat the problem in the high-incidence area, the low-incidence area, I'm afraid, starts to catch up,"" Mr Johnson said. He said ""tough tiering"" was still more ""relaxed by a long way than the current lockdown measures"" and it would ""drive the disease down... until a vaccine comes on stream, which we hope will be over the next weeks and months"". Asked about mass Covid testing, Mr Johnson said: ""The supply [of kits] I don't think is going to be the problem. The issue is going to be getting everybody mobilised to understand the potential advantage of [it]."" Aware of the disquiet on its own backbenches, the government has promised to publish impact assessments of the new restrictions; a key demand from concerned MPs. There's also a suggestion that areas could move into lower tiers when numbers are reviewed at regular intervals. But that's unlikely to see off the brewing Tory rebellion. Some Conservatives have already publicly declared that they won't vote for the new tier system when it's put before the Commons next week. If enough rebel the government might have to look to the opposition to get this through Parliament. Sir Keir Starmer is still deciding whether his party will back the plan, although it is likely to have enough support overall. However, it's not a good look for the government to have to rely on Labour in the face of unrest on its own benches. The Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs, set up to scrutinise the government's response to the pandemic, is threatening a revolt in next Tuesday's vote. The group's chair, Mark Harper, said evidence provided by the government to justify the tier system was not ""compelling"". He called for more information on the measures' effects on different sectors of the economy. He added that on ""too many occasions, ministers have made arguments and they've not stacked up"". Deputy chairman Steve Baker called the measures ""truly appalling"" and said the modelling used by government scientists had been ""wrong time and time again"". The group claims to have 70 members, but it is not certain how many of them would be expected to rebel against the government. This video can not be played The BBC's Laura Foster explains the new three tier system for England. Forty-three Conservatives would have to defy the prime minister to defeat the plan, if all opposition MPs also voted against. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is expected to decide early next week whether to support Mr Johnson, after consulting government coronavirus experts. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Labour was ""not against"" tougher restrictions or tiers, but would seek ""reassurances"" on support for the poor and vulnerable. MASS TESTING:Where is it available? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Under the government's plan, Kent and large parts of the Midlands, north-east and north-west England would go into tier three. Only Cornwall, the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight would be in tier one. Mr Johnson said the government's planned ""review point"" - on 16 December - gave the ""prospect of areas being able to move down the tier scale"". But Professor John Edmunds, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said he could not imagine ""huge changes"" to restrictions by then. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that experts were unlikely to ""have accumulated much data"" in time. The government has promised to publish an impact assessment before MPs vote on the new rules.

"Christopher Robinson was linked to the murder by DNA and CCTV evidence A west Belfast man found guilty of murdering a prison officer, who died 11 days after a bomb exploded under his van, has been given a minimum jail term of 22 years. Adrian Ismay, 52, died in hospital in 2016after he was injured in the explosion near his home at Hillsborough Drive in east Belfast. Christopher Robinson, 50, from Aspen Walk, had denied the murder. In March, a judge said Robinson was ""intimately and inextricably involved"". Robinson was also found guilty of possessing an improvised explosive device. The non-jury trial heard that Robinson knew his victim from their time volunteering together for St John Ambulance. Mr Justice McAlinden told Belfast Crown Court that Mr Ismay's murder had been ""perpetrated in pursuance of a twisted republican terrorist ideology"". Adrian Ismay had volunteered with St John Ambulance along with Robinson ""The defendant played an important and integral role in planning and carrying out the terrorist operation which resulted in the death of Mr Ismay,"" he added. Robinson was given a life sentence for the murder, but will be eligible to apply for release under licence after 22 years, the judge said. In 2016, a dissident republican group widely referred to as the New IRA had claimed it had carried out the attack on Mr Ismay. Robinson had denied he was an active member of the New IRA. Before determining the appropriate minimum sentence, the judge highlighted the victim impact statements the court had received from Mr Ismay's widow and his daughters. He said the ""heart-wrenching statements managed with dignified reserve to convey how deeply they all loved Mr Ismay and how intensely he adored them"". ""Only the hardest and coldest heart of stone would not be deeply affected reading them and anyone of normal sensitivity could not but readily perceive how each of the authors of those statement and those referred to therein have been utterly devastated by this murder and their lives have been altered irretrievably,"" he added. ""They will endure the cruel impact of the tragic loss of Mr Ismay for the rest of their lives."" Mr Justice McAlinden said ""the loss of Mr Ismay's life cannot be measured by the length of a minimum term prison sentence"". A bomb detonated under Adrian Ismay's van in the Cregagh area of Belfast The judge also paid tribute to the ""unstinting community service"" which Mr Ismay had engaged in. ""He lived to train, help and guide others,"" he said. ""He was a decent, warm, generous and loving human being and our society is the poorer for his loss. ""If only there were more like him. ""His legacy is his example of unstinting and enthusiastic community engagement; reaching out to and engaging with all, irrespective of background."" Mr Ismay had just left his home and was driving along Hillsborough Drive at about 07:00 GMT on 4 March 2016 when the bomb planted under his van detonated. In spite of appearing to make a good recovery from shrapnel injuries, he died 11 days later. In March, a judge said Robinson was linked to the murder by evidence including his DNA on a Poppy Appeal sticker that was removed from a vehicle containing traces of Semtex. He also said CCTV footage clearly showed the vehicle - which was registered to Robinson's sister-in-law - outside Mr Ismay's home when the bomb was planted. The judge added that CCTV at the workplace of Robinson's brother had been disabled several times by his sibling so he could not be filmed visiting him. Robinson's high level of online interest into the treatment of dissident republican prisoners - as well as internet searches about militant republican activity - was further evidence cited by the judge. Det Supt Richard Campbell, from the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), said Robinson's sentence was ""deserving"" for the ""brutal and horrific killing"" of Mr Ismay. ""He knew Mr Ismay, as they volunteered together in the local community, but callously betrayed him by his involvement in planting an explosive device under the prison officer's van just because of how he earned his living,"" he said. Det Supt Richard Campbell, from the PSNI's Major Investigation Team, said it was a ""reckless attack"" ""Adrian Ismay, who was a husband and a father, was a hard-working man who had left his home that Friday morning to do his job and to keep people safe,"" he added. He said his thoughts were with Mr Ismay's family who ""will be reliving the horror of what happened more than four and a half years ago"". ""They face their own life sentence as they will never see Mr Ismay again. Their lives have been shattered,"" he said. He added that while sentencing would not ""take away the pain and heartache felt each day by his family"" he hoped it would ""bring them some comfort in knowing that his killer is behind bars"".

"The government has announced the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England, and Scotland has taken similar steps. Here are some of your questions on the changes: Because your son is in a clinical risk group - and as long as he is over five - he shouldsoon be offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. You should be contacted by your GP or specialist team to arrange this. With regard to the dangers of mixing, the UK has also recommended that Covid vaccines are offered to all children aged 5 to 11, not just those at high clinical risk. This is likely to start in England in April. Children are generally at much lower risk of becoming seriously ill from a Covid infection, although some do still get sick and need hospital care. Over-12s can already be vaccinated, and it's hoped that extending the rollout to younger age groups will help protect even more children from the risk of catching and spreading Covid. Schools are expected to work with and support families who have concerns about a pupil returning to the classroom. It is compulsory for school-age children to attend, even if they were previously shielding - the only exception is a small number of children whose clinician or GP has advised them not to attend. If you have concerns about this, you should talk to your doctor. If you live in England and are not in a vulnerable group yourself, it is unlikely that you will be entitled to a free test after 1 April. From that point, lateral flow tests should be available to buy from pharmacies and other retailers. The government says it will continue to provide free tests to the oldest age groups and those most vulnerable to Covid. We don't have the details of how this will work yet, but your mother and her care workers should still be eligible for free tests. Care homes are responsible for their own visiting policies, but at the moment across the UK, all visitors are expected to test for Covid before arrival. The chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance has warned that further variants of Covid are expected - and that they could be more severe than previous ones. Therefore, although most of the free testing system is being dismantled in England, the government insists that the UK will continue to do detailed checks and surveillance to look for resurgences of Covid and any concerning new variants which may emerge. For example, some people in the community will still be asked to do regular tests for Covid as part of theOffice for National Statisticsâ Infection Survey. Positive test results collected this way can be analysed to identify the type of Covid people have. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have learned a great deal about how to track the virus, and the government says it will be possible to scale up such operations again in the future if necessary. Trials are already underway to test updated vaccines that could be a better match for the virus as it continues to change. The UK government also says it will also help support other countries in developing their own surveillance capabilities, because a new variant can emerge anywhere. NHS England says patients and staff should continue to wear face masks in GP practiceseven though they are no longer mandatory in public places. Face coverings also remain compulsory in healthcare settings in Scotland and Wales, and it is ""strongly advised"" that people wear them in Northern Ireland. Your doctor will be able to advise about what tests you will need before you have an operation. You may need to have a Covid test, and the government has said free testing will still be available in certain settings, such as hospitals. Infection control measures will continue to help keep people safe and limit the spread of the virus. SYMPTOMS:How do I know I've got Covid?

"Thousands of fans came to see Maradona's coffin on display at the presidential palace Three workers hired to help with the funeral and burial of Diego Maradona have been condemned for taking photos next to his open coffin. A funeral parlour took on the three to help prepare the coffin of the football icon, who died on Wednesday aged 60. In two pictures, the men can be seen posing next to the open casket at the parlour, smiling with their thumbs up. The photos surfaced online as Maradona's body lay in repose at the presidential palace, provoking outrage. Maradona's agent and lawyer, MatÃ­as Morla, vowed to take legal action against the ""scoundrel"" responsible for the photos. ""For the memory of my friend, I won't rest until he pays for such an atrocity,""Mr Morla wrote on Twitter,external. Obituary: Argentina's flawed football icon Footballer laid to rest as Argentina grieves The manager of the Sepelios Pinier funeral parlour in the Paternal district of Buenos Aires, MatÃ­as PicÃ³n, told local media that the three men in the photos were ""outsourced employees"" who had helped carry the heavy coffin. ""We are devastated,""Mr PicÃ³n, told the TN news channel,external. ""The family trusted us, we have been working with them for a long time."" Argentina's President Alberto FernÃ¡ndez was among those to pay his respects to Maradona Mr PicÃ³n said his company had organised funeral services for other members of the Maradona family. ""The family has total confidence in us, that's why we are so affected,"" he said. ""My father is 75 years old and he is crying, I am crying, my brother too, we are destroyed,"" Mr PicÃ³n added. When he called Maradona's ex-wife, Claudia VillafaÃ±e, to tell her about the photos, ""she was furious"". The coffin was draped in Argentina's national flag The PicÃ³ns said they did not know if the Maradona family planned to take any legal action. Judicial sourcestold the TÃ©lam news agency,externalthat no crime had been reported in relation to the photos, so no complaint had been filed by prosecutors. Maradona was buried in a private ceremony on Thursday, the first of three days of mourning declared over his death in Argentina. Maradona was buried in a cemetery where his parents were laid to rest Maradona's coffin - draped in Argentina's national flag and football shirt, bearing his trademark No 10 - was on public display at the presidential palace in Buenos Aires earlier in the day. Thousands of adoring fans filed through the door of the Casa Rosada to say goodbye to their hero, but the wake ended prematurely after clashes between police and some mourners waiting in line.

He had successful surgery on a brain blood clot earlier in November and was to be treated for alcohol dependency. He had a tumultuous personal life, scarred by alcohol and cocaine addiction, which caused him health problems.

"Helen Jeremy believes she would not have become blind if her monthly eye injections were not cancelled during lockdown A woman has become blind after her monthly eye injections were delayed for four months during lockdown. Helen Jeremy, 73, said everything she enjoyed doing has ""gone out of the window"" after losing her eyesight. Thousands more people in Wales are at risk of ""irreversible sight loss"" because of treatment delays, RNIB Cymru warns. The Welsh Government said health boards are working to increase services. Mrs Jeremy, from Bridgend, has glaucoma and was diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration four years ago. Monthly injections controlled the condition and meant she could still drive and play the piano. However, her appointments were cancelled when the pandemic struck and her eyesight deteriorated. ""I was panicking. It was terrifying. Because I'm a widow I'm on my own and it was awful,"" she said. ""Suddenly my eyesight was basically gone. By the time of my next appointment I was told there was no point in going on with these injections because the damage had been done to the back of my eye. ""Everything I loved doing has gone out of the window and my life's changed totally."" Ten-fold increase in patients waiting for treatment Covid cancer delays 'could cause 2,000 deaths' Man 'almost blind' after waiting years for eye op Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said priority at the time was based on patient risk. ""We are sorry that Mrs Jeremy sadly experienced deterioration in her eyesight a few weeks following her last treatment in July,"" a spokesperson said. ""Sadly, some eye conditions can become worse over time despite ongoing treatment."" This video can not be played What causes age-related macular degeneration? However, a Freedom of Information request by BBC Wales to all health boards in Wales found more than 33,000 people at risk of sight loss were waiting too long for treatment. Health boards are expected to meet the target to see 95% of the most serious cases on time. The average was 66% for all health boards in March - and that figure fell to just 53% in October. The number of people waiting more than nine months for cataract surgery has also quadrupled in the last year, from 1,096 in October last year to 5,693 this October. Consultant ophthalmologist Gwyn Williams, who specialises in cataract surgery at Singleton Hospital, said the number of people waiting had ""ballooned almost exponentially"". ""It is simply impossible to bring forward the appointment of everybody that asks because our capacity has been cut so severely,"" he said. ""There is a visual price being by the people of our country for the coronavirus restrictions in the name of a greater good of controlling the spread of this virus."" RNIB Cymru described the delays are ""extremely worrying"" and said it has helped other people who believe they have lost vision because of cancelled appointment during the coronavirus pandemic. Director Ansley Workman said that while she recognises the impact of Covid on the NHS, ""that doesn't take away from the fact that there are thousands of people in Wales who are at risk of irreversible sight loss"". RNIB Cymru director Ansley Workman called on the Welsh Government to ensure ""sight is saved"" She called on the Welsh Government to commit to putting in the ""investment and resources to make sure that people are seen in a timely manner and that sight is saved."" ""Before Covid came along there were already people waiting far too long for the treatment they needed to make sure they didn't lose their sight unnecessarily,"" she added. The Welsh Government said optometric practices and hospital eye care departments across Wales have been open for essential and urgent eye care during the pandemic. ""As with all planned care specialities, ophthalmology has been impacted by the pandemic and performance has been effected,"" a spokesperson said. ""Health Boards are working to increase ophthalmology activities and are prioritising patients based on clinical risk.

""It was a sunny day, I would have liked to play longer, for the whole day,"" Mr Bossini told the Piacenza LibertÃ  newspaper.

"This video can not be played The road near Tehran where gunmen opened fire on Mohsen Fakhrizadeh Iran's most senior nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh has been assassinated near the capital Tehran, the country's defence ministry has confirmed. Fakhrizadeh died in hospital after an attack in Absard, in Damavand county. Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, has condemned the killing ""as an act of state terror"". Western intelligence agencies believe Fakhrizadeh was behind a covert Iranian nuclear weapons programme. ""If Iran ever chose to weaponise (enrichment), Fakhrizadeh would be known as the father of the Iranian bomb,"" one Western diplomat told Reuters news agency in 2014. Iran insists its nuclear programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes. But news of the killing comes amid fresh concern about the increased amount of enriched uranium that the country is producing. Enriched uranium is a vital component for both civil nuclear power generation and military nuclear weapons. Trump 'asked about attacking Iran nuclear site' Iran's enriched uranium stockpile '12 times limit' After Trump, what will Biden do about Iran? Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words A 2015 deal with six world powers had placed limits on its production, but since President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018, Iran has been deliberately reneging on its agreements. Joe Biden has pledged to reengage with Iran when he becomes US president in January, despite longstanding opposition from Israel . Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, pictured in an undated photo, was head of the ministry of defence's research and innovation organisation Between 2010 and 2012, four Iranian nuclear scientists were assassinated and Iran has accused Israel of complicity in the killings. Fakhrizadeh's name was specifically mentioned in Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's presentation about Iran's nuclear programme in April 2018. There has been no comment from Israel on the news of the assassination. The Pentagon has also declined to comment, according to Reuters. In a statement on Friday, Iran's defence ministry said: ""Armed terrorists targeted a vehicle carrying Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, head of the ministry's research and innovation organisation. ""After a clash between the terrorists and his bodyguards, Mr Fakhrizadeh was severely injured and rushed to hospital. ""Unfortunately, the medical team's efforts to save him were unsuccessful and minutes ago he passed away."" Iranian media reports said the attackers opened fire on the scientist in his car. Fars news agency earlier reported there was a car explosion in Absard town, with witnesses reporting that ""three to four individuals, who are said to have been terrorists, were killed"". By Paul Adams, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent As head of the ministry of defence's research and innovation organisation, Fakhrizadeh was clearly still a key player. Hence Benjamin Netanyahu's warning, two years ago, to ""remember his name"". Since Iran started breaching its commitments under the terms of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the country has moved ahead rapidly, building stockpiles of low-enriched uranium and enriching to a purity above the level permitted under the deal. Iranian officials have always said such moves are reversible, but developments in research and development are harder to eradicate. ""We cannot go backwards,"" Iran's former ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Ali Asghar Soltanieh, said recently. If Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was the key player Israel alleges, then his death could represent someone's effort to put the brakes on Iran's forward momentum. With the US president-elect, Joe Biden, talking about taking Washington back into the deal with Iran, the assassination could also be aimed at complicating any future negotiations. ""Terrorists murdered an eminent Iranian scientist today,""Iran's foreign minister said in a tweet,external. ""This cowardice - with serious indications of Israeli role - shows desperate warmongering of perpetrators."" Mr Zarif called on the international community to ""condemn this act of state terror"". The scene of the attack in Damavand, near Tehran The commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has said that Iran will avenge the killing of the scientist. ""Assassination of nuclear scientists is the most obvious violation of the global hegemony to prevent our access to modern sciences,"" said Maj Gen Hossein Salami. Former head of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), John Brennan, said the killing of the scientist was a ""criminal"" and ""highly reckless"" act that risks inflaming conflict in the region. In aseries of tweets,external, he said the scientist's death ""risks lethal retaliation and a new round of regional conflict"". Mr Brennan added that he did not know ""whether a foreign government authorised or carried out the murder of Fakhrizadeh"". Fakhrizadeh was the most renowned Iranian nuclear scientist and a senior officer of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. He has long been spoken about by Western security sources as extremely powerful and instrumental in Iran's nuclear programme. According to secret documents obtained by Israel in 2018, he led a programme to create nuclear weapons. At the time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he identified Fakhrizedeh as the head scientist in the programme, and urged people to ""remember that name"". This video can not be played In 2018, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled what he claimed to be Iran's secret atomic archive In 2015,the New York Times compared him to J. Robert Oppenheimer,external, the physicist who directed the Manhattan Project that during World War Two produced the first atomic weapons. A professor of physics, Fakhrizadeh is said to have led Project Amad, the alleged covert programme that was established in 1989 to research the potential for building a nuclear bomb. It was shut down in 2003, according to the IAEA, though Mr Netanyahu said the documents retrieved in 2018 showed Fakhrizadeh led a programme which secretly continued Project Amad's work. The IAEA has long wanted to speak to him as part of its investigations into Iran's nuclear programme. Suspicions that Iran was using the programme as a cover to develop a nuclear bomb prompted the EU, US and UN to impose crippling sanctions in 2010. The 2015 deal that Iran reached with the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany saw it limit its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief. Since President Donald Trump abandoned the deal, it has floundered. Earlier this month, the IAEA said Iran had more than 12 times the amount of enriched uranium than permitted under the deal. Meanwhile, tensions between the US and Iran have escalated, peaking in January with America's assassination of Gen Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' Quds force.

"The government has announced the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England, and Scotland has taken similar steps. Here are some of your questions on the changes: Because your son is in a clinical risk group - and as long as he is over five - he shouldsoon be offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. You should be contacted by your GP or specialist team to arrange this. With regard to the dangers of mixing, the UK has also recommended that Covid vaccines are offered to all children aged 5 to 11, not just those at high clinical risk. This is likely to start in England in April. Children are generally at much lower risk of becoming seriously ill from a Covid infection, although some do still get sick and need hospital care. Over-12s can already be vaccinated, and it's hoped that extending the rollout to younger age groups will help protect even more children from the risk of catching and spreading Covid. Schools are expected to work with and support families who have concerns about a pupil returning to the classroom. It is compulsory for school-age children to attend, even if they were previously shielding - the only exception is a small number of children whose clinician or GP has advised them not to attend. If you have concerns about this, you should talk to your doctor. If you live in England and are not in a vulnerable group yourself, it is unlikely that you will be entitled to a free test after 1 April. From that point, lateral flow tests should be available to buy from pharmacies and other retailers. The government says it will continue to provide free tests to the oldest age groups and those most vulnerable to Covid. We don't have the details of how this will work yet, but your mother and her care workers should still be eligible for free tests. Care homes are responsible for their own visiting policies, but at the moment across the UK, all visitors are expected to test for Covid before arrival. The chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance has warned that further variants of Covid are expected - and that they could be more severe than previous ones. Therefore, although most of the free testing system is being dismantled in England, the government insists that the UK will continue to do detailed checks and surveillance to look for resurgences of Covid and any concerning new variants which may emerge. For example, some people in the community will still be asked to do regular tests for Covid as part of theOffice for National Statisticsâ Infection Survey. Positive test results collected this way can be analysed to identify the type of Covid people have. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have learned a great deal about how to track the virus, and the government says it will be possible to scale up such operations again in the future if necessary. Trials are already underway to test updated vaccines that could be a better match for the virus as it continues to change. The UK government also says it will also help support other countries in developing their own surveillance capabilities, because a new variant can emerge anywhere. NHS England says patients and staff should continue to wear face masks in GP practiceseven though they are no longer mandatory in public places. Face coverings also remain compulsory in healthcare settings in Scotland and Wales, and it is ""strongly advised"" that people wear them in Northern Ireland. Your doctor will be able to advise about what tests you will need before you have an operation. You may need to have a Covid test, and the government has said free testing will still be available in certain settings, such as hospitals. Infection control measures will continue to help keep people safe and limit the spread of the virus. SYMPTOMS:How do I know I've got Covid?

"This video can not be played The Covid uncertainty is ""awful"", pub owner Sian Shepphard says Pubs, restaurants and bars will be subject to stricter Covid-19 restrictions in the run up to Christmas, the first minister has said. The new restrictions, which have not yet been finalised, will come into force from Friday, 4 December. They may be based on the system in some parts of Scotland where no alcohol can be served. Cinemas, bowling alleys and indoor entertainment venues will also have to shut before the festive break. A date for these to close has not yet been agreed. Mark Drakeford said action was needed as case rates continued to rise in the run up to Christmas. But the Welsh Conservatives said any new restrictions would be a ""real blow"" for businesses who had already ""suffered greatly"", while Plaid Cymru said the lack of detail was leaving employers unable to prepare. Pubs, bars and restaurants had only reopened on 9 November after the Wales-wide 17-day lockdown, and are currently made to close at 22:00 GMT. Ahead of the announcement people working in the hospitality industry had warned any further restrictionsbefore Christmas would be a ""big blow"". Plans for the new rules have not yet been finalised, but BBC Wales understands one option being considered is the ""level three"" Scottish system, where venues are banned from selling alcohol and have to close at 18:00. The R rate - the number of people each infected person passed the virus on to - has risen again to 1.4 in Wales, with the rate needing to be below one for the number of cases to fall. This video can not be played ""We need to reduce Covid spread before Christmas"" In England about55 million people are being placed under the tightest level of lockdown rules from 2 December, when an England-wide lockdown ends and a new tiered system is introduced. Speaking at the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said Wales had to use the ""coming weeks"" to reduce the spread of the virus, to ""create more headroom for the Christmas period"". Mr Drakeford said while case rates had fallen following the 17-day firebreak, as people had resumed socialising it they had risen ""faster and further than we anticipated"", and action was needed. A further major package of financial support for businesses affected will be announced on Monday ""This does not mean a return to the firebreak arrangements, but the cabinet has agreed to take further specific and targeted action to reinforce the current national measures we have place,"" he said. Mr Drakeford said he could ""not rule anything out for the future"" in a bid to curb the spread of the virus. Non-essential retail, hairdressers, gyms and leisure centres will stay open, it was confirmed. Speaking of the new measures for pubs, bars and restaurants, Mr Drakeford added: ""I know this will be a worrying time for all working in the industry. ""We will be working over the weekend with partners to finalise the details of the new arrangements and to put in place a further major package of financial support to respond to those changes. ""I will give further details about the package on Monday."" Claire Vaughan, programme manager at Chapter cinema in Cardiff, said: ""Globally no cases of coronavirus have been traced back to a visit to the cinema. ""Cinemas are a low-risk way of spending time outside the house at a time when the mental health of people in Wales is a huge concern. People will watch Mared Williams outside the venue ""Masks are worn, there are air circulation units and no one is facing another person... Not everyone is living in a warm, safe home - many people need these spaces to be open."" Liam Evans-Ford, Theatr Clwyd's executive director, added the announcement had been a ""huge surprise"". ""This is devastating for our business, for our employees, for our freelancers and for our communities,"" he said. Sian Shepphard, owner of the Horse and Jockey in Pontypool, opened the pub in August so has not been eligible for government support. Sian Shepphard is worried about her staff ""The main problem is we are trying to get people to stay at home but it is ruining our businesses,"" she said. ""I employ over 25 staff here - we are a really family-run business. We are all family - how am I supposed to put food on the table for them?"" Phil James, a customer at the pub, said the potential changes would affect his Christmas plans. ""We just don't know what arrangement to make at the end of the day - people have to know. You come out to socialise - people want to be social for Christmas, alcohol is a part of it."" Phil James says pubs play a big part in his festive celebrations Simon Buckley, chairman of The Brewers of Wales, said: ""Is this finally the straw that will break the industry's back? ""We as an industry are being thrown to the wind, and the looming prospect of significant job losses seems to count for nothing."" Plaid's economy spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones said: ""They [pubs and restaurants] don't know if they're being asked to close altogether again, to only do takeaways, to have restricted opening without alcohol. ""So, they can't really prepare. They need to be given the maximum length of time to prepare."" Clwyd West member of the Senedd Darren Millar called for a targeted rather than a Wales-wide blanket approach. ""It is grossly unfair to impose the same level of restrictions in Conwy and Denbighshire as Covid-19 hotspots in south Wales,"" he said. ""The virus is circulating at different rates in different parts of the country."" Mr Drakeford insisted there were no plans to introduce regionalised ""tiered"" restrictions, similar to those coming into force in England. He said there was no case for aligning the Welsh and English systems to ensure no-one was left out of UK-wide Treasury schemes that offer financial assistance to businesses affected by lockdown measures. ""We don't lose out on any UK system by having a single tier for Wales, so there is no disadvantage to us in that,"" he said. He added: ""The advice we have is that a single set of arrangements for Wales works best, is easiest to communicate and delivers benefits in all parts of Wales."" Pembrokeshire councillor John Davies welcomed the restrictions after a spike in cases in his ward, Cilgerran, linked to the recent outbreak in nearby Cardigan. He told Newyddion 9: ""If people aren't willing to exercise common sense and be citizens of responsibility towards each other, there is no other option. ""We've seen what happens in this part of the world when people act in a selfish manner."" Children are currently in ""class bubbles"" during school Mr Drakeford said he had no plans to allow schools to close early for Christmas. Teaching union UCAC hadcalled for classrooms to be shuton 11 December and for lessons to be moved online amid fears teachers and pupils may have to isolate on Christmas Day. But Mr Drakeford said ministers would do ""everything we can"" to keep schools working up until the Christmas holiday. He added: ""It is more important for our children not to miss out further on the education that is planned for them for the whole of the rest of this term and that's what we will be working to achieve.""

"The UK's estimated coronavirus R number has fallen to between 0.9 and 1 for the first time since mid-August - so the epidemic is no longer though to be growing UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended the ""simplicity and clarity"" of tier allocations for Covid rules in England The government says it will publish an impact assessment before MPs get a chance to vote on the new rules on Tuesday If 40 Tory backbenchers rebel, the PM may need Labour's help in winning the vote Labour is expected to decide next week whether to back the plans, after consulting Covid experts Fresh curbs on hospitality and entertainment venues will be brought in across Wales from next Friday UK high street retailer Arcadia is understood to be on the verge of collapse, with the firm saying the pandemic has had a ""material impact"" on trading Fans in Italy have defied lockdown rules by gathering at Napoli stadium for a second day, to mark the death of football legend Diego Maradona There have been more than 60 million coronavirus cases and 1.4 million deaths across the globe, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Rob Corp and Alice Evans We are ending our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for the day, so thank you for joining us. Friday's coverage has been brought to you by: Joseph Lee, Katie Wright, Lauren Turner, Robin Levinson King, Alice Evans and Rob Corp. Here are some of the main UK stories from today.    Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen found the plight of mink farmers overwhelming Here's a quick recap of some of the coronavirus headlines from around the world today. The announcement of the new coronavirus restrictions for England, which will come into force from 2 December, has prompted questions and concerns from business owners and families. ""They have changed the rules in the middle of the game,"" says Amanda Thompson, managing director of amusement park Blackpool Pleasure Beach in Lancashire, which will go into the toughest tier of measures - tier three. Amanda has been trying to work out how she will make it to Christmas. ""I had a pantomime due to start next week, a dinner show due to begin, a lot of people who have been unemployed all year because they are performers unable to perform."" The visitor attraction, which is almost 125 years old, has survived two world wars only to be bought to a ""grinding halt"" this year. ""Without Blackpool Pleasure Beach there is no Blackpool. Perhaps people don't find it interesting in London but it is of interest to the millions of people who come here."" While the resort had been operating in a Covid-secure way over the summer, Amanda says it will now be closed until next year unless restrictions are relaxed. ""Â£250,000 of cancellations came in yesterday,"" she adds. Read more about how others are coming to terms with the new measures.  Jayne Nash is part of the team which has taken over the Never Say Die pub Why, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, would anybody decide to take over a pub? ""Crazy? We probably are,"" says Jayne Nash, from the village of Jaywick, on the Essex coast. ""But it was an opportunity we couldn't miss."" For years, she has been a regular at the Never Say Die, which sits 20m (60ft) from the beach. But now she is on the other side of the bar, as part of a team that reopened the ""community pub"" on 1 August, supported initially by grants from a number of organisations. ""We had a week to get going. It was all hands on deck,"" says Jayne. ""It was brilliant."" Takings reached about Â£1,000 per night, but within weeks of reopening, the team received the worst possible news in the form of a second lockdown. However, Jayne remains positive about the pub's future. ""We want to make it grow,"" she says. ""We've had so many volunteers come forward since we started. People know what we're doing and they want to help."" Read the full story here. Black Friday started earlier this year asUK shoppers turned to online services during the pandemic. The number of parcels being delivered started increasing sharply from the end of October. By last week, it had already surpassed last year's post-Black Friday peak, according to new data. Metapack, which acts as a go-between for retailers and couriers, said parcel volumes were already up by 70% this week, compared with the same week last year. In a normal year, retailers would expect the week in which Black Friday falls to be the most profitable of the year. But sales were already up by between 50 and 60% in each of the first three weeks of November, according to IMRG, which collects data from online retailing companies. Hundreds of people in England have beenwrongly told they have coronavirus by NHS Test and Traceafter a ""laboratory error"". More than 1,300 people who gave samples between 19 and 23 November received positive results, when the tests were actually void. All of those affected will be told to take another test, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said. Duncan Larcombe, said his two children, aged 14 and nine, were both sent home from school to self-isolate and he was unable to work. His 14-year-old daughter who tested positive ""had not left her bedroom"" for four days, with meals being left outside her door, until learning the result was void on Thursday. ""We were taking it very seriously,"" he said. DHSC said it was an ""isolated incident"" caused by an ""issue with a batch of testing chemicals"" which had affected tests taken across the UK. Shaimaa KhalilAustralia correspondent Matt Lanigan says the lockdown was ""pretty grim"" Melbourne's second lockdown, which began in July, went on to become one of the longest and strictest in the world until it ended last month. ""The streets were completely deserted. It was like something out of [post-apocalyptic film] Mad Max,"" says Matt Lanigan, who owns a cafe on Chapel St, the city's iconic shopping strip. ""It was brutal,"" Matt says of trying keep his business afloat. ""It was like I was in a boxing match and I just got knocked to the floor. For a moment there, I felt like maybe it wasn't worth getting up."" But things are slowly turning around. Earlier today, Melbourne and the state of Victoria reported the 28th consecutive day with no new infections. After seeing daily cases soar above 700 in July and August,the city is seen as an example for the rest of the world on how to handle a second outbreak. Melbourne's Chapel St is buzzing again Now on reopened Chapel St, music and chatter fill the air as people enjoy their Sunday brunches. But despite the high spirits, everywhere you look there are signs of how battered this city has been. Many businesses are still shut, and others are open but half empty. Matt says the real economic and mental health toll will become clearer in the months to come, especially when government wage subsidy schemes end. Er Shun, above, and Da Mao spent time at Toronto Zoo before being sent to Calgary A Canadian zoo is sending two pandas back to their previous home in China due to a bamboo shortage caused by the pandemic. The Calgary Zoo had hoped to return Er Shun and Da Mao earlier, as bamboo
 supplies dwindled, but there were significant delays in obtaining the 
permits to ship them home. ""Today is the day!"" the zoo posted on Facebook on Friday. The zoo had raised concerns in May that the pandemic was impacting supplies. Giant pandas eat about 40kg of fresh bamboo a day. Er Shun and Da Mao arrived in Canada in 2014, as part of a 10-year loan from China. They spent the first five years at a Toronto Zoo, where they gave birth birth to two cubs,Jia Panpan and Jia Yueyue. The adult pandas were meant to spend the next five years in Calgary. More vaccines need to be developed in the fight against coronavirus, the World Health Organization's chief scientist has said. Dr Soumya Swaminathan said some vaccines might benefit certain group such as pregnant women or older people more than others, while alternative jabs might give better immunity or be more affordable. She said potential vaccines at relatively early stages of development must continue to be trialled so that there is then ""a choice, a basket of vaccines that we can choose from and be able to target them to different situations in countries with different populations"". This video can not be played Tiffany Pearson-Gills took over the Junction pub in September The landlords of two pubs in an English village that sits on a county border say it makes no sense thatonly one of them can open under coronavirus measures coming into force next week. Groombridge has two pubs, but the Crown Inn is in Kent's tier three and the Junction is in East Sussex's tier two. In tier three, pubs must close apart from offering takeaway or delivery services, but in tier two, they can open as long as they serve substantial meals. Under next week's rules, residents on either side of Groombridge, home to about 1,600 people, should not cross over the county border at a bridge over the River Grom - meaning Kent villagers cannot enjoy the reopening of the East Sussex pub. Steve Harmes, at the Crown, says not being able to open is ""very frustrating"". ""We were not in such a bad position before, but now, being put in this position, it's really hard for us to move forward."" He said even if the tiers were reviewed in December, the pub would not be able to prepare and take advantage of the busy Christmas period. A seven-minute walk away - or 0.4 miles - at the Junction pub, landlady Tiffany Pearson-Gills calls the new rules ""perplexing"". The Crown Inn is in Kent, so will go into tier three next week ""For such a small village... it just doesn't make any sense at all,"" she said. She took over the Junction in September and spent several weeks renovating it but had to put off an opening on 5 November. She said the pub had been fortunate, adding: ""It's great for us, but it doesn't make sense that the Crown up the road cannot [open]. It's just so close, it's a really, really difficult one."" Cardiff city centre has been gearing up for Christmas In Wales, while rules are in place, people can still go to the pub, meet others at a social distance and head out to buy presents. But from 2 December, across the border in England, about 55 million people will be living under strict rules. So what do England's tiers mean for those living and working in Wales? Next Wednesday as the lockdown ends in England, areas will be placed under tiers, from one to three, depending on how high their case rate is. But while the rules do not apply in Wales, the changes over the border could affect your family, work or business over the coming days. We've taken a look at what the changes could mean for you.Read more here.  A further 521 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, the UK government has announced. By this measure, that brings the total number of Covid deaths in the country to 57,551. Meanwhile,the government also reported,externala further 16,022 new cases of the virus in the past 24 hours. More than 1.5 million cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the UK since the epidemic began. Teachers have warned ofa ""collapse"" in secondary school attendanceafter the second wave of the pandemic spread across the UK during autumn. Relatively few pupils have tested positive, but hundreds of thousands have had to learn from home after being required to self-isolate. We have been taking a look at what impact that is having on schools, parents and pupils themselves, as many prepare for exams. Merseyside, for example, has been one of the areas worst-hit in the UK's second wave of the pandemic. And at The Prescot School in Knowsley that has meant a collective 700 days in the classroom lost for the year 11 students preparing for exams in the summer. One student, Ben, told the BBC: ""Year 11 is such a crucial year, you've got exams and mock exams and that's the main thing that's going to set you for life. ""As someone who's self-isolated already, I think it's really stressful to even think about the exams that we've got to do in a few months' time when we've missed out a large chunk of school.""  Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Slopes in ski resorts in Switzerland are already open Across the Alps, countries are agonising over how to control the spread of coronavirus while allowing the winter sports season to begin. Germany has suggestedkeeping all ski resorts closed over the festive season,while Italy would like to wait to open them until mid-January. In Switzerland however, the slopes are already open â despite the country having one of the highest infection rates in Europe. The idea of closing the ski slopes has caused indignation in Switzerland - perhaps especially since closures are being proposed by its bigger European neighbours. The idea is almost as bad, harrumphed one editorial, as joining the EU itself. Switzerlandâs ski resorts seem convinced of their safety measures: masks on all lifts, strict distancing while waiting, and no apres-ski bars. The Swiss government knows the strategy is risky. With everywhere else closed, skiers from across Europe might come to Switzerland, catch the virus, and then take it home â a nightmarish, Europe-wide superspreader event. But there is method in what seems like madness. If the Christmas and New Year ski weeks go safely, Switzerland stands to make a tidy profit while its neighbours are left empty-handed. Now for some news onthe global race to develop and distribute a coronavirus vaccine, to help bring an end to the pandemic. Canada's federal government has said that as many as three million people in the country could be vaccinated by early 2021 - but how this will happen remains unclear. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was criticised this week after he said Canada's pharmaceutical industry is not equipped to produce Covid vaccines domestically. It means Canada will likely have to import the vaccine from the US, and will therefore be second in line. The government has tried to reassure Canadians, noting that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine could be approved by December and that three million people - less than 10% of the population - could be vaccinated by early next year. However, supplies will be limited to begin with, and early vaccines will be distributed to high-priority groups only. Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News According to the governmentâs scientific advisory group, Sage, England's former three-tiered system was not controlling the spread of the virus. That was largely because cases were rising in tier one areas, so it would only be a matter of time before those areas would have to move up a tier. Itâs now expected to work the other way round â with theareas with the tighter restrictions expected to move down a tieras infections decrease. Ministers have promised a review of their tier allocations every two weeks - with the first one expected on 16 December. But some Sage experts have said today that they believe mid-December is too soon to make any significant changes. The next assessment will be after the UK-widerelaxation of measures for the Christmas period, which is likely to see a rise in cases. Depending on how much of a surge there is, itâs likely to be mid-January at the very earliest before significant numbers of regions could be moved to lower tiers - with some possibly even going up one. An eight-year-old boy who wrote to Boris Johnson asking if Santa would be able to visit as usual said he was""shocked"" that the ""busiest man in the country""had replied. Monti, from Cockermouth, Cumbria, asked if the government had ""thought about Santa coming this Christmas"" - and received a reply saying Father Christmas was ""ready and raring to go"". ""In June I heard the pandemic might go on for a long time and it could reach up to Christmas,"" he said. ""I got a bit worried so I wondered if I should write to the prime minister, so I did. ""I asked him if everyone has to put hand sanitiser by the cookies and if he can actually come and keep the Christmas spirit alive. ""If the Christmas spirit isn't kept alive then no one will be happy.""  We've been busy answering questions you have about the restrictions in place - including the end of England's lockdown, and the new tougher tiers. Kevin from Norwichwanted to know whether businesses can reopen on 2 December - or if they have to wait til the following day. The government has confirmed that the new tiers system will âcome into effect from the beginning of Wednesday 2 Decemberâ, marking the end of the lockdown. In all tiers, all non-essential retail, including indoor and outdoor markets and car boot sales, can reopen from Wednesday, but must continue to follow Covid-19 secure guidelines. Read other questions we have answered here- you can also submit your own. Nottingham Trent University students Laura Puttock (left) and Emma de Duve say they are ""absolutely gutted"" Nottinghamshire residents have expressed theirdisappointment at returning to the top tier of England's Covid-19 restrictionswhen the national lockdown ends on Wednesday.

"This video can not be played The road near Tehran where gunmen opened fire on Mohsen Fakhrizadeh Iran's most senior nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh has been assassinated near the capital Tehran, the country's defence ministry has confirmed. Fakhrizadeh died in hospital after an attack in Absard, in Damavand county. Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, has condemned the killing ""as an act of state terror"". Western intelligence agencies believe Fakhrizadeh was behind a covert Iranian nuclear weapons programme. ""If Iran ever chose to weaponise (enrichment), Fakhrizadeh would be known as the father of the Iranian bomb,"" one Western diplomat told Reuters news agency in 2014. Iran insists its nuclear programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes. But news of the killing comes amid fresh concern about the increased amount of enriched uranium that the country is producing. Enriched uranium is a vital component for both civil nuclear power generation and military nuclear weapons. Trump 'asked about attacking Iran nuclear site' Iran's enriched uranium stockpile '12 times limit' After Trump, what will Biden do about Iran? Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words A 2015 deal with six world powers had placed limits on its production, but since President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018, Iran has been deliberately reneging on its agreements. Joe Biden has pledged to reengage with Iran when he becomes US president in January, despite longstanding opposition from Israel . Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, pictured in an undated photo, was head of the ministry of defence's research and innovation organisation Between 2010 and 2012, four Iranian nuclear scientists were assassinated and Iran has accused Israel of complicity in the killings. Fakhrizadeh's name was specifically mentioned in Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's presentation about Iran's nuclear programme in April 2018. There has been no comment from Israel on the news of the assassination. The Pentagon has also declined to comment, according to Reuters. In a statement on Friday, Iran's defence ministry said: ""Armed terrorists targeted a vehicle carrying Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, head of the ministry's research and innovation organisation. ""After a clash between the terrorists and his bodyguards, Mr Fakhrizadeh was severely injured and rushed to hospital. ""Unfortunately, the medical team's efforts to save him were unsuccessful and minutes ago he passed away."" Iranian media reports said the attackers opened fire on the scientist in his car. Fars news agency earlier reported there was a car explosion in Absard town, with witnesses reporting that ""three to four individuals, who are said to have been terrorists, were killed"". By Paul Adams, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent As head of the ministry of defence's research and innovation organisation, Fakhrizadeh was clearly still a key player. Hence Benjamin Netanyahu's warning, two years ago, to ""remember his name"". Since Iran started breaching its commitments under the terms of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the country has moved ahead rapidly, building stockpiles of low-enriched uranium and enriching to a purity above the level permitted under the deal. Iranian officials have always said such moves are reversible, but developments in research and development are harder to eradicate. ""We cannot go backwards,"" Iran's former ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Ali Asghar Soltanieh, said recently. If Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was the key player Israel alleges, then his death could represent someone's effort to put the brakes on Iran's forward momentum. With the US president-elect, Joe Biden, talking about taking Washington back into the deal with Iran, the assassination could also be aimed at complicating any future negotiations. ""Terrorists murdered an eminent Iranian scientist today,""Iran's foreign minister said in a tweet,external. ""This cowardice - with serious indications of Israeli role - shows desperate warmongering of perpetrators."" Mr Zarif called on the international community to ""condemn this act of state terror"". The scene of the attack in Damavand, near Tehran The commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has said that Iran will avenge the killing of the scientist. ""Assassination of nuclear scientists is the most obvious violation of the global hegemony to prevent our access to modern sciences,"" said Maj Gen Hossein Salami. Former head of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), John Brennan, said the killing of the scientist was a ""criminal"" and ""highly reckless"" act that risks inflaming conflict in the region. In aseries of tweets,external, he said the scientist's death ""risks lethal retaliation and a new round of regional conflict"". Mr Brennan added that he did not know ""whether a foreign government authorised or carried out the murder of Fakhrizadeh"". Fakhrizadeh was the most renowned Iranian nuclear scientist and a senior officer of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. He has long been spoken about by Western security sources as extremely powerful and instrumental in Iran's nuclear programme. According to secret documents obtained by Israel in 2018, he led a programme to create nuclear weapons. At the time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he identified Fakhrizedeh as the head scientist in the programme, and urged people to ""remember that name"". This video can not be played In 2018, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled what he claimed to be Iran's secret atomic archive In 2015,the New York Times compared him to J. Robert Oppenheimer,external, the physicist who directed the Manhattan Project that during World War Two produced the first atomic weapons. A professor of physics, Fakhrizadeh is said to have led Project Amad, the alleged covert programme that was established in 1989 to research the potential for building a nuclear bomb. It was shut down in 2003, according to the IAEA, though Mr Netanyahu said the documents retrieved in 2018 showed Fakhrizadeh led a programme which secretly continued Project Amad's work. The IAEA has long wanted to speak to him as part of its investigations into Iran's nuclear programme. Suspicions that Iran was using the programme as a cover to develop a nuclear bomb prompted the EU, US and UN to impose crippling sanctions in 2010. The 2015 deal that Iran reached with the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany saw it limit its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief. Since President Donald Trump abandoned the deal, it has floundered. Earlier this month, the IAEA said Iran had more than 12 times the amount of enriched uranium than permitted under the deal. Meanwhile, tensions between the US and Iran have escalated, peaking in January with America's assassination of Gen Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' Quds force.

"The UK's estimated coronavirus R number has fallen to between 0.9 and 1 for the first time since mid-August - so the epidemic is no longer though to be growing UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended the ""simplicity and clarity"" of tier allocations for Covid rules in England The government says it will publish an impact assessment before MPs get a chance to vote on the new rules on Tuesday If 40 Tory backbenchers rebel, the PM may need Labour's help in winning the vote Labour is expected to decide next week whether to back the plans, after consulting Covid experts Fresh curbs on hospitality and entertainment venues will be brought in across Wales from next Friday UK high street retailer Arcadia is understood to be on the verge of collapse, with the firm saying the pandemic has had a ""material impact"" on trading Fans in Italy have defied lockdown rules by gathering at Napoli stadium for a second day, to mark the death of football legend Diego Maradona There have been more than 60 million coronavirus cases and 1.4 million deaths across the globe, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Rob Corp and Alice Evans We are ending our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for the day, so thank you for joining us. Friday's coverage has been brought to you by: Joseph Lee, Katie Wright, Lauren Turner, Robin Levinson King, Alice Evans and Rob Corp. Here are some of the main UK stories from today.    Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen found the plight of mink farmers overwhelming Here's a quick recap of some of the coronavirus headlines from around the world today. The announcement of the new coronavirus restrictions for England, which will come into force from 2 December, has prompted questions and concerns from business owners and families. ""They have changed the rules in the middle of the game,"" says Amanda Thompson, managing director of amusement park Blackpool Pleasure Beach in Lancashire, which will go into the toughest tier of measures - tier three. Amanda has been trying to work out how she will make it to Christmas. ""I had a pantomime due to start next week, a dinner show due to begin, a lot of people who have been unemployed all year because they are performers unable to perform."" The visitor attraction, which is almost 125 years old, has survived two world wars only to be bought to a ""grinding halt"" this year. ""Without Blackpool Pleasure Beach there is no Blackpool. Perhaps people don't find it interesting in London but it is of interest to the millions of people who come here."" While the resort had been operating in a Covid-secure way over the summer, Amanda says it will now be closed until next year unless restrictions are relaxed. ""Â£250,000 of cancellations came in yesterday,"" she adds. Read more about how others are coming to terms with the new measures.  Jayne Nash is part of the team which has taken over the Never Say Die pub Why, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, would anybody decide to take over a pub? ""Crazy? We probably are,"" says Jayne Nash, from the village of Jaywick, on the Essex coast. ""But it was an opportunity we couldn't miss."" For years, she has been a regular at the Never Say Die, which sits 20m (60ft) from the beach. But now she is on the other side of the bar, as part of a team that reopened the ""community pub"" on 1 August, supported initially by grants from a number of organisations. ""We had a week to get going. It was all hands on deck,"" says Jayne. ""It was brilliant."" Takings reached about Â£1,000 per night, but within weeks of reopening, the team received the worst possible news in the form of a second lockdown. However, Jayne remains positive about the pub's future. ""We want to make it grow,"" she says. ""We've had so many volunteers come forward since we started. People know what we're doing and they want to help."" Read the full story here. Black Friday started earlier this year asUK shoppers turned to online services during the pandemic. The number of parcels being delivered started increasing sharply from the end of October. By last week, it had already surpassed last year's post-Black Friday peak, according to new data. Metapack, which acts as a go-between for retailers and couriers, said parcel volumes were already up by 70% this week, compared with the same week last year. In a normal year, retailers would expect the week in which Black Friday falls to be the most profitable of the year. But sales were already up by between 50 and 60% in each of the first three weeks of November, according to IMRG, which collects data from online retailing companies. Hundreds of people in England have beenwrongly told they have coronavirus by NHS Test and Traceafter a ""laboratory error"". More than 1,300 people who gave samples between 19 and 23 November received positive results, when the tests were actually void. All of those affected will be told to take another test, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said. Duncan Larcombe, said his two children, aged 14 and nine, were both sent home from school to self-isolate and he was unable to work. His 14-year-old daughter who tested positive ""had not left her bedroom"" for four days, with meals being left outside her door, until learning the result was void on Thursday. ""We were taking it very seriously,"" he said. DHSC said it was an ""isolated incident"" caused by an ""issue with a batch of testing chemicals"" which had affected tests taken across the UK. Shaimaa KhalilAustralia correspondent Matt Lanigan says the lockdown was ""pretty grim"" Melbourne's second lockdown, which began in July, went on to become one of the longest and strictest in the world until it ended last month. ""The streets were completely deserted. It was like something out of [post-apocalyptic film] Mad Max,"" says Matt Lanigan, who owns a cafe on Chapel St, the city's iconic shopping strip. ""It was brutal,"" Matt says of trying keep his business afloat. ""It was like I was in a boxing match and I just got knocked to the floor. For a moment there, I felt like maybe it wasn't worth getting up."" But things are slowly turning around. Earlier today, Melbourne and the state of Victoria reported the 28th consecutive day with no new infections. After seeing daily cases soar above 700 in July and August,the city is seen as an example for the rest of the world on how to handle a second outbreak. Melbourne's Chapel St is buzzing again Now on reopened Chapel St, music and chatter fill the air as people enjoy their Sunday brunches. But despite the high spirits, everywhere you look there are signs of how battered this city has been. Many businesses are still shut, and others are open but half empty. Matt says the real economic and mental health toll will become clearer in the months to come, especially when government wage subsidy schemes end. Er Shun, above, and Da Mao spent time at Toronto Zoo before being sent to Calgary A Canadian zoo is sending two pandas back to their previous home in China due to a bamboo shortage caused by the pandemic. The Calgary Zoo had hoped to return Er Shun and Da Mao earlier, as bamboo
 supplies dwindled, but there were significant delays in obtaining the 
permits to ship them home. ""Today is the day!"" the zoo posted on Facebook on Friday. The zoo had raised concerns in May that the pandemic was impacting supplies. Giant pandas eat about 40kg of fresh bamboo a day. Er Shun and Da Mao arrived in Canada in 2014, as part of a 10-year loan from China. They spent the first five years at a Toronto Zoo, where they gave birth birth to two cubs,Jia Panpan and Jia Yueyue. The adult pandas were meant to spend the next five years in Calgary. More vaccines need to be developed in the fight against coronavirus, the World Health Organization's chief scientist has said. Dr Soumya Swaminathan said some vaccines might benefit certain group such as pregnant women or older people more than others, while alternative jabs might give better immunity or be more affordable. She said potential vaccines at relatively early stages of development must continue to be trialled so that there is then ""a choice, a basket of vaccines that we can choose from and be able to target them to different situations in countries with different populations"". This video can not be played Tiffany Pearson-Gills took over the Junction pub in September The landlords of two pubs in an English village that sits on a county border say it makes no sense thatonly one of them can open under coronavirus measures coming into force next week. Groombridge has two pubs, but the Crown Inn is in Kent's tier three and the Junction is in East Sussex's tier two. In tier three, pubs must close apart from offering takeaway or delivery services, but in tier two, they can open as long as they serve substantial meals. Under next week's rules, residents on either side of Groombridge, home to about 1,600 people, should not cross over the county border at a bridge over the River Grom - meaning Kent villagers cannot enjoy the reopening of the East Sussex pub. Steve Harmes, at the Crown, says not being able to open is ""very frustrating"". ""We were not in such a bad position before, but now, being put in this position, it's really hard for us to move forward."" He said even if the tiers were reviewed in December, the pub would not be able to prepare and take advantage of the busy Christmas period. A seven-minute walk away - or 0.4 miles - at the Junction pub, landlady Tiffany Pearson-Gills calls the new rules ""perplexing"". The Crown Inn is in Kent, so will go into tier three next week ""For such a small village... it just doesn't make any sense at all,"" she said. She took over the Junction in September and spent several weeks renovating it but had to put off an opening on 5 November. She said the pub had been fortunate, adding: ""It's great for us, but it doesn't make sense that the Crown up the road cannot [open]. It's just so close, it's a really, really difficult one."" Cardiff city centre has been gearing up for Christmas In Wales, while rules are in place, people can still go to the pub, meet others at a social distance and head out to buy presents. But from 2 December, across the border in England, about 55 million people will be living under strict rules. So what do England's tiers mean for those living and working in Wales? Next Wednesday as the lockdown ends in England, areas will be placed under tiers, from one to three, depending on how high their case rate is. But while the rules do not apply in Wales, the changes over the border could affect your family, work or business over the coming days. We've taken a look at what the changes could mean for you.Read more here.  A further 521 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, the UK government has announced. By this measure, that brings the total number of Covid deaths in the country to 57,551. Meanwhile,the government also reported,externala further 16,022 new cases of the virus in the past 24 hours. More than 1.5 million cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the UK since the epidemic began. Teachers have warned ofa ""collapse"" in secondary school attendanceafter the second wave of the pandemic spread across the UK during autumn. Relatively few pupils have tested positive, but hundreds of thousands have had to learn from home after being required to self-isolate. We have been taking a look at what impact that is having on schools, parents and pupils themselves, as many prepare for exams. Merseyside, for example, has been one of the areas worst-hit in the UK's second wave of the pandemic. And at The Prescot School in Knowsley that has meant a collective 700 days in the classroom lost for the year 11 students preparing for exams in the summer. One student, Ben, told the BBC: ""Year 11 is such a crucial year, you've got exams and mock exams and that's the main thing that's going to set you for life. ""As someone who's self-isolated already, I think it's really stressful to even think about the exams that we've got to do in a few months' time when we've missed out a large chunk of school.""  Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Slopes in ski resorts in Switzerland are already open Across the Alps, countries are agonising over how to control the spread of coronavirus while allowing the winter sports season to begin. Germany has suggestedkeeping all ski resorts closed over the festive season,while Italy would like to wait to open them until mid-January. In Switzerland however, the slopes are already open â despite the country having one of the highest infection rates in Europe. The idea of closing the ski slopes has caused indignation in Switzerland - perhaps especially since closures are being proposed by its bigger European neighbours. The idea is almost as bad, harrumphed one editorial, as joining the EU itself. Switzerlandâs ski resorts seem convinced of their safety measures: masks on all lifts, strict distancing while waiting, and no apres-ski bars. The Swiss government knows the strategy is risky. With everywhere else closed, skiers from across Europe might come to Switzerland, catch the virus, and then take it home â a nightmarish, Europe-wide superspreader event. But there is method in what seems like madness. If the Christmas and New Year ski weeks go safely, Switzerland stands to make a tidy profit while its neighbours are left empty-handed. Now for some news onthe global race to develop and distribute a coronavirus vaccine, to help bring an end to the pandemic. Canada's federal government has said that as many as three million people in the country could be vaccinated by early 2021 - but how this will happen remains unclear. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was criticised this week after he said Canada's pharmaceutical industry is not equipped to produce Covid vaccines domestically. It means Canada will likely have to import the vaccine from the US, and will therefore be second in line. The government has tried to reassure Canadians, noting that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine could be approved by December and that three million people - less than 10% of the population - could be vaccinated by early next year. However, supplies will be limited to begin with, and early vaccines will be distributed to high-priority groups only. Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News According to the governmentâs scientific advisory group, Sage, England's former three-tiered system was not controlling the spread of the virus. That was largely because cases were rising in tier one areas, so it would only be a matter of time before those areas would have to move up a tier. Itâs now expected to work the other way round â with theareas with the tighter restrictions expected to move down a tieras infections decrease. Ministers have promised a review of their tier allocations every two weeks - with the first one expected on 16 December. But some Sage experts have said today that they believe mid-December is too soon to make any significant changes. The next assessment will be after the UK-widerelaxation of measures for the Christmas period, which is likely to see a rise in cases. Depending on how much of a surge there is, itâs likely to be mid-January at the very earliest before significant numbers of regions could be moved to lower tiers - with some possibly even going up one. An eight-year-old boy who wrote to Boris Johnson asking if Santa would be able to visit as usual said he was""shocked"" that the ""busiest man in the country""had replied. Monti, from Cockermouth, Cumbria, asked if the government had ""thought about Santa coming this Christmas"" - and received a reply saying Father Christmas was ""ready and raring to go"". ""In June I heard the pandemic might go on for a long time and it could reach up to Christmas,"" he said. ""I got a bit worried so I wondered if I should write to the prime minister, so I did. ""I asked him if everyone has to put hand sanitiser by the cookies and if he can actually come and keep the Christmas spirit alive. ""If the Christmas spirit isn't kept alive then no one will be happy.""  We've been busy answering questions you have about the restrictions in place - including the end of England's lockdown, and the new tougher tiers. Kevin from Norwichwanted to know whether businesses can reopen on 2 December - or if they have to wait til the following day. The government has confirmed that the new tiers system will âcome into effect from the beginning of Wednesday 2 Decemberâ, marking the end of the lockdown. In all tiers, all non-essential retail, including indoor and outdoor markets and car boot sales, can reopen from Wednesday, but must continue to follow Covid-19 secure guidelines.

"The government has announced the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England, and Scotland has taken similar steps. Here are some of your questions on the changes: Because your son is in a clinical risk group - and as long as he is over five - he shouldsoon be offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. You should be contacted by your GP or specialist team to arrange this. With regard to the dangers of mixing, the UK has also recommended that Covid vaccines are offered to all children aged 5 to 11, not just those at high clinical risk. This is likely to start in England in April. Children are generally at much lower risk of becoming seriously ill from a Covid infection, although some do still get sick and need hospital care. Over-12s can already be vaccinated, and it's hoped that extending the rollout to younger age groups will help protect even more children from the risk of catching and spreading Covid. Schools are expected to work with and support families who have concerns about a pupil returning to the classroom. It is compulsory for school-age children to attend, even if they were previously shielding - the only exception is a small number of children whose clinician or GP has advised them not to attend. If you have concerns about this, you should talk to your doctor. If you live in England and are not in a vulnerable group yourself, it is unlikely that you will be entitled to a free test after 1 April. From that point, lateral flow tests should be available to buy from pharmacies and other retailers. The government says it will continue to provide free tests to the oldest age groups and those most vulnerable to Covid. We don't have the details of how this will work yet, but your mother and her care workers should still be eligible for free tests. Care homes are responsible for their own visiting policies, but at the moment across the UK, all visitors are expected to test for Covid before arrival. The chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance has warned that further variants of Covid are expected - and that they could be more severe than previous ones. Therefore, although most of the free testing system is being dismantled in England, the government insists that the UK will continue to do detailed checks and surveillance to look for resurgences of Covid and any concerning new variants which may emerge. For example, some people in the community will still be asked to do regular tests for Covid as part of theOffice for National Statisticsâ Infection Survey. Positive test results collected this way can be analysed to identify the type of Covid people have. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have learned a great deal about how to track the virus, and the government says it will be possible to scale up such operations again in the future if necessary. Trials are already underway to test updated vaccines that could be a better match for the virus as it continues to change. The UK government also says it will also help support other countries in developing their own surveillance capabilities, because a new variant can emerge anywhere. NHS England says patients and staff should continue to wear face masks in GP practiceseven though they are no longer mandatory in public places. Face coverings also remain compulsory in healthcare settings in Scotland and Wales, and it is ""strongly advised"" that people wear them in Northern Ireland. Your doctor will be able to advise about what tests you will need before you have an operation. You may need to have a Covid test, and the government has said free testing will still be available in certain settings, such as hospitals. Infection control measures will continue to help keep people safe and limit the spread of the virus. SYMPTOMS:How do I know I've got Covid?

"This video can not be played Detained and forced to have a 'virginity test' Women are being offered controversial ""virginity tests"" at British medical clinics, an investigation by BBC Newsbeat and100 Womenhas found. The intrusive tests are considered a violation of human rights by the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations, which want to see them banned. Critics say they are unscientific, cannot prove whether someone is a virgin and can be a form of abuse. The tests involve a vaginal examination to check if the hymen is intact. The BBC investigation found a number of private clinics advertising ""virginity repair"" which, when contacted, then also offered the so-called virginity test for between Â£150 and Â£300. Last year, US rapper T.I. sparked outrage after revealing he takes his daughter for a test every year to check her hymen is still intact The BBC identified 21 clinics and managed to make inquiries with 16 of them, seven confirmed they offer ""virginity testing"" and several others would not clarify their position. All said they would carry out hymen-repair surgery, which costs in the region of Â£1,500 to Â£3,000. Data from NHS England shows 69 hymen-repair procedures have been carried out in the past five years. Newsbeat has heard the story of one woman helped by the charity Karma Nirvana, which supports victims of so-called honour-based abuse and forced marriage. ""I had a very emotionally abusive relationship with my parents who wanted me to have an arranged marriage,"" she says.

"This video can not be played Detained and forced to have a 'virginity test' Women are being offered controversial ""virginity tests"" at British medical clinics, an investigation by BBC Newsbeat and100 Womenhas found. The intrusive tests are considered a violation of human rights by the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations, which want to see them banned. Critics say they are unscientific, cannot prove whether someone is a virgin and can be a form of abuse. The tests involve a vaginal examination to check if the hymen is intact. The BBC investigation found a number of private clinics advertising ""virginity repair"" which, when contacted, then also offered the so-called virginity test for between Â£150 and Â£300. Last year, US rapper T.I. sparked outrage after revealing he takes his daughter for a test every year to check her hymen is still intact The BBC identified 21 clinics and managed to make inquiries with 16 of them, seven confirmed they offer ""virginity testing"" and several others would not clarify their position. All said they would carry out hymen-repair surgery, which costs in the region of Â£1,500 to Â£3,000. Data from NHS England shows 69 hymen-repair procedures have been carried out in the past five years. Newsbeat has heard the story of one woman helped by the charity Karma Nirvana, which supports victims of so-called honour-based abuse and forced marriage. ""I had a very emotionally abusive relationship with my parents who wanted me to have an arranged marriage,"" she says. ""One day, an elder in the community saw me out with my friends and said to my mum that one of the boys was my boyfriend. There were lots of rumours in the community about it."" She was then threatened with a ""virginity test"" by her parents.

"This video can not be played The Covid uncertainty is ""awful"", pub owner Sian Shepphard says Pubs, restaurants and bars will be subject to stricter Covid-19 restrictions in the run up to Christmas, the first minister has said. The new restrictions, which have not yet been finalised, will come into force from Friday, 4 December. They may be based on the system in some parts of Scotland where no alcohol can be served. Cinemas, bowling alleys and indoor entertainment venues will also have to shut before the festive break. A date for these to close has not yet been agreed. Mark Drakeford said action was needed as case rates continued to rise in the run up to Christmas. But the Welsh Conservatives said any new restrictions would be a ""real blow"" for businesses who had already ""suffered greatly"", while Plaid Cymru said the lack of detail was leaving employers unable to prepare. Pubs, bars and restaurants had only reopened on 9 November after the Wales-wide 17-day lockdown, and are currently made to close at 22:00 GMT. Ahead of the announcement people working in the hospitality industry had warned any further restrictionsbefore Christmas would be a ""big blow"". Plans for the new rules have not yet been finalised, but BBC Wales understands one option being considered is the ""level three"" Scottish system, where venues are banned from selling alcohol and have to close at 18:00. The R rate - the number of people each infected person passed the virus on to - has risen again to 1.4 in Wales, with the rate needing to be below one for the number of cases to fall. This video can not be played ""We need to reduce Covid spread before Christmas"" In England about55 million people are being placed under the tightest level of lockdown rules from 2 December, when an England-wide lockdown ends and a new tiered system is introduced. Speaking at the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said Wales had to use the ""coming weeks"" to reduce the spread of the virus, to ""create more headroom for the Christmas period"". Mr Drakeford said while case rates had fallen following the 17-day firebreak, as people had resumed socialising it they had risen ""faster and further than we anticipated"", and action was needed. A further major package of financial support for businesses affected will be announced on Monday ""This does not mean a return to the firebreak arrangements, but the cabinet has agreed to take further specific and targeted action to reinforce the current national measures we have place,"" he said. Mr Drakeford said he could ""not rule anything out for the future"" in a bid to curb the spread of the virus. Non-essential retail, hairdressers, gyms and leisure centres will stay open, it was confirmed. Speaking of the new measures for pubs, bars and restaurants, Mr Drakeford added: ""I know this will be a worrying time for all working in the industry. ""We will be working over the weekend with partners to finalise the details of the new arrangements and to put in place a further major package of financial support to respond to those changes. ""I will give further details about the package on Monday."" Claire Vaughan, programme manager at Chapter cinema in Cardiff, said: ""Globally no cases of coronavirus have been traced back to a visit to the cinema. ""Cinemas are a low-risk way of spending time outside the house at a time when the mental health of people in Wales is a huge concern. People will watch Mared Williams outside the venue ""Masks are worn, there are air circulation units and no one is facing another person... Not everyone is living in a warm, safe home - many people need these spaces to be open."" Liam Evans-Ford, Theatr Clwyd's executive director, added the announcement had been a ""huge surprise"". ""This is devastating for our business, for our employees, for our freelancers and for our communities,"" he said. Sian Shepphard, owner of the Horse and Jockey in Pontypool, opened the pub in August so has not been eligible for government support. Sian Shepphard is worried about her staff ""The main problem is we are trying to get people to stay at home but it is ruining our businesses,"" she said. ""I employ over 25 staff here - we are a really family-run business. We are all family - how am I supposed to put food on the table for them?"" Phil James, a customer at the pub, said the potential changes would affect his Christmas plans. ""We just don't know what arrangement to make at the end of the day - people have to know. You come out to socialise - people want to be social for Christmas, alcohol is a part of it."" Phil James says pubs play a big part in his festive celebrations Simon Buckley, chairman of The Brewers of Wales, said: ""Is this finally the straw that will break the industry's back? ""We as an industry are being thrown to the wind, and the looming prospect of significant job losses seems to count for nothing."" Plaid's economy spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones said: ""They [pubs and restaurants] don't know if they're being asked to close altogether again, to only do takeaways, to have restricted opening without alcohol. ""So, they can't really prepare. They need to be given the maximum length of time to prepare."" Clwyd West member of the Senedd Darren Millar called for a targeted rather than a Wales-wide blanket approach. ""It is grossly unfair to impose the same level of restrictions in Conwy and Denbighshire as Covid-19 hotspots in south Wales,"" he said. ""The virus is circulating at different rates in different parts of the country."" Mr Drakeford insisted there were no plans to introduce regionalised ""tiered"" restrictions, similar to those coming into force in England. He said there was no case for aligning the Welsh and English systems to ensure no-one was left out of UK-wide Treasury schemes that offer financial assistance to businesses affected by lockdown measures. ""We don't lose out on any UK system by having a single tier for Wales, so there is no disadvantage to us in that,"" he said. He added: ""The advice we have is that a single set of arrangements for Wales works best, is easiest to communicate and delivers benefits in all parts of Wales."" Pembrokeshire councillor John Davies welcomed the restrictions after a spike in cases in his ward, Cilgerran, linked to the recent outbreak in nearby Cardigan. He told Newyddion 9: ""If people aren't willing to exercise common sense and be citizens of responsibility towards each other, there is no other option. ""We've seen what happens in this part of the world when people act in a selfish manner."" Children are currently in ""class bubbles"" during school Mr Drakeford said he had no plans to allow schools to close early for Christmas. Teaching union UCAC hadcalled for classrooms to be shuton 11 December and for lessons to be moved online amid fears teachers and pupils may have to isolate on Christmas Day. But Mr Drakeford said ministers would do ""everything we can"" to keep schools working up until the Christmas holiday. He added: ""It is more important for our children not to miss out further on the education that is planned for them for the whole of the rest of this term and that's what we will be working to achieve.""

"Some big High Street names have decided to shun the Black Friday shopping bonanza even though online spending in the UK is set to soar. Next, M&S, Wilko and B&M will not be taking part in the sales event on Friday, which is seen as a key trading day in the run-up to Christmas. Several retailers told the BBC they were focussed on offering good value all-year round instead. Many shoppers use the annual event to buy discounted Christmas gifts. More than two-thirds of shoppers have delayed a purchase to try to find a bargain in the sale, according to research by Lloyds Bank. It expects Black Friday spending in the UK to jump to Â£750m this year. Last year, it totalled Â£718m, although drawing annual comparisons is difficult as the event covers more days and more shops take part. But retailer Next has confirmed it will not participate.The decision comes after it reportedthat in-store sales have been badly affected by the pandemic and are about half of what they were by this time in 2019. Despite the fact Next was a late adopter of Black Friday, previous sales saw bargain hunters queue up early in the morning for heavily discounted clothes, homeware and furniture. Most Black Friday products 'were same price or cheaper' beforehand Why bots will beat you to in-demand gifts Black Friday emissions boom predicted High Street stalwart Marks & Spencer has also decided not to take part. A spokesperson told the BBC that it had not offered any ""specific Black Friday deals"" for the last few years, and that there were no plans to change that. ""We focus on offering great value and deals throughout the whole festive season,"" M&S said. The festive period will be crucial for the firm off the back of a difficult year, during which it reported thefirst loss in its history as a publicly traded companyand was forced to announce 7,000 job cuts across stores and management. Although sales of clothes and homeware slid during the six months to 26 September, its boss Steve Rowe has said that M&S was in a ""much better position"" in the run-up to Christmas. The Wilko homeware chain also said there would be ""no specific Black Friday activity"", and that it offered ""great value products at great prices every day"". Discount chain B&M said that selling products at a lower price point throughout the festive trading period instead ""avoids excessive crowds on any one day"". They added that Black Friday shoppers are often ""chasing largely deceptive offers that do not represent real savings, or are only available in very limited stocks"". Consumer group Which? urged consumers to ""do some research"" to find genuine bargains Consumer group Which? recently found thatnearly nine in 10 products sold on Black Friday are available for the same price or cheaper earlier in the year. It urged consumers to ""do some research"", which may include using websites to check previous prices, in order to spot genuine bargains during the sales. The shopping bonanza, imported from the US, now sees shops advertising price cuts several days before the Friday after the Thanksgiving holiday. Brands such as Jigsaw had previously pledged not to take part, opting for end-of-season sales instead. But in 2018, it launched its first Black Friday sale, saying that the ""economic, political and retail landscapes have changed dramatically."" Up-market fashion chain Jigsaw previously shunned Black Friday but now takes part But retail expert Kate Hardcastle told the BBC it ""makes good sense"" for retailers to shift away from the extended event. ""[Black Friday] creates a challenging retail calendar for a lot of shops"", with many customers now expecting discounts throughout the year as a matter of course. Although some sales might be lost, she said: ""Brands need to remember it's not just a race to the bottom on price and use it as an opportunity to shift attention elsewhere."" Companies such as clothing brand Baukjen, for example, is giving the profits made during the ""Black Friday weekend"" to charity, while footwear firm Allbirds will raise prices by Â£1 across all of its products and donate those proceeds. Although many firms have been struggling with job losses, subdued sales and lockdowns in the face of the pandemic, Ms Hardcastle suggests this is a ""key moment"" for brands to make sure they are not just associated with discounts.

"The government has asked the regulator to assess the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, bringing the UK a step closer to a possible rollout. The referral to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) marked ""a significant first step"" in getting the vaccine ""approved for deployment"", the government said. It follows news that the jab was""highly effective"" in advanced trials. The UK government has pre-ordered 100m doses of the Oxford vaccine. The government's latest request to the MHRA comes a week after the regulator was asked to assess the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: âOur plan is working and I am more sure than ever that we will prevail togetherâ Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government was working ""tirelessly"" to be in the ""best possible position to deploy a vaccine"" as soon as one was approved by the MHRA. ""We have formally asked the regulator to assess the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, to understand the data and determine whether it meets rigorous safety standards,"" he added. The Department of Health and Social Care said the UK would be one of the first countries in the world to receive the vaccine, if it was authorised, with AstraZeneca set to have as many as 4 million doses ready for the UK by the end of the year and 40 million by the end of March 2021. The government has also ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine - which preliminary results showed stopped more than 90% of people developing Covid-19 symptoms. If approved,a vaccine could be rolled out from December, Mr Hancock has said. On Thursday, AstraZeneca said it was amending its study in the US following the accidental discovery that the vaccine appeared to perform best when a half dose was given followed by a full one, rather than two full doses. Oxford's Covid vaccine 'dose error' explained Covid vaccines: Who decides if they are safe? Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so quickly? It came after multiple news outlets in the UK and US reported that there were questions over the data on how effective the Oxford jab was. Interim data from the trial showed three efficacy levels - an overall efficacy of 70%, a lower one of 62% and a high of 90%. The company added that it was looking to get further confidence in the 90% efficacy found among volunteers who received the lower initial dose. It said it already had enough data from the trials to submit the vaccine for regulatory approval and would be doing this soon. Regulator the MHRA assesses vaccine trial data for safety, quality of manufacture, and how effective it is in protecting people It then advises the UK government whether a vaccine is ready to be used It is part of the Department of Health, and employs more than 1,200 people Independent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it first It has drawn up interim advice on priority groups for the Covid vaccine. It also considers how many doses to use The JCVI has about 20 members - all are experts on vaccines Read more onvaccine safety here. Prof David Salisbury, former director of immunisation at the Department of Health, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that if the Oxford jab had 60% efficacy, while others had higher efficacy, then ""tough choices"" would have to be made. ""I think you have to think very carefully what we do with one hundred million doses of a product that isn't protecting as well as the alternative,"" he said. Prof Salisbury suggested higher efficacy vaccines could be given to more vulnerable people while lower efficacy jabs could be given to under 55s. MASS TESTING:Where is it available? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? The DHSC said the MHRA had already started a ""rolling review"" of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and that once the regulator received the full safety, efficacy and quality data from the company, its scientists and clinicians ""stand ready to progress its assessment of the vaccine"". Prof Helen Fletcher, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: ""It's not surprising if some manufacturing issues were still being ironed out when they started clinical trials but early stage trials are all about safety and the safety data we have seen has been very robust."" She added that it was important to wait for the full dataset to be published.

"The R number for coronavirus has fallen to between 0.9 and 1 for the first time since mid-August, which means the epidemic is thought to be no longer growing. 'R' is calculated by the government's scientific advisers,external, and represents how many extra people each infected person passes the virus onto. The aim is to keep R below 1 until a vaccine is rolled out. During the first peak in the spring, R was thought to be around 3. The latest estimate of the growth rate of the virus has also fallen, to between -2% and 0%, which indicates that the number of new infections each day is coming down. On Friday in the UK, 521 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test,external. There were also 16,022 new cases reported - a 25% fall on the previous week. However cases in some regions of England are still high, particularly the North West, the North East and Yorkshire and the Humber. When lockdown ends on 2 December,most of England will move into the two toughest tiers of restrictions. What is the UK's R number and why does it matter? How many cases are there in your area? When does lockdown actually end? And other questions An R or reproduction number of 1 means that, on average, every person with the virus will infect one other person. So an R number between 0.9 and 1.0 means that on average every 10 people infected will infect between 9 and 10 other people, indicating it is shrinking. With the four nations of the UK following different policies on restrictions, the government says the estimate for R for the whole of the UK has become ""less meaningful in recent weeks"". It says the impact of the second lockdown in England, which began on 5 November, cannot be fully evaluated yet, and adds that R ""may be below 1 for all regions already"" in England. R is estimated using a range of data, including testing numbers, hospital admissions, intensive care deaths andestimates of how many people are infected in households across the country. Scientists from different universities then use this data to estimate the spread of infections. There is always a slight time lag in the R number of a matter of weeks - the latest estimate is based on data up to 24 November. The UK government has said in the past that the R number was one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. From Wednesday in England, more than 32 million people are due to be living under tier two restrictions, banning indoor meetings between households. A further 23 million people will be placed under the highest - tier three - restrictions, which further limit contact between people outdoors. Boris Johnson has defended the approach, arguing the country needs ""simplicity and clarity"" and the restrictions would ""drive"" Covid down until a vaccine is available. R was last below 1 on the 14 August Prof Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology, from the University of Edinburgh, said the R numbers across the UK ""may decrease further as the full impact of lockdown becomes apparent"". ""It is worth noting that the falls in R began in the second half of September which may indicate that measures taken during that month did have some impact in some regions of the UK,"" he said. However he added that the data raised the question ""of whether the earlier implementation of measures short of full lockdown would have been sufficient to keep the epidemic in check and prevent local NHS Trusts from being overwhelmed.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson addresses criticism of ""tough"" tiers plan Boris Johnson has defended his decision to place 55 million people in England into the two highest tiers of Covid restrictions, arguing the country needs ""simplicity and clarity"". The PM said measures due to come in when lockdown ends on Wednesday were more ""relaxed"" but would ""drive"" Covid down until a vaccine is available. But a group of Tory MPs is threatening to rebel in a Commons vote on Tuesday. If Labour backs them, this could threaten the government's majority. There is concern that the government is adopting a ""one-size-fits all"" approach, which does not reflect local levels of infection. Almost all of England facing tough virus rules Postcode check - what is my tier? Tiers and Christmas - a recipe for disaster? From Wednesday, more than 32 million people are due to be living under tier two restrictions, banning indoor meetings between households. A further 23 million people would be placed under the highest - tier three - restrictions, which further limit contact between people outdoors. Just over 1% of England's population would enter the lowest - tier one - restrictions, under which the ""rule of six"" applies both indoors and outdoors. Conservative MP and former cabinet minister Damian Green, who represents Ashford, in Kent, which is set to go into tier three, told the BBC he would vote against the government unless it provided ""new and convincing evidence"". ""Instead of having these wide county-based areas, where people are put in tiers, then we should do it on a borough basis,"" he said. ""In an area like mine, the incidence is less than it is in Liverpool, which has just been released down into tier two. So, as it stands, the current policy, the current allocation of tiers on these wide bases, are just not evidence-based."" This video can not be played How you and your family can celebrate Christmas and minimise the spread of coronavirus Speaking on a visit to Public Health England laboratories, at Porton Down, Wiltshire, Mr Johnson said he understood the ""frustration"" of those in higher-tier areas, whose own town or village did not have high levels of the disease. But he added that the government ""cannot divide the country up into loads and loads of very complicated sub-divisions"" and had to ensure ""some simplicity and clarity"". ""Unless you beat the problem in the high-incidence area, the low-incidence area, I'm afraid, starts to catch up,"" Mr Johnson said. He said ""tough tiering"" was still more ""relaxed by a long way than the current lockdown measures"" and it would ""drive the disease down... until a vaccine comes on stream, which we hope will be over the next weeks and months"". Asked about mass Covid testing, Mr Johnson said: ""The supply [of kits] I don't think is going to be the problem. The issue is going to be getting everybody mobilised to understand the potential advantage of [it]."" Aware of the disquiet on its own backbenches, the government has promised to publish impact assessments of the new restrictions; a key demand from concerned MPs. There's also a suggestion that areas could move into lower tiers when numbers are reviewed at regular intervals. But that's unlikely to see off the brewing Tory rebellion. Some Conservatives have already publicly declared that they won't vote for the new tier system when it's put before the Commons next week. If enough rebel the government might have to look to the opposition to get this through Parliament. Sir Keir Starmer is still deciding whether his party will back the plan, although it is likely to have enough support overall. However, it's not a good look for the government to have to rely on Labour in the face of unrest on its own benches. The Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs, set up to scrutinise the government's response to the pandemic, is threatening a revolt in next Tuesday's vote. The group's chair, Mark Harper, said evidence provided by the government to justify the tier system was not ""compelling"". He called for more information on the measures' effects on different sectors of the economy. He added that on ""too many occasions, ministers have made arguments and they've not stacked up"". Deputy chairman Steve Baker called the measures ""truly appalling"" and said the modelling used by government scientists had been ""wrong time and time again"". The group claims to have 70 members, but it is not certain how many of them would be expected to rebel against the government. This video can not be played The BBC's Laura Foster explains the new three tier system for England. Forty-three Conservatives would have to defy the prime minister to defeat the plan, if all opposition MPs also voted against. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is expected to decide early next week whether to support Mr Johnson, after consulting government coronavirus experts. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Labour was ""not against"" tougher restrictions or tiers, but would seek ""reassurances"" on support for the poor and vulnerable. MASS TESTING:Where is it available? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Under the government's plan, Kent and large parts of the Midlands, north-east and north-west England would go into tier three. Only Cornwall, the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight would be in tier one. Mr Johnson said the government's planned ""review point"" - on 16 December - gave the ""prospect of areas being able to move down the tier scale"". But Professor John Edmunds, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said he could not imagine ""huge changes"" to restrictions by then. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that experts were unlikely to ""have accumulated much data"" in time. The government has promised to publish an impact assessment before MPs vote on the new rules.

"This video can not be played The report from the Royal Foundation shows parents under emotional pressure in the pandemic Loneliness among parents of young children has ""dramatically increased"" during the pandemic, suggests research from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's Royal Foundation. The charity gathered views from half a million people in the UK on bringing up children under the age of five. It found parents increasingly worried about feeling cut off from support, particularly in more deprived areas. The duchess said it had been a ""hugely challenging"" year for families. ""It's very tough,"" says Emily Wingrove, mother of three-year-old Franklin and Denis who had his first birthday this month, in celebrations muted by the lockdown. Emily says the pandemic has been very tough on those without a garden She lives with her two young children in a small flat in south London and has been cut off from her own family and in-laws. ""It's draining. It takes its toll. There's definitely a burn out, like hitting a brick wall. When is it going to end?"" Emily misses the ""reassurance"" of being able to talk to other mothers and worries about the lack of access to children's centres and baby clinics. Kate launches childhood survey to help under-fives How young people are beating loneliness Loneliness: The man who talked to chairs The pressure on parents is relentless, she says, with ""no night off to recharge the batteries"". Families without a garden have had a much tougher time than has been recognised, she says. ""It's so difficult to keep them entertained. Every second is a battle,"" she says. The report from the Royal Foundation shows parents under emotional pressure in the pandemic - drawing on 528,000 responses to theFive Big Questions survey launched by the duchess, plus further research with 3,700 people across the UK. It is claimed to be one of the biggest ever responses to such a survey into childhood - and the duchess says problems in adult life, such as ""homelessness, addiction, and poor mental health are often grounded in a difficult childhood"". Parents need to protect their own well-being, says the study Addressing an online forum on Friday, the duchess said support for children in early years should have equal status to ""the other great social challenges"". ""The early years are not simply about how we raise our children. They are in fact about how we raise the next generation of adults. They are about the society we will become,"" said the duchess. A greater investment in children's first years ""isn't for the quick win - it is for the big win,"" the duchess told her online audience. The research shows separation from family, friends and support networks during the lockdown taking a heavy psychological toll on parents of young children - with 63% reporting feelings of loneliness, compared with 38% before the pandemic. But the Duchess of Cambridge warns her research also shows ""just one in four recognise the specific importance of the first five years of a child's life"". ""I can't describe the loneliness. Everything is on you,"" says Rebecca Goatley, a lone parent, living in Wallingford, Oxfordshire, with her three year old son. Rebecca had to cope with having coronavirus while looking after her son Making it even more of a ""complete nightmare"", she had coronavirus during the lockdown. ""I've never been so unwell in my life. I thought I was getting a bit of a sore throat and then when I was cooking dinner I couldn't smell anything,"" she says. It meant looking after her son in their flat while suffering from Covid, with her mother helping by dropping round food. ""I've never felt tiredness like it,"" says Rebecca, who usually enjoys playing rugby rather than being ""stuck in a flat with no one to talk to"". Kate and William have also supported the cause of parenting skills for men The whole experience of the pandemic has been one of exhaustion for parents with young children, says Rebecca. ""Mentally and emotionally it's been really hard,"" she says, with parents isolated from their friends and family while children have also been desperate to play with their own friends. ""It's been so strange - and made me feel disconnected from everything,"" she says. ""There's not been enough focus on kids in the lockdown and how it has affected them. It was like cabin fever,"" says Rebecca. The research launched by the Duchess of Cambridge says parents have neglected their own well-being, with only 10% taking time to think about their own mental health. It also found 70% of parents ""felt judged"" about how they were bringing up their children, or how their children were behaving, and that could ""make a bad situation worse"". Neil Leitch of the Early Years Alliance says ""the first five years of a child's life are absolutely critical for a child's long-term life chances"". But during the pandemic, he says, the focus was too often on getting children back to school, rather than the support and childcare needed for families with young children. ""Parents put pressure on themselves,"" says Zunaira, who misses the friendships and social activities that would usually be a lifeline for this mother of two young children. It is easy for parents to be guilt-tripped into thinking they should be coming up with amazing activities every day. Zunaira says parents can put pressure on themselves and feel even worse ""It's lonely. You lose your own self, you forget about yourself - and all the focus is on another person. ""Your identity goes and I felt like I was suffocating,"" said Zunaira, from Peterborough. The long, exhausting pandemic is taking its toll on young families, she says, cutting them off from the simplest pleasures. ""You just want to sit in a cafe, have a bit of cake and a talk,"" she says. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"This video can not be played The Covid uncertainty is ""awful"", pub owner Sian Shepphard says Pubs, restaurants and bars will be subject to stricter Covid-19 restrictions in the run up to Christmas, the first minister has said. The new restrictions, which have not yet been finalised, will come into force from Friday, 4 December. They may be based on the system in some parts of Scotland where no alcohol can be served. Cinemas, bowling alleys and indoor entertainment venues will also have to shut before the festive break. A date for these to close has not yet been agreed. Mark Drakeford said action was needed as case rates continued to rise in the run up to Christmas. But the Welsh Conservatives said any new restrictions would be a ""real blow"" for businesses who had already ""suffered greatly"", while Plaid Cymru said the lack of detail was leaving employers unable to prepare. Pubs, bars and restaurants had only reopened on 9 November after the Wales-wide 17-day lockdown, and are currently made to close at 22:00 GMT. Ahead of the announcement people working in the hospitality industry had warned any further restrictionsbefore Christmas would be a ""big blow"". Plans for the new rules have not yet been finalised, but BBC Wales understands one option being considered is the ""level three"" Scottish system, where venues are banned from selling alcohol and have to close at 18:00. The R rate - the number of people each infected person passed the virus on to - has risen again to 1.4 in Wales, with the rate needing to be below one for the number of cases to fall. This video can not be played ""We need to reduce Covid spread before Christmas"" In England about55 million people are being placed under the tightest level of lockdown rules from 2 December, when an England-wide lockdown ends and a new tiered system is introduced. Speaking at the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said Wales had to use the ""coming weeks"" to reduce the spread of the virus, to ""create more headroom for the Christmas period"". Mr Drakeford said while case rates had fallen following the 17-day firebreak, as people had resumed socialising it they had risen ""faster and further than we anticipated"", and action was needed. A further major package of financial support for businesses affected will be announced on Monday ""This does not mean a return to the firebreak arrangements, but the cabinet has agreed to take further specific and targeted action to reinforce the current national measures we have place,"" he said. Mr Drakeford said he could ""not rule anything out for the future"" in a bid to curb the spread of the virus. Non-essential retail, hairdressers, gyms and leisure centres will stay open, it was confirmed. Speaking of the new measures for pubs, bars and restaurants, Mr Drakeford added: ""I know this will be a worrying time for all working in the industry. ""We will be working over the weekend with partners to finalise the details of the new arrangements and to put in place a further major package of financial support to respond to those changes. ""I will give further details about the package on Monday."" Claire Vaughan, programme manager at Chapter cinema in Cardiff, said: ""Globally no cases of coronavirus have been traced back to a visit to the cinema. ""Cinemas are a low-risk way of spending time outside the house at a time when the mental health of people in Wales is a huge concern. People will watch Mared Williams outside the venue ""Masks are worn, there are air circulation units and no one is facing another person... Not everyone is living in a warm, safe home - many people need these spaces to be open."" Liam Evans-Ford, Theatr Clwyd's executive director, added the announcement had been a ""huge surprise"". ""This is devastating for our business, for our employees, for our freelancers and for our communities,"" he said. Sian Shepphard, owner of the Horse and Jockey in Pontypool, opened the pub in August so has not been eligible for government support. Sian Shepphard is worried about her staff ""The main problem is we are trying to get people to stay at home but it is ruining our businesses,"" she said. ""I employ over 25 staff here - we are a really family-run business. We are all family - how am I supposed to put food on the table for them?"" Phil James, a customer at the pub, said the potential changes would affect his Christmas plans. ""We just don't know what arrangement to make at the end of the day - people have to know. You come out to socialise - people want to be social for Christmas, alcohol is a part of it."" Phil James says pubs play a big part in his festive celebrations Simon Buckley, chairman of The Brewers of Wales, said: ""Is this finally the straw that will break the industry's back? ""We as an industry are being thrown to the wind, and the looming prospect of significant job losses seems to count for nothing."" Plaid's economy spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones said: ""They [pubs and restaurants] don't know if they're being asked to close altogether again, to only do takeaways, to have restricted opening without alcohol. ""So, they can't really prepare. They need to be given the maximum length of time to prepare."" Clwyd West member of the Senedd Darren Millar called for a targeted rather than a Wales-wide blanket approach. ""It is grossly unfair to impose the same level of restrictions in Conwy and Denbighshire as Covid-19 hotspots in south Wales,"" he said. ""The virus is circulating at different rates in different parts of the country."" Mr Drakeford insisted there were no plans to introduce regionalised ""tiered"" restrictions, similar to those coming into force in England. He said there was no case for aligning the Welsh and English systems to ensure no-one was left out of UK-wide Treasury schemes that offer financial assistance to businesses affected by lockdown measures. ""We don't lose out on any UK system by having a single tier for Wales, so there is no disadvantage to us in that,"" he said. He added: ""The advice we have is that a single set of arrangements for Wales works best, is easiest to communicate and delivers benefits in all parts of Wales."" Pembrokeshire councillor John Davies welcomed the restrictions after a spike in cases in his ward, Cilgerran, linked to the recent outbreak in nearby Cardigan. He told Newyddion 9: ""If people aren't willing to exercise common sense and be citizens of responsibility towards each other, there is no other option. ""We've seen what happens in this part of the world when people act in a selfish manner."" Children are currently in ""class bubbles"" during school Mr Drakeford said he had no plans to allow schools to close early for Christmas. Teaching union UCAC hadcalled for classrooms to be shuton 11 December and for lessons to be moved online amid fears teachers and pupils may have to isolate on Christmas Day. But Mr Drakeford said ministers would do ""everything we can"" to keep schools working up until the Christmas holiday. He added: ""It is more important for our children not to miss out further on the education that is planned for them for the whole of the rest of this term and that's what we will be working to achieve.""

"Thousands of fans came to see Maradona's coffin on display at the presidential palace Three workers hired to help with the funeral and burial of Diego Maradona have been condemned for taking photos next to his open coffin. A funeral parlour took on the three to help prepare the coffin of the football icon, who died on Wednesday aged 60. In two pictures, the men can be seen posing next to the open casket at the parlour, smiling with their thumbs up. The photos surfaced online as Maradona's body lay in repose at the presidential palace, provoking outrage.

"Diggers tipped piles of dead mink into trenches in Jutland Opposition MPs in Denmark have urged the government to dig up millions of mink that were buried in mass graves amid Covid-19 fears. The two burial sites in Jutland are highly controversial - one is near a bathing lake and the other not far from a source of drinking water. The discovery of a mutated form of the virus prompted a cull of nearly 17 million mink, devastating the Danish fur industry - the largest in the EU. The burial decision was judged illegal. The new Agriculture Minister, Rasmus Prehn, said on Friday he supported the idea of exhuming the mink and incinerating them. But that would require the environmental protection agency's approval, he added. His predecessor Mogens Jensen resigned last week in the furore over the government's legal basis for the cull, as more than 10,000 tonnes of dead mink were hastily buried. Denmark's DR news reports that about 11 million mink have been culled so far. Warning: you may find a picture below showing a burial site disturbing The government has admitted that the cull was mishandled. The grisly mass burial got even more macabre when there were reports of buried mink resurfacing because of the nitrogen and phosphorus gases produced by their decay. The two mass graves are near Karup and Holstebro. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen became tearful when discussing the plight of mink farmers Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen wept on Danish TV while visiting a mink farm on Thursday. ""We have two generations of really skilled mink farmers, father and son, who in a very, very short time have had their life's work shattered, and thatâ¦ It's been emotional for them. Sorry. For me as well,"" she said, wiping away tears. Fur industry faces uncertain future due to Covid Denmark shaken by cull of millions of mink What's the science behind mink and coronavirus? Law experts quoted by Danish TV2 say the government went ahead with mass burial without getting an environmental impact assessment. The opposition Liberal Party (Venstre) says the mink should be dug up and loaded into containers of manure, which would allegedly be a safer disposal method. The cull of 17 million mink is still going on Environment Minister Lea Wermelin spoke to parliament - the Folketing - on Friday, in a crisis session called to deal with the mink problem. She admitted that mass burial had not been the best method - incineration would have been preferable - but the spread of Covid-19 on mink farms had made the disposal urgent and there had been no other quick way to handle such a quantity of dead animals. This video can not be played Critics and supporters of the fur trade speak out On Danish TV, the Liberals' environment spokesman Thomas Danielsen said ""this is a case full of errors and illegalities"".

"A blood test designed to detect more than 50 types of cancer at an early stage will be trialled by the NHS. More than 165,000 people in England will be offered the tests from next year. If successful, the NHS hopes to expand it to 1m people from 2024. Sir Simon Stevens, NHS England chief executive, said early detection had the potential ""to save many lives"". While some welcomed the pilot, others cautioned the test was still untried and untested. Developing a blood test for cancer has been keeping scientists busy for many years without much success. Making one that's accurate and reliable has proved incredibly complex - the danger is that a test doesn't detect a person's cancer when they do have it, or it indicates someone has cancer when they don't. This test, developed by the Californian firm Grail, is designed to detect molecular changes in the blood caused by cancer in people with no obvious symptoms. As part of a large-scale pilot, also funded by the company, 140,000 participants aged between 50 and 79 will be asked to take the tests for the next three years. Another 25,000 people with possible cancer symptoms will also be offered testing after being referred to hospital in the normal way. Lesley (left) was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at the age of 62 Lesley Maiden was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer seven months after she was first told there was something wrong with her pancreas. Her sister, Sue, says an earlier diagnosis at an earlier stage of the cancer might have given her a better chance. ""I can't say that it would have saved her life - I will never know, but it might have extended her life. ""Maybe she could have had a few years of good, quality life,"" Sue says. Instead, her cancer was too advanced to allow her to be part of a clinical trial and surgery was no longer an option. Lesley died eight months after her diagnosis on Christmas Day 2018, aged 63. The aim is to increase the number of cancers diagnosed at stage one or two, from half to three-quarters by 2028. Tumours in organs such as the pancreas and ovaries are often diagnosed at a late stage, making treatment far more difficult and reducing survival rates. The NHS hopes the blood tests will help increase five-year survival rates for cancer, which are below the levels seen in many other high-income countries. ""This promising blood test could therefore be a game-changer in cancer care, helping thousands more people to get successful treatment,"" Sir Simon said. Cancer Research UK said large research studies of tests were ""essential for determining if they're effective, and a vital step in getting them to patients, if proven to work"". ""All too often, people are diagnosed with cancer at a late stage, when their disease is more difficult to treat,"" said Michelle Mitchell, the charity's chief executive. ""This is a human tragedy, not just in terms of lives lost, but it also means more expensive treatments, hospital stays and monitoring."" But Prof Paul Pharoah, professor of cancer epidemiology, University of Cambridge, said that the NHS ""should not be investing in such a test before it has been adequately evaluated in well-conducted, large-scale clinical trials.""

"The UK's asylum system has become mired in delay during the lockdown, with tens of thousands of people still waiting for their cases to be determined. Among them is ""Karim"", an Iraqi doctor who wants to use his skills to help the NHS fight the virus. Karim, not his real name, was a doctor working in a hospital in Iraq in 2019 when a group of militiamen entered with a dying patient on a trolley. They demanded to see a doctor and Karim claims he was with the patient in moments, doing his best to save his life, but the man died and the militia blamed Karim. Karim says he was not the first doctor to be targeted - and it was what happened to the others that meant he had to flee. ""I think my fate will be death, because this is what had happened to one of our consultants in the hospital a few months before I fled the country. ""They followed him for about six months and then they shot him over the whole of his body. I had no choice but to flee,"" he told the BBC. Karim says another consultant was told by a militia member that he would be killed if he did not pay them $20,000 after he had treated a pregnant mother whose child was born with a congenital abnormality. Karim and his wife, who is also a doctor, flew to the UK last November, claiming asylum when they arrived. Just over a year later, their application has no end in sight. ""We don't have any exact date which tells us that at least we will be interviewed or we will have a decision by this time, nothing like this,"" says Karim. ""Me and my wife tried our best by contacting the Home Office to get an exemption to support the NHS as doctors during this pandemic, and all our efforts were refused. ""I also offered to volunteer as a doctor but the NHS will not allow you to do any work inside their hospitals if you don't have permission to work."" Karim wants to remain anonymous, fearful of attack, even now he is in the UK As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Home Office cancelled asylum interviews on 19 March. Guidance published on 6 August stated there would be a phased resumption of interviews using video conferencing. Some face-to-face interviews have now resumed. However, figures published this week show arise in the number of asylum seekers waiting for more than six months for their case to be determined,external. They show: in September 2019, 37,450 people were awaiting an asylum decision, of these 20,054 or 54% had waited more than six months but by September 2020 there were 50,179 awaiting a decision and 36,093 or 72% waiting more than six months That represents a rise of more than 16,000 people. ""More than 36,000 asylum seekers, many of whom are traumatised and vulnerable, have waited longer than six months for a Home Office decision that is pivotal for their future, their family and their security. This is unacceptable,"" Law Society President David Greene told the BBC. ""Asylum seekers are living in limbo, unable to earn a living, contribute to the economy or, as in Karim's case, support the NHS. ""We need an immigration and asylum system that treats people fairly, that is efficient and provides timely, lawful decisions. ""Justice delayed is justice denied."" Anyone wishing to stay in the UK as a refugee must apply for asylum. To be eligible you must have left your country and be unable to go back because you fear persecution. Applications should be made on arrival in the UK or as soon as it is thought it would be unsafe to return to your own country. After you apply, you will have a meeting with an immigration officer, a process known as screening. There will then be an asylum interview with a caseworker which will determine your asylum status. If successful you may be given permission to stay in the UK for five years. This is known as ""leave to remain"". In May 2019 the government scrapped its target of processing most asylum claims within six months but said it was committed to ensuring claims were considered without unnecessary delay ""to ensure individuals who need protection are granted asylum as soon as possible and can start to integrate and rebuild their lives, including those granted at appeal"". Home Secretary Priti Patel told the BBC the need for change in the UK's asylum system had never been clearer. ""With over 48,000 asylum cases stuck in this broken system, I will bring forward new legislation next year to ensure vulnerable people get the support they need instead of being stuck in the system waiting for a decision and unable to get on with rebuilding their lives. ""This also means ending abuse of the asylum system. Our new legislation will introduce a new firm system to expedite removals of foreign criminals, stop people coming here illegally and instead prioritise those most in need who play by the rules.""

"This video can not be played Monaco, models and money â who is retail mogul Sir Philip Green? Sir Philip Green's retail empire Arcadia, which includes Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins, is understood to be on the brink of collapse. Sir Philip had been in talks with potential lenders about borrowing Â£30m to help the business through Christmas. However, these talks have failed and administrators could be appointed on Monday, putting 13,000 jobs at risk. Arcadia said it was working on ""contingency options"". Arcadia admitted that the coronavirus had had ""a material impact on trading across our businesses"". ""As a result, the Arcadia boards have been working on a number of contingency options to secure the future of the group's brands,"" it said. ""The brands continue to trade and our stores will be opening again in England and the Republic of Ireland as soon as the government Covid-19 restrictions are lifted next week."" However, even before the pandemic, Arcadia's best-known names - like Topshop - were struggling against nimbler online-only fashion retailers like Asos, Boohoo and Pretty Little Thing. Four reasons Topshop is not the brand it once was Sir Philip Green's Arcadia 'sorry' after notice pay row And rival High Street chains like Zara have invested heavily in their digital business while Topshop has been slow to catch up. In its most recent accounts for the year to 1 September 2018, Arcadia reported a Â£93.4m pre-tax loss compared with a Â£164.6m profit in the previous 12 months. It also said sales fell 4.5% to Â£1.8bn. Sir Philip Green, model Kate Moss and Edward Enninful, now editor-in-chief of British Vogue, in 2017 Sir Philip Green - once known as the ""King of the High Street"" - is facing his biggest challenge yet. With his Arcadia retail empire teetering on the brink of collapse, it is the latest saga in a colourful career that once saw him branded as the ""unacceptable face of capitalism"". The retail tycoon's life story to date is rich in character and anecdote, from his failed attempts to take over M&S, to a lavish lifestyle that has attracted accusations of tax avoidance. But questions now swirl over the fate of his empire. Read more about Sir Philip's career here Richard Lim, chief executive at Retail Economics, said that while all clothing shops had been adversely affected by the pandemic, Arcadia's ""demise has been accelerated because of an online proposition that falls way behind that of their competitors"". ""Years of underinvestment in the digital channel has severely restricted their ability to trade successfully through this hugely difficult period,"" he said. ""Arcadia would be the biggest British corporate collapse of the pandemic if it does enter voluntary liquidation,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""It would hollow out huge swathes of the High Street, if its huge footprint of stores were forced to close."" If administrators are called in, the shops will continue to trade as buyers for the company - or more likely its well-known brands - are lined up for sale. Arcadia currently has about 500 shops. There is some speculation that Boohoo could emerge as a buyer for some of the brand. This year it bought the online businesses of Oasis and Warehouse, adding to Karen Millen and Coast, which it acquired in 2019. Mike Ashley, the billionaire founder of Sports Direct, is also understood to be among those interested. He has been buying up struggling High Street chains such as DW Sports Fitness and House of Fraser over the last few years. Non-essential retailers in England have been forced to close for four weeks until 2 December to contain the spread of Covid-19. This followed a longer lockdown earlier in the year. It has meant that other retailers with ties to Arcadia - such as department store chain Debenhams - are also struggling. Are you an Arcadia employee?  Share your experiences. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Debenhams sells a number of Sir Philip's brands through concessions at its department stores. However, Debenhams is in administrationand is currently in talks to find a buyer. As with many High Street chains that had to go into lockdown, Arcadia placed many of the group's 13,000 workers on furlough. It began the year with 15,000 workers. But in the summer, it axed 500 roles at its head office, while natural attrition meant employees have left for other, busier businesses. While it would be the biggest casualty of the pandemic if it collapsed, Arcadia is not alone. On Friday, menswear retailer Moss Bros launched a restructuring of its business after it said trading had been ""severely impacted"" by Covid-19. It hired auditors toprepare for the company voluntary arrangementearlier this year. Earlier this month, fashion chains Peacocks and Jaeger were placed into administration after owner Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group failed to find a buyer. And other retailers have been cutting jobs, including 3,500 at grocer Sainsbury's and 1,500 roles at John Lewis Partnership. Sir Philip is unlikely to buy back any of his brands if it does go into administration,which was first reported by Sky News,external. Arcadia underwent restructuring last year when it agreed to shut 50 shops. As part of that deal, the company secured a rent cut with its landlords on property, as well as an agreement with the Pension Protection Fund to put money into the company's pension schemes. Sir Philip and his wife Lady Cristina Green are worth Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Sir Philip Green owns a luxury yacht called 'Lionheart' Much of their wealth is derived from a Â£1.2bn dividend payment Sir Philip took from Arcadia in 2005, two years after buying the business. It was paid tax-free as his wife, Lady Green, is resident in Monaco, and she is the ultimate owner of the company. In recent years, Sir Philip faced controversy for selling off BHS, the former department store chain, for Â£1 to high-profile businessman Dominic Chappell. The following year, BHS went bust with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of Â£571m. Sir Philip reached a deal with the Pensions Regulator to inject Â£363m into that scheme. The buyer of BHS, Mr Chappell, was recently sentenced to six years in prison after being found guilty of tax evasion. John Ralfe, an independent pension expert who advised the work and pensions select committee on BHS's pension schemes in 2016, told the BBC that Sir Philip seemed to ""have learnt his lesson"". In a deal with the Pensions Regulator in 2019, Lady Tina Green, Arcadia's biggest shareholder, agreed to pump Â£100m into its two pension schemes over three years. The wider group also said it would inject Â£75m, although it paused payments in March for six months due to difficulties stemming from the pandemic. Mr Ralfe believes that the pension deficit could be as much as Â£350m for insurers to take on once the value of things like its physical shops had been accounted for. The Pension Regulator and the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) are understood to be being kept closely informed about plans for the group. A spokesperson for the PPF said that although it was unable to comment on trading companies, members of the schemes ""can be assured of our ongoing protection.""

"Claire Elms, who was celebrating her 35th birthday, said she felt ""sad"" but not surprised by the decision Nottinghamshire's return to the top tier of Covid-19 restrictions is ""a kick in the teeth"", residents have said. The city and countymoved into tier three in October, but a four-week England-wide lockdown has seen the rates of positive cases drop. Some residents said the decision will affect their livelihoods, with one describing it as heartbreaking. The government said ratesremained ""very high"" among those over 60. Lia Primrose (left), pictured with her friend Poppi, said the decision felt like a ""kick in the teeth"" Lia Primrose, 17, who is studying health and social care at college, said: ""It just feels like a bit of a kick in the teeth after cases went down so much."" She said that because she worked as a waitress, she would be unable to return to work and described the announcement as, ""the biggest heartbreak"". Nottingham Trent University students Laura Puttock (left) and Emma de Duve said they were ""absolutely gutted"" Her classmate, Poppi West, also 17, added: ""It feels like we're going round in circles. ""I know it's not the biggest issue but we're both nearly 18 and we won't be able to go out and have a drink to celebrate. It's just a bit sad."" Pat West, 63, from Newark, said she did not understand why the region was in tier three. ""I'm really disappointed,"" she said. ""My grandchildren can't come round to see me at home. I'm not seeing them grow up."" Julia West said she really felt for young people in the area Julia West, 69, from West Bridgford, said: ""I think it's disheartening we're going back into tier three after we all did our bit to bring it down. ""I feel especially for the young people who need some sort of outlet."" Nottingham Trent University students Laura Puttock and Emma de Duve said they were ""absolutely gutted"". ""It's our 21st [birthdays] in December,"" said Laura. ""It's our last year of uni and we thought we could have a last celebration, but now it's going to have to be a takeaway. ""It's hardly the 21st I'd dreamed of. It just feels [as if] we've done our bit, cases are going down, but we're still not seeing any change.

Rates have dropped in Nottingham and Nottinghamshire during the national lockdown Emma added: ""Everyone was hanging on for this day to see if we were in tier two. ""I think for people's mental health just being able to go out of the house [and] meet people not from your household is really important."" Pat Brown, 75, a West Bridgford resident, said: ""To be perfectly honest I didn't think in a million years we'd be in tier two."" Mandy Middlecote said the tiers system would not make much difference to her However, other residents said they had expected the announcement. Claire Elms, who was celebrating her 35th birthday, said she felt ""sad"" but not surprised. ""I live on my own and I want to get out and meet my friends,"" she said. Mandy Middlecote, 44, from Beeston, said she was not surprised by the announcement either. ""Cases are still pretty high,"" she said. ""Me and my family are keeping to ourselves so tier two or three doesn't make much difference.

"Topshop's owner Arcadia Group is reportedlyin talks to secure millions of pounds in emergency funding. The retail chain, which also owns Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins, was hit hard when coronavirus lockdowns forced the closure of hundreds of stores. The company slashed 500 head office jobs in July, blaming lost sales. But many fashion commentators say the group's most famous brand - Topshop - has had problems for years. We take a look at what's gone wrong at the former High Street favourite. Topshop's popularity peaked in the heady years before the Great Recession, when people had more money to spend and celebrities were keen to be associated with the brand. At that time, Topshop counted among its team some of the most respected names in the industry, such as stylist Katie Grand and brand director Jane Shepherdson. ""They were very good kind of fashion people with good fashion pedigree and the result of that was they had a very clear aim and they knew who their customer was,"" says fashion columnist Amber Graafland. Topshop has been hit hard by coronavirus lockdowns High-profile collaborations also created buzz for the brand, as in 2007, when shoppers queued around the block to buy a piece from the range designed by Kate Moss. ""For a while Topshop was cool. They were part of London Fashion Week, they were pulling cool people onto the runway and in the front row,"" Ms Graafland says. But more recently, Topshop has failed to command that kind of status. The brand just ""isn't doing anything exciting anymore,"" says Barbara Adeniken, a London-based fashion content creator. Crowds gather outside Topshop in Oxford Circus for Kate Moss's collection launch in 2014 ""When I was 18 and 19, I used to always spend my first paycheque in Topshop and buy a Â£90 coat. But I don't think they're seen as young and trendy anymore. More young people I know tend to shop at BooHoo and Missguided,"" she says, referring to two of the UK's most popular online retailers. Topshop didn't respond to a request for comment from BBC news. Topshop, like other traditional High Street brands, has been challenged by online-only fashion platforms like Asos, BooHoo and Pretty Little Thing. Their low prices and rapid turnover draw in customers wanting to continually update their wardrobe - something that has become more important in the age of Instagram, says Ms Adeniken. ""There's this perception on social media that you always have to be changing your outfit so of course to do that, you buy fast fashion,"" she says. The pandemic, which forced physical stores to close for months this year, only accelerated fashion's move to the digital marketplace, says Bethan Alexander, a global retail expert at the London College of Fashion. Fashion content creator Barbara Adeniken says Topshop 'isn't doing anything exciting anymore' But when it comes to selling collections online, she says Topshop's traditional high street rival Zara does a much better job. ""Topshop has been guilty of being too slow to adapt to the changing market. Whereas Zara has been investing in digital solutions in recent years - such as giving consumers online access to stock levels in-store - Topshop has been lagging behind,"" she says. Ms Alexander says Topshop's brand has also been tainted by Arcadia director Sir Philip Green, after a series of less-than-favourable incidents. First there wasthe BHS pension scandal, which surfaced after Sir Philip sold the now-defunct department store in 2015 to another businessman for Â£1. A year later BHS collapsed, 11,000 people lost their jobs and the company was found to have a pension deficit of Â£571m. Sir Philip later reached a deal with the Pensions Regulator - which accused him of doing the sale to dodge responsibility for the deficit - to inject Â£363m into the scheme. But his reputation took a hit. Then in 2018,Sir Philip was accused of sexual and racial harassment, getting named in Parliament after he took legal action to stop the media from publishing the claims. Arcadia Group director Sir Philip Green, Kate Moss and Edward Enninful attend Topshop's London Fashion Week show in 2017. The retail boss ""categorically and wholly"" denied the allegations which The Telegraph said it had spent eight months investigating. Fast-forward to this year when the pandemic struck and shops in the UK were closed. Garment makers in Bangladesh reported that Arcadia cancelled some orders and demanded a 30% discount on others. Ms Alexander says the Topshop owner behaved ""in stark contrast with some competitors who prioritised the welfare of staff and suppliers as the pandemic hit"". Topshop might not churn out new pieces at the breakneck speed of its online-only rivals, but it still has a fast fashion business model - mass producing garments cheaply, then shipping them to 260-outlets worldwide. As more consumers question firms' environmental records, Topshop has fallen behind when it comes to sustainability. ""Topshop has faced controversy over the past decade due to allegations of its social and environmental impact and a lack of any meaningful action to counteract these claims,"" says Ms Alexander. An ethical and sustainable brand aggregator, goodonyou.eco, rates Topshop as 'not good enough' when it comes to the environment and accuses it of ""not taking adequate steps to ensure payment of a living wage for its workers."" The retailer has ""zero transparency about their practices,"" says 24-year-old artist Ilona Ecott of Buckinghamshire. In contrast, she points to the ethos of newer names such as 23-year-oldGrace Beverley, a social media influencer who founded an athleisure labelmade from a range of recycled fabrics.

She says you're far more likely to hold on to Topshop clothes, than those from other cheaper brands. ""People buy from Pretty Little Thing but they don't fit the same. You have them for a year then get rid of them because they're out of fashion. With Topshop you can dress a top up with different trousers or a different coat or cardigan and you can still wear them.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson addresses criticism of ""tough"" tiers plan Boris Johnson has defended his decision to place 55 million people in England into the two highest tiers of Covid restrictions, arguing the country needs ""simplicity and clarity"". The PM said measures due to come in when lockdown ends on Wednesday were more ""relaxed"" but would ""drive"" Covid down until a vaccine is available. But a group of Tory MPs is threatening to rebel in a Commons vote on Tuesday. If Labour backs them, this could threaten the government's majority. There is concern that the government is adopting a ""one-size-fits all"" approach, which does not reflect local levels of infection. Almost all of England facing tough virus rules Postcode check - what is my tier? Tiers and Christmas - a recipe for disaster? From Wednesday, more than 32 million people are due to be living under tier two restrictions, banning indoor meetings between households. A further 23 million people would be placed under the highest - tier three - restrictions, which further limit contact between people outdoors. Just over 1% of England's population would enter the lowest - tier one - restrictions, under which the ""rule of six"" applies both indoors and outdoors. Conservative MP and former cabinet minister Damian Green, who represents Ashford, in Kent, which is set to go into tier three, told the BBC he would vote against the government unless it provided ""new and convincing evidence"". ""Instead of having these wide county-based areas, where people are put in tiers, then we should do it on a borough basis,"" he said. ""In an area like mine, the incidence is less than it is in Liverpool, which has just been released down into tier two. So, as it stands, the current policy, the current allocation of tiers on these wide bases, are just not evidence-based."" This video can not be played How you and your family can celebrate Christmas and minimise the spread of coronavirus Speaking on a visit to Public Health England laboratories, at Porton Down, Wiltshire, Mr Johnson said he understood the ""frustration"" of those in higher-tier areas, whose own town or village did not have high levels of the disease. But he added that the government ""cannot divide the country up into loads and loads of very complicated sub-divisions"" and had to ensure ""some simplicity and clarity"". ""Unless you beat the problem in the high-incidence area, the low-incidence area, I'm afraid, starts to catch up,"" Mr Johnson said. He said ""tough tiering"" was still more ""relaxed by a long way than the current lockdown measures"" and it would ""drive the disease down... until a vaccine comes on stream, which we hope will be over the next weeks and months"". Asked about mass Covid testing, Mr Johnson said: ""The supply [of kits] I don't think is going to be the problem. The issue is going to be getting everybody mobilised to understand the potential advantage of [it]."" Aware of the disquiet on its own backbenches, the government has promised to publish impact assessments of the new restrictions; a key demand from concerned MPs. There's also a suggestion that areas could move into lower tiers when numbers are reviewed at regular intervals. But that's unlikely to see off the brewing Tory rebellion. Some Conservatives have already publicly declared that they won't vote for the new tier system when it's put before the Commons next week. If enough rebel the government might have to look to the opposition to get this through Parliament. Sir Keir Starmer is still deciding whether his party will back the plan, although it is likely to have enough support overall. However, it's not a good look for the government to have to rely on Labour in the face of unrest on its own benches. The Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs, set up to scrutinise the government's response to the pandemic, is threatening a revolt in next Tuesday's vote. The group's chair, Mark Harper, said evidence provided by the government to justify the tier system was not ""compelling"". He called for more information on the measures' effects on different sectors of the economy. He added that on ""too many occasions, ministers have made arguments and they've not stacked up"". Deputy chairman Steve Baker called the measures ""truly appalling"" and said the modelling used by government scientists had been ""wrong time and time again"". The group claims to have 70 members, but it is not certain how many of them would be expected to rebel against the government. This video can not be played The BBC's Laura Foster explains the new three tier system for England. Forty-three Conservatives would have to defy the prime minister to defeat the plan, if all opposition MPs also voted against. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is expected to decide early next week whether to support Mr Johnson, after consulting government coronavirus experts. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Labour was ""not against"" tougher restrictions or tiers, but would seek ""reassurances"" on support for the poor and vulnerable. MASS TESTING:Where is it available? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Under the government's plan, Kent and large parts of the Midlands, north-east and north-west England would go into tier three. Only Cornwall, the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight would be in tier one. Mr Johnson said the government's planned ""review point"" - on 16 December - gave the ""prospect of areas being able to move down the tier scale"". But Professor John Edmunds, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said he could not imagine ""huge changes"" to restrictions by then. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that experts were unlikely to ""have accumulated much data"" in time. The government has promised to publish an impact assessment before MPs vote on the new rules.

"This video can not be played Monaco, models and money â who is retail mogul Sir Philip Green? Sir Philip Green's retail empire Arcadia, which includes Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins, is understood to be on the brink of collapse. Sir Philip had been in talks with potential lenders about borrowing Â£30m to help the business through Christmas. However, these talks have failed and administrators could be appointed on Monday, putting 13,000 jobs at risk. Arcadia said it was working on ""contingency options"". Arcadia admitted that the coronavirus had had ""a material impact on trading across our businesses"". ""As a result, the Arcadia boards have been working on a number of contingency options to secure the future of the group's brands,"" it said. ""The brands continue to trade and our stores will be opening again in England and the Republic of Ireland as soon as the government Covid-19 restrictions are lifted next week."" However, even before the pandemic, Arcadia's best-known names - like Topshop - were struggling against nimbler online-only fashion retailers like Asos, Boohoo and Pretty Little Thing. Four reasons Topshop is not the brand it once was Sir Philip Green's Arcadia 'sorry' after notice pay row And rival High Street chains like Zara have invested heavily in their digital business while Topshop has been slow to catch up. In its most recent accounts for the year to 1 September 2018, Arcadia reported a Â£93.4m pre-tax loss compared with a Â£164.6m profit in the previous 12 months. It also said sales fell 4.5% to Â£1.8bn. Sir Philip Green, model Kate Moss and Edward Enninful, now editor-in-chief of British Vogue, in 2017 Sir Philip Green - once known as the ""King of the High Street"" - is facing his biggest challenge yet. With his Arcadia retail empire teetering on the brink of collapse, it is the latest saga in a colourful career that once saw him branded as the ""unacceptable face of capitalism"". The retail tycoon's life story to date is rich in character and anecdote, from his failed attempts to take over M&S, to a lavish lifestyle that has attracted accusations of tax avoidance. But questions now swirl over the fate of his empire. Read more about Sir Philip's career here Richard Lim, chief executive at Retail Economics, said that while all clothing shops had been adversely affected by the pandemic, Arcadia's ""demise has been accelerated because of an online proposition that falls way behind that of their competitors"". ""Years of underinvestment in the digital channel has severely restricted their ability to trade successfully through this hugely difficult period,"" he said. ""Arcadia would be the biggest British corporate collapse of the pandemic if it does enter voluntary liquidation,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""It would hollow out huge swathes of the High Street, if its huge footprint of stores were forced to close."" If administrators are called in, the shops will continue to trade as buyers for the company - or more likely its well-known brands - are lined up for sale. Arcadia currently has about 500 shops. There is some speculation that Boohoo could emerge as a buyer for some of the brand. This year it bought the online businesses of Oasis and Warehouse, adding to Karen Millen and Coast, which it acquired in 2019. Mike Ashley, the billionaire founder of Sports Direct, is also understood to be among those interested. He has been buying up struggling High Street chains such as DW Sports Fitness and House of Fraser over the last few years. Non-essential retailers in England have been forced to close for four weeks until 2 December to contain the spread of Covid-19. This followed a longer lockdown earlier in the year. It has meant that other retailers with ties to Arcadia - such as department store chain Debenhams - are also struggling. Are you an Arcadia employee?  Share your experiences. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Debenhams sells a number of Sir Philip's brands through concessions at its department stores. However, Debenhams is in administrationand is currently in talks to find a buyer. As with many High Street chains that had to go into lockdown, Arcadia placed many of the group's 13,000 workers on furlough. It began the year with 15,000 workers. But in the summer, it axed 500 roles at its head office, while natural attrition meant employees have left for other, busier businesses. While it would be the biggest casualty of the pandemic if it collapsed, Arcadia is not alone. On Friday, menswear retailer Moss Bros launched a restructuring of its business after it said trading had been ""severely impacted"" by Covid-19. It hired auditors toprepare for the company voluntary arrangementearlier this year. Earlier this month, fashion chains Peacocks and Jaeger were placed into administration after owner Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group failed to find a buyer. And other retailers have been cutting jobs, including 3,500 at grocer Sainsbury's and 1,500 roles at John Lewis Partnership. Sir Philip is unlikely to buy back any of his brands if it does go into administration,which was first reported by Sky News,external. Arcadia underwent restructuring last year when it agreed to shut 50 shops. As part of that deal, the company secured a rent cut with its landlords on property, as well as an agreement with the Pension Protection Fund to put money into the company's pension schemes. Sir Philip and his wife Lady Cristina Green are worth Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Sir Philip Green owns a luxury yacht called 'Lionheart' Much of their wealth is derived from a Â£1.2bn dividend payment Sir Philip took from Arcadia in 2005, two years after buying the business. It was paid tax-free as his wife, Lady Green, is resident in Monaco, and she is the ultimate owner of the company. In recent years, Sir Philip faced controversy for selling off BHS, the former department store chain, for Â£1 to high-profile businessman Dominic Chappell. The following year, BHS went bust with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of Â£571m. Sir Philip reached a deal with the Pensions Regulator to inject Â£363m into that scheme. The buyer of BHS, Mr Chappell, was recently sentenced to six years in prison after being found guilty of tax evasion. John Ralfe, an independent pension expert who advised the work and pensions select committee on BHS's pension schemes in 2016, told the BBC that Sir Philip seemed to ""have learnt his lesson"". In a deal with the Pensions Regulator in 2019, Lady Tina Green, Arcadia's biggest shareholder, agreed to pump Â£100m into its two pension schemes over three years. The wider group also said it would inject Â£75m, although it paused payments in March for six months due to difficulties stemming from the pandemic. Mr Ralfe believes that the pension deficit could be as much as Â£350m for insurers to take on once the value of things like its physical shops had been accounted for. The Pension Regulator and the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) are understood to be being kept closely informed about plans for the group. A spokesperson for the PPF said that although it was unable to comment on trading companies, members of the schemes ""can be assured of our ongoing protection.""

"This video can not be played BBC News NI Political Reporter Jayne McCormack explains what the new restrictions mean for people in Northern Ireland New guidance has been issued to help retailers run a click and collect service in a controlled way during NI's two-week circuit breaker. Tougher new Covid-19 restrictions came into force across NI on Friday. Non-essential retailers have been told to close except for click-and-collect services. On Friday morning,a framework setting out how these services can be provided safely was published by the Department for the Economy.,external The department said click and collect facilities will operate ""on an appointment-only basis with maximum mitigations in place"". Economy Minister Diane Dodds said the guidance will ""help business owners and customers ensure they are operating safely and within Northern Ireland legislation"". The framework includes guidance such as: Retailers and customers are encouraged to use on-line ordering and delivery as the first choice for customers Those retailers who do not have an online facility should consider the potential of phoned-in or text ordering Collections are by appointment only and should be scheduled to ensure no customer-customer contact and no queuing Retailers are encouraged to allocate time slots to allow them to manage a reasonable number of people per hour If collection is from a store in a shopping centre, the collection point should be close to the entrance with a one-way system Customers are not permitted to enter stores - the collection should be from the entrance door Collections should be by a designated customer to collect only - there should be no household groups Customers and retailers should encourage where possible pre-payment methods and contactless proof of purchase on collection In other restrictions, cafes and restaurants can only provide a take-away service and close-contact services such as hairdressers and beauty salons have to close. Therestrictions came into force at 00:01 GMT on Friday,externaland will be in place until 00:01 on 11 December. It means Northern Ireland will revert to similar measures introduced in March, with the exception of schools remaining open. Garden centres, supermarkets and homeware stores are exempt from closing under the new regulations. Mrs Dodds has also confirmed that the closing date for applications to Part A and Part B of theCovid Restrictions Business Support Schemehas been extended to 16 December. She said payments to eligible businesses will be extended to cover the latest restrictions agreed by the executive. It is hoped the measures, announced by the Stormont Executive, will help control the spread of coronavirus and bring the reproduction (R) number down ahead of the Christmas period. On Thursday, First Minister Arlene Foster said R number in Northern Ireland was ""just below 1"",but the two-week circuit breaker was ""crucial... so that we can all have the safest and the happiest Christmas possible"". Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was important to reduce the transmission rate to ""as low as possible"" and ""do everything possible to limit the number of people you come into contact with"". NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your Questions Answered The run-up to the festive period is traditionally the busiest time of the year for the businesses affected by the latest lockdown and the decision has been criticised by retailers and the groups which represent them. Lisa and Peter Mahaffey own a gift shop in Bangor, County Down. They extended their opening hours this week to cope with the big rise in customers attempting to beat both the lockdown and the Christmas rush. But they say the new rules over what constitutes essential retail are confusing as a large proportion of the items sold in the shop are homeware. Gift shop owner Peter Mahaffey says there needs to be more clarity on what constitutes essential retail ""All the big retailers like Sainsbury's and Tesco don't close, but they sell the same stuff that we sell. We don't know where we really stand,"" said Mr Mahaffey. He thinks the other main issue is the timing of the move by Stormont. ""They would have been much better closing us at the beginning of November and letting us re-open now with the run-in to Christmas,"" he said. What are the lockdown rules across the UK? Plan for Covid vaccinations to begin in December ""This is our busiest time of the year. The main time is just being taken away from us."" The doors may be closed to customers, but Christmas stock deliveries are still arriving at shops. Jenny Doherty, from a book shop shop in Londonderry, is not sure if online sales will be enough to clear that stock and pay the suppliers. She is not sure yet what the financial hit will be and she said not having customers coming in at this time of year is ""frightening"". She added: ""Books aren't perishable. There will be a plan B, but I do worry."" Florist Penny Hamilton is trialling a click-and-collect service Florist Penny Hamilton is also trialling a click-and-collect service at her east Belfast shop, but is worried it will not suit some of her older customers. ""They are used to coming in and being able to smell all the flowers and see all the colours,"" she said.

"The music producer, named only as Michel, spoke to reporters outside the National Police General Inspectorate in Paris French authorities have suspended three police officers after they were seen on video beating up a black music producer in central Paris. The incident on Saturday has prompted a fresh outcry over the conduct of French security forces. On Mondaypolice were accused of using unnecessary forceas they dismantled a makeshift migrant camp in Paris. The incidents come as the government tries to bring in laws banning the broadcast of police officers' faces. Critics of the legislation say that without such images, none of the incidents which took place over the past week would have come to light. Tough French immigration bill approved On Thursday, French football star Kylian Mbappe, who is black, joined national teammates and fellow athletes in condemning the latest incident. ""Unbearable video, unacceptable violence. Say no to racism,""he wrote on Twitter,externalnext to a picture of the bloodied face of the injured producer, who has been named only as Michel. The security camera video was published on Thursday by the online news site Loopsider. It shows three officers kicking, punching and using their truncheons on the man after he entered his studio. Loopsider said he had initially been stopped for not wearing a mask. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Michel said that he was also subjected to racist abuse during the five minute beating. He was detained and charged with violence and resisting arrest, but prosecutors threw the charges out and instead opened an investigation against the officers. As he arrived at police headquarters on Thursday with his lawyer to file a complaint, Michel told reporters: ""People who should have been protecting me attacked me. I did nothing to deserve this. I just want these three people to be punished according to the law."" Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said she was ""profoundly shocked"" by the ""intolerable act"". Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin told French television that he would press for the officers' dismissal, saying they had ""soiled the uniform of the republic"". Earlier this week Mr Darmanin ordered police to provide a full report after they violently dismantled a makeshift migrant camp in the capital, clashing with migrants and activists. He tweeted that some of the scenes were ""shocking"". This video can not be played Police tipped some migrants out of their flimsy tents Meanwhile, the French government is pressing ahead with its controversial security bill, which opponents say could undermine the media's ability to scrutinise police behaviour. Article 24 of the bill makes it a criminal offence to post images of police or soldiers on social media which are deemed to target them as individuals. No new 'Jungle' camp in Calais - Macron How the migrant crisis changed Europe The government argues that the new bill does not jeopardise the rights of the media and ordinary citizens to report police abuses. But in the face of criticism the government added an amendment, specifying that Article 24 ""will only target the dissemination of images clearly aimed at harming a police officer's or soldier's physical or psychological integrity"".

"The UK's asylum system has become mired in delay during the lockdown, with tens of thousands of people still waiting for their cases to be determined. Among them is ""Karim"", an Iraqi doctor who wants to use his skills to help the NHS fight the virus. Karim, not his real name, was a doctor working in a hospital in Iraq in 2019 when a group of militiamen entered with a dying patient on a trolley. They demanded to see a doctor and Karim claims he was with the patient in moments, doing his best to save his life, but the man died and the militia blamed Karim. Karim says he was not the first doctor to be targeted - and it was what happened to the others that meant he had to flee. ""I think my fate will be death, because this is what had happened to one of our consultants in the hospital a few months before I fled the country. ""They followed him for about six months and then they shot him over the whole of his body. I had no choice but to flee,"" he told the BBC. Karim says another consultant was told by a militia member that he would be killed if he did not pay them $20,000 after he had treated a pregnant mother whose child was born with a congenital abnormality. Karim and his wife, who is also a doctor, flew to the UK last November, claiming asylum when they arrived. Just over a year later, their application has no end in sight. ""We don't have any exact date which tells us that at least we will be interviewed or we will have a decision by this time, nothing like this,"" says Karim. ""Me and my wife tried our best by contacting the Home Office to get an exemption to support the NHS as doctors during this pandemic, and all our efforts were refused. ""I also offered to volunteer as a doctor but the NHS will not allow you to do any work inside their hospitals if you don't have permission to work."" Karim wants to remain anonymous, fearful of attack, even now he is in the UK As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Home Office cancelled asylum interviews on 19 March. Guidance published on 6 August stated there would be a phased resumption of interviews using video conferencing. Some face-to-face interviews have now resumed. However, figures published this week show arise in the number of asylum seekers waiting for more than six months for their case to be determined,external. They show: in September 2019, 37,450 people were awaiting an asylum decision, of these 20,054 or 54% had waited more than six months but by September 2020 there were 50,179 awaiting a decision and 36,093 or 72% waiting more than six months That represents a rise of more than 16,000 people. ""More than 36,000 asylum seekers, many of whom are traumatised and vulnerable, have waited longer than six months for a Home Office decision that is pivotal for their future, their family and their security. This is unacceptable,"" Law Society President David Greene told the BBC. ""Asylum seekers are living in limbo, unable to earn a living, contribute to the economy or, as in Karim's case, support the NHS. ""We need an immigration and asylum system that treats people fairly, that is efficient and provides timely, lawful decisions. ""Justice delayed is justice denied."" Anyone wishing to stay in the UK as a refugee must apply for asylum. To be eligible you must have left your country and be unable to go back because you fear persecution. Applications should be made on arrival in the UK or as soon as it is thought it would be unsafe to return to your own country. After you apply, you will have a meeting with an immigration officer, a process known as screening. There will then be an asylum interview with a caseworker which will determine your asylum status. If successful you may be given permission to stay in the UK for five years. This is known as ""leave to remain"". In May 2019 the government scrapped its target of processing most asylum claims within six months but said it was committed to ensuring claims were considered without unnecessary delay ""to ensure individuals who need protection are granted asylum as soon as possible and can start to integrate and rebuild their lives, including those granted at appeal"". Home Secretary Priti Patel told the BBC the need for change in the UK's asylum system had never been clearer. ""With over 48,000 asylum cases stuck in this broken system, I will bring forward new legislation next year to ensure vulnerable people get the support they need instead of being stuck in the system waiting for a decision and unable to get on with rebuilding their lives. ""This also means ending abuse of the asylum system. Our new legislation will introduce a new firm system to expedite removals of foreign criminals, stop people coming here illegally and instead prioritise those most in need who play by the rules.""

"The UK's estimated coronavirus R number has fallen to between 0.9 and 1 for the first time since mid-August - so the epidemic is no longer though to be growing UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended the ""simplicity and clarity"" of tier allocations for Covid rules in England The government says it will publish an impact assessment before MPs get a chance to vote on the new rules on Tuesday If 40 Tory backbenchers rebel, the PM may need Labour's help in winning the vote Labour is expected to decide next week whether to back the plans, after consulting Covid experts Fresh curbs on hospitality and entertainment venues will be brought in across Wales from next Friday UK high street retailer Arcadia is understood to be on the verge of collapse, with the firm saying the pandemic has had a ""material impact"" on trading Fans in Italy have defied lockdown rules by gathering at Napoli stadium for a second day, to mark the death of football legend Diego Maradona There have been more than 60 million coronavirus cases and 1.4 million deaths across the globe, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Rob Corp and Alice Evans We are ending our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for the day, so thank you for joining us. Friday's coverage has been brought to you by: Joseph Lee, Katie Wright, Lauren Turner, Robin Levinson King, Alice Evans and Rob Corp. Here are some of the main UK stories from today.    Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen found the plight of mink farmers overwhelming Here's a quick recap of some of the coronavirus headlines from around the world today. The announcement of the new coronavirus restrictions for England, which will come into force from 2 December, has prompted questions and concerns from business owners and families. ""They have changed the rules in the middle of the game,"" says Amanda Thompson, managing director of amusement park Blackpool Pleasure Beach in Lancashire, which will go into the toughest tier of measures - tier three. Amanda has been trying to work out how she will make it to Christmas. ""I had a pantomime due to start next week, a dinner show due to begin, a lot of people who have been unemployed all year because they are performers unable to perform."" The visitor attraction, which is almost 125 years old, has survived two world wars only to be bought to a ""grinding halt"" this year. ""Without Blackpool Pleasure Beach there is no Blackpool. Perhaps people don't find it interesting in London but it is of interest to the millions of people who come here."" While the resort had been operating in a Covid-secure way over the summer, Amanda says it will now be closed until next year unless restrictions are relaxed. ""Â£250,000 of cancellations came in yesterday,"" she adds. Read more about how others are coming to terms with the new measures.  Jayne Nash is part of the team which has taken over the Never Say Die pub Why, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, would anybody decide to take over a pub? ""Crazy? We probably are,"" says Jayne Nash, from the village of Jaywick, on the Essex coast. ""But it was an opportunity we couldn't miss."" For years, she has been a regular at the Never Say Die, which sits 20m (60ft) from the beach. But now she is on the other side of the bar, as part of a team that reopened the ""community pub"" on 1 August, supported initially by grants from a number of organisations. ""We had a week to get going. It was all hands on deck,"" says Jayne. ""It was brilliant."" Takings reached about Â£1,000 per night, but within weeks of reopening, the team received the worst possible news in the form of a second lockdown. However, Jayne remains positive about the pub's future. ""We want to make it grow,"" she says. ""We've had so many volunteers come forward since we started. People know what we're doing and they want to help."" Read the full story here. Black Friday started earlier this year asUK shoppers turned to online services during the pandemic. The number of parcels being delivered started increasing sharply from the end of October. By last week, it had already surpassed last year's post-Black Friday peak, according to new data. Metapack, which acts as a go-between for retailers and couriers, said parcel volumes were already up by 70% this week, compared with the same week last year. In a normal year, retailers would expect the week in which Black Friday falls to be the most profitable of the year. But sales were already up by between 50 and 60% in each of the first three weeks of November, according to IMRG, which collects data from online retailing companies. Hundreds of people in England have beenwrongly told they have coronavirus by NHS Test and Traceafter a ""laboratory error"". More than 1,300 people who gave samples between 19 and 23 November received positive results, when the tests were actually void. All of those affected will be told to take another test, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said. Duncan Larcombe, said his two children, aged 14 and nine, were both sent home from school to self-isolate and he was unable to work. His 14-year-old daughter who tested positive ""had not left her bedroom"" for four days, with meals being left outside her door, until learning the result was void on Thursday. ""We were taking it very seriously,"" he said. DHSC said it was an ""isolated incident"" caused by an ""issue with a batch of testing chemicals"" which had affected tests taken across the UK. Shaimaa KhalilAustralia correspondent Matt Lanigan says the lockdown was ""pretty grim"" Melbourne's second lockdown, which began in July, went on to become one of the longest and strictest in the world until it ended last month. ""The streets were completely deserted. It was like something out of [post-apocalyptic film] Mad Max,"" says Matt Lanigan, who owns a cafe on Chapel St, the city's iconic shopping strip. ""It was brutal,"" Matt says of trying keep his business afloat. ""It was like I was in a boxing match and I just got knocked to the floor. For a moment there, I felt like maybe it wasn't worth getting up."" But things are slowly turning around. Earlier today, Melbourne and the state of Victoria reported the 28th consecutive day with no new infections. After seeing daily cases soar above 700 in July and August,the city is seen as an example for the rest of the world on how to handle a second outbreak. Melbourne's Chapel St is buzzing again Now on reopened Chapel St, music and chatter fill the air as people enjoy their Sunday brunches. But despite the high spirits, everywhere you look there are signs of how battered this city has been. Many businesses are still shut, and others are open but half empty. Matt says the real economic and mental health toll will become clearer in the months to come, especially when government wage subsidy schemes end. Er Shun, above, and Da Mao spent time at Toronto Zoo before being sent to Calgary A Canadian zoo is sending two pandas back to their previous home in China due to a bamboo shortage caused by the pandemic. The Calgary Zoo had hoped to return Er Shun and Da Mao earlier, as bamboo
 supplies dwindled, but there were significant delays in obtaining the 
permits to ship them home. ""Today is the day!"" the zoo posted on Facebook on Friday. The zoo had raised concerns in May that the pandemic was impacting supplies. Giant pandas eat about 40kg of fresh bamboo a day. Er Shun and Da Mao arrived in Canada in 2014, as part of a 10-year loan from China. They spent the first five years at a Toronto Zoo, where they gave birth birth to two cubs,Jia Panpan and Jia Yueyue. The adult pandas were meant to spend the next five years in Calgary. More vaccines need to be developed in the fight against coronavirus, the World Health Organization's chief scientist has said. Dr Soumya Swaminathan said some vaccines might benefit certain group such as pregnant women or older people more than others, while alternative jabs might give better immunity or be more affordable. She said potential vaccines at relatively early stages of development must continue to be trialled so that there is then ""a choice, a basket of vaccines that we can choose from and be able to target them to different situations in countries with different populations"". This video can not be played Tiffany Pearson-Gills took over the Junction pub in September The landlords of two pubs in an English village that sits on a county border say it makes no sense thatonly one of them can open under coronavirus measures coming into force next week. Groombridge has two pubs, but the Crown Inn is in Kent's tier three and the Junction is in East Sussex's tier two. In tier three, pubs must close apart from offering takeaway or delivery services, but in tier two, they can open as long as they serve substantial meals. Under next week's rules, residents on either side of Groombridge, home to about 1,600 people, should not cross over the county border at a bridge over the River Grom - meaning Kent villagers cannot enjoy the reopening of the East Sussex pub. Steve Harmes, at the Crown, says not being able to open is ""very frustrating"". ""We were not in such a bad position before, but now, being put in this position, it's really hard for us to move forward."" He said even if the tiers were reviewed in December, the pub would not be able to prepare and take advantage of the busy Christmas period. A seven-minute walk away - or 0.4 miles - at the Junction pub, landlady Tiffany Pearson-Gills calls the new rules ""perplexing"". The Crown Inn is in Kent, so will go into tier three next week ""For such a small village... it just doesn't make any sense at all,"" she said. She took over the Junction in September and spent several weeks renovating it but had to put off an opening on 5 November. She said the pub had been fortunate, adding: ""It's great for us, but it doesn't make sense that the Crown up the road cannot [open]. It's just so close, it's a really, really difficult one."" Cardiff city centre has been gearing up for Christmas In Wales, while rules are in place, people can still go to the pub, meet others at a social distance and head out to buy presents. But from 2 December, across the border in England, about 55 million people will be living under strict rules. So what do England's tiers mean for those living and working in Wales? Next Wednesday as the lockdown ends in England, areas will be placed under tiers, from one to three, depending on how high their case rate is. But while the rules do not apply in Wales, the changes over the border could affect your family, work or business over the coming days. We've taken a look at what the changes could mean for you.Read more here.  A further 521 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, the UK government has announced. By this measure, that brings the total number of Covid deaths in the country to 57,551. Meanwhile,the government also reported,externala further 16,022 new cases of the virus in the past 24 hours. More than 1.5 million cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the UK since the epidemic began. Teachers have warned ofa ""collapse"" in secondary school attendanceafter the second wave of the pandemic spread across the UK during autumn. Relatively few pupils have tested positive, but hundreds of thousands have had to learn from home after being required to self-isolate. We have been taking a look at what impact that is having on schools, parents and pupils themselves, as many prepare for exams. Merseyside, for example, has been one of the areas worst-hit in the UK's second wave of the pandemic. And at The Prescot School in Knowsley that has meant a collective 700 days in the classroom lost for the year 11 students preparing for exams in the summer. One student, Ben, told the BBC: ""Year 11 is such a crucial year, you've got exams and mock exams and that's the main thing that's going to set you for life. ""As someone who's self-isolated already, I think it's really stressful to even think about the exams that we've got to do in a few months' time when we've missed out a large chunk of school.""  Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Slopes in ski resorts in Switzerland are already open Across the Alps, countries are agonising over how to control the spread of coronavirus while allowing the winter sports season to begin. Germany has suggestedkeeping all ski resorts closed over the festive season,while Italy would like to wait to open them until mid-January. In Switzerland however, the slopes are already open â despite the country having one of the highest infection rates in Europe. The idea of closing the ski slopes has caused indignation in Switzerland - perhaps especially since closures are being proposed by its bigger European neighbours. The idea is almost as bad, harrumphed one editorial, as joining the EU itself. Switzerlandâs ski resorts seem convinced of their safety measures: masks on all lifts, strict distancing while waiting, and no apres-ski bars. The Swiss government knows the strategy is risky. With everywhere else closed, skiers from across Europe might come to Switzerland, catch the virus, and then take it home â a nightmarish, Europe-wide superspreader event. But there is method in what seems like madness. If the Christmas and New Year ski weeks go safely, Switzerland stands to make a tidy profit while its neighbours are left empty-handed. Now for some news onthe global race to develop and distribute a coronavirus vaccine, to help bring an end to the pandemic. Canada's federal government has said that as many as three million people in the country could be vaccinated by early 2021 - but how this will happen remains unclear. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was criticised this week after he said Canada's pharmaceutical industry is not equipped to produce Covid vaccines domestically. It means Canada will likely have to import the vaccine from the US, and will therefore be second in line. The government has tried to reassure Canadians, noting that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine could be approved by December and that three million people - less than 10% of the population - could be vaccinated by early next year. However, supplies will be limited to begin with, and early vaccines will be distributed to high-priority groups only. Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News According to the governmentâs scientific advisory group, Sage, England's former three-tiered system was not controlling the spread of the virus. That was largely because cases were rising in tier one areas, so it would only be a matter of time before those areas would have to move up a tier. Itâs now expected to work the other way round â with theareas with the tighter restrictions expected to move down a tieras infections decrease. Ministers have promised a review of their tier allocations every two weeks - with the first one expected on 16 December. But some Sage experts have said today that they believe mid-December is too soon to make any significant changes. The next assessment will be after the UK-widerelaxation of measures for the Christmas period, which is likely to see a rise in cases. Depending on how much of a surge there is, itâs likely to be mid-January at the very earliest before significant numbers of regions could be moved to lower tiers - with some possibly even going up one. An eight-year-old boy who wrote to Boris Johnson asking if Santa would be able to visit as usual said he was""shocked"" that the ""busiest man in the country""had replied. Monti, from Cockermouth, Cumbria, asked if the government had ""thought about Santa coming this Christmas"" - and received a reply saying Father Christmas was ""ready and raring to go"". ""In June I heard the pandemic might go on for a long time and it could reach up to Christmas,"" he said. ""I got a bit worried so I wondered if I should write to the prime minister, so I did. ""I asked him if everyone has to put hand sanitiser by the cookies and if he can actually come and keep the Christmas spirit alive. ""If the Christmas spirit isn't kept alive then no one will be happy.""  We've been busy answering questions you have about the restrictions in place - including the end of England's lockdown, and the new tougher tiers. Kevin from Norwichwanted to know whether businesses can reopen on 2 December - or if they have to wait til the following day. The government has confirmed that the new tiers system will âcome into effect from the beginning of Wednesday 2 Decemberâ, marking the end of the lockdown. In all tiers, all non-essential retail, including indoor and outdoor markets and car boot sales, can reopen from Wednesday, but must continue to follow Covid-19 secure guidelines.

Nottingham Trent University students Laura Puttock (left) and Emma de Duve say they are ""absolutely gutted"" Nottinghamshire residents have expressed theirdisappointment at returning to the top tier of England's Covid-19 restrictionswhen the national lockdown ends on Wednesday. The city and county moved into tier three in October, but has seen the rate of positive cases drop since lockdown began. However, the government said rates in Nottinghamremain ""very high"" among those over 60. Nottingham Trent University students Laura Puttock and Emma de Duve said they were ""absolutely gutted"" at the news. ""It's our 21st [birthdays] in December,"" said Laura. ""It's our last year of uni and we thought we could have a last celebration, but now it's going to have to be a takeaway. ""It's hardly the 21st I'd dreamed of. It just feels [as if] we've done our bit, cases are going down, but we're still not seeing any change."" Pat West, 63, from Newark, said she did not understand why the region was still in tier three. ""I'm really disappointed,"" she said. ""My grandchildren can't come round to see me at home. I'm not seeing them grow up."" Read up on the rules in each tier here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played BBC News NI Political Reporter Jayne McCormack explains what the new restrictions mean for people in Northern Ireland New guidance has been issued to help retailers run a click and collect service in a controlled way during NI's two-week circuit breaker. Tougher new Covid-19 restrictions came into force across NI on Friday. Non-essential retailers have been told to close except for click-and-collect services. On Friday morning,a framework setting out how these services can be provided safely was published by the Department for the Economy.,external The department said click and collect facilities will operate ""on an appointment-only basis with maximum mitigations in place"". Economy Minister Diane Dodds said the guidance will ""help business owners and customers ensure they are operating safely and within Northern Ireland legislation"". The framework includes guidance such as: Retailers and customers are encouraged to use on-line ordering and delivery as the first choice for customers Those retailers who do not have an online facility should consider the potential of phoned-in or text ordering Collections are by appointment only and should be scheduled to ensure no customer-customer contact and no queuing Retailers are encouraged to allocate time slots to allow them to manage a reasonable number of people per hour If collection is from a store in a shopping centre, the collection point should be close to the entrance with a one-way system Customers are not permitted to enter stores - the collection should be from the entrance door Collections should be by a designated customer to collect only - there should be no household groups Customers and retailers should encourage where possible pre-payment methods and contactless proof of purchase on collection In other restrictions, cafes and restaurants can only provide a take-away service and close-contact services such as hairdressers and beauty salons have to close. Therestrictions came into force at 00:01 GMT on Friday,externaland will be in place until 00:01 on 11 December. It means Northern Ireland will revert to similar measures introduced in March, with the exception of schools remaining open. Garden centres, supermarkets and homeware stores are exempt from closing under the new regulations. Mrs Dodds has also confirmed that the closing date for applications to Part A and Part B of theCovid Restrictions Business Support Schemehas been extended to 16 December. She said payments to eligible businesses will be extended to cover the latest restrictions agreed by the executive. It is hoped the measures, announced by the Stormont Executive, will help control the spread of coronavirus and bring the reproduction (R) number down ahead of the Christmas period. On Thursday, First Minister Arlene Foster said R number in Northern Ireland was ""just below 1"",but the two-week circuit breaker was ""crucial... so that we can all have the safest and the happiest Christmas possible"". Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was important to reduce the transmission rate to ""as low as possible"" and ""do everything possible to limit the number of people you come into contact with"". NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your Questions Answered The run-up to the festive period is traditionally the busiest time of the year for the businesses affected by the latest lockdown and the decision has been criticised by retailers and the groups which represent them. Lisa and Peter Mahaffey own a gift shop in Bangor, County Down. They extended their opening hours this week to cope with the big rise in customers attempting to beat both the lockdown and the Christmas rush. But they say the new rules over what constitutes essential retail are confusing as a large proportion of the items sold in the shop are homeware. Gift shop owner Peter Mahaffey says there needs to be more clarity on what constitutes essential retail ""All the big retailers like Sainsbury's and Tesco don't close, but they sell the same stuff that we sell. We don't know where we really stand,"" said Mr Mahaffey. He thinks the other main issue is the timing of the move by Stormont. ""They would have been much better closing us at the beginning of November and letting us re-open now with the run-in to Christmas,"" he said. What are the lockdown rules across the UK? Plan for Covid vaccinations to begin in December ""This is our busiest time of the year. The main time is just being taken away from us."" The doors may be closed to customers, but Christmas stock deliveries are still arriving at shops. Jenny Doherty, from a book shop shop in Londonderry, is not sure if online sales will be enough to clear that stock and pay the suppliers. She is not sure yet what the financial hit will be and she said not having customers coming in at this time of year is ""frightening"". She added: ""Books aren't perishable. There will be a plan B, but I do worry."" Florist Penny Hamilton is trialling a click-and-collect service Florist Penny Hamilton is also trialling a click-and-collect service at her east Belfast shop, but is worried it will not suit some of her older customers. ""They are used to coming in and being able to smell all the flowers and see all the colours,"" she said.

"A blood test designed to detect more than 50 types of cancer at an early stage will be trialled by the NHS. More than 165,000 people in England will be offered the tests from next year. If successful, the NHS hopes to expand it to 1m people from 2024. Sir Simon Stevens, NHS England chief executive, said early detection had the potential ""to save many lives"". While some welcomed the pilot, others cautioned the test was still untried and untested. Developing a blood test for cancer has been keeping scientists busy for many years without much success. Making one that's accurate and reliable has proved incredibly complex - the danger is that a test doesn't detect a person's cancer when they do have it, or it indicates someone has cancer when they don't. This test, developed by the Californian firm Grail, is designed to detect molecular changes in the blood caused by cancer in people with no obvious symptoms. As part of a large-scale pilot, also funded by the company, 140,000 participants aged between 50 and 79 will be asked to take the tests for the next three years. Another 25,000 people with possible cancer symptoms will also be offered testing after being referred to hospital in the normal way. Lesley (left) was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at the age of 62 Lesley Maiden was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer seven months after she was first told there was something wrong with her pancreas. Her sister, Sue, says an earlier diagnosis at an earlier stage of the cancer might have given her a better chance. ""I can't say that it would have saved her life - I will never know, but it might have extended her life. ""Maybe she could have had a few years of good, quality life,"" Sue says. Instead, her cancer was too advanced to allow her to be part of a clinical trial and surgery was no longer an option. Lesley died eight months after her diagnosis on Christmas Day 2018, aged 63. The aim is to increase the number of cancers diagnosed at stage one or two, from half to three-quarters by 2028. Tumours in organs such as the pancreas and ovaries are often diagnosed at a late stage, making treatment far more difficult and reducing survival rates. The NHS hopes the blood tests will help increase five-year survival rates for cancer, which are below the levels seen in many other high-income countries. ""This promising blood test could therefore be a game-changer in cancer care, helping thousands more people to get successful treatment,"" Sir Simon said. Cancer Research UK said large research studies of tests were ""essential for determining if they're effective, and a vital step in getting them to patients, if proven to work"". ""All too often, people are diagnosed with cancer at a late stage, when their disease is more difficult to treat,"" said Michelle Mitchell, the charity's chief executive. ""This is a human tragedy, not just in terms of lives lost, but it also means more expensive treatments, hospital stays and monitoring."" But Prof Paul Pharoah, professor of cancer epidemiology, University of Cambridge, said that the NHS ""should not be investing in such a test before it has been adequately evaluated in well-conducted, large-scale clinical trials.""

"This video can not be played Huge crowds gathered at the Casa Rosada in the hope of seeing Diego Maradona's coffin Football legend Diego Maradona has been buried in a private ceremony after a day of emotional scenes in the Argentine capital Buenos Aires. Only around two dozen relatives and close friends attended the final ceremony on Thursday. But earlier huge crowds turned out to pay their respects, with many weeping, blowing kisses and praying as they filed past his coffin. Maradona died of a heart attack on Wednesday aged 60. His death triggered mourning around the world but nowhere was it felt more fiercely than in a country that saw him as a national hero. Maradona dies aged 60 - tributes and reaction Obituary - Argentina's flawed football icon Maradona's coffin - draped in Argentina's national flag and football shirt, bearing his trademark number 10 on the back - was on public display at the presidential palace on Thursday. By mid-afternoon queues stretched back for more than a kilometre, and police clashed with mourners as they tried to close off the palace in anticipation of the wake scheduled for 16:00 local time (19:00 GMT). There were reports of tear gas and rubber bullets being used as officers in riot gear struggled to hold back the crowd. This video can not be played Diego Maradona ""will live in our heart forever"" One well-wisher, RubÃ©n HernÃ¡ndez, thought the police had overreacted. ""We were calm lining up and suddenly, the police started to fire rubber bullets,"" he said, quoted by Reuters news agency. ""Crazy, I just want to say goodbye to Diego."" Maradona: A flawed hero on (and off) the pitch An extraordinary life in pictures Authorities were eventually forced to stop public viewing of the coffin to keep the peace. The motorised funeral cortege drove his body to the Bella Vista cemetery on the outskirts of the city, where he was buried next to the graves of his parents. The atmosphere varied greatly outside the presidential palace. Those waiting to go in were singing and chanting. ""If you don't jump, you're English,"" is one of the favourite chants of Argentinians about the 1986 match with England and THAT goal - the Hand of God - something many here saw as a sort of payback after the Falklands War, known here as the Malvinas. But on the other side of the square, there was another line with those coming out, many wiping away tears or hugging each other after processing what had happened. This wasn't just the death of Argentina's superstar footballer, but the passing of a man that many saw as a national icon, a star who made Argentina famous - and most of all, a very human role-model who Argentinians loved, flaws and all. A man who was respected for achieving so much, yet never forgetting his roots. At the Italian club Napoli, where Maradona played for seven years and transformed their fortunes, fans flocked to the stadium to pay their respects chanting ""Diego, Diego!"". It is the second day people have defied a coronavirus lockdown to pay tribute, ahead of Napoli's closed-door Europa League fixture against the Croatian team Rijeka. The Napoli team, who all stepped onto the pitch wearing black armbands and Maradona's No. 10 jersey, won the match 2-0. Argentine police struggled to control the crowds as they queued to see the coffin Some fans clapped, others wept, as they filed past Maradona's coffin ""He was unique, he represented everything, everything for us Neapolitans,"" fan Gianni Autiero told Reuters. ""I have cried for only a few people in my life, and Diego is one of them."" World mourns Argentine football legend Maradona One of the greatest football players of all time, Maradona had a troubled personal life marked by cocaine and alcohol addiction. He had successful surgery on a brain blood clot earlier in November and was to be treated for alcohol dependency. Local media said the preliminary results of an autopsy showed he had suffered ""acute heart failure"". This video can not be played Watch all of Maradona's World Cup goals The former Argentina attacking midfielder and manager died at his home in Tigre, near Buenos Aires. The last person to see Maradona alive was his nephew Johnny Esposito, according to statements gathered by officials. Maradona is survived by five children and his former wife, 58-year-old Claudia Villafane, whom he split with in 2004 after 20 years of marriage. After news of his death emerged, at 22:00 on Wednesday (01:00 GMT) - an hour chosen to match the number on his shirt - stadiums across Argentina switched on their floodlights to honour his memory. Fans flocked to La Bombonera, Boca Juniors' stadium in Buenos Aires, where many were in tears. Maradona was also revered in the Italian city of Naples, where he played club football for seven years Maradona, who also played for Barcelona, was captain of the national team when Argentina won the 1986 World Cup, scoring the famous ""Hand of God"" goal against England in the quarter-finals. To score the goal, Maradona used his hand to deflect the ball past England goalkeeper Peter Shilton, but the referee did not see it. It remains one of the most controversial World Cup moments. Former Tottenham midfielder Ossie Ardiles, who played alongside Maradona at the 1982 World Cup, told the BBC ""he will be remembered as a genius in football"". Argentina and Barcelona forward Lionel Messi also paid tribute,writing on social media,external: ""He has left us but he will never leave us because Diego is eternal."" Former England striker and Match of the Day host Gary Lineker, who was part of the England team beaten by Argentina at the 1986 World Cup, said Maradona was ""by some distance, the best player of my generation and arguably the greatest of all time"". In a statement on social media, the Argentine Football Association expressed ""its deepest sorrow for the death of our legend"", adding: ""You will always be in our hearts.""

"The UK's estimated coronavirus R number has fallen to between 0.9 and 1 for the first time since mid-August - so the epidemic is no longer though to be growing UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended the ""simplicity and clarity"" of tier allocations for Covid rules in England The government says it will publish an impact assessment before MPs get a chance to vote on the new rules on Tuesday If 40 Tory backbenchers rebel, the PM may need Labour's help in winning the vote Labour is expected to decide next week whether to back the plans, after consulting Covid experts Fresh curbs on hospitality and entertainment venues will be brought in across Wales from next Friday UK high street retailer Arcadia is understood to be on the verge of collapse, with the firm saying the pandemic has had a ""material impact"" on trading Fans in Italy have defied lockdown rules by gathering at Napoli stadium for a second day, to mark the death of football legend Diego Maradona There have been more than 60 million coronavirus cases and 1.4 million deaths across the globe, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Rob Corp and Alice Evans We are ending our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for the day, so thank you for joining us. Friday's coverage has been brought to you by: Joseph Lee, Katie Wright, Lauren Turner, Robin Levinson King, Alice Evans and Rob Corp. Here are some of the main UK stories from today.    Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen found the plight of mink farmers overwhelming Here's a quick recap of some of the coronavirus headlines from around the world today. The announcement of the new coronavirus restrictions for England, which will come into force from 2 December, has prompted questions and concerns from business owners and families. ""They have changed the rules in the middle of the game,"" says Amanda Thompson, managing director of amusement park Blackpool Pleasure Beach in Lancashire, which will go into the toughest tier of measures - tier three. Amanda has been trying to work out how she will make it to Christmas. ""I had a pantomime due to start next week, a dinner show due to begin, a lot of people who have been unemployed all year because they are performers unable to perform."" The visitor attraction, which is almost 125 years old, has survived two world wars only to be bought to a ""grinding halt"" this year. ""Without Blackpool Pleasure Beach there is no Blackpool. Perhaps people don't find it interesting in London but it is of interest to the millions of people who come here."" While the resort had been operating in a Covid-secure way over the summer, Amanda says it will now be closed until next year unless restrictions are relaxed. ""Â£250,000 of cancellations came in yesterday,"" she adds. Read more about how others are coming to terms with the new measures.  Jayne Nash is part of the team which has taken over the Never Say Die pub Why, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, would anybody decide to take over a pub? ""Crazy? We probably are,"" says Jayne Nash, from the village of Jaywick, on the Essex coast. ""But it was an opportunity we couldn't miss."" For years, she has been a regular at the Never Say Die, which sits 20m (60ft) from the beach. But now she is on the other side of the bar, as part of a team that reopened the ""community pub"" on 1 August, supported initially by grants from a number of organisations. ""We had a week to get going. It was all hands on deck,"" says Jayne. ""It was brilliant."" Takings reached about Â£1,000 per night, but within weeks of reopening, the team received the worst possible news in the form of a second lockdown. However, Jayne remains positive about the pub's future. ""We want to make it grow,"" she says. ""We've had so many volunteers come forward since we started. People know what we're doing and they want to help."" Read the full story here. Black Friday started earlier this year asUK shoppers turned to online services during the pandemic. The number of parcels being delivered started increasing sharply from the end of October. By last week, it had already surpassed last year's post-Black Friday peak, according to new data. Metapack, which acts as a go-between for retailers and couriers, said parcel volumes were already up by 70% this week, compared with the same week last year. In a normal year, retailers would expect the week in which Black Friday falls to be the most profitable of the year. But sales were already up by between 50 and 60% in each of the first three weeks of November, according to IMRG, which collects data from online retailing companies. Hundreds of people in England have beenwrongly told they have coronavirus by NHS Test and Traceafter a ""laboratory error"". More than 1,300 people who gave samples between 19 and 23 November received positive results, when the tests were actually void. All of those affected will be told to take another test, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said. Duncan Larcombe, said his two children, aged 14 and nine, were both sent home from school to self-isolate and he was unable to work. His 14-year-old daughter who tested positive ""had not left her bedroom"" for four days, with meals being left outside her door, until learning the result was void on Thursday. ""We were taking it very seriously,"" he said. DHSC said it was an ""isolated incident"" caused by an ""issue with a batch of testing chemicals"" which had affected tests taken across the UK. Shaimaa KhalilAustralia correspondent Matt Lanigan says the lockdown was ""pretty grim"" Melbourne's second lockdown, which began in July, went on to become one of the longest and strictest in the world until it ended last month. ""The streets were completely deserted. It was like something out of [post-apocalyptic film] Mad Max,"" says Matt Lanigan, who owns a cafe on Chapel St, the city's iconic shopping strip. ""It was brutal,"" Matt says of trying keep his business afloat. ""It was like I was in a boxing match and I just got knocked to the floor. For a moment there, I felt like maybe it wasn't worth getting up."" But things are slowly turning around. Earlier today, Melbourne and the state of Victoria reported the 28th consecutive day with no new infections. After seeing daily cases soar above 700 in July and August,the city is seen as an example for the rest of the world on how to handle a second outbreak. Melbourne's Chapel St is buzzing again Now on reopened Chapel St, music and chatter fill the air as people enjoy their Sunday brunches. But despite the high spirits, everywhere you look there are signs of how battered this city has been. Many businesses are still shut, and others are open but half empty. Matt says the real economic and mental health toll will become clearer in the months to come, especially when government wage subsidy schemes end. Er Shun, above, and Da Mao spent time at Toronto Zoo before being sent to Calgary A Canadian zoo is sending two pandas back to their previous home in China due to a bamboo shortage caused by the pandemic. The Calgary Zoo had hoped to return Er Shun and Da Mao earlier, as bamboo
 supplies dwindled, but there were significant delays in obtaining the 
permits to ship them home. ""Today is the day!"" the zoo posted on Facebook on Friday. The zoo had raised concerns in May that the pandemic was impacting supplies. Giant pandas eat about 40kg of fresh bamboo a day. Er Shun and Da Mao arrived in Canada in 2014, as part of a 10-year loan from China. They spent the first five years at a Toronto Zoo, where they gave birth birth to two cubs,Jia Panpan and Jia Yueyue. The adult pandas were meant to spend the next five years in Calgary. More vaccines need to be developed in the fight against coronavirus, the World Health Organization's chief scientist has said. Dr Soumya Swaminathan said some vaccines might benefit certain group such as pregnant women or older people more than others, while alternative jabs might give better immunity or be more affordable. She said potential vaccines at relatively early stages of development must continue to be trialled so that there is then ""a choice, a basket of vaccines that we can choose from and be able to target them to different situations in countries with different populations"". This video can not be played Tiffany Pearson-Gills took over the Junction pub in September The landlords of two pubs in an English village that sits on a county border say it makes no sense thatonly one of them can open under coronavirus measures coming into force next week. Groombridge has two pubs, but the Crown Inn is in Kent's tier three and the Junction is in East Sussex's tier two. In tier three, pubs must close apart from offering takeaway or delivery services, but in tier two, they can open as long as they serve substantial meals. Under next week's rules, residents on either side of Groombridge, home to about 1,600 people, should not cross over the county border at a bridge over the River Grom - meaning Kent villagers cannot enjoy the reopening of the East Sussex pub. Steve Harmes, at the Crown, says not being able to open is ""very frustrating"". ""We were not in such a bad position before, but now, being put in this position, it's really hard for us to move forward."" He said even if the tiers were reviewed in December, the pub would not be able to prepare and take advantage of the busy Christmas period. A seven-minute walk away - or 0.4 miles - at the Junction pub, landlady Tiffany Pearson-Gills calls the new rules ""perplexing"". The Crown Inn is in Kent, so will go into tier three next week ""For such a small village... it just doesn't make any sense at all,"" she said. She took over the Junction in September and spent several weeks renovating it but had to put off an opening on 5 November. She said the pub had been fortunate, adding: ""It's great for us, but it doesn't make sense that the Crown up the road cannot [open]. It's just so close, it's a really, really difficult one."" Cardiff city centre has been gearing up for Christmas In Wales, while rules are in place, people can still go to the pub, meet others at a social distance and head out to buy presents. But from 2 December, across the border in England, about 55 million people will be living under strict rules. So what do England's tiers mean for those living and working in Wales? Next Wednesday as the lockdown ends in England, areas will be placed under tiers, from one to three, depending on how high their case rate is. But while the rules do not apply in Wales, the changes over the border could affect your family, work or business over the coming days. We've taken a look at what the changes could mean for you.Read more here.  A further 521 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, the UK government has announced. By this measure, that brings the total number of Covid deaths in the country to 57,551. Meanwhile,the government also reported,externala further 16,022 new cases of the virus in the past 24 hours. More than 1.5 million cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the UK since the epidemic began. Teachers have warned ofa ""collapse"" in secondary school attendanceafter the second wave of the pandemic spread across the UK during autumn. Relatively few pupils have tested positive, but hundreds of thousands have had to learn from home after being required to self-isolate. We have been taking a look at what impact that is having on schools, parents and pupils themselves, as many prepare for exams. Merseyside, for example, has been one of the areas worst-hit in the UK's second wave of the pandemic. And at The Prescot School in Knowsley that has meant a collective 700 days in the classroom lost for the year 11 students preparing for exams in the summer. One student, Ben, told the BBC: ""Year 11 is such a crucial year, you've got exams and mock exams and that's the main thing that's going to set you for life. ""As someone who's self-isolated already, I think it's really stressful to even think about the exams that we've got to do in a few months' time when we've missed out a large chunk of school.""  Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Slopes in ski resorts in Switzerland are already open Across the Alps, countries are agonising over how to control the spread of coronavirus while allowing the winter sports season to begin. Germany has suggestedkeeping all ski resorts closed over the festive season,while Italy would like to wait to open them until mid-January. In Switzerland however, the slopes are already open â despite the country having one of the highest infection rates in Europe. The idea of closing the ski slopes has caused indignation in Switzerland - perhaps especially since closures are being proposed by its bigger European neighbours. The idea is almost as bad, harrumphed one editorial, as joining the EU itself. Switzerlandâs ski resorts seem convinced of their safety measures: masks on all lifts, strict distancing while waiting, and no apres-ski bars. The Swiss government knows the strategy is risky. With everywhere else closed, skiers from across Europe might come to Switzerland, catch the virus, and then take it home â a nightmarish, Europe-wide superspreader event. But there is method in what seems like madness. If the Christmas and New Year ski weeks go safely, Switzerland stands to make a tidy profit while its neighbours are left empty-handed. Now for some news onthe global race to develop and distribute a coronavirus vaccine, to help bring an end to the pandemic. Canada's federal government has said that as many as three million people in the country could be vaccinated by early 2021 - but how this will happen remains unclear. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was criticised this week after he said Canada's pharmaceutical industry is not equipped to produce Covid vaccines domestically. It means Canada will likely have to import the vaccine from the US, and will therefore be second in line. The government has tried to reassure Canadians, noting that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine could be approved by December and that three million people - less than 10% of the population - could be vaccinated by early next year. However, supplies will be limited to begin with, and early vaccines will be distributed to high-priority groups only. Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News According to the governmentâs scientific advisory group, Sage, England's former three-tiered system was not controlling the spread of the virus. That was largely because cases were rising in tier one areas, so it would only be a matter of time before those areas would have to move up a tier. Itâs now expected to work the other way round â with theareas with the tighter restrictions expected to move down a tieras infections decrease. Ministers have promised a review of their tier allocations every two weeks - with the first one expected on 16 December. But some Sage experts have said today that they believe mid-December is too soon to make any significant changes. The next assessment will be after the UK-widerelaxation of measures for the Christmas period, which is likely to see a rise in cases. Depending on how much of a surge there is, itâs likely to be mid-January at the very earliest before significant numbers of regions could be moved to lower tiers - with some possibly even going up one. An eight-year-old boy who wrote to Boris Johnson asking if Santa would be able to visit as usual said he was""shocked"" that the ""busiest man in the country""had replied. Monti, from Cockermouth, Cumbria, asked if the government had ""thought about Santa coming this Christmas"" - and received a reply saying Father Christmas was ""ready and raring to go"". ""In June I heard the pandemic might go on for a long time and it could reach up to Christmas,"" he said. ""I got a bit worried so I wondered if I should write to the prime minister, so I did. ""I asked him if everyone has to put hand sanitiser by the cookies and if he can actually come and keep the Christmas spirit alive. ""If the Christmas spirit isn't kept alive then no one will be happy.""  We've been busy answering questions you have about the restrictions in place - including the end of England's lockdown, and the new tougher tiers. Kevin from Norwichwanted to know whether businesses can reopen on 2 December - or if they have to wait til the following day. The government has confirmed that the new tiers system will âcome into effect from the beginning of Wednesday 2 Decemberâ, marking the end of the lockdown. In all tiers, all non-essential retail, including indoor and outdoor markets and car boot sales, can reopen from Wednesday, but must continue to follow Covid-19 secure guidelines. Read other questions we have answered here- you can also submit your own. Nottingham Trent University students Laura Puttock (left) and Emma de Duve say they are ""absolutely gutted"" Nottinghamshire residents have expressed theirdisappointment at returning to the top tier of England's Covid-19 restrictionswhen the national lockdown ends on Wednesday. The city and county moved into tier three in October, but has seen the rate of positive cases drop since lockdown began. However, the government said rates in Nottinghamremain ""very high"" among those over 60. Nottingham Trent University students Laura Puttock and Emma de Duve said they were ""absolutely gutted"" at the news. ""It's our 21st [birthdays] in December,"" said Laura. ""It's our last year of uni and we thought we could have a last celebration, but now it's going to have to be a takeaway. ""It's hardly the 21st I'd dreamed of. It just feels [as if] we've done our bit, cases are going down, but we're still not seeing any change."" Pat West, 63, from Newark, said she did not understand why the region was still in tier three. ""I'm really disappointed,"" she said. ""My grandchildren can't come round to see me at home. I'm not seeing them grow up."" Read up on the rules in each tier here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Some big High Street names have decided to shun the Black Friday shopping bonanza even though online spending in the UK is set to soar. Next, M&S, Wilko and B&M will not be taking part in the sales event on Friday, which is seen as a key trading day in the run-up to Christmas. Several retailers told the BBC they were focussed on offering good value all-year round instead. Many shoppers use the annual event to buy discounted Christmas gifts. More than two-thirds of shoppers have delayed a purchase to try to find a bargain in the sale, according to research by Lloyds Bank. It expects Black Friday spending in the UK to jump to Â£750m this year. Last year, it totalled Â£718m, although drawing annual comparisons is difficult as the event covers more days and more shops take part. But retailer Next has confirmed it will not participate.The decision comes after it reportedthat in-store sales have been badly affected by the pandemic and are about half of what they were by this time in 2019. Despite the fact Next was a late adopter of Black Friday, previous sales saw bargain hunters queue up early in the morning for heavily discounted clothes, homeware and furniture. Most Black Friday products 'were same price or cheaper' beforehand Why bots will beat you to in-demand gifts Black Friday emissions boom predicted High Street stalwart Marks & Spencer has also decided not to take part. A spokesperson told the BBC that it had not offered any ""specific Black Friday deals"" for the last few years, and that there were no plans to change that. ""We focus on offering great value and deals throughout the whole festive season,"" M&S said. The festive period will be crucial for the firm off the back of a difficult year, during which it reported thefirst loss in its history as a publicly traded companyand was forced to announce 7,000 job cuts across stores and management. Although sales of clothes and homeware slid during the six months to 26 September, its boss Steve Rowe has said that M&S was in a ""much better position"" in the run-up to Christmas. The Wilko homeware chain also said there would be ""no specific Black Friday activity"", and that it offered ""great value products at great prices every day"". Discount chain B&M said that selling products at a lower price point throughout the festive trading period instead ""avoids excessive crowds on any one day"". They added that Black Friday shoppers are often ""chasing largely deceptive offers that do not represent real savings, or are only available in very limited stocks"". Consumer group Which? urged consumers to ""do some research"" to find genuine bargains Consumer group Which? recently found thatnearly nine in 10 products sold on Black Friday are available for the same price or cheaper earlier in the year. It urged consumers to ""do some research"", which may include using websites to check previous prices, in order to spot genuine bargains during the sales. The shopping bonanza, imported from the US, now sees shops advertising price cuts several days before the Friday after the Thanksgiving holiday. Brands such as Jigsaw had previously pledged not to take part, opting for end-of-season sales instead. But in 2018, it launched its first Black Friday sale, saying that the ""economic, political and retail landscapes have changed dramatically."" Up-market fashion chain Jigsaw previously shunned Black Friday but now takes part But retail expert Kate Hardcastle told the BBC it ""makes good sense"" for retailers to shift away from the extended event. ""[Black Friday] creates a challenging retail calendar for a lot of shops"", with many customers now expecting discounts throughout the year as a matter of course. Although some sales might be lost, she said: ""Brands need to remember it's not just a race to the bottom on price and use it as an opportunity to shift attention elsewhere."" Companies such as clothing brand Baukjen, for example, is giving the profits made during the ""Black Friday weekend"" to charity, while footwear firm Allbirds will raise prices by Â£1 across all of its products and donate those proceeds. Although many firms have been struggling with job losses, subdued sales and lockdowns in the face of the pandemic, Ms Hardcastle suggests this is a ""key moment"" for brands to make sure they are not just associated with discounts.

"Greater Manchester faced new Covid restrictions in October, like many areas of the UK Some 842 British employers told government of plans to cut 20 or more jobs last month, as growing uncertainty about the pandemic and the government response hit business confidence. That's more than any month on record before the Covid outbreak began, and almost two-and-a-half times the level seen in October last year. In total they are putting 51,000 jobs at risk, over double the 2019 number. The data was released to the BBC after a Freedom of Information request. Though high compared to normal years, the October figures are lower than the exceptional peaks caused by the pandemic in June, July and September. October saw rapidly rising levels of Covid-19 infections, with restrictions introduced in many parts of the UK, culminating in an England-wide lockdown announced at the end of the month. ""These figures show us that many businesses were planning lots of job losses back in October because they were very worried and concerned about the evolving economic situation, and how that would unfold over the winter,"" said Rebecca McDonald, senior economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation think-tank. Pret a Manger, the pub and brewing groups Greene King and Marston's, and Manchester Airport were among the employers to announce redundancy plans. The government's job support measures evolved rapidly as the virus spread. Businesses had expected the furlough scheme, which pays 80% of an employee's wages, to end on 31 October, with little certainty about what would replace it. Reaching more than 9 million people at its peak, the scheme helped to prevent a much bigger surge in unemployment. Fears about the end of furlough may help to explain the exceptionally high levels of redundancies seen in the summer. On 24 September, the less generousJob Support Schemewas announced to replace furlough. It was expanded on 9 October, and expanded again on 22 October. Then on 31 October, the day it was due to end, the furlough scheme was extended for a month. On 5 November it was extended again until the end of March. ""I think that the messy and last-minute approach that the chancellor took to his announcements in the autumn, especially about job support packages, will have contributed to the lack of certainty and unfortunately will have cost jobs,"" Ms McDonald said. The government did not reply to a BBC request for comment. The curtain never went up on the 16 March performance of Phantom of the Opera in London's West End. Laurie Kirkby, head of sound on the show for ten years, came to work as usual at 5pm. That evening the Prime Minister announced the start of the lockdown, and the cast and crew were all sent home. ""That was the last day's work we did,"" he says. They were furloughed for a few months, but by the end of October everyone had been made redundant. Theatre people know it can be an insecure job, but no-one was prepared for the entire live events industry to shut for months on end. ""I do lots of different things, but it's all in live events, so trying to diversify when you can't use any of your skills anywhere, is really difficult. ""It's hard to get work because there are so many people who are unemployed. So it has affected me greatly, as it has millions of other people."" Laurie's wife, a dance teacher, has still been able to work, and her clients have been very supportive. So the family of four still has her income to rely on. With no need for two cars, one has been sold. ""There won't be holidays, Christmas will be a little more economic."" He's staying positive, doing some online courses and tackling the maintenance backlog that comes with living in an old house. But it's not easy. ""It affects your mental health because you forget what your career is, you forget what you used to do. I have not been in a theatre or done a live event since March now. It's a really strange feeling. ""You have to keep yourself focused, because if you think too hard about itâ¦ it can be damaging."" Phantom of the Opera closed after nearly 34 years on the West End Companies planning to make 20 or more redundancies have to notify the Insolvency Service at the start of the process, via an HR1 Advance Notice of Redundancy form. The total number of planned redundancies will be higher than the figures compiled by the Insolvency service, as firms cutting fewer than 20 posts don't have to notify government. However, employers often find ways to make fewer redundancies than they initially plan. This data gives an early indication of how many firms are considering cutting staff, before the numbers from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) pick up any change. For the period from July to September, ONS redundancy figures saw a record quarterly increase of 181,000 to reach a record high of 314,000. This confirms the summer spike in redundancy plans detailed in previous BBC reporting. Employers in Northern Ireland file HR1 forms with the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, and they are not included in these figures.

"This video can not be played Parents are torn over early Christmas school closures Schools must be closed early ahead of the festive break to help children and teachers avoid having to self-isolate on Christmas Day, a union has warned. The UCAC teaching union said coronavirus cases in schools could force whole class ""bubbles"" into self-isolation over the holidays. The union said schools should close on 11 December and move lessons online. First Minister Mark Drakeford said there were no plans to close schools early. In a letter to Education Minister Kirsty Williams, the union said there were ""serious concerns"" among UCAC members ""that pupils and students will continue to attend an educational setting a week before Christmas Day"". Most schools are due to break up in the week starting 14 December, but if positive cases are found in pupils' class bubbles, children would have to self-isolate for two weeks, meaning some may have to isolate on Christmas Day. ""If a pupil or student tested positive with Covid-19 during the last week of term, it would mean that the whole bubble would have to self-isolate, preventing them from joining their extended family for Christmas,"" General Secretary Dilwyn Roberts-Young said in the letter. ""The same could be true for the education workforce. ""In addition, Test, Trace and Protect could continue to contact school and colleges leaders on Christmas Day, which is totally unacceptable."" The union said that closing schools early would give families ""greater reassurance"" that they could get together to celebrate during the five day Christmas travel rules. ""We are acutely aware of the need to ensure continuity of learning for all pupils and students in Wales, particularly in the wake of the disruption earlier in the year, which has continued to some extent since September,"" the letter said. ""We believe that making an early announcement on this would not only allow the workforce to prepare thoroughly for that week, but also enable families to make alternative childcare arrangements as needed."" Christmas Covid rules 'not an instruction to meet up' Tighter Covid restrictions in Wales before Christmas considered Masks compulsory in Welsh schools communal areas It said a survey of members prompted a thousand responses with 75% in favour of online learning in the final week of term. The union has also asked the minister to consider an alternative or parallel move to offer Covid tests to staff members once contact with pupils and students has come to an end, from 18 December onwards. Some local authorities are also believed to be in favour of closing school sites a week early, though provision for children of key workers and vulnerable children would be one potential concern. The latest Public Health Wales figures show that 50.3% of primary schools and 87.9% of secondary schools have had at least one Covid-19 case since the start of term. There were 414 positive tests amongst school pupils or staff in the week up to 25 November. Face masks are now compulsory in communal areas in schools across Wales However Mr Drakeford said he had ""no intention"" in allowing schools to close early. ""We will do everything we can to keep our schools working up until Christmas,"" he said during the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing on Friday. ""We'll do that alongside the unions, the head teachers and the local education authorities. ""It is more important for our children not to miss out further on the education planned for them for the whole of the rest of this term. That's what we will be working to achieve.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson addresses criticism of ""tough"" tiers plan Boris Johnson has defended his decision to place 55 million people in England into the two highest tiers of Covid restrictions, arguing the country needs ""simplicity and clarity"". The PM said measures due to come in when lockdown ends on Wednesday were more ""relaxed"" but would ""drive"" Covid down until a vaccine is available. But a group of Tory MPs is threatening to rebel in a Commons vote on Tuesday. If Labour backs them, this could threaten the government's majority. There is concern that the government is adopting a ""one-size-fits all"" approach, which does not reflect local levels of infection. Almost all of England facing tough virus rules Postcode check - what is my tier? Tiers and Christmas - a recipe for disaster? From Wednesday, more than 32 million people are due to be living under tier two restrictions, banning indoor meetings between households. A further 23 million people would be placed under the highest - tier three - restrictions, which further limit contact between people outdoors. Just over 1% of England's population would enter the lowest - tier one - restrictions, under which the ""rule of six"" applies both indoors and outdoors. Conservative MP and former cabinet minister Damian Green, who represents Ashford, in Kent, which is set to go into tier three, told the BBC he would vote against the government unless it provided ""new and convincing evidence"". ""Instead of having these wide county-based areas, where people are put in tiers, then we should do it on a borough basis,"" he said. ""In an area like mine, the incidence is less than it is in Liverpool, which has just been released down into tier two. So, as it stands, the current policy, the current allocation of tiers on these wide bases, are just not evidence-based."" This video can not be played How you and your family can celebrate Christmas and minimise the spread of coronavirus Speaking on a visit to Public Health England laboratories, at Porton Down, Wiltshire, Mr Johnson said he understood the ""frustration"" of those in higher-tier areas, whose own town or village did not have high levels of the disease. But he added that the government ""cannot divide the country up into loads and loads of very complicated sub-divisions"" and had to ensure ""some simplicity and clarity"". ""Unless you beat the problem in the high-incidence area, the low-incidence area, I'm afraid, starts to catch up,"" Mr Johnson said. He said ""tough tiering"" was still more ""relaxed by a long way than the current lockdown measures"" and it would ""drive the disease down... until a vaccine comes on stream, which we hope will be over the next weeks and months"". Asked about mass Covid testing, Mr Johnson said: ""The supply [of kits] I don't think is going to be the problem. The issue is going to be getting everybody mobilised to understand the potential advantage of [it]."" Aware of the disquiet on its own backbenches, the government has promised to publish impact assessments of the new restrictions; a key demand from concerned MPs. There's also a suggestion that areas could move into lower tiers when numbers are reviewed at regular intervals. But that's unlikely to see off the brewing Tory rebellion. Some Conservatives have already publicly declared that they won't vote for the new tier system when it's put before the Commons next week. If enough rebel the government might have to look to the opposition to get this through Parliament. Sir Keir Starmer is still deciding whether his party will back the plan, although it is likely to have enough support overall. However, it's not a good look for the government to have to rely on Labour in the face of unrest on its own benches. The Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs, set up to scrutinise the government's response to the pandemic, is threatening a revolt in next Tuesday's vote. The group's chair, Mark Harper, said evidence provided by the government to justify the tier system was not ""compelling"". He called for more information on the measures' effects on different sectors of the economy. He added that on ""too many occasions, ministers have made arguments and they've not stacked up"". Deputy chairman Steve Baker called the measures ""truly appalling"" and said the modelling used by government scientists had been ""wrong time and time again"". The group claims to have 70 members, but it is not certain how many of them would be expected to rebel against the government. This video can not be played The BBC's Laura Foster explains the new three tier system for England. Forty-three Conservatives would have to defy the prime minister to defeat the plan, if all opposition MPs also voted against. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is expected to decide early next week whether to support Mr Johnson, after consulting government coronavirus experts. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Labour was ""not against"" tougher restrictions or tiers, but would seek ""reassurances"" on support for the poor and vulnerable. MASS TESTING:Where is it available? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Under the government's plan, Kent and large parts of the Midlands, north-east and north-west England would go into tier three. Only Cornwall, the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight would be in tier one. Mr Johnson said the government's planned ""review point"" - on 16 December - gave the ""prospect of areas being able to move down the tier scale"". But Professor John Edmunds, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said he could not imagine ""huge changes"" to restrictions by then. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that experts were unlikely to ""have accumulated much data"" in time. The government has promised to publish an impact assessment before MPs vote on the new rules.

"This video can not be played President Trump once again alleged ""massive fraud"" without evidence to reporters on Thanksgiving Donald Trump has said he will leave the White House if Joe Biden is formally confirmed as the next US president. Answering reporters' questions for the first time since losing the 3 November vote, Mr Trump insisted, however, that ""this race is far from over"". He has refused to concede, citing unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. Individual states are currently certifying their results, after Mr Biden was projected as the winner with an unassailable lead. The Democrat leads Mr Trump 306 votes to 232 under the electoral college system that is used to pick US presidents. The tally is far more than the 270 needed to win, and Mr Biden also leads the popular vote by more than six million. Electors will meet to formalise the result on 14 December, with Mr Biden due to be sworn in as president on 20 January. What is the presidential transition? A simple guide to the electoral college What Biden's new foreign policy team tells us The president and his supporters have lodged a number of legal challenges over the election, but most have been dismissed. Earlier this week, Mr Trump finally agreed to allow the formal transition to President-elect Biden's team to begin, following several weeks of uncertainty. The decision means Mr Biden is able to receive top security briefings and access key government officials and millions of dollars in funds as he prepares to take over. Following a video call with military personnel on the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, Mr Trump faced questions from reporters at the White House. Mr Trump spoke with members of the US military - at home and abroad - via video link for the Thanksgiving holiday He was asked whether he would agree to leave the White House if he lost the electoral college vote. ""Certainly I will, certainly I will and you know that,"" he said. However, the president went on to say that ""if they do [elect Joe Biden], they made a mistake"", and suggested he may never accept defeat. ""It's going to be a very hard thing to concede because we know there was massive fraud,"" he said, an allegation he has stood by without offering proof. It is not a requirement for Mr Trump to concede in order for Mr Biden to be sworn in as the 46th US president. What do we know about Trump's legal challenges? Fact-checking Trump team's main fraud claims Mr Trump did not say whether he would run for president again in 2024, or whether he would attend Mr Biden's inauguration. The normally routine process of transitioning from one president to another and confirming the result has been derailed by President Trump's refusal to concede. Under the US electoral system, voters do not directly choose the next president. Instead, they vote for 538 officials, who are allocated to American states based on their population size. This video can not be played Explaining the Electoral College and which voters will decide who wins The electors almost always vote for the candidate who won the most votes in their states, and although it is possible for some to disregard the voters' pick, no result has ever been changed this way. Mr Trump also said that he was planning to hold a rally in Georgia on Saturday in support of two Republicans in key runoff elections that will decide which party controls the Senate. The elections in Georgia are due to be held on 5 January. The president-elect celebrated a quiet Thanksgiving on Thursday, as coronavirus cases in the US continue to rise. ""This year, our turkey will be smaller and the clatter of cooking a little quieter,""Mr Biden and his wife Jill said in an op-ed published by CNN,external. ""Like millions of Americans, we are temporarily letting go of the traditions we can't do safely. ""It is not a small sacrifice. These moments with our loved ones - time that's lost - can't be returned. Yet, we know it's the price of protecting each other and one we don't pay alone."" This video can not be played ""We're at war with a virus, not with one another"": President-elect Biden calls on Americans to unite against Covid-19 Earlier this week, Mr Biden urged Americans to hold smaller celebrations, saying: ""I know that we can and will beat this virus."" He has said that tackling the pandemic will be his main priority when he takes office. Mr Biden has already nominated a number of top officialsfor when he takes over and said that co-operation from the White House over the transition had been ""sincere"". Speaking in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, on Wednesday, he said that the US ""won't stand"" for any attempt to derail the election. Americans ""have full and fair and free elections, and then we honour the results,"" he said. Trump accepts transition to Biden must begin Why does US presidential transition matter?

"Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said 2020 cannot be a normal Christmas People should limit their contact with others before Covid-19 restrictions are relaxed at Christmas, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has said. Across the UK,three households can mix for five daysfrom 23-27 December. However, Ms O'Neill said it was important to reduce Covid-19 transmission ""as low as possible"". First Minister Arlene Foster said the next two weeks ""are crucial... so that we can all have the safest and the happiest Christmas possible"". From midnight, Northern Ireland enters a two-week circuit breaker, with the closure of many businesses in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors. NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your Questions Answered How many people can get together at Christmas? The deputy first minister also said a ""number of things need clarified"" around Christmas arrangements which will be the focus of the executive's meeting on Tuesday. She said these included care home arrangements, students coming home and the definition of a household. ""There is a different in approach across all the jurisdictions in terms of, for example, what a household looks like and it's important that we define that for ourselves,"" the deputy first minister added. In Scotland, a three household bubble should contain no more than eight people over the age of 11. Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill gave a briefing at Stomont after the executive meeting on Thursday The executive also announced that a Covid-19 Taskforce was being establishedto oversee the roll-out of the vaccine and testing programmes. The deputy first minister said it will be chaired by a new interim head of the Civil Service and will also be responsible for public messaging to improve compliance. Mrs Foster said therate of transmissionwas currently believed to be ""just below 1"". She said she commended ""all those who are re-doubling their efforts to make our high street as Covid secure as possible for their reopening on 11 December"". ""I want to pay tribute to our scientists, our academics, medics and health workers who are providing us with the pathways out of this pandemic through mass vaccination and testing programmes,"" she continued. The broadcast press conferences from Stormont that follow executive meetings have understandably often been sombre occasions. The news of daily deaths and increased hospital admissions bring home the reality of Covid-19. The news that many families are suffering shows that eight months on, we are still struggling with this pandemic. Whilst this is bleak and painful, today's press conference did offer some shades of light for the future. The news of a vaccination programme offers hope that could save lives and end talk of lockdown and restrictions. There was also news that Northern Ireland'sR valueis just below one - lower than England and Wales. The first and deputy first ministers also offered some hope to the hospitality sector who desperately want to get back into business on 11 December. Conversations with the Chief Medical Officer Dr McBride and the Chief Scientific Adviser Professor Ian Young about lifting the trading restrictions are ongoing. Much depends on how the next fortnight pans out. Today offered some glimpses of the future and for some at least there is hope on the horizon. On Thursday, eight further deaths linked to Covid-19 in Northern Ireland were reported by the Department of Health, bringing its total to 962. The department also recorded 442 new cases of coronavirus. Five hospitals are currently operating beyond their bed capacity. They are the Causeway, Mater, Royal Victoria, Ulster and South West Acute. There are confirmed outbreaks of Covid-19 in 139 care homes. The UK government has said anyone travelling to or from Northern Ireland can travel on 22 and 28 December, but ""only meet with their Christmas bubble"" between 23 and 27 December.
