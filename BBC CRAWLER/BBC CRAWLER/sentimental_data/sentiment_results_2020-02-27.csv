"This video can not be played Michael Gove: UK is not seeking EU rules alignment The UK has warned the EU it will walk away from trade talks in June unless there is a ""broad outline"" of a deal. Michael Gove told MPs the UK wanted to strike a ""comprehensive free trade agreement"" in 10 months. But the government would not accept any alignment with EU laws as the EU is demanding, with Mr Gove adding: ""We will not trade away our sovereignty."" The EU has already set out its priorities ahead of the formal start of the talks on Monday. The government haspublished a 30-page document,externaloutlining its priorities for the talks. Faisal Islam: UK warns it could abandon EU trade talks in June UK to end agreement with EU to extradite criminals EU ministers agree UK trade talks mandate PM gives green light to post-Brexit research deal The UK document says: The UK ""will not negotiate any arrangements in which the UK does not have control of its own laws and political life"" The UK's aim is for a trading relationship with the EU similar to the ones the 27-nation bloc has with Canada, Japan and South Korea There will be no jurisdiction for EU law or the European Court of Justice in the UK The UK will rely on World Trade Organization rules under an arrangement with the EU similar to Australia's if progress on a comprehensive deal cannot be made A separate agreement on fisheries is needed, to reflect the fact that ""the UK will be an independent coastal state at the end of 2020"" The government wants to agree a ""broad outline"" of a deal with the EU ""capable of being rapidly finalised by September"" in the next four months If that does not happen it will decide whether to switch focus to leaving on WTO terms at the end of December The UK officially left the EU at the end of January, but is continuing to abide by many EU rules while talks on a permanent trading relationship take place. Mr Johnson has pledged to get a deal with the EU by the end of the so-called transition period - 31 December 2020 - and has said he is not prepared to extend that deadline. The UK's negotiating team will be led by Mr Johnson's Europe adviser David Frost. Thought Brexit was done? Sorry to disappoint, but the process of defining Britain's new relationship with the EU as a non-member state is only just getting going. We'll soon be back to the days of crunch talks, the prospect of no deal and the two sides locking horns. What's different now though? Boris Johnson has a huge majority and gone are the days of disunity in the Conservative party that we saw under Theresa May. So the government is being forthright about what it wants from these negotiations - to pull away from the EU and form a new relationship with the bloc as other non-member states have already done. We can already see where the flashpoints are likely to be. But the Conservative manifesto promised a negotiated trade agreement this year - we'll see in the coming months how likely that's looking. David Frost (l) and Michel Barnier (r) will lead the negotiating teams Both sides agree that the UK will not undercut existing regulations on the environment, workers rights, competition and international tax principles. But, says BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming, there are ""some big obvious flashpoints"". 'Dynamic alignment':The UK does not want to follow EU legislation as it is updated in the future. The EU is concerned about the UK gaining a competitive advantage. State aid:The UK wants the freedom to subsidise domestic industries of its choice. Brussels wants state aid restrictions to continue ""in perpetuity"". Governance:The EU wants a ""blockbuster"" agreement covering everything from fisheries, aviation, energy to immigration. The UK wants different deals in these areas. Fishing:The UK wants quota deals like the EU has with Iceland or Norway. The EU wants continued access to UK waters. The EU's46-page negotiating document,external, published on Monday, indicated that the UK could be expected to keep aligned with changes to EU rules covering state subsidies for industry, environmental standards and workers' rights in future. Any trade agreement ""should uphold common high standards, and corresponding high standards over time with Union standards as a reference point"", it added. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson told BBC News: ""The whole objective of doing what we're doing is so the UK can do things differently and better."" He added: ""All we want is mutual recognition of each other's high standards and access to each other's markets. ""We wouldn't ask the EU to follow every particular change in UK legislation so it doesn't make any sense for them to make the same requirement of us and that's where we are."" The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said Brussels is prepared to give the UK ""super-preferential access"" to the EU market of 450 million people. But he said the UK has to accept alignment with EU rules as they develop to ensure fair competition with EU states, effectively ruling out a Canada-style deal. Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? EU warns UK over goods checks between NI and GB Brexit: What is a level playing field? ""The UK says that it wants Canada. But the problem with that is that the UK is not Canada,"" Mr Barnier told an event at the European Parliament on Wednesday. ""This is because of Britain's proximity to the EU and the much larger trade volumes it has with the EU than with Canada."" Michael Gove, the minister in charge of delivering Brexit, hit back in his statement to MPs, saying: ""Geography is no reason to undermine democracy. ""We will not be seeking to dynamically align with EU rules on EU terms governed by EU laws and EU institutions."" Labour's shadow Exiting the EU minister Paul Blomfield said the government's negotiating strategy was ""frankly underwhelming"". He told MPs the government had a ""cavalier disregard"" for the consequences of failing to conclude a deal in the next 10 months and the uncertainty that would mean for business. The Scottish National Party's Pete Wishart said: ""This is nothing other than a routemap to the cherished no-deal - the real ambition of these Brexit zealots."" Critics say leaving without an agreement and going to World Trade Organisation rules - the terms countries use to set tariffs (taxes) on goods when they do not have free-trade deals - could damage the economy.

"A common type of gut bacterium may increase a person's chance of developing bowel cancer, according to a study published in the journalNature,external. The bacterium is a type ofE. coliinfection, present in up to one in five people, scientists believe. It releases a toxin which experts say can damage the cells that line the bowel, potentially turning some cells cancerous over time. There are around 42,000 new cases of bowel cancer each year in the UK. Experts do not yet know how many of these might be linked to theE. colistrain that makes the toxin colibactin. Bowel cancer rates rising 'among young adults' Dame Julie Walters reveals shock of bowel cancer diagnosis The researchers suspect it may contribute to a minority of bowel cancer cases - one in 20 or five in every 100 - but more research is needed to confirm the link. There is no routine test for the bacterium currently, and it is not clear yet that people who have it will be at heightened risk. In some people it may live in the bowel and cause no issue. It is not the first infection to be linked with cancer, however. HPV is a virus that causes cervical cancer and H pylori infection is associated with stomach cancer. No. This particular E. coli strain is not one of the ones linked to food poisoning outbreaks. There are lots of different types of E. coli. Many are part of the normal gut flora - the trillions of bacteria that naturally live in the bowel. The team, from The Netherlands, the UK and the US, used miniature replicas of the human gut, grown in the lab, to test the effects of the toxin on cells. They then compared the damage seen with more than 5,000 bowel cancer samples taken from patients and found identical patterns or ""fingerprints"" of DNA damage in around 5% of the samples. a persistent change in bowel habit - going more often, with looser stools and sometimes tummy pain blood in the stools without other symptoms, such as piles abdominal pain, discomfort or bloating always brought on by eating - sometimes resulting in a reduction in the amount of food eaten and weight loss Most people with these symptoms do not have bowel cancer, but the NHS advice is to see your GP if you have one or more of the symptoms and they have persisted for more than four weeks. Source:NHS UK,external Experts say it may be possible to develop a more sensitive test to detect early bowel tumours using this knowledge about the toxin. The findings may also offer a way to prevent some bowel cancers, by getting rid of the bacterium from the body before it can do any harm, using existing antibiotics. One of the researchers, Prof Hans Clevers, from the Hubrecht Institute in The Netherlands, said: ""Common antibiotics will kill these bacteria. ""This is the first time we've seen such a distinctive pattern of DNA damage in bowel cancer, which has been caused by a bacterium that lives in our gut."" He said there may be other gut bacteria that do the same. Probiotic treatments that contain a similar strain of E. coli, called Nissle 1917, might also pose a risk potentially, he added - but these are not the same ones found in yoghurt drinks sold in supermarkets. ""Although it might sound scary, there's still lots left to understand about our how our gut bacteria affect our health, what we could do about it, and how much impact it has on bowel cancer risk,"" says Nicola Smith, senior health information Manager at Cancer Research UK, who funded the work. ""In the future, knowing what role bacteria in our gut plays could change the way we detect and prevent bowel cancer. ""But we do know that around half of bowel cancer cases can be prevented by not smoking, keeping a healthy weight and eating a balanced diet - so there's plenty of changes that you can make right now that will reduce your risk,"" she added. Genevieve Edwards, chief executive at Bowel Cancer UK, said: ""Although this research is at an early stage, it adds to the growing body of evidence about the role that bacteria and other microorganisms that live in our gut may play in bowel cancer development.

"Four properties searched were in Navestock near Brentwood About 450 police officers have taken part in raids as part of an investigation into thefts of cars worth a total of up to Â£4m. More than 20 properties were raided in Essex and in London at about 05:45 GMT. Essex Police said 15 arrests have been made so far, 25 stolen vehicles have been found and Â£150,000 has been seized as well as Â£90,000 in jewellery. The operation was carried out by Essex Police and the Met Police, along with British Transport Police. About 400 police officers from three forces were involved in the raids It follows an investigation into a gang suspected of stealing about 90 cars - worth a total of up to Â£4m - since November 2018. Raids were carried out in the Chelmsford, Braintree, Southend, Basildon and Uttlesford districts and London, mainly in the east of the capital. Acting Supt Lewis Basford said they had been ""targeting a specific group that had been offending, taking high-end value vehicles"" and had also seized hi-tech equipment used to steal vehicles without a key. ""We believe this gang are responsible for the theft of vehicles from across the whole of Essex, London and car parks linked to the British Transport Police, particularly high-end Range Rovers and sports cars,"" he said. ""The offences that we believe the group are responsible for [involved] using technology using keyless entry... and equipment used to automatically start a vehicle without the key being present in the offender's hand."" Individuals responsible for the coding of new keys, thus enabling vehicles to be cloned and sold to unsuspecting victims, were also targeted, Supt Basford said. He added that the raids were ""just the start of the operation to tackle the theft of motor vehicles"". A cannabis factory with 200 plants was uncovered and 10 stolen van flatbeds were also recovered.

"Controversial plans for a third runway at Heathrow Airport have been thrown into doubt after a court ruling. The government's decision to allow the expansion was unlawful because it did not take climate commitments into account, the Court of Appeal said. Heathrow said it would challenge the decision, but the government said it would not appeal. The judges said that in future, a third runway could go ahead, as long as it fits with the UK's climate policy. The case was brought by environmental groups, councils and the Mayor of London. There were ""whoops and jumps of jubilation from environmentalists outside the court room"" after the judgement, BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin reported. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps tweeted that the government would not appeal against the ruling. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In an interview, he said that it was ""for Heathrow and the courts to decide"" whether the expansion should go ahead. ""This government is absolutely committed [from] the Prime Minister down to airport expansion, but, we want to make sure that expansion is environmentally friendly,"" he said. Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye said the airport would challenge the court's decision at the Supreme Court, saying: ""We think the appeals court got it wrong"". ""We have a very strong legal case, and we will be making that very firmly,"" he said. He said in the meantime Heathrow would work with government on a review of its policy ""to make sure we can demonstrate expansion is compatible with the Paris accord on climate change"". ""I'm confident that this issue is fixable, and we can work with the government to get on and deliver the expanded Heathrow that Britain needs,"" Mr Holland-Kaye added. ""Without Heathrow expansion, there will be no global Britain."" Heathrow expansion: What is the third runway plan? What is climate change? Friends of the Earth, one of the environmental groups that brought the case, said the ruling was ""an absolutely groundbreaking result for climate justice"". Will Rundle, head of legal at the campaign group, said: ""This judgment has exciting wider implications for keeping climate change at the heart of all planning decisions. ""It's time for developers and public authorities to be held to account when it comes to the climate impact of their damaging developments."" Greenpeace said the government needed to ""permanently ground Heathrow's expansion plans"". Greenpeace UK's executive director, John Sauven, said: ""The third runway is already on its knees over costs, noise, air pollution, habitat loss and lack of access, and now Heathrow has yet another impossibly high hurdle to clear. ""Boris Johnson should now put Heathrow out of its misery and cancel the third runway once and for all. No ifs, no buts, no lies, no U-turns."" MPs voted overwhelmingly to support Heathrow expansionin 2018, with Boris Johnson out of the country at the time. Before he became prime minister, Mr Johnson pledged in 2015 to lie down ""in front of those bulldozersand stop the building, stop the construction of that third runway"" at Heathrow. Reacting to the Court of Appeal's decision the government hardly sounded enthusiastic about Heathrow expansion. Transport secretary Grant Shapps was repeatedly asked whether ministers still backed a third runway, he talked instead about ""overall airport expansion."" Plus, the government's not going to appeal the decision, leaving it to others. Some think this is a sign that the project is about to be cancelled, but there's an alternative explanation for the reticence. For years Boris Johnson campaigned against the development, so joining a court action to push it through risks accusations of hypocrisy. Privately, senior ministers say they're not looking at alternatives and if Heathrow wins its appeal at the Supreme Court then it will go ahead. For now the government can watch from a distance. If the case is lost, however, there will be some difficult decisions to make, because so many Conservative MPs and businesses think that airport expansion is essential. The Court of Appeal found that the government had not followed UK policy when backing the controversial expansion plans. It said that the government had a duty to take into account the Paris climate agreement, which seeks to limit global warming. It was ""legally fatal"" to the government's Heathrow expansion policy that it did not take those climate commitments into account, the judges said. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said business communities in the UK would be ""bitterly disappointed that plans for a world-leading hub airport are now at risk"". ""Without expansion, firms risk losing crucial regional connectivity and access to key markets across the world,"" said BCC director general Adam Marshall. Industry lobby group the CBI said that while ""all major projects must be consistent"" with net zero carbon emissions by 2050, ""it's clear that the government and aviation industry need to work closely to agree a robust decarbonisation plan"". However, it said it was ""vital"" that the Heathrow project be kept ""on track"". ""Opportunities for future trade will not wait,"" said Josh Hardie, CBI deputy-director general. But airline group IAG, which owns British Airways, said: ""We have always said the environmental impact and cost of Heathrow expansion needs independent review. The airport cannot be trusted. Its original Â£14bn cost for expansion is now Â£32bn.""

"George Eustice watched a screen showing images of flood defences during a visit to Ironbridge Boris Johnson has been kept ""regularly informed"" on the flooding situation, the environment secretary said during a visit to flood-hit Shropshire. George Eustice, who was in Ironbridge and Shrewsbury earlier, said the prime minister ""made it clear he wanted me to lead on this"". It follows criticism ofMr Johnson for not visitingflood-affected areas. Mr Eustice also said Â£4bn would be spent on flood defences over five years. The money was pledged last year. Storm Jorge, due to hit at the weekend, could bring more disruption to the region, with heavy rain also forecast on Friday. As well as the flooding in Shropshire, up to70 properties in Snaith, East Yorkshire, have been flooded. This video can not be played Shrewsbury flooding: B&B Darwin's Townhouse reopens During his visit to Ironbridge, Mr Eustice said: ""The prime minister when he appointed me two weeks ago made it clear he wanted me to lead on this. ""We discussed Storm Dennis that was coming that weekend... discussed our response. ""I've kept him regularly informed with what's happening; the important thing is have we made the right decisions in a timely way? And I think the answer is yes."" Mr Eustice praised the teams working ""on the ground"", who have done a ""fantastic job at responding to this"" and said the government would look to make improvements to defences, some ofwhich buckled in Ironbridge on Wednesday. ""We'll be spending over Â£4bn in the next five years on flood defences,"" he said. The money was pledged by the Conservatives in theirmanifesto,externalahead of the 2019 general election. ""Some of that is going to be on nature-based solutions upstream to try to hold water uphill so vulnerable communities like this on the Severn are less likely to be affected, but there will also be some hard defences put in place as well,"" Mr Eustice said. He refused to be drawn on exactly which projects would be backed, saying there would be assessments based on flood risk and the total of number of homes potentially protected. Mr Eustice spoke to residents affected by flooding in Ironbridge and the Longden Coleham area of Shrewsbury. But one business owner said the environment secretary had initially walked past without speaking, so he had followed and asked for a conversation. Steven Clarke, who runs greengrocers The Allotment, in Coleham, said it was an ""insult"".

""We were quite keen to speak to him and get some answers... he walked straight past and went towards the bridge to go and do some press interviews."" Mr Clarke confirmed Mr Eustice had later talked to him and another business owner. George Eustice is accompanied by a member of the Environment Agency on his visit The environment secretary's visit was shrouded in secrecy after his junior Rebecca Pow phoned in sick. He stepped in at the last minute to visit Ironbridge and Shrewsbury. We were told he'd be visiting Wharfage but suddenly it was switched to Dale End on the other side of town. He arrived to be greeted by workers from the Environment Agency, emergency services and Telford and Wrekin Council. They explained how busy they had been over the past two weeks trying to protect Ironbridge and its residents and businesses. He listened intently and asked questions. I had been told there would be no media interviews but before he went to meet the assembled staff, I asked him why it has taken two weeks to visit flood-hit Shropshire. ""I'm here today,"" he said, adding, ""in the initial aftermath we want the Environment Agency to head things up"". He then went to inspect the fast-flowing River Severn with the iconic Iron Bridge in the background before getting up close to the flood defence barriers. On Wednesday evening,police and the Environment Agency warned of ""another 10 days of difficult conditions""over fears Shropshire and Worcestershire, where evacuations have been taking place, will be further affected following heavy rain in Wales. The Met Office warned parts of Wales and northern England could see between 60 and 80mm of rain on Friday - with much of the rainfall in Wales falling into the Severn catchment and heading towards flood-hit communities in the West Midlands. There has been some respite, though, with river levels recently dropping by about 40cm in Ironbridge and by 80cm in Shrewsbury. Rachel Moss, who has a hairdressing salon in Coleham, said people ""need some action"". ""We've been hit twice in a week - there's still rumours it could get worse this weekend,"" she said. ""If it does, it will absolutely devastate this community."" Defences along The Wharfage in Ironbridge buckled Chris Bainger, from the Environment Agency, said: ""We have a bit of respite, we've just got showers moving through over the next couple of days. ""But coming into Friday we have another band of rain coming through that's going to be up in the Welsh mountains and that's going to be coming to us... perhaps Saturday.

"This video can not be played Quicker than takeaway: BBC News investigates quick delivery of drugs in Leeds More illegal drugs than ever before are coming into the UK - and buying them is almost as easy as ordering a pizza, the author of a major new report has said. Dame Carol Black also found that an ""unprecedented"" number of children and teenagers are being drawn into the drug trade through county lines gangs. Herdrugs review,externalput the costs of the illicit trade in crime and to society at about Â£19bn a year in England. The government said it was taking ""tough action"" to combat illegal drugs. Dame Carol, who the Home Office asked last year to review drug supply and demand in the UK, presented her findings on Thursday. The ""widespread"" use of children to supply drugs was the ""most alarming"" recent development, she told the UK Drugs Summit in Glasgow. Her report also found that the illicit drugs market in the UK is worth Â£9.4bn a year, with about three million people in England and Wales taking them last year. 'We're here to make money and not get killed' 'County-lines gangs fuelling' child slavery rise Children in drugs gangs 'to be treated as victims' Dame Carol told the conference: ""We have an abundant supply coming into our countries from around the world, more than ever before. ""It's purer, it's more available, you can buy whichever drug you want almost anywhere. ""It wouldn't be too far to go to say it's almost for some drugs as easy as getting your pizza."" The comparison came after an investigation by BBC News foundit took just 27 minutes to receive an order of cocainefrom a drug dealer in Leeds. The key conclusion of Dame Carol Black's report on illegal drugs - that a ""perfect storm"" has developed that can be abated only through government intervention - is based on compelling evidence from an impressive array of statistics and information. The headline figure - the Â£19bn cost to society of illicit drugs in England - is designed to act as a wake-up call. It is about half of the National Crime Agency estimate of the total cost of serious and organised crime to the UK economy and around three times as much as the cost of treating and dealing with the effects of obesity in England. There is no simple solution to reducing the economic costs of drug-taking, not to mention the human toll, but Dame Carol indicates there must be investment in treatment. A report from Public Health England in 2014 found that every pound spent on drug treatment saved Â£2.50 in costs to society. However, her review raises more questions than answers about the overall effectiveness of law enforcement activity on illicit drugs, saying crackdowns have little impact on supply and may increase violence by creating a gap in the market for dealers to battle over. Dame Carol highlighted the effect of government funding cuts on drug recovery support services - which she said were ""disappearing"" in certain areas. She said: ""At the same time we have seen a reduction in very good treatment and recovery, and that again all adds up to leave us, as you will see in this report, with the perfect storm. ""I believe this perfect storm will not go away unless government takes action."" Her report, which was released to coincide with a drugs summit held by the UK government in Glasgow, said drug-related deaths are at an all-time high, while the market is becoming increasingly violent. It found 300,000 people in England used the most harmful drugs - opiates and crack cocaine - last year. The review said the ""county lines"" model is now a widely-used method for supplying the most serious drugs. County lines is a tactic which sees gangs and distribution networks from cities move into smaller towns and use violence to overtake local drug dealers. The model relies on children or other vulnerable people to sell drugs. Crime minister Kit Malthouse, who is chairing the Glasgow summit, said: ""The findings, which we will discuss today, are troubling and paint a stark picture of how illegal drugs are devastating lives and communities, and fuelling serious violence. ""We are already taking tough action to combat county lines and violent crime and to disrupt and prosecute the organised gangs that bring so much misery. But clearly we all need to do more.""

"Staff at the chicken chain Nando's claim they sometimes have to clean its restaurants without pay. Current and former Nando's employees at multiple restaurants told the BBC they had to scrub cookers and disinfect toilets after being clocked out. One claimed the same mops were used in toilets and kitchens while another said they handled chicken without gloves. Nando's said it was its policy to pay employees properly and it upholds the highest cleaning standards. Most of its branches do not employ dedicated cleaners - which Nando's described as standard across the food service industry. The company, which has more than 400 restaurants in the UK, added: ""Cleaning is an integral part of restaurant work and is crucial to maintaining high standards of health and hygiene, which we take very seriously."" Thousands of people have signed an online petition calling on Nando's to review its cleaning and pay policies. ""The managers would clock us out early and not adjust for late stays. If we complained, we were simply told we should have worked faster,"" people commenting onthe petition claimed,external. Most Nando's branches do not employ a dedicated cleaner The BBC spoke to five current and former Nando's staff - dubbed ""Nandocas"" by the company - they all requested anonymity. For most, Nando's was their first job. Collectively they have worked in seven different restaurants across England and Scotland within the past 12 months. They were broadly complimentary about Nando's as a workplace. ""You do make friendsâ¦ it's social,"" one said. ""It's saved me Â£45 a week in free food,"" another added. But almost all highlighted problems with how closing shifts are managed and some alleged incidents of poor cleaning practices. 'Costa Coffee took Â£200 from my pay for training' Costa Coffee workers 'not treated like humans' Wahaca changes eat-and-run bill policy They all described closing shifts as ending when a manager - known as a ""Patrao"" - signed off the restaurant as ready for the next day. The system automatically clocks staff out unless managers override it, but that did not always happen, the workers claimed. ""I would get my payslip on a Friday and find I'd have less money than expected because they didn't put in the hours on my closing shifts,"" a 22-year-old, who we're calling Suzanne, said. ""There was a time where we'd run over and finished around 02:30 in the morning and the managers had already put it through the system and they wouldn't add on the extra hours."" More than 10 reviews about Nando's posted on Glassdoor mention unpaid overtime ""You would be usually clocked out early and I thought that was a normal thing. I just thought they pay us for extra hours,"" said 19-year-old Jenny - not her real name - who worked at a Nando's in Cheshire. ""I did ask colleagues 'are we actually getting paid?' and they said... 'we don't actually get paid, you have to bug them for it'. ""You have to ask [managers] 'can I have the extra pay for the close' and they wouldn't always actually do it."" One current member of staff who works in the kitchen of a Nando's in the south-west of England said that he was almost always paid properly for overtime. But there were occasional mistakes. ""We had this one staff member who, when [his hours] got put through completely wrong, didn't get paid so the manager gave him the money out of his own pocket,"" the 20-year-old said. Several of those the BBC spoke to said Nando's uses an industry-standard colour-coded system to separate cleaning equipment. For example, a green mop is used in kitchens, while a red mop is used to clean toilets. Suzanne, who worked at a Nando's in Manchester city centre, claimed she rarely saw the red mop head used in the 12 months she worked there. ""The kitchen staff will close first... they wouldn't really take the time out to use the correct coloured mop,"" she said. ""You can use any bucket or any mop, which was a huge problem because whatever is in the kitchen would be contaminated in the toilets."" Meanwhile, Jenny claimed she was required to cook chicken and clean toilets without protection for a week due to a supply issue. ""That means that raw chicken was being racked [cooked] without hair nets or gloves and also toilets had to be cleaned when we didn't have the option of wearing gloves at all,"" she said. Nando's - which has around 20,000 staff in Britain - has also responded to complaints which mention unpaid overtime and arduous cleaning duties made on the employment review website Glassdoor. Employment lawyer Katie Mahoney said managers' control of the clocking out system could be a breach of trust which may ""entitle the employee to resign and claim constructive dismissal"". ""Depending on the terms of the contract, they may also be able to argue that the failure to pay them for the hours they have actually worked has resulted in an unlawful deduction from their wages,"" she added. Staff said cleaning tasks ranged from mopping floors to bleaching toilet bowls and urinals The petition calling on Nando's to review its cleaning and pay policies was created on the campaigns website Organise, which told the BBC it is supported by 551 people who said they work there. It has so far gained more than 3,700 signatures. The BBC understands the company has ""reinforced"" its clocking-out policy to managers as a result of the petition. Organise founder Nat Whalley said: ""Hundreds of Nando's staff are now speaking up together to stamp out missing pay."" A Nando's spokesperson told the BBC: ""We wholeheartedly refute the accusation that we would ask or expect our employees to do unpaid work. ""Without exception, our policy across all our restaurants is to pay all of our employees for all the work they do, and we take this incredibly seriously. ""If human error ever does occur, it is rectified without delay."" ""As is standard across the industry, cleaning is an essential role for employees, and this is made clear to all job applicants,"" they added. ""Cleaning is an integral part of restaurant work and is crucial to maintaining high standards of health and hygiene, which we take very seriously. Any employee who is asked to clean is given full training."" The spokesperson said: ""99% of our restaurants across the country have a rating of four or five under the Food Hygiene Scheme"".

"Financial markets suffered a sixth day of losses on Thursday, as traders dumped shares on fears that the spread of coronavirus will hobble the global economy. In the US, the Dow Jones plunged nearly 1,200 points to lose 4.4%. It was the sharpest points-drop in history. The S&P 500 ended 4.4% lower, while the Nasdaq dropped 4.6%. Earlier, London's FTSE 100 finished 3.5% lower, while Japan's Nikkei 225 led Asian losses, falling more than 2%. The string of declines has pushed indexes in Europe and the US down more than 10% from their recent highs - sending them into so-called ""correction"" territory. The tumult comes as the coronavirus, which started in China, spreads rapidly around the world, restricting travel, upending global supply chains and prompting shoppers in some countries to stay home. ""Markets move sharply when fear and uncertainty are prevalent, and there is plenty of both right now,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com. Indexes in the US and London were poised for their the biggest weekly losses since the 2008 financial crisis, as the Dow retreated to levels last seen in August. Investors rushed into less risky investments, such as government debt, sending bond yields to record lows. Globally, the share price declines of the last six days have wiped out more than $3.6tn (Â£2.8tn) in value. The declines follow warnings from dozens of companies - from mining firm Rio Tinto to software giant Microsoft - that they will not hit sales targets. On Thursday, Facebook said it would cancel a conference for developers, scheduled for May. Economists, many of whom had originally expected the virus to be a temporary blow, are also sounding warnings.

'We're getting more orders thanks to the virus' At an event on Wednesday, former US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen suggested it could tip the US into recession, while Goldman Sachs told clients it did not expect companies to see any profit growth this year. ""Our reduced profit forecasts reflect the severe decline in Chinese economic activity... lower end-demand for US exporters, disruption to the supply chain for many US firms, a slowdown in US economic activity, and elevated business uncertainty,"" the firm wrote. The coronavirus has infected nearly 79,000 people in China and killed more than 2,700. More than 3,200 cases and 51 deaths have been reported in another 44 countries. Investors around the world are now looking to see if central banks respond with efforts to prop up the economy. Chinas's central bank has already taken stimulative measures. Germany's Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said that while the impact of the virus so far had been limited, the country was considering how to respond should it worsen.

"Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and the government is seeking ways to minimise its spread. Without drastic measures - which could be in place for weeks, or even months - it is feared that more than 250,000 people could die. All members of the public should reduce the time they spend with others: Everyone should stop non-essential contact with others. This is particularly important for people over 70, those with underlying health conditions and pregnant women People should work from home if they can Cafes, pubs and restaurants are being closed from Friday night - except for take-away food - to tackle coronavirus People should stop all unnecessary travel Those most at risk - about 1.5 million who've had organ transplants, have severe respiratory conditions or some cancers - should not go out for 12 weeks, and will be given essential supplies if they don't have a support system of their own Everyone should continue to regularly wash their hands and avoid contacting the NHS unless it's essential. The strongest warnings are in place for those who are ill and the people close to them: Anyone with a fever or persistent cough should stay at home for seven days Anyone who lives with someone displaying coronavirus symptoms should also stay at home for 14 days.People who have to isolate themselvesshould ask others for help The government's thinking has changed quickly. It started off trying to contain coronavirus by isolating people who tested positive and asking anyone who had close contact with them to self-isolate too. Ministers then introduced policies to delay and reduce the peak, when the most cases are expected. The idea was that by pushing it back to the summer it would allow the NHS to cope. But modelling from Imperial College London prompted a change in approach. It warned the policy of a managed spread could lead to more than 250,000 deaths, with hospital intensive care units getting overwhelmed. Ministers are now seeking to suppress the spread completely. They hope this will keep deaths below 20,000. We are in uncharted territory - so it is impossible to tell. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested that""we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks"". But the problem with trying to suppress the virus is that as soon as you lift those measures the fear is it could quickly return. One option from experts advising the government is to go through a cycle of lifting and reapplying restrictions, using demand on intensive care as a guide. There will be close attention paid to China, which is now looking at how it lifts restrictions. It is not realistic to think that if you temporarily break the spread of coronavirus it will go away. Then you have to consider the social and economic factors at play. Businesses are going to struggle and people are going to lose their jobs. And how long are the public going to put up with being told they cannot go out, need to work from home and can no longer watch sport or go to festivals? It leaves the government with some very difficult decisions to take. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The whole of the NHS has been put on an emergency footing. From mid-April all routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements, are being cancelled for three months. Hospitals have plans to keep coronavirus patients separate and supply staff with protective masks and suits. All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested. Patients with mild symptoms - a high temperature or new and persistent cough - are being asked to self-isolate at home. Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be. But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. Currently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms. Specialist ECMO breathing equipment is at five units for patients whose lungs fail. There are between 4,000 and 5,000 intensive care beds. But NHS officials said they can effectively increase that to between 11,000 and 12,000 by using ventilators reserved for planned surgery and those available in the private sector, Ministry of Defence, new ones being made and old stocks that are no longer used. Ministers are also working with private companies to ramp up production. A third of patients who need hospital care require intensive care support, evidence from China and Italy suggests. Doctors warn that some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment. What questions do you have about the UK's coronavirus plans?

"Italy and Iran have become hotbeds of coronavirus infections The coronavirus outbreak has reached a ""decisive point"" and has ""pandemic potential"", World Health Organization head Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus says. His comments come as countries around the world battle to prevent the virus spreading further. For a second day, more cases have been reported outside than inside China. Iran and Italy have become major centres of infection, with people travelling from there spreading the virus further afield. Several high-profile Iranian officials have become infected, the latest being Vice-President for Women and Family Affairs Masoumeh Ebtekar. ""It's what's happening in the rest of the world that's now our greatest concern,"" Dr Tedros said. As it happened: Updates as cases spread around world How close are we to a pandemic? What you need to know Globally, more than 80,000 people in nearly 50 countries have been infected. Nearly 2,800 have died, the majority in China's Hubei province. Meanwhilestock markets around the world have fallen sharplyamid fears that increased travel restrictions will prevent business activity. Dr Tedros urged governments to act swiftly and aggressively to contain the virus. ""We are actually in a very delicate situation in which the outbreak can go in any direction based on how we handle it,"" he said. ""This is not a time for fear. This is a time for taking action to prevent infection and save lives now,"" he added.

The move will affect about 13 million students. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the first weeks of March would be an ""extremely critical period"" for preventing virus transmission. It follows China's decision not to reopen schools on the mainland after the Spring Festival holiday and instead ask nearly 200 million students to follow classes online from their homes. Hong Kong is also keeping schools closed until April. Japan's school closures will affect 13 million students Many parents in Japan are concerned about what they will do with their children. ""My honest feeling - all schools on break? It's important to protect children, but what happens if they have working parents?"" one parent wrote on social media. Where are we with a coronavirus vaccine? Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? Officials say child day care centres and after-school facilities can remain open.

Coronavirus: A visual guide to the outbreak Global stock markets suffer sixth day of losses Ms Ebtekar's symptoms are reportedly not severe and she is not in hospital. Ms Ebtekar - one of Iran's vice-presidents - has contracted the virus The WHO's Michael Ryan said the extent of infection in Iran ""may be broader than we think"". But he said the country had a ""very high clinical capacity"" and the current 10% death rate for cases there probably reflected screening that was not picking up mild coronavirus cases. Health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur called on Iranians to avoid ""unnecessary trips inside the country"". Iran's neighbours have closed their borders. The UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Estonia in northern Europe all recorded new cases of the virus in people travelling from Iran. Mark Lowen, BBC Rome correspondent Italy's government is in fightback mode, trying a concerted approach to lessen the coronavirus panic. The foreign minister warned that an ""epidemic of misleading information"" would damage Italy ""more than the virus itself"", which, he added, had infected 0.1% of towns in the country. ""It's time to stop the panic"", said the prime minister, asking the national broadcaster Rai to ""tone down"". This video can not be played Quiet on Venice streets amid coronavirus fears On the front pages of Italian newspapers, the top story is no longer the rising number of cases but appeals for calm. The mayor of Milan, where many hotels and restaurants are half-empty, has called for some museums to reopen.A new video released by the authorities shows vibrant scenes,externalfrom the city with the message: we're not afraid and we're open for business. But this is a story driven by perceptions. And with Donald Trump mentioning possible future travel restrictions to Italy, with Israel barring foreigners arriving on flights from Italy, with Kuwait evacuating its nationals from Milan, the Italian government faces a challenge to change the narrative. Chinareported 29 more deaths and 433 new cases on Thursday. It has ordered people arriving in Beijing from affected countries to self-quarantine. South Koreasaw new cases bringing its total infections to 1,261 with 12 deaths.Singaporesaid a 12-year-old student at the top Raffles Institution school was among three new cases, bringing its total to 96. In Europe,Italyhad 650 infections and 17 deaths. Several countries includingAlgeria,Denmark,RomaniaandSpainhave reported infections linked to Italy. France's President Emmanuel Macron said the country was ""facing a crisis, an epidemic that is coming"". The country now has 38 confirmed cases and two deaths. France is the world's most visited country. Northern Ireland diagnosed its first casebringing the total inthe UKto 16. The first case has been confirmed inThe Netherlands. The person recently visited the Lombardy region of Italy. Latin America recorded its first case inBrazil, in a person who had returned home from Italy. Coronavirus in Europe: epidemic or 'infodemic'? TheUShas recorded its first confirmed case of ""unknown origin"", the 60th in the country overall. The unidentified person in California had ""no relevant travel history or exposure to another known patient"" with the virus, officials said. During a news conference on Thursday, US Vice-President Mike Pence said the threat to the public remains low. The White House has started discussions with leaders of US Congress on a spending bill to fight the spread of the virus, he said. How worried should US be over coronavirus? But President Trump appeared to downplay concerns of an epidemic in the US. ""I think that there's a chance that it could get worse, a chance it could get fairly substantially worse, but nothing's inevitable,"" he said on Wednesday.

But, as you'd expect, weâll
continue to cover this story across the BBC website.You can read our main story here. A reminder of key developments today: Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Ten new laboratories have been set up, to analyse 1,000 possible cases a day. Four cases of
coronavirus have been confirmed in the country. The Swiss knew it was only a
matter of time. The sudden surge in cases in Italy made that inevitable. The
two countries share extensive borders, tens of thousands of people cross daily
to work. The government strategy is to be thorough, but calm. Borders will not
be closed, but border guards are issuing health advice. A nationwide campaign,
with the slogan ""This affects us all!"" will begin on Friday. The risk to the
general public remains low, but we are being urged to wash our hands often.
Hand sanitiser has sold out in Bern, popular cafes are quieter than usual. Right now, the economic damage is far greater than that to health: the Geneva
watch fair, hugely lucrative to the city, has been cancelled. Tourism from
China is down 50%, tourist resorts report a loss, already, of more than 20m francs (Â£16m; $20m). Nick Thorpe, BBC News InRomania, the first case of coronavirus was confirmed on
Wednesday, a man from Gorj county in the south of the country, on the border
with Bulgaria. He had been in contact with an Italian citizen who visited his
family in the city of Craiova between 18 and 22 February, who was confirmed ill
with the virus after he returned to Italy. The Romanian authorities are trying
to trace and put into quarantine everyone he met in Romania. 91 people are currently in
quarantine, and 7,174 are in isolation at home. One million Romanians work in Italy, and there are direct flights from
14 Romanian cities. Harder to monitor are the large numbers of migrant
labourers, who travel between the two countries by minibus or private car. InHungary, thereâs growing
concern and some panic-buying of face masks and hand disinfectants, but no
confirmed cases. 18 people are in quarantine after visiting northern Italy,
including schoolchildren and a lorry driver. Around 3,500 people have been
screened so far at Budapest airport. Last week was half-term in many schools,
and northern Italy is a popular region for Hungarian families to go skiing. The
authorities have earmarked two major Budapest hospitals for future cases. InBulgaria, the government sent
a special plane to bring back 20 agriculture students from Italy. They are now
under medical observation. Bulgaria Air have cancelled flights to Milan until
the end of March. Thermal cameras which measure travellersâ temperatures are
being installed at land border crossings as well as airports. Anyone with a
temperature over 37 degrees is screened for the virus. Iran's Vice-President for Women and Family Affairs Masoumeh Ebtekar has become the fourth politician to contract the virus. Her case is mild and she has not gone into hospital, state media say. Deputy Health MinisterIraj Harirchi and two MPs also have the virus. The WHO's Michael Ryan said the extent of infection in Iran could be ""broader than we think"". But he said the country had high capacity to cope with outbreaks of infection.

Out of about 700 guests, 130 arrived on Monday - some because flights were delayed by a sandstorm - and so didnât come into contact with the four Italians who originally tested positive The UK's Foreign Office said consular staff in Tenerife has made contact with the majority of the 168 British tourists believed to be staying at the hotel. Some of those are understood to fall within the 130 but itâs not clear how many. While the coronavirus presents ""some challenges"", it will not be anything like the scale of thedeadly Spanish Flu pandemic, England's chief medical officer has said. Speaking to health professionals at the Nuffield Trust Summit in Windsor, Professor Chris Whitty said: ""We are not heading into a H1N1 1918 flu pandemic situation but the coronavirus does present some challenges for us. It definitely will for a period. How big remains to be seen."" The H1N1 influenza pandemic in 1918 is estimated to have killed between 40 and 50 million people worldwide. Prof Whitty added the virus was ""a global problem or it is nothing"". He said: ""If it becomes a global epidemic then
the UK will get it, and if it does not become a global epidemic the UK is
perfectly capable of containing and getting rid of individual cases leading to
onward transmission."" He said onward transmission in the UK was ""just a matter of time in my view"". Prof Whitty said there could be a ""social cost"" if the
virus worsens, which could result in the reduction of mass gatherings and
school closures for more than two months. Global investors have been hit with a sixth day of stock market losses as traders respond to the threat of the coronavirus. The string of declines pushed indexes in Europe and the US down more than 10% from their recent highs - sending them into so-called ""correction"" territory. Read here for more on this business story. Public Health England is contacting people who had ""close contact"" withone of the latest confirmed cases of Covid-19. The patient is a Derbyshire resident who became infected whilst in Tenerife, in Spain's Canary Islands, Dr Fu-Meng Khaw, centre director Public Health England in the East Midlands, said. ""Close contacts"", he said, will be given ""health advice"" about symptoms and emergency contact details to use if they become unwell in the next 14 days after contact with the confirmed cases. There was, he added, currently no information to suggest there was any increased health risk to any pupils or staff at Burbage Primary School, in Buxton,which closed because of the case, and ""no public health reason"" for it to remain closed. Dean Wallace, director of public health for Derbyshire County Council, said the risk to the general public ""remains low"" and reminded people that ""good hygiene"" measures - such as washing hands regularly - were ""the best prevention"". Lewis GoodallPolicy Editor, BBC Newsnight The BBC's Newsnight programme understands that the Cabinet Office has been in contact with local authorities
about their preparedness, specifically with regard to their âExcess Death
Contingency Planningâ. This includes, among other things, where local
authorities might locate new, and perhaps mass, burial sites, should they be
needed. The government
stresses that these are worst-case contingency plans and a Whitehall source
confirms that they have been done before, albeit rarely, for example at the
time of the 2009 Sars outbreak. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: âWe have been clear from the outset that we
expect coronavirus to have some impact on the UK, which is why we are planning
for every eventuality â including the reasonable worst case scenario. Crucially
this does not mean we expect it to happen.""  There are similarities between the spread of the new coronavirus and other epidemics in the past. For example, Sars and Mers were two other types of viral respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus. Sars spread across the globe in 2003, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing 774. But there are two key differences between Sars and the current coronavirus outbreak. Firstly, the new coronavirus spread more quickly and further afield from its origin (the city of Wuhan in China) than Sars did. Secondly, data suggests the new coronavirus is less deadly than Sars. The graphic below highlights these differences.  China has quarantined dozens of passengers,externalarriving on a flight from Iran after one person tested positive for coronavirus, according to the Hong Kong-based newspaper South China Morning Post. This would be China's first known, imported case of coronavirus. The Aeroflot flight arrived in Shanghai via Moscow on 20 February. In Chiayi City, Taiwan, this art installation called The Sleeping Bear reminds people to wear face masks. Asked this morning what reassurances could be given to the British public over the coronavirus outbreak, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: âI think itâs absolutely vital that people do feel reassured. ""The NHS is a fantastic service and weâve made every possible preparation for any eventuality, and if you are concerned about travelling abroad to an area thatâs infected, the key thing is to look at the foreign office website.â His comments come after two more patients tested positive for coronavirus in England,bringing the total number of UK cases to 15. Guy HedgecoeFreelance journalist A sudden rise in
the number of cases of coronavirus in Spain this week has made it a talking
point, although there is little sense of panic among the general 
population. However, there is increased concern following the news that a
Spanish man in Seville had become infected without having travelled abroad
recently. This was the first such case of local contagion, suggesting the virus
has been present in Spain longer than previously thought. âAs long as we see a
rise in imported cases or local cases of infection, the risk factor will rise,â
said Fernando SimÃ³n, head of the Spanish governmentâs health emergency
department. âObviously it is to be expected... that there will be fatalities.â The lockdown of a hotel in Tenerife with nearly 1,000 people in it has been the
most visible instance of disruption so far, but there are now fears that events
surrounding Easter Week, a major holiday in Spain, will be affected. Britons making an insurance claim for a holiday they have cancelled because of the coronavirus should not be required to provide a GP letter, doctors say. Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said insurance firms should instead be basing their decisions to offer refunds on advice from the Foreign Office and Public Health England. ""Patients will undoubtedly have good and sensible reasons for not wanting to travel to certain places because of Covid-19,"" he said. ""But this is not the same as being unable to travel due to existing illness, and it should not become the GP's responsibility to give patients advice about where not to travel."" The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said insurers were assessing claims on a ""case by case basis"" and said it may need ""medical evidence if someone puts in a cancellation claim, saying their pre-existing condition could be exacerbated by coronavirus"".

Public Health England has sent a health protection specialist to Tenerife, where hundreds of guests have beenlocked down in a coronavirus-hit hotel. Professor Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said the expert will ""work with the Spanish authorities to better understand the public health measures that have been put in place in the hotel"". ""This includes understanding spread of the virus within the hotel and how the Spanish authorities are monitoring the situation,"" she added. It comes after some British guests claimed safety rules were not being enforced, or followed by other customers.

Mark LowenBBC Rome correspondent Tram carriages were empty during rush hour in Milan on Thursday Italyâs government is in fightback mode, trying a concerted approach to lessen the coronavirus panic. The foreign minister warned that an âepidemic of misleading informationâ would damage Italy âmore than the virus itselfâ, which, he added, had infected 0.1% of towns in the country. âItâs time to stop the panicâ, said the prime minister, asking the national broadcaster Rai to âtone downâ. On the front pages of Italian newspapers, the top story is no longer the rising number of cases â now more than 520, with 14 deaths â but appeals for calm. The mayor of Milan, where many hotels and restaurants are half-empty, has called for some museums to reopen. A new video released by the authorities shows vibrant scenes from the city with the message: weâre not afraid and weâre open for business. But this is a story driven by perceptions. And with Donald Trump mentioning possible future travel restrictions to Italy, with Israel barring foreigners arriving on flights from Italy, with Kuwait evacuating its nationals from Milan, the Italian government faces a challenge to change the narrative.

"Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and the government is seeking ways to minimise its spread. Without drastic measures - which could be in place for weeks, or even months - it is feared that more than 250,000 people could die. All members of the public should reduce the time they spend with others: Everyone should stop non-essential contact with others. This is particularly important for people over 70, those with underlying health conditions and pregnant women People should work from home if they can Cafes, pubs and restaurants are being closed from Friday night - except for take-away food - to tackle coronavirus People should stop all unnecessary travel Those most at risk - about 1.5 million who've had organ transplants, have severe respiratory conditions or some cancers - should not go out for 12 weeks, and will be given essential supplies if they don't have a support system of their own Everyone should continue to regularly wash their hands and avoid contacting the NHS unless it's essential. The strongest warnings are in place for those who are ill and the people close to them: Anyone with a fever or persistent cough should stay at home for seven days Anyone who lives with someone displaying coronavirus symptoms should also stay at home for 14 days.People who have to isolate themselvesshould ask others for help The government's thinking has changed quickly. It started off trying to contain coronavirus by isolating people who tested positive and asking anyone who had close contact with them to self-isolate too. Ministers then introduced policies to delay and reduce the peak, when the most cases are expected. The idea was that by pushing it back to the summer it would allow the NHS to cope. But modelling from Imperial College London prompted a change in approach. It warned the policy of a managed spread could lead to more than 250,000 deaths, with hospital intensive care units getting overwhelmed. Ministers are now seeking to suppress the spread completely. They hope this will keep deaths below 20,000. We are in uncharted territory - so it is impossible to tell. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested that""we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks"". But the problem with trying to suppress the virus is that as soon as you lift those measures the fear is it could quickly return. One option from experts advising the government is to go through a cycle of lifting and reapplying restrictions, using demand on intensive care as a guide. There will be close attention paid to China, which is now looking at how it lifts restrictions. It is not realistic to think that if you temporarily break the spread of coronavirus it will go away. Then you have to consider the social and economic factors at play. Businesses are going to struggle and people are going to lose their jobs. And how long are the public going to put up with being told they cannot go out, need to work from home and can no longer watch sport or go to festivals? It leaves the government with some very difficult decisions to take. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The whole of the NHS has been put on an emergency footing. From mid-April all routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements, are being cancelled for three months. Hospitals have plans to keep coronavirus patients separate and supply staff with protective masks and suits. All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested. Patients with mild symptoms - a high temperature or new and persistent cough - are being asked to self-isolate at home. Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be. But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. Currently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms. Specialist ECMO breathing equipment is at five units for patients whose lungs fail. There are between 4,000 and 5,000 intensive care beds. But NHS officials said they can effectively increase that to between 11,000 and 12,000 by using ventilators reserved for planned surgery and those available in the private sector, Ministry of Defence, new ones being made and old stocks that are no longer used. Ministers are also working with private companies to ramp up production. A third of patients who need hospital care require intensive care support, evidence from China and Italy suggests. Doctors warn that some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment. What questions do you have about the UK's coronavirus plans?

"The Supreme Court has reversed a decision to block plans for a controversial third runway at Heathrow Airport. It means that developerscan now seek planning permission for the project,which faces opposition from environmentalists and local residents. Heathrow is already the UK's busiest airport, serving about 80 million passengers per year. The airport currently has four terminals and two runways. Supporters of a new runway say it would boost international trade and provide many new jobs. Building the new runway would involve diverting rivers, moving roads and rerouting the M25 through a tunnel under the new runway. The proposal also includes upgrades to existing terminals two and five and plans to build new car parks. Heathrow Airport has said the project would be funded privately. The expansion would benefit passengers,boost the wider economy by up to Â£61bn and create up to 77,000 local jobs by 2030,,externalaccording to the Department for Transport. More than 40% of the UK's exports to non-EU countries now go through Heathrow, according to its chief executive John Holland-Kaye. He said a third runway was vital in order to strengthen international trade links. ""If we don't expand our only hub airport, then we're going to be flying through Paris to get to global markets,"" he said. Heathrow Airport also says it would introduce legally-binding environmental targets - including on noise, air quality and carbon emissions. Climate campaigners win Heathrow expansion case Heathrow third runway 'delayed for 12 months' MPs vote in favour of expansion 'Where's Boris?' shout Heathrow debate MPs Local and environmental groups have dismissed Heathrow Airport's assurances and have argued that a new runway would mean unacceptable levels of noise and pollution, as well as adding to the UK's carbon emissions from the increased number of flights. The proposal also""makes a mockery"",externalof the government's 2050 carbon neutral strategy, according to Green MP Caroline Lucas. Rupa Huq - the Labour MP for neighbouring Ealing Central and Acton - has labelled the plan ""completely nuts"", saying: ""Heathrow is the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide in Europe."" Anti-expansion protesters have mounted legal challenges against the government Campaign groups have also voiced opposition. ""The impact on local people could be severe for many years to come,"" said John Stewart, who chairs the Hacan group. ""Disruption from construction, the demolition of homes, the reality of more than 700 extra planes a day."" In all, 761 homes are expected to go,including the entire village of Longford. Heathrow has said it would pay the full market value plus 25% for properties in its compulsory purchase zone, as well as for some houses in the surrounding areas. Could aviation ever be less polluting? The third runway plan has been talked about for many years. The Labour government approved a third runway in 2009, with former Prime Minister Gordon Brown saying it was needed for economic reasons. But the plan was later scrapped by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in 2010. David Cameron, who became prime minister after Mr Brown, ruled out a Heathrow expansion""no ifs, no buts"". Five years ago Mr Johnson said he would lie down in front of bulldozers to stop a third runway being built In 2015 anAirports Commission,external, set up to look at London's airport capacity problems,recommended Heathrow as the preferred site for a new runway- a planwhich was approvedunder Theresa May's leadership. The decision was opposed by several local MPs, including Boris Johnson, whose Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat is next to Heathrow. He offered to lie down in front of bulldozers to stop the runway's construction. However, whenMPs voted in favour of the third runwayin 2018, Mr Johnson - then foreign secretary - was away in Afghanistan. On 27 February 2020, the Court of Appeal ruled the decision to allow the expansion was unlawful because it did not take climate commitments into account. However, the Supreme Court's decision has ruled the strategy was legitimately based on previous, less stringent, climate targets at the time it was agreed. The airport can now make a planning application, although this could take more than a year. It still has to persuade a public inquiry that there is a case for expansion, and the government will have the final say. Meanwhile environmentalists are expected to continue challenging the project at every stage in the courts - including the European Court of Human Rights.

"A specialist centre at the Royal Free Hospital, London, is treating one of the new patients Two more patients have tested positive for coronavirus in England, bringing the total number of UK cases to 15. They have been transferred to specialist NHS infection centres in Liverpool and London, the Department of Health said. The virus was passed on while they were in Italy and Tenerife, said England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty. Ministers have said they expect more cases to emerge. The new patients are being treated at specialist centres at the Royal Free Hospital, London, and the Royal Liverpool Hospital. How is the UK getting ready for coronavirus?

A medical centre less than a mile from the school has also closed due to a ""confirmed case"" of the virus. It is not clear which part of the UK the other person is from. They contracted the virus in northern Italy. Burbage Primary School in Derbyshire said the decision to close was made independently of health officials Italy now has more than 500 cases of coronavirus with authorities there reporting that 17 people have died. In Tenerife, 168 Britons were told to isolate themselves at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel after at least four guests, including an Italian doctor, tested positive for coronavirus. The Canary Islands minister of health subsequently announced that 130 of about 700 guests staying at the hotel will be able to leave, as they arrived on Monday and did not come into contact with the four Italians who tested positive. About 50 of them are understood to be British. Downing Street has defended the response to the situation at the hotel. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""The Foreign Office has been in contact with more than 100 British nationals who are staying in the hotel. ""They are providing them with support, they are also in regular contact with local authorities and tour companies to share information.""

Can my pet get coronavirus, and other questions Coronavirus boosts demand for Dettol products Globally, more than 80,000 people in more than 40 countries have now been infected. Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus, has killed more than 2,700 people. Most of the deaths have been in China, where the virus originated in December. Ministers and public health officials had always been clear there would be more cases in the UK given the way coronavirus has spread around the globe. Teams from Public Health England will be busy tracing the contacts these two individuals have had on their journeys from Italy and Tenerife and since they returned. This detective work will be essential in containing any further spread of the virus. At the moment we haven't had any human-to-human transmission in the UK. The British government is hopeful it can contain outbreaks. But even if it doesn't, it wants to delay them until the spring or summer when the weather will be warmer and there will be less intense pressure on the NHS. It comes as England's chief medical officer, Prof Whitty, warned onward transmission of the virus between people in the UK was ""just a matter of time in my view"". He said there could be a potential ""social cost"" if the virus intensifies, which could include reducing mass gatherings and closing schools. ""One of the things that's really clear with this virus, much more so than flu, is that anything we do we're going to have to do for quite a long period of time, probably more than two months."" Meanwhile, the Cabinet Office has been in communication with local authorities about their ""mass death preparedness"" - what their plans are to deal with pressures on public services if deaths from coronavirus are severe, BBC Newsnight understands. This includes, among other things, where local authorities might locate new, and perhaps mass, burial sites, should they be needed. As of 27 February, a total of 7,690 people in the UK have been tested for the virus. Of the 15 to have tested positive, eight have so far been discharged from hospital. The risk level in the UK was raised to moderate after the World Health Organization declared it a public health emergency of international concern.

"Italy and Iran have become hotbeds of coronavirus infections The coronavirus outbreak has reached a ""decisive point"" and has ""pandemic potential"", World Health Organization head Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus says. His comments come as countries around the world battle to prevent the virus spreading further. For a second day, more cases have been reported outside than inside China. Iran and Italy have become major centres of infection, with people travelling from there spreading the virus further afield. Several high-profile Iranian officials have become infected, the latest being Vice-President for Women and Family Affairs Masoumeh Ebtekar. ""It's what's happening in the rest of the world that's now our greatest concern,"" Dr Tedros said. As it happened: Updates as cases spread around world How close are we to a pandemic? What you need to know Globally, more than 80,000 people in nearly 50 countries have been infected. Nearly 2,800 have died, the majority in China's Hubei province. Meanwhilestock markets around the world have fallen sharplyamid fears that increased travel restrictions will prevent business activity. Dr Tedros urged governments to act swiftly and aggressively to contain the virus. ""We are actually in a very delicate situation in which the outbreak can go in any direction based on how we handle it,"" he said. ""This is not a time for fear. This is a time for taking action to prevent infection and save lives now,"" he added.

"Italy and Iran have become hotbeds of coronavirus infections The coronavirus outbreak has reached a ""decisive point"" and has ""pandemic potential"", World Health Organization head Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus says. His comments come as countries around the world battle to prevent the virus spreading further. For a second day, more cases have been reported outside than inside China. Iran and Italy have become major centres of infection, with people travelling from there spreading the virus further afield. Several high-profile Iranian officials have become infected, the latest being Vice-President for Women and Family Affairs Masoumeh Ebtekar. ""It's what's happening in the rest of the world that's now our greatest concern,"" Dr Tedros said. As it happened: Updates as cases spread around world How close are we to a pandemic? What you need to know Globally, more than 80,000 people in nearly 50 countries have been infected. Nearly 2,800 have died, the majority in China's Hubei province. Meanwhilestock markets around the world have fallen sharplyamid fears that increased travel restrictions will prevent business activity. Dr Tedros urged governments to act swiftly and aggressively to contain the virus. ""We are actually in a very delicate situation in which the outbreak can go in any direction based on how we handle it,"" he said. ""This is not a time for fear. This is a time for taking action to prevent infection and save lives now,"" he added.

Hong Kong is also keeping schools closed until April. Japan's school closures will affect 13 million students Many parents in Japan are concerned about what they will do with their children.

"Meghan and Harry have been living in Canada intermittently since November 2019 Canada will soon stop providing security for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, the federal government has confirmed. Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) have been providing assistance to the couple since their arrival in Canada ""intermittently since November 2019"". It had not been clear whether Canadians would be paying for their security following their move. The couplewill formally step down as senior royals from 31 March. They will no longer carry out duties on behalf of the Queen but arrangements will be reviewed after 12 months. This video can not be played 'We are all just to call him Harry' They have indicated that they will split their time between the UK and North America. RCMP has been providing security to the couple at the request of the Metropolitan Police. ""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex choosing to re-locate to Canada on a part-time basis presented our government with a unique and unprecedented set of circumstances,"" said Canada's federal Public Safety Minister Bill Blair in a statement on Thursday. 'Just call me Harry', prince tells conference Wallis Simpson's hard lessons for Harry and Meghan The big question Canadians have about royal move ""The RCMP has been engaged with officials in the UK from the very beginning regarding security considerations. As the duke and duchess are currently recognised as Internationally Protected Persons, Canada has an obligation to provide security assistance on an as needed basis."" This video can not be played Justin Trudeau: ""We're not entirely sure what the final decisions will be"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had faced repeated questions over who would be paying to provide security for the prince and his wife Meghan. ""The assistance will cease in the coming weeks, in keeping with their change in status,"" according to the statement from public safety. Neither the Metropolitan Police nor a spokeswoman for the couple would comment on security matters. The Canadian government's confirmation was first reported by CBC News. Earlier this year Harry and Meghan announced they would be stepping back from royal duties and working to become financially independent. Details of how this would workwere then unveiled, following days of talks with the Queen and other senior royals. Why Meghan and Harry have Canada in their sights How might Harry and Meghan make money? The Harry and Meghan story The couple had previously spoken abouthow they had struggled under the media spotlight. The couple have been in Canada with their son Archie for much of this year, after briefly returning to the UK in January following an extended six-week Christmas break on Vancouver Island. When news broke that the couple would be spending part of their time in Canada, one of the main preoccupations was about who would foot the bill, especially if they are spending the bulk of their time as private citizens. A public opinion poll released in January by the non-profit Angus Reid Institute indicated that 73% of Canadians had no interest in paying any of the costs for security and other expenditures associated with their relocation.

"Over A$470,000 has been donated by the family of Quaden Bayles (L), who has been bullied at school for his dwarfism The family of an Australian boy who gained global fame in a viral video after he was bullied have turned down a crowdfunded trip to Disneyland and vow to give the money to charity instead. Yarraka Bayles posted a clip of her son, Quaden, crying after he was targeted at school for his dwarfism. More than $308,000 (Â£240,000) has since been given to an online campaign. His family told local media that they were touched by the gesture, but wanted to focus on ""the real issue"". ""This little fellow has been bullied. How many suicides, black or white, in our society have happened due to bullying?,"" his aunt, Mundanara Bayles, told NITV. ""We want the money to go to community organisations that really need it,"" she added. ""As much as we want to go to Disneyland, I think our community would far off benefit from that."" The video of Quaden crying has been viewed millions of times online The family said they wanted to give the money to two charities: Dwarfism Awareness Australia, and the Balunu Healing Foundation. They said they were also in discussions with Brad Williams, a US comedian who started the campaign on GoFundMe, and who has the same dwarfism condition of Achondroplasia. Quaden led out the Indigenous All-Stars during a rugby match last week Mr Williams stated on the campaign website that ""any excess money"" from the Disneyland trip would be donated to anti-bullying and anti-abuse charities. Under GoFundMe's terms, all donated funds must be used ""solely for the purpose you have stated on and in connection with your campaign"". Aside from the campaign, since the video of Quaden surfaced onlinehe has led a rugby league team out to their match in Queensland. Celebrities like actor Hugh Jackman and basketball player Enes Kanter have alsoshared their support online, while parents in other countries have posted video messages from their own children. In the confronting six-minute video that originally went viral, Quaden's mother describes the relentless bullying experienced by her son every day. The family, who are Aboriginal Australian, live in Queensland. If you or someone you know needs support for issues around this story, in Australia you can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 or Beyond Blue on 1300 224 636.In the UK these organisations may be able to help.

"Arlene Foster told BBC NI's The View there are more important things requiring attention than a border poll First Minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster has suggested there will not be a border poll or a united Ireland in her lifetime. Sinn FÃ©in has said it wants a referendum on Irish reunification within five years. Some recent opinion polls have shown an increase in support for getting rid of the border. However, Mrs Foster told BBC NI's The View there were more important things requiring attention. The Democratic Unionist Party leader, who turns 50 this year, was asked if she thought she would see a united Ireland in her lifetime. She replied: ""No I don't."" Pressed if she thought she would see a border poll in the same timeframe, she again replied: ""No, I don't"". Asked why, she added: ""Because there has to be evidence there. ""As you know the test for a border poll is that people would vote for it in a majority. And there's no evidence of that. ""Yes, people can have different opinion polls, but there's no tangible evidence if you look right across Northern Ireland."" Irish border poll call 'irresponsible' 'Irresponsible' not to plan border vote The DUP failed to respond to an invitation to take part in a discussion in Cookstown this week organised by Shared Ireland, a group which believes unity is the way forward, but which wants everyone, including unionists, involved in the discussion. Former Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt was due to take part but had to withdraw at the last moment. He believes unionists can no longer stay out of such discussions. He told the programme: ""During my lifetime I think there are many examples of unionism's failure to outreach doing damage to the cause. Mike Nesbitt believes unionists can no longer stay out of discussions about Irish unity ""I think of 1985 and the reaction to the Anglo-Irish agreement when they basically alienated every friend we had at Westminster. ""I think of Gerry Adams' first visa to go to the States in '94 when Ian Paisley and Jim Molyneaux stayed home when they should have gone to challenge them. ""And that's what I would have done in Cookstown on Tuesday night, I would have challenged."" However, Colin Harvey, professor of human rights at Queens University, who did take part in the Cookstown event, said unionists faced a challenge. ""There's been a lot of focus on those proposing Irish reunification,"" he said. ""But if these referendums do take place, if there's a referendum in the north, what is the proposition that unionism is going to come up with? ""I think there'll be change. No matter what happens, the current arrangements won't remain static, if there's a vote to remain in the UK or if there's a vote for Irish reunification. ""But I think what this does is it throws down a real challenge. Unionism has been massively complacent. Unionism is effectively sitting on its hands. ""We need to know if there's a referendum here on the constitutional future of this island, what is the unionist proposition."" Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald has repeatedly called for a border poll One Sinn FÃ©in member at the Cookstown event was highly critical of what he called the triumphalism displayed by some of his party colleagues after the Republic's general election. Conal Hamill, a Sinn FÃ©in member from The Moy, told The View: ""Tonight's all about a shared Ireland. ""And I didn't think as a Sinn FÃ©in member, while I understood some of the euphoria associated with getting elected as TDs in various parts of the Republic of Ireland, that it's not helpful in the context of shared Ireland to see that level of triumphalism. ""We can't on one hand complain about the triumphalism of the Orange Order marching in places where they're not welcome and at the same time support that level of triumphalism from a newly elected TD. ""So if I was a northern unionist, if I lived in Larne or Carrickfergus or parts of east Belfast, and I was seriously considering what am I getting into bed with here in terms of a shared Ireland I would have major reservations about that."" The View is broadcast on BBC One NI at 10.35pm on Thursday and then available on the BBC iPlayer. Would some unionists back a united Ireland?

Need something to read on your commute home? Check out this piece about the hundreds of Ethiopians returning to the country, following reforms brought in by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. Mr Abiy's reforms include changing the law to enable more Ethiopians living abroad to come back and help rebuild the economy. For years, Ethiopia's economy has been tightly controlled by the state and closed to many international investors. About two million Ethiopians live in the diaspora, the government estimates. Abiy Bister owns an Ethiopian restaurant in Washington DC. He hasn't seen his homeland in almost two decades, but he's now considering returning to Ethiopia to start a business there. Advertising giant WPP reported a sharp slowdown in sales on Thursday morning. Its pre-tax profit also dropped by 21.9% to Â£982m last year. That pushed its share price down by more than 15%, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 index today. The FTSE 100 has had another bad day. The UK's blue-chip index closed at 6,796.33, after dropping 246.14 points, or 3.50%. The wider FTSE 250 index lost 764.63 points, or 3.71%, to close at 19,858.32. Allow Twitter content?

Sir Roger Gale, president of the All Party Parliamentary Group on General Aviation, spoke to the BBC's World at One about the Court of Appeal's decision on Heathrow. Another comment on the Court of Appeal's ruling against Heathrow's expansion this morning. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, called the decision ""extremely disappointing"". He said: ""The economic
prize is enormous if expansion is done right, with airlines ready to respond to
the unlocking of new capacity by creating new routes and helping to connect the
UK to new markets and destinations, and Heathrow to regions across the country. ""UK aviation has committed to 'net zero' carbon by 2050 and this factors in the
emissions created by Heathrow expansion. It is not a question of being
pro-aviation or pro-environment."" He added: ""We are clear that as a country
we cannot keep fudging this issue if we are to maintain our credibility
internationally. We urge ministers to appeal the decision, back expansion
publicly, and ensure it delivers for the whole country."" Global investors were hit with a sixth day of stock market losses on Thursday, as traders responded to the threat of the coronavirus. The string of declines pushed indexes in Europe and the US down more than 10% from their recent highs - sending them into so-called ""correction"" territory. In the US, the three main indexes slumped more than 2.5% in opening trade, while London's FTSE 100 was almost 4% lower. Japan's Nikkei 225 led losses in Asia. Read more on the story here. Environmental campaigners waited for the decision outside the Royal Courts of Justice on Thursday morning The Unite union has commented on the ruling against the expansion of Heathrow Airport. Its assistant general secretary, Diana Holland, said: ""Hundreds of thousands of jobs are at risk if the
government does not take immediate action to ensure that the Heathrow expansion
goes ahead. However, Unite is adamant this must not be at the expense of the
environment."" She added: ""The government must bring forward new proposals
that are in line with the UKâs environmental commitments.""Urgent action is needed to tackle the climate
emergency that we all face but that must be through a just transition which
does not demonise particular sectors or industries."" Travel stocks have not had a good start to the day on Wall Street. At 15:45, the Royal Caribbean cruise company had dropped by 7.29%. Delta Airlines saw a fall of nearly 5%, down 2.26 points. American Airlines was also down by 8.94%. Some investors suspect that the travel industry will be badly hit by travel restrictions and a slowdown in business caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Researchers have developed a satellite antenna that could end the frustrations of millions of rail passengers. It has been designed toprovide high speed broadband on the movewithout the breaks in connection that plague many rail journeys, particularly in rural areas. Researchers at Heriot-Watt University say it could also be adapted to provide fast broadband aboard airliners much more cheaply than existing systems. Gone are the days when a rail journey meant the morning paper, a cuppa and peace from the demands of work for a while.

Alex Veitch, Head of multimodal policy at the Freight Transport Association  More on the news that the UK housebuilder's chief executive is to stand down. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor says ""the company's reputation is continuing to show cracks as reports of customer complaints are rife"", with concerns over build quality. ""This
has ultimately led to Dave Jenkinsonâs departure and his replacement will need
to rebuild the companyâs image in the wake of an independent review that
reported a failure to install fire-stopping cavity barriers in properties
causing a wave of customer complaints. She added: ""Persimmon
will need to find someone who has the right tools to fix the crisis and
shareholders will be concerned with the potential impact on the companyâs
figures. With the Help to Buy scheme now in its last year, which has been a
source of much revenue, if this ongoing struggle for customer satisfaction is
not sorted by the new boss, the housebuilderâs results will eventually take a
beating."" Wall Street has slumped on opening. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 459.96 points, or 1.71% at the open. This is its sixth day of losses in a row.

A spokesperson said: ""Heathrow is the UKâs only hub airport and plays a key role
in supporting regional connectivity by providing access to established and
emerging markets. ""As an industry, weâre very clear on the need to balance the economic and social
benefits aviation undoubtedly delivers alongside our climate change

Today ProgrammeBBC Radio 4 NMC Health, the middle eastern healthcare firm, said its chief executive Prasanth Manghat has left amid the possibility of discrepancies in its cash balances, uncertainty about a complicated financing arrangement, and suggestions an independent investigation into the situation was obstructed. Russ Mould, Investment Director at stockbroker AJ Bell, told Today that the only certainty is that the company will soon exit the FTSE 100,  because of how much its share price has dropped. A quick update on the FTSE 100 after lunch. At 14:00, the UK's blue-chip index was down by 3%, or 220 points, to 6,821. Some analysts have suggested that fears over the coronavirus outbreak have impacted shares. But Artur Baluszynski, head of research at Henderson Rowe, says that the impact of the virus on the global economy is difficult to quantify and forecast ""as we know very little about infection rates and recovery rates inside China"". The UK government is ""putting ideology ahead of people's livelihoods"" by ""rushing"" to get any trade deal with the EU,Wales' first minister has said. UK ministers say they will decide in June whether to abandon negotiations and prepare for a no-deal Brexit. Ministers say the decision depends on how much ground is covered in talks. Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford warned of the risk of tariffs ""crippling for our farmers and food sector"" if the negotiations fail. The Department for Transport has just released its official statement on the Heathrow decision. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""Airport
expansion is a core part of boosting our global connectivity and levelling up
across the UK and it is critical that vital infrastructure projects, including
airport expansion, drive the whole UK economy. ""We have always
been clear that Heathrow expansion is a private sector project which must
meet strict criteria on air quality, noise and climate change, as well as
being privately financed, affordable, and delivered in the best interest
of consumers."" Mr Shapps confirmed that the government ""has taken the decision not to appeal"" today's judgement. He added: ""We take seriously our commitments on the environment, clean air and
reducing carbon emissions. We will carefully consider this complex judgement and
set out our next steps in due course."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,2.7933107e-05
"A common type of gut bacterium may increase a person's chance of developing bowel cancer, according to a study published in the journalNature,external. The bacterium is a type ofE. coliinfection, present in up to one in five people, scientists believe. It releases a toxin which experts say can damage the cells that line the bowel, potentially turning some cells cancerous over time. There are around 42,000 new cases of bowel cancer each year in the UK. Experts do not yet know how many of these might be linked to theE. colistrain that makes the toxin colibactin. Bowel cancer rates rising 'among young adults' Dame Julie Walters reveals shock of bowel cancer diagnosis The researchers suspect it may contribute to a minority of bowel cancer cases - one in 20 or five in every 100 - but more research is needed to confirm the link. There is no routine test for the bacterium currently, and it is not clear yet that people who have it will be at heightened risk. In some people it may live in the bowel and cause no issue. It is not the first infection to be linked with cancer, however. HPV is a virus that causes cervical cancer and H pylori infection is associated with stomach cancer. No. This particular E. coli strain is not one of the ones linked to food poisoning outbreaks. There are lots of different types of E. coli. Many are part of the normal gut flora - the trillions of bacteria that naturally live in the bowel. The team, from The Netherlands, the UK and the US, used miniature replicas of the human gut, grown in the lab, to test the effects of the toxin on cells. They then compared the damage seen with more than 5,000 bowel cancer samples taken from patients and found identical patterns or ""fingerprints"" of DNA damage in around 5% of the samples. a persistent change in bowel habit - going more often, with looser stools and sometimes tummy pain blood in the stools without other symptoms, such as piles abdominal pain, discomfort or bloating always brought on by eating - sometimes resulting in a reduction in the amount of food eaten and weight loss Most people with these symptoms do not have bowel cancer, but the NHS advice is to see your GP if you have one or more of the symptoms and they have persisted for more than four weeks. Source:NHS UK,external Experts say it may be possible to develop a more sensitive test to detect early bowel tumours using this knowledge about the toxin. The findings may also offer a way to prevent some bowel cancers, by getting rid of the bacterium from the body before it can do any harm, using existing antibiotics. One of the researchers, Prof Hans Clevers, from the Hubrecht Institute in The Netherlands, said: ""Common antibiotics will kill these bacteria. ""This is the first time we've seen such a distinctive pattern of DNA damage in bowel cancer, which has been caused by a bacterium that lives in our gut."" He said there may be other gut bacteria that do the same. Probiotic treatments that contain a similar strain of E. coli, called Nissle 1917, might also pose a risk potentially, he added - but these are not the same ones found in yoghurt drinks sold in supermarkets. ""Although it might sound scary, there's still lots left to understand about our how our gut bacteria affect our health, what we could do about it, and how much impact it has on bowel cancer risk,"" says Nicola Smith, senior health information Manager at Cancer Research UK, who funded the work. ""In the future, knowing what role bacteria in our gut plays could change the way we detect and prevent bowel cancer. ""But we do know that around half of bowel cancer cases can be prevented by not smoking, keeping a healthy weight and eating a balanced diet - so there's plenty of changes that you can make right now that will reduce your risk,"" she added. Genevieve Edwards, chief executive at Bowel Cancer UK, said: ""Although this research is at an early stage, it adds to the growing body of evidence about the role that bacteria and other microorganisms that live in our gut may play in bowel cancer development.

"Singer-songwriter James Newman will represent the United Kingdom at this year's Eurovision Song Contest. He'll perform My Last Breath at the event's final in Rotterdam in The Netherlands on 16 May. Speaking to Radio 1 Newsbeat, James hopes his ""simple, memorable and anthemic"" song will help win votes. James is a successful pop songwriter and has written for acts including Ed Sheeran and Jess Glynne, and is the older brother of John Newman. Allow YouTube content?

The UK's looking to improve on 2019's contest, when Michael Rice's X-Factor style ballad Bigger Than Us finishedin last place. It marked the fourth time the UK had come bottom of the table but James says he doesn't feel nervous at that prospect. He feels his song will ""connect"" with the audience and says he has a ""massive opportunity to get my song out to the world in such a big way"". James has co-written song for pop acts such as Ed Sheeran, Little Mix and Louis Tomlinson James is signed to record label BMG, who the BBC have worked with to select and produce this year's entry. After he was approached, James says he had a ""little think"" before saying yes but decided Eurovision was a ""celebration of music"". While the United Kingdom is still one of the most successful countries in the 63-year history of the contest (five wins in total), it's seen little success since its last win in 1997. Whilst many still associate the event with camp, cheese and tackiness, the modern day contest is a slick production where many countries send their best acts. Eurovision is the world's largest live music event, with organisers claiming the 2019 edition was seen by 182 million viewers across 40 markets. Duncan Laurence won the 2019 contest for the Netherlands with his stirring ballad, Arcade. ""Since I was a little kid, I've always wanted to be an artist and performer myself,"" says James. ""It just feels like the right time to start putting songs out."" He says he's lucky to have a brother like John (Newman) who's used to performing in front of thousands of people but, with a cheeky smile, he reckons it's time to show everyone who the ""actual good singer"" is. My Last Breath was written in Scotland when he was staying near a loch with his mates (and fellow songwriters) Ed Drewett, Iain James and Adam Argyle. ""We were jumping in the loch every morning. This was January. It was freezing."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

The song was inspired by a documentary about a diver in the North Sea who has to be saved after getting cut off from the rest of his crew, and the video features Dutch cold water swimmer Wim Hof. ""It got us thinking about what you would for other people."" Iain James already has Eurovision credentials, co-writing Azerbaijan's 2011 winning entry, Running Scared. James Newman also has Eurovision history himself after writing Ireland's 2017 entry - but it didn't qualify for the final. There was a weird moment when Greg James played the UK's Eurovision song on BBC Radio 1. There it was, sandwiched between tracks by Harry Styles and Dua Lipa and... it didn't sound like his show had been hacked. That's down to the pedigree of James Newman and his co-writers, who have written hits for some of the UK's biggest pop exports of the last decade. My Last Breath ticks all the Eurovision boxes: It's a mid-tempo banger with a Coldplay-style ""woah-oh"" hook and a lyric about undying love. Granted, the central metaphor is weirdly macabre (it concerns two scuba divers running out of air) but somehow that makes it more memorable. It doesn't feel like a winner but nor does it feel like an embarrassment. And that, at least, is progress. James won a Brit Award for co-writing Waiting All Night, performed by Rudimental and Ella Eyre Over the past decade, the BBC has tried two strategies for Eurovision, with neither providing amazing results. From 2011 to 2015, the act was internally selected by the BBC, with Blue's I Can getting the best result. It placed 11th out of 25 in 2011. From 2016 to 2019, the act was selected with a public vote. Of those, Lucie Jones' 2017 ballad I'll Never Give Up On You placed 15th. The last time the UK actually got into the Eurovision final top ten was in 2009, when Jade Ewen performed the Andrew Lloyd Webber-penned track It's My Time and came fifth. This year, the United Kingdom's strategy has changed once again, with the BBC essentially giving record label BMG free rein to choose the act and curate the performance. No matter what happens when the votes start rolling in, James says it's an ""amazing thing to be singing something you love in front of all those people.""

"Sales of Dettol and Lysol products have surged as the spread of the coronavirus outbreak continues. The disinfectant is seen as providing protection against the spread of the disease, although its effectiveness has not yet been scientifically proven. In China, demand for Dettol-branded hand gels is outstripping supply, owner Reckitt Benckiser has said. The shortages come as global markets slump for a sixth day, with the FTSE 100 down more than 3%. Luxury carmaker Aston Martin and drinks giant Anheuser-Busch InBev are the latest to warn of the virus's impact on their businesses. Shares in AB InBev, the world's largest beer maker, fell 9% after it forecast muted growth in 2020, partly due to the outbreak Aston Martin shares tumbled to a record low as it posted a Â£104m loss before tax and warned it had seen demand drop because of the virus. ""We are seeing some increased demand for Dettol and Lysol products and are working to support the relevant healthcare authorities and agencies, including through donations, information and education.  We do see increased activity online for our consumers in China,"" Dettol owner Reckitt Benckiser said in its results on Thursday. Coronavirus prompts buyers to look closer to home London firms sending staff home amid coronavirus fears Drinks giant warns of profit hit as bars close ""If you look at China today, what you are seeing is that consumer traffic to store is down, but you do see activity moving to online,"" Reckitt Benckiser chief executive Laxman Narasimhan said. He added the firm had ""seen some disruptions to retail and distribution channels and getting products in to market"", meaning the effect on company performance had been balanced. Hand washing with soap is one of the key health messages promoted by governments in the face of the outbreak, and Dettol and Lysol are two of the world's leading disinfectants. Online pharmacy Medino said it had also seen a sharp rise in demand for hand sanitiser in the UK since the beginning of early February, and said some suppliers were starting to struggle. ""A number of these customers are not our regular buyers, rather we're seeing new customers purchasing large quantities of hand sanitiser suggesting people are stockpiling in response to recent events,"" said superintendent pharmacist Giulia Guerrini. Meanwhile, AB InBev forecast a 10% decline in first-quarter profit after the coronavirus outbreak hurt beer sales during the Chinese New Year. Aston Martin - which counts China as its fastest-growing market - also said on Thursday that the outbreak was affecting its sales and supply chain. ""Markets are moving on from thinking it's all going to blow over and it's all going to be fine to realising there clearly are some issues here,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.

"This video can not be played 'We're not convinced' on drug consumption rooms Plans for drug consumption rooms to get addicts off the streets have been called a ""distraction"" by the UK government minister for crime. Kit Malthouse said the drug deaths crisis gripping Scotland demanded ""a more assertive approach"". Glasgow's plan for a special facility to allow users to take their own drugs under medical supervision are backed by the Scottish government. But drug legislation is reserved to the Westminster government. Drug support services 'disappearing' due to government cuts It has refused to allow Glasgow City Council to pilot the scheme, which the council says would encourage the hundreds of users who inject heroin or cocaine on the city's streets to enter a safe and clean environment. It is hoped the special room would encourage addicts into treatment, cut down on heroin needles on city streets and counter the spread of diseases such as HIV. However, ahead of a UK-wide summit on drug deaths being held at Glasgow's SEC, Mr Malthouse toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""We have to recognise this is a complicated problem and there is no silver bullet solution. Other countries have introduced drug consumption rooms ""To me, drug consumption rooms are a bit of a distraction."" He said research from around the world showed ""mixed"" results for consumption rooms. ""They are quite small scale and the scale of the problem demands a much more assertive approach,"" he said. Mr Malthouse called for more drug treatment alongside education and support. He also said that more needed to be done to disrupt drug supplies, especially online and social media, using ""intelligent enforcement"". Almost 4,300 people died from drug misuse across the UK in 2018, a record figure, and the numbers for last year are expected to be just as high. Deaths in England and Wales increased significantly but the rate remains much lower than in Scotland. Scotland accounted for more than a quarter of UK drug deaths, which was far higher than its share of the population. The latest figures showed an average of more than three people a day dying of drug overdoses in Scotland. What can be done about Scotland's drugs crisis? Scotland's drug death crisis in six charts 'Bold' action needed to tackle drugs deaths Scotland's Public Health Minister Joe FitzPatrick told the summit in Glasgow that an extra Â£20m in government funding would be made available for drug rehabilitation and mental health support for addicts. He said he remained convinced that ""a public health approach to this emergency is the right way forward""  rather than trying to punish users for breaking the law. The minister added: ""The UK government has made it clear at their summit that they are not willing to consider the bold, innovative approaches to this problem that I feel are needed. ""However, that doesn't mean we will stop fighting for what we believe is right and this extra investment will help us in our efforts to save lives."" It is more than three years since Glasgow City Council first proposed drug consumption rooms. The leader of Glasgow City Council, Susan Aitken, said her city had the most drug deaths in the UK, 280 in 2018. ""This is a critical situation for our entire city - we are in the throes of a crisis and an emergency response is required,"" she said. Ms Aitken called on the UK government to support new approaches, such as safe consumption rooms, in an attempt to get addicts off the streets. Dr Saket Priyadarshi, from Glasgow Alcohol and Drug Recovery Services, said a drug consumption facility would be a good way to reach people with whom they have no contact to begin recovery. He said it was urgently needed and could not see an argument against it. Glasgow wants to open a safe consumption room to get users of the streets Both the UK and Scottish governments agree that tackling addiction and rising drug death levels should be a priority. However, both remain at odds over how best to help some of the country's most vulnerable addicts. At the heart of the Scottish government agenda is a public health approach, exemplified by the drastic reduction in drug deaths in Portugal. It involves decriminalising possession of small amounts of drugs, wrap-around services and potentially the introduction of so-called ""fix rooms"" - facilities where addicts can inject drugs safely under supervision. But to do this, says the Scottish government, it requires devolution of drug policy and changes to the Misuse of Drugs Act. The UK government's Home Office are reluctant. As well as Tory unwillingness to appear ""soft"" on drugs, Home Office policing minister Kit Malthouse has already said divergence in drug policy north of the border would be encouraging for English gangs seeking more opportunity to flood Scottish towns with illegal drugs. Recovery charities have expressed fears that these two summits could end up being another political point-scoring exercise. If that's the case, the ones losing out are the ones dying.

"Rail passengers like to stay in touch digitally while they are travelling Researchers have developed a satellite antenna that could end frustration for millions of rail passengers. It has been designed to provide high speed broadband on the move without the breaks in connection that plague many rail journeys, particularly in rural areas. Researchers at Heriot-Watt University say it could also be adapted to provide fast broadband aboard airliners much more cheaply than existing systems. Gone are the days when a rail journey meant the morning paper, a cuppa and peace from the demands of work for a while. Now we're expected to stay in touch digitally. And our smartphones and tablets don't just give us the ability to reply to emails and work on spreadsheets. Others value the opportunity to interact on social media or watch amusing videos of kittens. But if you're on a train that can be hit and miss to say the least. Even if your carriage has wi-fi, whether you can use it to contact the rest of the world typically depends on the quality of the mobile phone network outside. Mobile networks tend to cover the built up areas where there are more customers. Even there, the masts weren't located to favour railway lines. In rural areas the problem of ""notspots"" - areas of poor or no signal - is more acute. Given that at the last count there were almost 1.8bn rail passenger journeys in the UK every year, that's a lot of watching those irritating little spinning wheels that tell you your device is trying in vain to connect. The alternative is to connect the train wi-fi to a satellite.  But this also has its problems. Unless a satellite is geostationary, orbiting above a fixed point on the Earth's surface, it is moving across the sky. To establish a link, an antenna has to maintain contact with one or more moving satellites from a train which is itself on the move. Another problem: you can't feasibly stick a satellite dish on top of a train. Certainly not in the restricted clearances of the UK rail network. But the Heriot-Watt research, soon to become a spinout company called Infinect, has come up with a solution: a flat antenna a little over half a metre across. Just right for the top of a train carriage. Samuel Rotenberg has been working on the new development Research engineer Samuel Rotenberg says it will communicate with satellites throughout a journey. ""It's fairly lightweight, at a fraction of the cost of existing solutions and will provide global coverage,"" he said. George Goussetis, professor of antenna engineering at Heriot-Watt, is principal investigator on the project. He says it has taken a decade of research to get from the basic idea of satellite-equipped trains to market. ""There's been a lot of investment in being able to deliver broadband connectivity via satellite,"" he says. ""There have been multi-billion investments in the space sector, a lot of new standards - and it looks like the flat panel antenna is the missing piece in that puzzle."" Mr Rotenberg is confident they've created that piece, and he says it offers much more than being able to update your social media profile from seat 16B. Professor George Goussetis says it has taken 10 years to get the product to market Linking the train to the ""internet of things"" will improve the security of the train and all aboard. ""When they are in a remote area, the train operator doesn't have any control over the train,"" he says. ""They don't know where they are, what speed, if there is an accident or an emergency. ""They are completely blind - and they need information."" A data stream from sensors via satellite will deliver it. The prototype antenna is expected to enter field trials with a big rail operator before the end of 2020. Funding for the research has come from the European Space Agency, the Department for Transport and the High Growth Spin-Out Programme run by Scottish Enterprise. Mr Rotenberg, now co-founder and lead engineer of Infinect, has also won a place on the ICURe Innovation to Commercialisation Programme funded by the innovation agency Innovate UK. The prospect of seamless, fast broadband on the move seems closer than ever.  Is there a catch? Yes. Tunnels. This is advanced technology, not magic.  So when the antenna can't see a satellite the signal stops. But the new antenna means it will pick up again just as soon as your train comes out the other end. So those cute kittens will have to stay on pause for just a couple of minutes.

"This video can not be played Quicker than takeaway: BBC News investigates quick delivery of drugs in Leeds More illegal drugs than ever before are coming into the UK - and buying them is almost as easy as ordering a pizza, the author of a major new report has said. Dame Carol Black also found that an ""unprecedented"" number of children and teenagers are being drawn into the drug trade through county lines gangs. Herdrugs review,externalput the costs of the illicit trade in crime and to society at about Â£19bn a year in England. The government said it was taking ""tough action"" to combat illegal drugs. Dame Carol, who the Home Office asked last year to review drug supply and demand in the UK, presented her findings on Thursday. The ""widespread"" use of children to supply drugs was the ""most alarming"" recent development, she told the UK Drugs Summit in Glasgow. Her report also found that the illicit drugs market in the UK is worth Â£9.4bn a year, with about three million people in England and Wales taking them last year. 'We're here to make money and not get killed' 'County-lines gangs fuelling' child slavery rise Children in drugs gangs 'to be treated as victims' Dame Carol told the conference: ""We have an abundant supply coming into our countries from around the world, more than ever before. ""It's purer, it's more available, you can buy whichever drug you want almost anywhere. ""It wouldn't be too far to go to say it's almost for some drugs as easy as getting your pizza."" The comparison came after an investigation by BBC News foundit took just 27 minutes to receive an order of cocainefrom a drug dealer in Leeds. The key conclusion of Dame Carol Black's report on illegal drugs - that a ""perfect storm"" has developed that can be abated only through government intervention - is based on compelling evidence from an impressive array of statistics and information. The headline figure - the Â£19bn cost to society of illicit drugs in England - is designed to act as a wake-up call. It is about half of the National Crime Agency estimate of the total cost of serious and organised crime to the UK economy and around three times as much as the cost of treating and dealing with the effects of obesity in England. There is no simple solution to reducing the economic costs of drug-taking, not to mention the human toll, but Dame Carol indicates there must be investment in treatment. A report from Public Health England in 2014 found that every pound spent on drug treatment saved Â£2.50 in costs to society. However, her review raises more questions than answers about the overall effectiveness of law enforcement activity on illicit drugs, saying crackdowns have little impact on supply and may increase violence by creating a gap in the market for dealers to battle over. Dame Carol highlighted the effect of government funding cuts on drug recovery support services - which she said were ""disappearing"" in certain areas. She said: ""At the same time we have seen a reduction in very good treatment and recovery, and that again all adds up to leave us, as you will see in this report, with the perfect storm. ""I believe this perfect storm will not go away unless government takes action."" Her report, which was released to coincide with a drugs summit held by the UK government in Glasgow, said drug-related deaths are at an all-time high, while the market is becoming increasingly violent. It found 300,000 people in England used the most harmful drugs - opiates and crack cocaine - last year. The review said the ""county lines"" model is now a widely-used method for supplying the most serious drugs. County lines is a tactic which sees gangs and distribution networks from cities move into smaller towns and use violence to overtake local drug dealers. The model relies on children or other vulnerable people to sell drugs. Crime minister Kit Malthouse, who is chairing the Glasgow summit, said: ""The findings, which we will discuss today, are troubling and paint a stark picture of how illegal drugs are devastating lives and communities, and fuelling serious violence. ""We are already taking tough action to combat county lines and violent crime and to disrupt and prosecute the organised gangs that bring so much misery. But clearly we all need to do more.""

"This video can not be played Michael Gove: UK is not seeking EU rules alignment The UK has warned the EU it will walk away from trade talks in June unless there is a ""broad outline"" of a deal. Michael Gove told MPs the UK wanted to strike a ""comprehensive free trade agreement"" in 10 months. But the government would not accept any alignment with EU laws as the EU is demanding, with Mr Gove adding: ""We will not trade away our sovereignty."" The EU has already set out its priorities ahead of the formal start of the talks on Monday. The government haspublished a 30-page document,externaloutlining its priorities for the talks. Faisal Islam: UK warns it could abandon EU trade talks in June UK to end agreement with EU to extradite criminals EU ministers agree UK trade talks mandate PM gives green light to post-Brexit research deal The UK document says: The UK ""will not negotiate any arrangements in which the UK does not have control of its own laws and political life"" The UK's aim is for a trading relationship with the EU similar to the ones the 27-nation bloc has with Canada, Japan and South Korea There will be no jurisdiction for EU law or the European Court of Justice in the UK The UK will rely on World Trade Organization rules under an arrangement with the EU similar to Australia's if progress on a comprehensive deal cannot be made A separate agreement on fisheries is needed, to reflect the fact that ""the UK will be an independent coastal state at the end of 2020"" The government wants to agree a ""broad outline"" of a deal with the EU ""capable of being rapidly finalised by September"" in the next four months If that does not happen it will decide whether to switch focus to leaving on WTO terms at the end of December The UK officially left the EU at the end of January, but is continuing to abide by many EU rules while talks on a permanent trading relationship take place. Mr Johnson has pledged to get a deal with the EU by the end of the so-called transition period - 31 December 2020 - and has said he is not prepared to extend that deadline. The UK's negotiating team will be led by Mr Johnson's Europe adviser David Frost. Thought Brexit was done? Sorry to disappoint, but the process of defining Britain's new relationship with the EU as a non-member state is only just getting going. We'll soon be back to the days of crunch talks, the prospect of no deal and the two sides locking horns. What's different now though? Boris Johnson has a huge majority and gone are the days of disunity in the Conservative party that we saw under Theresa May. So the government is being forthright about what it wants from these negotiations - to pull away from the EU and form a new relationship with the bloc as other non-member states have already done. We can already see where the flashpoints are likely to be. But the Conservative manifesto promised a negotiated trade agreement this year - we'll see in the coming months how likely that's looking. David Frost (l) and Michel Barnier (r) will lead the negotiating teams Both sides agree that the UK will not undercut existing regulations on the environment, workers rights, competition and international tax principles. But, says BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming, there are ""some big obvious flashpoints"". 'Dynamic alignment':The UK does not want to follow EU legislation as it is updated in the future. The EU is concerned about the UK gaining a competitive advantage. State aid:The UK wants the freedom to subsidise domestic industries of its choice. Brussels wants state aid restrictions to continue ""in perpetuity"". Governance:The EU wants a ""blockbuster"" agreement covering everything from fisheries, aviation, energy to immigration. The UK wants different deals in these areas. Fishing:The UK wants quota deals like the EU has with Iceland or Norway. The EU wants continued access to UK waters. The EU's46-page negotiating document,external, published on Monday, indicated that the UK could be expected to keep aligned with changes to EU rules covering state subsidies for industry, environmental standards and workers' rights in future. Any trade agreement ""should uphold common high standards, and corresponding high standards over time with Union standards as a reference point"", it added. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson told BBC News: ""The whole objective of doing what we're doing is so the UK can do things differently and better."" He added: ""All we want is mutual recognition of each other's high standards and access to each other's markets. ""We wouldn't ask the EU to follow every particular change in UK legislation so it doesn't make any sense for them to make the same requirement of us and that's where we are."" The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said Brussels is prepared to give the UK ""super-preferential access"" to the EU market of 450 million people. But he said the UK has to accept alignment with EU rules as they develop to ensure fair competition with EU states, effectively ruling out a Canada-style deal. Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? EU warns UK over goods checks between NI and GB Brexit: What is a level playing field? ""The UK says that it wants Canada. But the problem with that is that the UK is not Canada,"" Mr Barnier told an event at the European Parliament on Wednesday. ""This is because of Britain's proximity to the EU and the much larger trade volumes it has with the EU than with Canada."" Michael Gove, the minister in charge of delivering Brexit, hit back in his statement to MPs, saying: ""Geography is no reason to undermine democracy. ""We will not be seeking to dynamically align with EU rules on EU terms governed by EU laws and EU institutions."" Labour's shadow Exiting the EU minister Paul Blomfield said the government's negotiating strategy was ""frankly underwhelming"". He told MPs the government had a ""cavalier disregard"" for the consequences of failing to conclude a deal in the next 10 months and the uncertainty that would mean for business. The Scottish National Party's Pete Wishart said: ""This is nothing other than a routemap to the cherished no-deal - the real ambition of these Brexit zealots."" Critics say leaving without an agreement and going to World Trade Organisation rules - the terms countries use to set tariffs (taxes) on goods when they do not have free-trade deals - could damage the economy.

"Staff at the chicken chain Nando's claim they sometimes have to clean its restaurants without pay. Current and former Nando's employees at multiple restaurants told the BBC they had to scrub cookers and disinfect toilets after being clocked out. One claimed the same mops were used in toilets and kitchens while another said they handled chicken without gloves. Nando's said it was its policy to pay employees properly and it upholds the highest cleaning standards. Most of its branches do not employ dedicated cleaners - which Nando's described as standard across the food service industry. The company, which has more than 400 restaurants in the UK, added: ""Cleaning is an integral part of restaurant work and is crucial to maintaining high standards of health and hygiene, which we take very seriously."" Thousands of people have signed an online petition calling on Nando's to review its cleaning and pay policies. ""The managers would clock us out early and not adjust for late stays. If we complained, we were simply told we should have worked faster,"" people commenting onthe petition claimed,external. Most Nando's branches do not employ a dedicated cleaner The BBC spoke to five current and former Nando's staff - dubbed ""Nandocas"" by the company - they all requested anonymity. For most, Nando's was their first job. Collectively they have worked in seven different restaurants across England and Scotland within the past 12 months. They were broadly complimentary about Nando's as a workplace. ""You do make friendsâ¦ it's social,"" one said. ""It's saved me Â£45 a week in free food,"" another added. But almost all highlighted problems with how closing shifts are managed and some alleged incidents of poor cleaning practices. 'Costa Coffee took Â£200 from my pay for training' Costa Coffee workers 'not treated like humans' Wahaca changes eat-and-run bill policy They all described closing shifts as ending when a manager - known as a ""Patrao"" - signed off the restaurant as ready for the next day. The system automatically clocks staff out unless managers override it, but that did not always happen, the workers claimed. ""I would get my payslip on a Friday and find I'd have less money than expected because they didn't put in the hours on my closing shifts,"" a 22-year-old, who we're calling Suzanne, said. ""There was a time where we'd run over and finished around 02:30 in the morning and the managers had already put it through the system and they wouldn't add on the extra hours."" More than 10 reviews about Nando's posted on Glassdoor mention unpaid overtime ""You would be usually clocked out early and I thought that was a normal thing. I just thought they pay us for extra hours,"" said 19-year-old Jenny - not her real name - who worked at a Nando's in Cheshire. ""I did ask colleagues 'are we actually getting paid?' and they said... 'we don't actually get paid, you have to bug them for it'. ""You have to ask [managers] 'can I have the extra pay for the close' and they wouldn't always actually do it."" One current member of staff who works in the kitchen of a Nando's in the south-west of England said that he was almost always paid properly for overtime. But there were occasional mistakes. ""We had this one staff member who, when [his hours] got put through completely wrong, didn't get paid so the manager gave him the money out of his own pocket,"" the 20-year-old said. Several of those the BBC spoke to said Nando's uses an industry-standard colour-coded system to separate cleaning equipment. For example, a green mop is used in kitchens, while a red mop is used to clean toilets. Suzanne, who worked at a Nando's in Manchester city centre, claimed she rarely saw the red mop head used in the 12 months she worked there. ""The kitchen staff will close first... they wouldn't really take the time out to use the correct coloured mop,"" she said. ""You can use any bucket or any mop, which was a huge problem because whatever is in the kitchen would be contaminated in the toilets."" Meanwhile, Jenny claimed she was required to cook chicken and clean toilets without protection for a week due to a supply issue. ""That means that raw chicken was being racked [cooked] without hair nets or gloves and also toilets had to be cleaned when we didn't have the option of wearing gloves at all,"" she said. Nando's - which has around 20,000 staff in Britain - has also responded to complaints which mention unpaid overtime and arduous cleaning duties made on the employment review website Glassdoor. Employment lawyer Katie Mahoney said managers' control of the clocking out system could be a breach of trust which may ""entitle the employee to resign and claim constructive dismissal"". ""Depending on the terms of the contract, they may also be able to argue that the failure to pay them for the hours they have actually worked has resulted in an unlawful deduction from their wages,"" she added. Staff said cleaning tasks ranged from mopping floors to bleaching toilet bowls and urinals The petition calling on Nando's to review its cleaning and pay policies was created on the campaigns website Organise, which told the BBC it is supported by 551 people who said they work there. It has so far gained more than 3,700 signatures. The BBC understands the company has ""reinforced"" its clocking-out policy to managers as a result of the petition. Organise founder Nat Whalley said: ""Hundreds of Nando's staff are now speaking up together to stamp out missing pay."" A Nando's spokesperson told the BBC: ""We wholeheartedly refute the accusation that we would ask or expect our employees to do unpaid work. ""Without exception, our policy across all our restaurants is to pay all of our employees for all the work they do, and we take this incredibly seriously. ""If human error ever does occur, it is rectified without delay."" ""As is standard across the industry, cleaning is an essential role for employees, and this is made clear to all job applicants,"" they added. ""Cleaning is an integral part of restaurant work and is crucial to maintaining high standards of health and hygiene, which we take very seriously. Any employee who is asked to clean is given full training."" The spokesperson said: ""99% of our restaurants across the country have a rating of four or five under the Food Hygiene Scheme"".

"The government will decide in June whether to abandon talks with the EU and prepare for no trade deal on World Trade Organization terms. The decision will be made if insufficient ground has been covered in talks with the EU. The acid test will be if what it calls ""good progress"" has not been made on areas such as financial services and data, which the government sees as the easiest areas to negotiate. The approach was revealed in the publication of its negotiating mandate for the talks, which begin next week. It echoes the EU approach to sequencing negotiations in the first phase of Brexit talks, seeking to settle issues of significant importance to the UK early, over which the EU has unilateral power. UK prepared to ditch EU trade talks in June The EU has so far refused, for example, to negotiate its power to determine whether UK financial services have ""equivalent"" standards for its trade with the EU, or whether UK's data regulations are adequate in terms of the flow of electronic information. The government has also played down the prospect of doing an immediate numerical economic assessment of the introduction of new trading arrangements with the EU, although a public consultation will begin in the spring, after the formal start of negotiations. The UK mandate emphasises the government's wish for a trading relationship with the EU based on its existing precedents with Canada, Japan and South Korea. It allows no jurisdiction for EU law or the European Court of Justice in the UK. ""The government will work hard to agree arrangements on these lines,"" the document says. ""However if it is not possible to negotiate a satisfactory outcome, then the trading relationship with the EU will rest on the 2019 Withdrawal Agreement and will look similar to Australia's."" The mandate seeks a suite of different agreements on fisheries, aviation, energy and migration, unlike the EU mandate, which seeks one whole agreement covering everything. The document also says that it hopes the broad outline of an agreement should be clear by June, and capable of being ""rapidly finalised"" by September. In the meantime, the government will push on for preparations for the reintroduction of customs and regulatory formalities on trade with the EU in January 2021, and expects businesses to follow suit.

"This video can not be played Michael Gove: UK is not seeking EU rules alignment The UK has warned the EU it will walk away from trade talks in June unless there is a ""broad outline"" of a deal. Michael Gove told MPs the UK wanted to strike a ""comprehensive free trade agreement"" in 10 months. But the government would not accept any alignment with EU laws as the EU is demanding, with Mr Gove adding: ""We will not trade away our sovereignty."" The EU has already set out its priorities ahead of the formal start of the talks on Monday. The government haspublished a 30-page document,externaloutlining its priorities for the talks. Faisal Islam: UK warns it could abandon EU trade talks in June UK to end agreement with EU to extradite criminals EU ministers agree UK trade talks mandate PM gives green light to post-Brexit research deal The UK document says: The UK ""will not negotiate any arrangements in which the UK does not have control of its own laws and political life"" The UK's aim is for a trading relationship with the EU similar to the ones the 27-nation bloc has with Canada, Japan and South Korea There will be no jurisdiction for EU law or the European Court of Justice in the UK The UK will rely on World Trade Organization rules under an arrangement with the EU similar to Australia's if progress on a comprehensive deal cannot be made A separate agreement on fisheries is needed, to reflect the fact that ""the UK will be an independent coastal state at the end of 2020"" The government wants to agree a ""broad outline"" of a deal with the EU ""capable of being rapidly finalised by September"" in the next four months If that does not happen it will decide whether to switch focus to leaving on WTO terms at the end of December The UK officially left the EU at the end of January, but is continuing to abide by many EU rules while talks on a permanent trading relationship take place. Mr Johnson has pledged to get a deal with the EU by the end of the so-called transition period - 31 December 2020 - and has said he is not prepared to extend that deadline. The UK's negotiating team will be led by Mr Johnson's Europe adviser David Frost. Thought Brexit was done? Sorry to disappoint, but the process of defining Britain's new relationship with the EU as a non-member state is only just getting going. We'll soon be back to the days of crunch talks, the prospect of no deal and the two sides locking horns. What's different now though? Boris Johnson has a huge majority and gone are the days of disunity in the Conservative party that we saw under Theresa May. So the government is being forthright about what it wants from these negotiations - to pull away from the EU and form a new relationship with the bloc as other non-member states have already done. We can already see where the flashpoints are likely to be. But the Conservative manifesto promised a negotiated trade agreement this year - we'll see in the coming months how likely that's looking. David Frost (l) and Michel Barnier (r) will lead the negotiating teams Both sides agree that the UK will not undercut existing regulations on the environment, workers rights, competition and international tax principles. But, says BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming, there are ""some big obvious flashpoints"". 'Dynamic alignment':The UK does not want to follow EU legislation as it is updated in the future. The EU is concerned about the UK gaining a competitive advantage. State aid:The UK wants the freedom to subsidise domestic industries of its choice. Brussels wants state aid restrictions to continue ""in perpetuity"". Governance:The EU wants a ""blockbuster"" agreement covering everything from fisheries, aviation, energy to immigration. The UK wants different deals in these areas. Fishing:The UK wants quota deals like the EU has with Iceland or Norway. The EU wants continued access to UK waters. The EU's46-page negotiating document,external, published on Monday, indicated that the UK could be expected to keep aligned with changes to EU rules covering state subsidies for industry, environmental standards and workers' rights in future. Any trade agreement ""should uphold common high standards, and corresponding high standards over time with Union standards as a reference point"", it added. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson told BBC News: ""The whole objective of doing what we're doing is so the UK can do things differently and better."" He added: ""All we want is mutual recognition of each other's high standards and access to each other's markets. ""We wouldn't ask the EU to follow every particular change in UK legislation so it doesn't make any sense for them to make the same requirement of us and that's where we are."" The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said Brussels is prepared to give the UK ""super-preferential access"" to the EU market of 450 million people. But he said the UK has to accept alignment with EU rules as they develop to ensure fair competition with EU states, effectively ruling out a Canada-style deal. Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? EU warns UK over goods checks between NI and GB Brexit: What is a level playing field? ""The UK says that it wants Canada. But the problem with that is that the UK is not Canada,"" Mr Barnier told an event at the European Parliament on Wednesday. ""This is because of Britain's proximity to the EU and the much larger trade volumes it has with the EU than with Canada."" Michael Gove, the minister in charge of delivering Brexit, hit back in his statement to MPs, saying: ""Geography is no reason to undermine democracy. ""We will not be seeking to dynamically align with EU rules on EU terms governed by EU laws and EU institutions."" Labour's shadow Exiting the EU minister Paul Blomfield said the government's negotiating strategy was ""frankly underwhelming"". He told MPs the government had a ""cavalier disregard"" for the consequences of failing to conclude a deal in the next 10 months and the uncertainty that would mean for business. The Scottish National Party's Pete Wishart said: ""This is nothing other than a routemap to the cherished no-deal - the real ambition of these Brexit zealots."" Critics say leaving without an agreement and going to World Trade Organisation rules - the terms countries use to set tariffs (taxes) on goods when they do not have free-trade deals - could damage the economy.

"The Supreme Court has reversed a decision to block plans for a controversial third runway at Heathrow Airport. It means that developerscan now seek planning permission for the project,which faces opposition from environmentalists and local residents. Heathrow is already the UK's busiest airport, serving about 80 million passengers per year. The airport currently has four terminals and two runways. Supporters of a new runway say it would boost international trade and provide many new jobs. Building the new runway would involve diverting rivers, moving roads and rerouting the M25 through a tunnel under the new runway. The proposal also includes upgrades to existing terminals two and five and plans to build new car parks. Heathrow Airport has said the project would be funded privately. The expansion would benefit passengers,boost the wider economy by up to Â£61bn and create up to 77,000 local jobs by 2030,,externalaccording to the Department for Transport. More than 40% of the UK's exports to non-EU countries now go through Heathrow, according to its chief executive John Holland-Kaye. He said a third runway was vital in order to strengthen international trade links. ""If we don't expand our only hub airport, then we're going to be flying through Paris to get to global markets,"" he said. Heathrow Airport also says it would introduce legally-binding environmental targets - including on noise, air quality and carbon emissions. Climate campaigners win Heathrow expansion case Heathrow third runway 'delayed for 12 months' MPs vote in favour of expansion 'Where's Boris?' shout Heathrow debate MPs Local and environmental groups have dismissed Heathrow Airport's assurances and have argued that a new runway would mean unacceptable levels of noise and pollution, as well as adding to the UK's carbon emissions from the increased number of flights. The proposal also""makes a mockery"",externalof the government's 2050 carbon neutral strategy, according to Green MP Caroline Lucas. Rupa Huq - the Labour MP for neighbouring Ealing Central and Acton - has labelled the plan ""completely nuts"", saying: ""Heathrow is the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide in Europe."" Anti-expansion protesters have mounted legal challenges against the government Campaign groups have also voiced opposition. ""The impact on local people could be severe for many years to come,"" said John Stewart, who chairs the Hacan group. ""Disruption from construction, the demolition of homes, the reality of more than 700 extra planes a day."" In all, 761 homes are expected to go,including the entire village of Longford. Heathrow has said it would pay the full market value plus 25% for properties in its compulsory purchase zone, as well as for some houses in the surrounding areas. Could aviation ever be less polluting? The third runway plan has been talked about for many years. The Labour government approved a third runway in 2009, with former Prime Minister Gordon Brown saying it was needed for economic reasons. But the plan was later scrapped by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in 2010. David Cameron, who became prime minister after Mr Brown, ruled out a Heathrow expansion""no ifs, no buts"". Five years ago Mr Johnson said he would lie down in front of bulldozers to stop a third runway being built In 2015 anAirports Commission,external, set up to look at London's airport capacity problems,recommended Heathrow as the preferred site for a new runway- a planwhich was approvedunder Theresa May's leadership. The decision was opposed by several local MPs, including Boris Johnson, whose Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat is next to Heathrow. He offered to lie down in front of bulldozers to stop the runway's construction. However, whenMPs voted in favour of the third runwayin 2018, Mr Johnson - then foreign secretary - was away in Afghanistan. On 27 February 2020, the Court of Appeal ruled the decision to allow the expansion was unlawful because it did not take climate commitments into account. However, the Supreme Court's decision has ruled the strategy was legitimately based on previous, less stringent, climate targets at the time it was agreed. The airport can now make a planning application, although this could take more than a year. It still has to persuade a public inquiry that there is a case for expansion, and the government will have the final say. Meanwhile environmentalists are expected to continue challenging the project at every stage in the courts - including the European Court of Human Rights.

"Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and the government is seeking ways to minimise its spread. Without drastic measures - which could be in place for weeks, or even months - it is feared that more than 250,000 people could die. All members of the public should reduce the time they spend with others: Everyone should stop non-essential contact with others. This is particularly important for people over 70, those with underlying health conditions and pregnant women People should work from home if they can Cafes, pubs and restaurants are being closed from Friday night - except for take-away food - to tackle coronavirus People should stop all unnecessary travel Those most at risk - about 1.5 million who've had organ transplants, have severe respiratory conditions or some cancers - should not go out for 12 weeks, and will be given essential supplies if they don't have a support system of their own Everyone should continue to regularly wash their hands and avoid contacting the NHS unless it's essential. The strongest warnings are in place for those who are ill and the people close to them: Anyone with a fever or persistent cough should stay at home for seven days Anyone who lives with someone displaying coronavirus symptoms should also stay at home for 14 days.People who have to isolate themselvesshould ask others for help The government's thinking has changed quickly. It started off trying to contain coronavirus by isolating people who tested positive and asking anyone who had close contact with them to self-isolate too. Ministers then introduced policies to delay and reduce the peak, when the most cases are expected. The idea was that by pushing it back to the summer it would allow the NHS to cope. But modelling from Imperial College London prompted a change in approach. It warned the policy of a managed spread could lead to more than 250,000 deaths, with hospital intensive care units getting overwhelmed. Ministers are now seeking to suppress the spread completely. They hope this will keep deaths below 20,000. We are in uncharted territory - so it is impossible to tell. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested that""we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks"". But the problem with trying to suppress the virus is that as soon as you lift those measures the fear is it could quickly return. One option from experts advising the government is to go through a cycle of lifting and reapplying restrictions, using demand on intensive care as a guide. There will be close attention paid to China, which is now looking at how it lifts restrictions. It is not realistic to think that if you temporarily break the spread of coronavirus it will go away. Then you have to consider the social and economic factors at play. Businesses are going to struggle and people are going to lose their jobs. And how long are the public going to put up with being told they cannot go out, need to work from home and can no longer watch sport or go to festivals? It leaves the government with some very difficult decisions to take. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The whole of the NHS has been put on an emergency footing. From mid-April all routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements, are being cancelled for three months. Hospitals have plans to keep coronavirus patients separate and supply staff with protective masks and suits. All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested. Patients with mild symptoms - a high temperature or new and persistent cough - are being asked to self-isolate at home. Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be. But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. Currently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms. Specialist ECMO breathing equipment is at five units for patients whose lungs fail. There are between 4,000 and 5,000 intensive care beds. But NHS officials said they can effectively increase that to between 11,000 and 12,000 by using ventilators reserved for planned surgery and those available in the private sector, Ministry of Defence, new ones being made and old stocks that are no longer used. Ministers are also working with private companies to ramp up production. A third of patients who need hospital care require intensive care support, evidence from China and Italy suggests. Doctors warn that some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment. What questions do you have about the UK's coronavirus plans?

"The Court of Appeal is set to make a ruling over Heathrow's expansion in a case described by green groups as massively significant. Judges will decide whether Heathrow's expansion plans took into account climate change commitments. If the court rules against the environmentalists, it is likely Heathrow's third runway will be built. If it rules against the government, ministers could re-start the appraisal process. This would involve making the highly contentious case that expansion is compatible with combating climate change. Or the prime minister could also accept a negative verdict and allow the court to take the blame for scuppering the expansion proposal that he has long opposed. The case has been brought by local residents, councils, the mayor of London, and environmental groups including Greenpeace. The governmentâs climate change committee advised that expanding Heathrow is not compatible with a climate neutral economy. But the former transport secretary Chris Grayling gave the go-ahead to a third runway there in April 2018. Boris Johnson missed the Commons vote on the scheme. He was in Afghanistan in his role as foreign secretary. What is the third runway plan? What is climate change? A really simple guide Climate campaigners attack aviation duty proposal Green groups argue that before the decision was made, Mr Grayling should have taken into account the Paris deal on climate change, which pledged to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees if possible. At the time, he said: âThe step that [the] government is taking today is truly momentous. I am proud that after years of discussion and delay, this government is taking decisive action to secure the UKâs place in the global aviation market â securing jobs and business opportunities for the next decade and beyond.â Government advisers warned him that expanding aviation would increase emissions when they should be going down. And since then parliament has agreed to a climate neutral economy by 2050 â substantially more challenging than the 80% emissions reduction target in force when Mr Grayling made his decision. The green groups don't believe an expanded Heathrow will be able to meet the net zero target, even with the advent of new technologies. Aviation 'not the enemy' in climate battle Climate change to drive 'massive' investment shift They also think the governmentâs calculations over Heathrow understate the overall damage aviation does to the climate. If they win the case, the implications for other government policies in the UK and elsewhere are potentially huge. Tim Crosland from the pressure group Plan B, one of the organisations which brought the court action, told BBC News: âThis would be massively significant â it would mean that in the UK at least carbon-intensive investment shouldnât happen any more. âOther nations will be looking at this verdict and taking note [of] what it means to commit to net zero carbon emissions."" John Holland-Kaye, chief executive of Heathrow Airport, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday that the airport would play an essential part in post-Brexit Britain. ""Let's be clear, no Heathrow expansion, no global Britain,"" he said. ""That's how simple it is."" He said only a ""hub"" airport can get goods and people to ""all the big trading markets of the world"". ""If we're not flying through Heathrow, we'll be flying through Paris Charles De Gaulle,"" he said. ""We'll be handing control of our trading economy to the French - once our friends and partners, now our rivals."" ""Now, no prime minister is going to give control of the economy to the French,"" he said. ""We cannot let the French control our trading future."" The government declined to comment.

Faisal Islam: UK warns it could abandon EU trade talks in June UK to end agreement with EU to extradite criminals EU ministers agree UK trade talks mandate PM gives green light to post-Brexit research deal The UK document says: The UK ""will not negotiate any arrangements in which the UK does not have control of its own laws and political life"" The UK's aim is for a trading relationship with the EU similar to the ones the 27-nation bloc has with Canada, Japan and South Korea There will be no jurisdiction for EU law or the European Court of Justice in the UK The UK will rely on World Trade Organization rules under an arrangement with the EU similar to Australia's if progress on a comprehensive deal cannot be made A separate agreement on fisheries is needed, to reflect the fact that ""the UK will be an independent coastal state at the end of 2020"" The government wants to agree a ""broad outline"" of a deal with the EU ""capable of being rapidly finalised by September"" in the next four months If that does not happen it will decide whether to switch focus to leaving on WTO terms at the end of December The UK officially left the EU at the end of January, but is continuing to abide by many EU rules while talks on a permanent trading relationship take place. Mr Johnson has pledged to get a deal with the EU by the end of the so-called transition period - 31 December 2020 - and has said he is not prepared to extend that deadline. The UK's negotiating team will be led by Mr Johnson's Europe adviser David Frost. Thought Brexit was done? Sorry to disappoint, but the process of defining Britain's new relationship with the EU as a non-member state is only just getting going. We'll soon be back to the days of crunch talks, the prospect of no deal and the two sides locking horns. What's different now though? Boris Johnson has a huge majority and gone are the days of disunity in the Conservative party that we saw under Theresa May. So the government is being forthright about what it wants from these negotiations - to pull away from the EU and form a new relationship with the bloc as other non-member states have already done. We can already see where the flashpoints are likely to be. But the Conservative manifesto promised a negotiated trade agreement this year - we'll see in the coming months how likely that's looking. David Frost (l) and Michel Barnier (r) will lead the negotiating teams Both sides agree that the UK will not undercut existing regulations on the environment, workers rights, competition and international tax principles. But, says BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming, there are ""some big obvious flashpoints"". 'Dynamic alignment':The UK does not want to follow EU legislation as it is updated in the future. The EU is concerned about the UK gaining a competitive advantage. State aid:The UK wants the freedom to subsidise domestic industries of its choice. Brussels wants state aid restrictions to continue ""in perpetuity"". Governance:The EU wants a ""blockbuster"" agreement covering everything from fisheries, aviation, energy to immigration. The UK wants different deals in these areas. Fishing:The UK wants quota deals like the EU has with Iceland or Norway. The EU wants continued access to UK waters. The EU's46-page negotiating document,external, published on Monday, indicated that the UK could be expected to keep aligned with changes to EU rules covering state subsidies for industry, environmental standards and workers' rights in future. Any trade agreement ""should uphold common high standards, and corresponding high standards over time with Union standards as a reference point"", it added. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson told BBC News: ""The whole objective of doing what we're doing is so the UK can do things differently and better."" He added: ""All we want is mutual recognition of each other's high standards and access to each other's markets. ""We wouldn't ask the EU to follow every particular change in UK legislation so it doesn't make any sense for them to make the same requirement of us and that's where we are."" The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said Brussels is prepared to give the UK ""super-preferential access"" to the EU market of 450 million people. But he said the UK has to accept alignment with EU rules as they develop to ensure fair competition with EU states, effectively ruling out a Canada-style deal. Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? EU warns UK over goods checks between NI and GB Brexit: What is a level playing field? ""The UK says that it wants Canada. But the problem with that is that the UK is not Canada,"" Mr Barnier told an event at the European Parliament on Wednesday. ""This is because of Britain's proximity to the EU and the much larger trade volumes it has with the EU than with Canada."" Michael Gove, the minister in charge of delivering Brexit, hit back in his statement to MPs, saying: ""Geography is no reason to undermine democracy. ""We will not be seeking to dynamically align with EU rules on EU terms governed by EU laws and EU institutions."" Labour's shadow Exiting the EU minister Paul Blomfield said the government's negotiating strategy was ""frankly underwhelming"". He told MPs the government had a ""cavalier disregard"" for the consequences of failing to conclude a deal in the next 10 months and the uncertainty that would mean for business. The Scottish National Party's Pete Wishart said: ""This is nothing other than a routemap to the cherished no-deal - the real ambition of these Brexit zealots."" Critics say leaving without an agreement and going to World Trade Organisation rules - the terms countries use to set tariffs (taxes) on goods when they do not have free-trade deals - could damage the economy.

"The Court of Appeal is set to make a ruling over Heathrow's expansion in a case described by green groups as massively significant. Judges will decide whether Heathrow's expansion plans took into account climate change commitments. If the court rules against the environmentalists, it is likely Heathrow's third runway will be built. If it rules against the government, ministers could re-start the appraisal process. This would involve making the highly contentious case that expansion is compatible with combating climate change. Or the prime minister could also accept a negative verdict and allow the court to take the blame for scuppering the expansion proposal that he has long opposed. The case has been brought by local residents, councils, the mayor of London, and environmental groups including Greenpeace. The governmentâs climate change committee advised that expanding Heathrow is not compatible with a climate neutral economy. But the former transport secretary Chris Grayling gave the go-ahead to a third runway there in April 2018. Boris Johnson missed the Commons vote on the scheme. He was in Afghanistan in his role as foreign secretary. What is the third runway plan? What is climate change? A really simple guide Climate campaigners attack aviation duty proposal Green groups argue that before the decision was made, Mr Grayling should have taken into account the Paris deal on climate change, which pledged to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees if possible. At the time, he said: âThe step that [the] government is taking today is truly momentous. I am proud that after years of discussion and delay, this government is taking decisive action to secure the UKâs place in the global aviation market â securing jobs and business opportunities for the next decade and beyond.â Government advisers warned him that expanding aviation would increase emissions when they should be going down. And since then parliament has agreed to a climate neutral economy by 2050 â substantially more challenging than the 80% emissions reduction target in force when Mr Grayling made his decision. The green groups don't believe an expanded Heathrow will be able to meet the net zero target, even with the advent of new technologies. Aviation 'not the enemy' in climate battle Climate change to drive 'massive' investment shift They also think the governmentâs calculations over Heathrow understate the overall damage aviation does to the climate. If they win the case, the implications for other government policies in the UK and elsewhere are potentially huge. Tim Crosland from the pressure group Plan B, one of the organisations which brought the court action, told BBC News: âThis would be massively significant â it would mean that in the UK at least carbon-intensive investment shouldnât happen any more. âOther nations will be looking at this verdict and taking note [of] what it means to commit to net zero carbon emissions."" John Holland-Kaye, chief executive of Heathrow Airport, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday that the airport would play an essential part in post-Brexit Britain. ""Let's be clear, no Heathrow expansion, no global Britain,"" he said. ""That's how simple it is."" He said only a ""hub"" airport can get goods and people to ""all the big trading markets of the world"". ""If we're not flying through Heathrow, we'll be flying through Paris Charles De Gaulle,"" he said. ""We'll be handing control of our trading economy to the French - once our friends and partners, now our rivals."" ""Now, no prime minister is going to give control of the economy to the French,"" he said. ""We cannot let the French control our trading future."" The government declined to comment.

"The fight against the coronavirus is at a 'decisive point', the World Health Organization says It would be 'fatal' for any country to assume it will not get cases, WHO chief warns Saudi Arabia is stopping foreign pilgrims entering the country Two more patients have tested positive in the UK, bringing the total to 15 Japan plans to close all schools from 2 March Several European countries have announced new cases, traced to Italy Globally, more than 80,000 people in more than 40 countries have been infected Georgina Rannard, Patrick Jackson, Mary O'Connor, Owen Amos, Yvette Tan, Joshua Nevett, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman and Joshua Cheetham We're going to pause live updates now, after another busy day covering the spread of the new coronavirus. But, as you'd expect, weâll
continue to cover this story across the BBC website.You can read our main story here. A reminder of key developments today: Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Ten new laboratories have been set up, to analyse 1,000 possible cases a day. Four cases of
coronavirus have been confirmed in the country. The Swiss knew it was only a
matter of time. The sudden surge in cases in Italy made that inevitable. The
two countries share extensive borders, tens of thousands of people cross daily
to work. The government strategy is to be thorough, but calm. Borders will not
be closed, but border guards are issuing health advice. A nationwide campaign,
with the slogan ""This affects us all!"" will begin on Friday. The risk to the
general public remains low, but we are being urged to wash our hands often.
Hand sanitiser has sold out in Bern, popular cafes are quieter than usual. Right now, the economic damage is far greater than that to health: the Geneva
watch fair, hugely lucrative to the city, has been cancelled. Tourism from
China is down 50%, tourist resorts report a loss, already, of more than 20m francs (Â£16m; $20m). Nick Thorpe, BBC News InRomania, the first case of coronavirus was confirmed on
Wednesday, a man from Gorj county in the south of the country, on the border
with Bulgaria. He had been in contact with an Italian citizen who visited his
family in the city of Craiova between 18 and 22 February, who was confirmed ill
with the virus after he returned to Italy. The Romanian authorities are trying
to trace and put into quarantine everyone he met in Romania. 91 people are currently in
quarantine, and 7,174 are in isolation at home. One million Romanians work in Italy, and there are direct flights from
14 Romanian cities. Harder to monitor are the large numbers of migrant
labourers, who travel between the two countries by minibus or private car. InHungary, thereâs growing
concern and some panic-buying of face masks and hand disinfectants, but no
confirmed cases. 18 people are in quarantine after visiting northern Italy,
including schoolchildren and a lorry driver. Around 3,500 people have been
screened so far at Budapest airport. Last week was half-term in many schools,
and northern Italy is a popular region for Hungarian families to go skiing. The
authorities have earmarked two major Budapest hospitals for future cases. InBulgaria, the government sent
a special plane to bring back 20 agriculture students from Italy. They are now
under medical observation. Bulgaria Air have cancelled flights to Milan until
the end of March. Thermal cameras which measure travellersâ temperatures are
being installed at land border crossings as well as airports. Anyone with a
temperature over 37 degrees is screened for the virus. Iran's Vice-President for Women and Family Affairs Masoumeh Ebtekar has become the fourth politician to contract the virus. Her case is mild and she has not gone into hospital, state media say. Deputy Health MinisterIraj Harirchi and two MPs also have the virus. The WHO's Michael Ryan said the extent of infection in Iran could be ""broader than we think"". But he said the country had high capacity to cope with outbreaks of infection. Iranian Vice-President for Women and Family Affairs Massoumeh Ebtekar Dan JohnsonBBC News The Canary Islands health minister has announced that 130 tourists will be able to leave the Costa Adeje Palace hotel in Tenerife, currently onlockdown because of a coronavirus outbreak. Out of about 700 guests, 130 arrived on Monday - some because flights were delayed by a sandstorm - and so didnât come into contact with the four Italians who originally tested positive The UK's Foreign Office said consular staff in Tenerife has made contact with the majority of the 168 British tourists believed to be staying at the hotel. Some of those are understood to fall within the 130 but itâs not clear how many. While the coronavirus presents ""some challenges"", it will not be anything like the scale of thedeadly Spanish Flu pandemic, England's chief medical officer has said. Speaking to health professionals at the Nuffield Trust Summit in Windsor, Professor Chris Whitty said: ""We are not heading into a H1N1 1918 flu pandemic situation but the coronavirus does present some challenges for us. It definitely will for a period. How big remains to be seen."" The H1N1 influenza pandemic in 1918 is estimated to have killed between 40 and 50 million people worldwide. Prof Whitty added the virus was ""a global problem or it is nothing"". He said: ""If it becomes a global epidemic then
the UK will get it, and if it does not become a global epidemic the UK is
perfectly capable of containing and getting rid of individual cases leading to
onward transmission."" He said onward transmission in the UK was ""just a matter of time in my view"". Prof Whitty said there could be a ""social cost"" if the
virus worsens, which could result in the reduction of mass gatherings and
school closures for more than two months. Global investors have been hit with a sixth day of stock market losses as traders respond to the threat of the coronavirus. The string of declines pushed indexes in Europe and the US down more than 10% from their recent highs - sending them into so-called ""correction"" territory. Read here for more on this business story. Public Health England is contacting people who had ""close contact"" withone of the latest confirmed cases of Covid-19. The patient is a Derbyshire resident who became infected whilst in Tenerife, in Spain's Canary Islands, Dr Fu-Meng Khaw, centre director Public Health England in the East Midlands, said. ""Close contacts"", he said, will be given ""health advice"" about symptoms and emergency contact details to use if they become unwell in the next 14 days after contact with the confirmed cases. There was, he added, currently no information to suggest there was any increased health risk to any pupils or staff at Burbage Primary School, in Buxton,which closed because of the case, and ""no public health reason"" for it to remain closed. Dean Wallace, director of public health for Derbyshire County Council, said the risk to the general public ""remains low"" and reminded people that ""good hygiene"" measures - such as washing hands regularly - were ""the best prevention"". Lewis GoodallPolicy Editor, BBC Newsnight The BBC's Newsnight programme understands that the Cabinet Office has been in contact with local authorities
about their preparedness, specifically with regard to their âExcess Death
Contingency Planningâ. This includes, among other things, where local
authorities might locate new, and perhaps mass, burial sites, should they be
needed. The government
stresses that these are worst-case contingency plans and a Whitehall source
confirms that they have been done before, albeit rarely, for example at the
time of the 2009 Sars outbreak. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: âWe have been clear from the outset that we
expect coronavirus to have some impact on the UK, which is why we are planning
for every eventuality â including the reasonable worst case scenario. Crucially
this does not mean we expect it to happen.""  There are similarities between the spread of the new coronavirus and other epidemics in the past. For example, Sars and Mers were two other types of viral respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus. Sars spread across the globe in 2003, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing 774. But there are two key differences between Sars and the current coronavirus outbreak. Firstly, the new coronavirus spread more quickly and further afield from its origin (the city of Wuhan in China) than Sars did. Secondly, data suggests the new coronavirus is less deadly than Sars. The graphic below highlights these differences.  China has quarantined dozens of passengers,externalarriving on a flight from Iran after one person tested positive for coronavirus, according to the Hong Kong-based newspaper South China Morning Post. This would be China's first known, imported case of coronavirus. The Aeroflot flight arrived in Shanghai via Moscow on 20 February. In Chiayi City, Taiwan, this art installation called The Sleeping Bear reminds people to wear face masks. Asked this morning what reassurances could be given to the British public over the coronavirus outbreak, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: âI think itâs absolutely vital that people do feel reassured. ""The NHS is a fantastic service and weâve made every possible preparation for any eventuality, and if you are concerned about travelling abroad to an area thatâs infected, the key thing is to look at the foreign office website.â His comments come after two more patients tested positive for coronavirus in England,bringing the total number of UK cases to 15. Guy HedgecoeFreelance journalist A sudden rise in
the number of cases of coronavirus in Spain this week has made it a talking
point, although there is little sense of panic among the general 
population. However, there is increased concern following the news that a
Spanish man in Seville had become infected without having travelled abroad
recently. This was the first such case of local contagion, suggesting the virus
has been present in Spain longer than previously thought. âAs long as we see a
rise in imported cases or local cases of infection, the risk factor will rise,â
said Fernando SimÃ³n, head of the Spanish governmentâs health emergency
department. âObviously it is to be expected... that there will be fatalities.â The lockdown of a hotel in Tenerife with nearly 1,000 people in it has been the
most visible instance of disruption so far, but there are now fears that events
surrounding Easter Week, a major holiday in Spain, will be affected. Britons making an insurance claim for a holiday they have cancelled because of the coronavirus should not be required to provide a GP letter, doctors say. Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said insurance firms should instead be basing their decisions to offer refunds on advice from the Foreign Office and Public Health England. ""Patients will undoubtedly have good and sensible reasons for not wanting to travel to certain places because of Covid-19,"" he said. ""But this is not the same as being unable to travel due to existing illness, and it should not become the GP's responsibility to give patients advice about where not to travel."" The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said insurers were assessing claims on a ""case by case basis"" and said it may need ""medical evidence if someone puts in a cancellation claim, saying their pre-existing condition could be exacerbated by coronavirus"". You can read our guide on your rights as a travellerhere. Public Health England has sent a health protection specialist to Tenerife, where hundreds of guests have beenlocked down in a coronavirus-hit hotel. Professor Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said the expert will ""work with the Spanish authorities to better understand the public health measures that have been put in place in the hotel"". ""This includes understanding spread of the virus within the hotel and how the Spanish authorities are monitoring the situation,"" she added. It comes after some British guests claimed safety rules were not being enforced, or followed by other customers.

Here are some interesting takeaways:  Italy's beloved football is feeling the impact. Fans have been wearing masks to matches, and games are being cancelled or played behind closed doors, dealing an economic blow to some clubs. But other major sporting events around the world are also being affected.You can read all about what's happening with major events including the Olympics, F1 and Six Nations here.

Mark LowenBBC Rome correspondent Tram carriages were empty during rush hour in Milan on Thursday Italyâs government is in fightback mode, trying a concerted approach to lessen the coronavirus panic. The foreign minister warned that an âepidemic of misleading informationâ would damage Italy âmore than the virus itselfâ, which, he added, had infected 0.1% of towns in the country. âItâs time to stop the panicâ, said the prime minister, asking the national broadcaster Rai to âtone downâ. On the front pages of Italian newspapers, the top story is no longer the rising number of cases â now more than 520, with 14 deaths â but appeals for calm. The mayor of Milan, where many hotels and restaurants are half-empty, has called for some museums to reopen. A new video released by the authorities shows vibrant scenes from the city with the message: weâre not afraid and weâre open for business. But this is a story driven by perceptions. And with Donald Trump mentioning possible future travel restrictions to Italy, with Israel barring foreigners arriving on flights from Italy, with Kuwait evacuating its nationals from Milan, the Italian government faces a challenge to change the narrative.

"This video can not be played Bob Weighton marking his 111th birthday A 111-year-old former teacher and engineer from Hampshire is set to be confirmed as the world's oldest man. Bob Weighton, who was born on 29 March 1908, is expected to be named as the new record-holder following the death of 112-year-old Chitetsu Watanabe. The Japanese supercentenarian died on Sunday, just days after being awarded a Guinness World Records certificate. Mr Weighton, from Alton, said: ""I don't really feel satisfied because it means someone else has died."" Chitetsu Watanabe served in the military towards the end of World War Two A spokesman for Guinness World Records said it was currently investigating the title for the oldest living man following the death of Mr Watanabe. ""Further information will follow soon upon confirmation of the next record-holder,"" the spokesman said. Mr Weighton has been alive during the reign of five monarchs and the rule of 22 prime ministers Mr Weighton, who grew up in Hull, said: ""I just accept it as a fact. It's not something I ever intended, wanted or worked for but it's just one of those facts of life. ""You might find it amazing but it's just one of those things."" He was formerly both England's oldest man and Britain's joint oldest man untilAlfred Smith, from St Madoes, Perthshire, who shared the same birthday, died last summer. Mr Weighton shares the title of Britain's oldest person with Joan Hocquard, from Poole, Dorset - she, Mr Weighton and Mr Smith were all born on 29 March 1908. Mr Weighton, one of seven children, was born in Hull Mr Weighton, who worked as an engineer, spending time in Taiwan, Japan and Canada, now lives in a flat in a care complex at Alton. He married his wife Agnes in 1937 and has two sons and a daughter, 10 grandchildren and 25 great-grandchildren. Mr Weighton previously told the BBC: ""I have not lived my life avoiding being run over by buses or getting cancer or anything else. ""I've done nothing to deserve or achieve this age. I'm just one of the lucky ones.""

"Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and the government is seeking ways to minimise its spread. Without drastic measures - which could be in place for weeks, or even months - it is feared that more than 250,000 people could die. All members of the public should reduce the time they spend with others: Everyone should stop non-essential contact with others. This is particularly important for people over 70, those with underlying health conditions and pregnant women People should work from home if they can Cafes, pubs and restaurants are being closed from Friday night - except for take-away food - to tackle coronavirus People should stop all unnecessary travel Those most at risk - about 1.5 million who've had organ transplants, have severe respiratory conditions or some cancers - should not go out for 12 weeks, and will be given essential supplies if they don't have a support system of their own Everyone should continue to regularly wash their hands and avoid contacting the NHS unless it's essential. The strongest warnings are in place for those who are ill and the people close to them: Anyone with a fever or persistent cough should stay at home for seven days Anyone who lives with someone displaying coronavirus symptoms should also stay at home for 14 days.People who have to isolate themselvesshould ask others for help The government's thinking has changed quickly. It started off trying to contain coronavirus by isolating people who tested positive and asking anyone who had close contact with them to self-isolate too. Ministers then introduced policies to delay and reduce the peak, when the most cases are expected. The idea was that by pushing it back to the summer it would allow the NHS to cope. But modelling from Imperial College London prompted a change in approach. It warned the policy of a managed spread could lead to more than 250,000 deaths, with hospital intensive care units getting overwhelmed. Ministers are now seeking to suppress the spread completely. They hope this will keep deaths below 20,000. We are in uncharted territory - so it is impossible to tell. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested that""we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks"". But the problem with trying to suppress the virus is that as soon as you lift those measures the fear is it could quickly return. One option from experts advising the government is to go through a cycle of lifting and reapplying restrictions, using demand on intensive care as a guide. There will be close attention paid to China, which is now looking at how it lifts restrictions. It is not realistic to think that if you temporarily break the spread of coronavirus it will go away. Then you have to consider the social and economic factors at play. Businesses are going to struggle and people are going to lose their jobs. And how long are the public going to put up with being told they cannot go out, need to work from home and can no longer watch sport or go to festivals? It leaves the government with some very difficult decisions to take. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The whole of the NHS has been put on an emergency footing. From mid-April all routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements, are being cancelled for three months. Hospitals have plans to keep coronavirus patients separate and supply staff with protective masks and suits. All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested. Patients with mild symptoms - a high temperature or new and persistent cough - are being asked to self-isolate at home. Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be. But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. Currently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms. Specialist ECMO breathing equipment is at five units for patients whose lungs fail. There are between 4,000 and 5,000 intensive care beds. But NHS officials said they can effectively increase that to between 11,000 and 12,000 by using ventilators reserved for planned surgery and those available in the private sector, Ministry of Defence, new ones being made and old stocks that are no longer used. Ministers are also working with private companies to ramp up production. A third of patients who need hospital care require intensive care support, evidence from China and Italy suggests. Doctors warn that some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment. What questions do you have about the UK's coronavirus plans?

"A specialist centre at the Royal Free Hospital, London, is treating one of the new patients Two more patients have tested positive for coronavirus in England, bringing the total number of UK cases to 15. They have been transferred to specialist NHS infection centres in Liverpool and London, the Department of Health said. The virus was passed on while they were in Italy and Tenerife, said England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty. Ministers have said they expect more cases to emerge. The new patients are being treated at specialist centres at the Royal Free Hospital, London, and the Royal Liverpool Hospital. How is the UK getting ready for coronavirus? Coronavirus: How worried should we be? 'Parent with coronavirus' causes school closure Coronavirus: A visual guide to the outbreak Live: Countries scramble to respond as virus spreads The person who contracted the virus in Tenerife is from Derbyshire.A school in the county has closed because of the case. A medical centre less than a mile from the school has also closed due to a ""confirmed case"" of the virus. It is not clear which part of the UK the other person is from. They contracted the virus in northern Italy. Burbage Primary School in Derbyshire said the decision to close was made independently of health officials Italy now has more than 500 cases of coronavirus with authorities there reporting that 17 people have died. In Tenerife, 168 Britons were told to isolate themselves at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel after at least four guests, including an Italian doctor, tested positive for coronavirus. The Canary Islands minister of health subsequently announced that 130 of about 700 guests staying at the hotel will be able to leave, as they arrived on Monday and did not come into contact with the four Italians who tested positive. About 50 of them are understood to be British. Downing Street has defended the response to the situation at the hotel. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""The Foreign Office has been in contact with more than 100 British nationals who are staying in the hotel. ""They are providing them with support, they are also in regular contact with local authorities and tour companies to share information."" Prof Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said PHE had sent a health protection specialist to Tenerife to work with the Spanish authorities to better understand the public health measures that have been put in place in the hotel.

Can my pet get coronavirus, and other questions Coronavirus boosts demand for Dettol products Globally, more than 80,000 people in more than 40 countries have now been infected. Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus, has killed more than 2,700 people. Most of the deaths have been in China, where the virus originated in December. Ministers and public health officials had always been clear there would be more cases in the UK given the way coronavirus has spread around the globe. Teams from Public Health England will be busy tracing the contacts these two individuals have had on their journeys from Italy and Tenerife and since they returned. This detective work will be essential in containing any further spread of the virus. At the moment we haven't had any human-to-human transmission in the UK. The British government is hopeful it can contain outbreaks. But even if it doesn't, it wants to delay them until the spring or summer when the weather will be warmer and there will be less intense pressure on the NHS. It comes as England's chief medical officer, Prof Whitty, warned onward transmission of the virus between people in the UK was ""just a matter of time in my view"". He said there could be a potential ""social cost"" if the virus intensifies, which could include reducing mass gatherings and closing schools. ""One of the things that's really clear with this virus, much more so than flu, is that anything we do we're going to have to do for quite a long period of time, probably more than two months."" Meanwhile, the Cabinet Office has been in communication with local authorities about their ""mass death preparedness"" - what their plans are to deal with pressures on public services if deaths from coronavirus are severe, BBC Newsnight understands. This includes, among other things, where local authorities might locate new, and perhaps mass, burial sites, should they be needed. As of 27 February, a total of 7,690 people in the UK have been tested for the virus. Of the 15 to have tested positive, eight have so far been discharged from hospital. The risk level in the UK was raised to moderate after the World Health Organization declared it a public health emergency of international concern. The main signs of infection are fever and a cough, as well as shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. This video can not be played The BBC's Hugh Pym was given an exclusive demonstration of how a drive-through testing facility works The new cases in England come as the government is set to launch a public information campaign, which will focus on hygiene and how to prevent the spread of infection. The current advice is to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or sleeve when you cough or sneeze, throw away tissues immediately after use and wash your hands frequently. It is also advised to avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unclean hands and avoid close contact with people who are unwell.

"A review setting out options for a radical overhaul of university admissions in England has been launched by the higher education watchdog. The Office for Students has outlined an entry system which would scrap the use of predicted A-level grades. Instead, applications would be delayed until students had their exam results. Sir Michael Barber, chairman of the watchdog, said there was ""widespread recognition"" that parts of the admissions system were ""not working"". In a separate report, the Higher Education Policy Institute says a fairer system would be to remove tuition fees for the first year for students whose parents had not gone to university. The Office for Students' three-month review of how universities allocate places follows concerns about the fairness of the current system which uses predicted exam grades, references and personal statements. Universities launch their own inquiry into switching admissions timetable 'Ditch predicted grades from university applications' Cost of train fares to open days decides university choices The watchdog points out that in 75% of cases, pupils did not make the grades predicted by schools. There have already been warnings from education ministers to reduce ""unconditional offers"", when universities recruit students with offers of places regardless of exam grades. There has been concern about a lack of transparency over how ""contextual"" offers operate, where a disadvantaged candidate might be offered a place with lower grades. And the watchdog also highlighted the discrepancy between the required grades advertised by universities and often much lower grades which were really needed to get places. There have been warnings that ""personal statements"" - where students write about their own interests in a course - can be skewed towards those who get the most help from parents or teachers. Sir Michael said the admissions process ""may be especially unfair on students from disadvantaged backgrounds"". The watchdog has set out three options for reform: Universities would not make offers until pupils had received their A-level results. But applications could be made in advance, as at present. Applications would not be made until students had their A-level results. Pupils could have visited universities and registered an interest, but would not make a final choice on applying until they knew their exam grades. Keep the current timetable broadly unchanged, but take more account of disadvantages facing some pupils, reconsider the use of personal statements and have more transparency over required grades Delaying applications or offers until exam results are known would mean changing the current timetable - either taking A-levels or publishing results earlier or starting the university term later. But it would also remove the need for information used as a proxy for exam results - such as predicted grades, personal statements and references. Unconditional offers would also no longer be needed and students would not have to make multiple applications dependent on results they might or might not achieve. Jo Grady, leader of the UCU lecturers' union, said there was ""growing support for a shift to a fairer admissions system, where students apply to university after they have received their results"". ""This review is the opportunity for us to finally move to a system where university offers are based on actual achievement rather than unreliable estimates of potential."" Claire Sosienski Smith, of the National Union of Students, said: ""It has been clear that for some time the admissions system has not been working in the interest of students, so it is good to see that the OfS is taking action."" Universities UK is already running its own review of admissions, including examining the idea of applications coming after A-level results. Chief executive Alistair Jarvis said the review ""will make recommendations informed by what applicants, schools and universities think works well and where the main challenges lie in achieving greater fairness, transparency and aspiration-raising"". Clare Marchant, head of Ucas, which runs the admissions service, said they were already ""exploring how the timetable of offer-making could be improved"" and how to get more reliable grade predictions. A different approach to creating more open access to university is proposed by the Higher Education Policy Institute. To remove financial barriers for disadvantage, the think tank suggests anyone in the first generation of a family to go to university should not have to pay tuition fees in the first year, with the government picking up the cost. The watchdog will publish its findings after the admissions review ends in May, but universities are independent bodies, and changes to admissions cannot be imposed on them. But the review has the backing of Universities Minister Michelle Donelan who said it was vital that admissions processes were ""transparent and work in students' best interests"". She said the review would be ""instrumental in helping assess how the system can be improved"".

"Klarna was launched in the UK in 2014 Buy now, pay later services for online shoppers are growing at 39% a year, a report says, despite worries that young consumers are sleepwalking into debt. Operators such as Klarna and Afterpay allow customers to delay payment or buy through interest-free instalments. Convenience and the ease to make snap purchases are behind their popularity, according to the report by payment processors Worldpay. But consumer groups say many young people are ignoring the debt risks. Debt threat stalks households in January The rapid rise of 'Buy now, pay later' Klarna has announced that seven million people have used its services in the UK, twice as many as a year ago. Among them was Crystle Pearce, who bought a Peloton stationary exercise bike on Klarna after going into the store and asking about her credit options. Peloton exercise bikes are expensive (picture posed by model) ""I do not have Â£2,000 to drop on a spinning bike. It is definitely a luxury, so you have to make sure, before you sign the piece of paper, that you will be able to pay it back,"" she told BBC 5 live's Wake Up to Money. ""If you can't, you will get yourself into so much debt. If you miss a payment, it completely affects everything. I would only recommend it to someone who is budget-savvy."" These debt warnings have been consistent during the rise of these ""buy now, pay later"" services, with consumer groups warning for some time about the dangers. Caroline Siarkiewicz, chief executive of the Money and Pensions Service, said that falling behind on payments can affect access to borrowing in subsequent years. ""These schemes attract younger people and are pretty straightforward,"" she said last month. ""But many are not thinking about the future enough before they sign up to take out these products."" Complaints service Resolver said it had received nearly 10,000 inquiries about the issue since it began recording them separately in September 2018. However, the Worldpay report suggested that these services were set to double their market share of online purchases by 2023, compared with last year. ""Buy now, pay later delivers a more intuitive level of convenience and access for consumers than traditional credit cards,"" the report said. ""As digitally savvy Gen Z consumers come of age, this is especially significant as younger consumers are more used to making snap purchases and then deciding later if they want to keep it."" Its research suggested this was the fastest-growing online payment method in the UK, growing twice as quickly as bank transfers and more than three times the rate of annual growth in digital wallets. However, it said digital wallets - mainly involving payment via a mobile phone - were popular in stores and would account for more than half of online payments by 2023.

"Klarna was launched in the UK in 2014 Buy now, pay later services for online shoppers are growing at 39% a year, a report says, despite worries that young consumers are sleepwalking into debt. Operators such as Klarna and Afterpay allow customers to delay payment or buy through interest-free instalments. Convenience and the ease to make snap purchases are behind their popularity, according to the report by payment processors Worldpay. But consumer groups say many young people are ignoring the debt risks. Debt threat stalks households in January The rapid rise of 'Buy now, pay later' Klarna has announced that seven million people have used its services in the UK, twice as many as a year ago. Among them was Crystle Pearce, who bought a Peloton stationary exercise bike on Klarna after going into the store and asking about her credit options. Peloton exercise bikes are expensive (picture posed by model) ""I do not have Â£2,000 to drop on a spinning bike. It is definitely a luxury, so you have to make sure, before you sign the piece of paper, that you will be able to pay it back,"" she told BBC 5 live's Wake Up to Money. ""If you can't, you will get yourself into so much debt. If you miss a payment, it completely affects everything. I would only recommend it to someone who is budget-savvy."" These debt warnings have been consistent during the rise of these ""buy now, pay later"" services, with consumer groups warning for some time about the dangers. Caroline Siarkiewicz, chief executive of the Money and Pensions Service, said that falling behind on payments can affect access to borrowing in subsequent years. ""These schemes attract younger people and are pretty straightforward,"" she said last month. ""But many are not thinking about the future enough before they sign up to take out these products."" Complaints service Resolver said it had received nearly 10,000 inquiries about the issue since it began recording them separately in September 2018. However, the Worldpay report suggested that these services were set to double their market share of online purchases by 2023, compared with last year. ""Buy now, pay later delivers a more intuitive level of convenience and access for consumers than traditional credit cards,"" the report said. ""As digitally savvy Gen Z consumers come of age, this is especially significant as younger consumers are more used to making snap purchases and then deciding later if they want to keep it."" Its research suggested this was the fastest-growing online payment method in the UK, growing twice as quickly as bank transfers and more than three times the rate of annual growth in digital wallets. However, it said digital wallets - mainly involving payment via a mobile phone - were popular in stores and would account for more than half of online payments by 2023.

Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus, has killed more than 2,700 people. Most of the deaths have been in China, where the virus originated in December. Ministers and public health officials had always been clear there would be more cases in the UK given the way coronavirus has spread around the globe.

It comes as England's chief medical officer, Prof Whitty, warned onward transmission of the virus between people in the UK was ""just a matter of time in my view"". He said there could be a potential ""social cost"" if the virus intensifies, which could include reducing mass gatherings and closing schools. ""One of the things that's really clear with this virus, much more so than flu, is that anything we do we're going to have to do for quite a long period of time, probably more than two months.""

This includes, among other things, where local authorities might locate new, and perhaps mass, burial sites, should they be needed. As of 27 February, a total of 7,690 people in the UK have been tested for the virus. Of the 15 to have tested positive, eight have so far been discharged from hospital.

"""Robyn"" was in care two hours' drive away from her family Six out of the 10 largest providers of children's homes and foster carers are running huge debts, suggests a report for councils in England. The Local Government Association fears such financial instability could put vulnerable children's care at risk. And some councils report struggling to find suitable places for vulnerable children near their families. The Independent Children's Homes Association blamed funding cuts for the squeeze on children's homes. Vulnerable children moved miles from home 'Alarm bells' over private equity foster care In the 1990s most children's homes were in the public sector but now about 80% are in private or voluntary sector hands which was thought to be better value for money. But now, escalating costs and difficulties of finding nearby places mean some councils are reopening their own children's homes. 'It was terrifying' Robyn was eventually moved into foster care in her home city of Liverpool - but it took more than a year Robyn (whose name we have changed to protect her identity) was 12 when she was taken into care for her own safety. But the nearest children's home that could offer her a place was nearly two hours' drive away. One night, a social worker came and took her away from her family to a residential home. ""I didn't even know what the town was called or the street, "" she says. Her story is all too common in a children's care system councils say is struggling with rising demand and increasing costs. She adds: ""I was really close to all my teachers and me school. ""I felt really isolated - having no-one to speak to, no friends. ""I sat in my room for days, watching telly and having no schoolwork to do - it's hard."" She was eventually moved into foster care in her home city of Liverpool - but it took more than a year. Liverpool City Council says the difficulty of finding places locally is one sign of the major problems facing the care system. Councillor Barry Kushner, who is the council's cabinet member for children's services, claims some larger providers will fill a place based on how much a council will pay rather than whether it is local to the child. Liverpool councillor Barry Kushner said the city was reopening some of its own children's homes ""The costs of residential care have in the last three years gone up by about 30%,"" he says, with Robyn's placement alone about Â£3,500 a week. He accepts that some costs are increasing because of the complex needs of children, but also worries about the level of debt some of the larger companies have. ""Where I take issue is where those additional costs are levied on the council because of the internal financing of those organisations, because of who owns them or who is investing in them. ""And councils really shouldn't be picking up the bill for that."" Liverpool, like a number of other authorities, is now reopening some of its own children's homes, closed nearly a decade ago, to be run by the charity, Barnardo's. The LGA report shows most of the biggest care providers have more debts and liabilities than assets. Many of the big companies are private equity funded which often means loans have been used to buy the business with the aim of making a profit when it is sold on. Councils have seen significant increases in the cost of placing a child in a residential or foster placement, partly because of the increasingly complex needs of many children. But the report also says the six largest independent companies made Â£215m in profit last year with some making more than 20% profit on their income. The LGA wants more transparency over costs and for the financial health of the big firms to be monitored to avoid a similar scenario to the collapse of adult care home provider Southern  Cross in 2011. Judith Blake, chair of the LGA's Children and Young People Board, says much of the growth of the biggest providers ""has been fuelled by enormous loans, which will at some point need paying back, yet this research shows many of them do not have the assets to do that"". She added: ""Stability for children in care is paramount... and an oversight scheme is needed to help catch providers before they fail and ensure company changes don't risk the quality of provision. ""Providers should also not be making excessive profits from providing placements for children. She wants a promised government review of children's care to consider how to better support in-house provision and smaller providers. Peter Sandiford is chief executive of the Independent Children's Homes Association The Independent Children's Homes Association represents both large and small private care companies as well as voluntary sector homes. It says the report doesn't look at the value for money or quality of care provided by many independent care companies. Its chief executive, Peter Sandiford, says he would be concerned if the level of debt held by some firms keeps growing, but that the likelihood of one of those companies failing is ""at the moment, probably not very high"". He also believes that, rather than care companies making large profits, many of the smaller providers are struggling on the fees that local authorities pay. With increasing numbers of children needing support he wants independent care providers and councils to work together more closely to plan what is needed. ""What we're looking at is growing the sector, and having more homes to look after very vulnerable children. ""I don't think we can afford to say one thing isn't right, because we need the whole spectrum (of homes)."" A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said an extra Â£1 billion of new funding was being put in to adult and children's social care, adding: ""The safety and suitability of a child's placement in care is our absolute priority, which is why we are reviewing the system so children receive the best possible care.""

"The Court of Appeal is set to make a ruling over Heathrow's expansion in a case described by green groups as massively significant. Judges will decide whether Heathrow's expansion plans took into account climate change commitments. If the court rules against the environmentalists, it is likely Heathrow's third runway will be built. If it rules against the government, ministers could re-start the appraisal process. This would involve making the highly contentious case that expansion is compatible with combating climate change. Or the prime minister could also accept a negative verdict and allow the court to take the blame for scuppering the expansion proposal that he has long opposed. The case has been brought by local residents, councils, the mayor of London, and environmental groups including Greenpeace. The governmentâs climate change committee advised that expanding Heathrow is not compatible with a climate neutral economy. But the former transport secretary Chris Grayling gave the go-ahead to a third runway there in April 2018. Boris Johnson missed the Commons vote on the scheme. He was in Afghanistan in his role as foreign secretary. What is the third runway plan? What is climate change? A really simple guide Climate campaigners attack aviation duty proposal Green groups argue that before the decision was made, Mr Grayling should have taken into account the Paris deal on climate change, which pledged to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees if possible. At the time, he said: âThe step that [the] government is taking today is truly momentous. I am proud that after years of discussion and delay, this government is taking decisive action to secure the UKâs place in the global aviation market â securing jobs and business opportunities for the next decade and beyond.â Government advisers warned him that expanding aviation would increase emissions when they should be going down. And since then parliament has agreed to a climate neutral economy by 2050 â substantially more challenging than the 80% emissions reduction target in force when Mr Grayling made his decision. The green groups don't believe an expanded Heathrow will be able to meet the net zero target, even with the advent of new technologies. Aviation 'not the enemy' in climate battle Climate change to drive 'massive' investment shift They also think the governmentâs calculations over Heathrow understate the overall damage aviation does to the climate. If they win the case, the implications for other government policies in the UK and elsewhere are potentially huge. Tim Crosland from the pressure group Plan B, one of the organisations which brought the court action, told BBC News: âThis would be massively significant â it would mean that in the UK at least carbon-intensive investment shouldnât happen any more. âOther nations will be looking at this verdict and taking note [of] what it means to commit to net zero carbon emissions."" John Holland-Kaye, chief executive of Heathrow Airport, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday that the airport would play an essential part in post-Brexit Britain. ""Let's be clear, no Heathrow expansion, no global Britain,"" he said. ""That's how simple it is."" He said only a ""hub"" airport can get goods and people to ""all the big trading markets of the world"". ""If we're not flying through Heathrow, we'll be flying through Paris Charles De Gaulle,"" he said. ""We'll be handing control of our trading economy to the French - once our friends and partners, now our rivals."" ""Now, no prime minister is going to give control of the economy to the French,"" he said. ""We cannot let the French control our trading future."" The government declined to comment.

"This video can not be played 'We're not convinced' on drug consumption rooms Plans for drug consumption rooms to get addicts off the streets have been called a ""distraction"" by the UK government minister for crime. Kit Malthouse said the drug deaths crisis gripping Scotland demanded ""a more assertive approach"". Glasgow's plan for a special facility to allow users to take their own drugs under medical supervision are backed by the Scottish government. But drug legislation is reserved to the Westminster government. Drug support services 'disappearing' due to government cuts It has refused to allow Glasgow City Council to pilot the scheme, which the council says would encourage the hundreds of users who inject heroin or cocaine on the city's streets to enter a safe and clean environment. It is hoped the special room would encourage addicts into treatment, cut down on heroin needles on city streets and counter the spread of diseases such as HIV. However, ahead of a UK-wide summit on drug deaths being held at Glasgow's SEC, Mr Malthouse toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""We have to recognise this is a complicated problem and there is no silver bullet solution. Other countries have introduced drug consumption rooms ""To me, drug consumption rooms are a bit of a distraction."" He said research from around the world showed ""mixed"" results for consumption rooms. ""They are quite small scale and the scale of the problem demands a much more assertive approach,"" he said. Mr Malthouse called for more drug treatment alongside education and support. He also said that more needed to be done to disrupt drug supplies, especially online and social media, using ""intelligent enforcement"". Almost 4,300 people died from drug misuse across the UK in 2018, a record figure, and the numbers for last year are expected to be just as high. Deaths in England and Wales increased significantly but the rate remains much lower than in Scotland. Scotland accounted for more than a quarter of UK drug deaths, which was far higher than its share of the population. The latest figures showed an average of more than three people a day dying of drug overdoses in Scotland. What can be done about Scotland's drugs crisis? Scotland's drug death crisis in six charts 'Bold' action needed to tackle drugs deaths Scotland's Public Health Minister Joe FitzPatrick told the summit in Glasgow that an extra Â£20m in government funding would be made available for drug rehabilitation and mental health support for addicts. He said he remained convinced that ""a public health approach to this emergency is the right way forward""  rather than trying to punish users for breaking the law. The minister added: ""The UK government has made it clear at their summit that they are not willing to consider the bold, innovative approaches to this problem that I feel are needed. ""However, that doesn't mean we will stop fighting for what we believe is right and this extra investment will help us in our efforts to save lives."" It is more than three years since Glasgow City Council first proposed drug consumption rooms. The leader of Glasgow City Council, Susan Aitken, said her city had the most drug deaths in the UK, 280 in 2018. ""This is a critical situation for our entire city - we are in the throes of a crisis and an emergency response is required,"" she said. Ms Aitken called on the UK government to support new approaches, such as safe consumption rooms, in an attempt to get addicts off the streets. Dr Saket Priyadarshi, from Glasgow Alcohol and Drug Recovery Services, said a drug consumption facility would be a good way to reach people with whom they have no contact to begin recovery. He said it was urgently needed and could not see an argument against it. Glasgow wants to open a safe consumption room to get users of the streets Both the UK and Scottish governments agree that tackling addiction and rising drug death levels should be a priority. However, both remain at odds over how best to help some of the country's most vulnerable addicts. At the heart of the Scottish government agenda is a public health approach, exemplified by the drastic reduction in drug deaths in Portugal. It involves decriminalising possession of small amounts of drugs, wrap-around services and potentially the introduction of so-called ""fix rooms"" - facilities where addicts can inject drugs safely under supervision. But to do this, says the Scottish government, it requires devolution of drug policy and changes to the Misuse of Drugs Act. The UK government's Home Office are reluctant. As well as Tory unwillingness to appear ""soft"" on drugs, Home Office policing minister Kit Malthouse has already said divergence in drug policy north of the border would be encouraging for English gangs seeking more opportunity to flood Scottish towns with illegal drugs. Recovery charities have expressed fears that these two summits could end up being another political point-scoring exercise. If that's the case, the ones losing out are the ones dying.

"Staff at the chicken chain Nando's claim they sometimes have to clean its restaurants without pay. Current and former Nando's employees at multiple restaurants told the BBC they had to scrub cookers and disinfect toilets after being clocked out. One claimed the same mops were used in toilets and kitchens while another said they handled chicken without gloves. Nando's said it was its policy to pay employees properly and it upholds the highest cleaning standards. Most of its branches do not employ dedicated cleaners - which Nando's described as standard across the food service industry. The company, which has more than 400 restaurants in the UK, added: ""Cleaning is an integral part of restaurant work and is crucial to maintaining high standards of health and hygiene, which we take very seriously."" Thousands of people have signed an online petition calling on Nando's to review its cleaning and pay policies. ""The managers would clock us out early and not adjust for late stays. If we complained, we were simply told we should have worked faster,"" people commenting onthe petition claimed,external. Most Nando's branches do not employ a dedicated cleaner The BBC spoke to five current and former Nando's staff - dubbed ""Nandocas"" by the company - they all requested anonymity. For most, Nando's was their first job. Collectively they have worked in seven different restaurants across England and Scotland within the past 12 months. They were broadly complimentary about Nando's as a workplace. ""You do make friendsâ¦ it's social,"" one said. ""It's saved me Â£45 a week in free food,"" another added. But almost all highlighted problems with how closing shifts are managed and some alleged incidents of poor cleaning practices. 'Costa Coffee took Â£200 from my pay for training' Costa Coffee workers 'not treated like humans' Wahaca changes eat-and-run bill policy They all described closing shifts as ending when a manager - known as a ""Patrao"" - signed off the restaurant as ready for the next day. The system automatically clocks staff out unless managers override it, but that did not always happen, the workers claimed. ""I would get my payslip on a Friday and find I'd have less money than expected because they didn't put in the hours on my closing shifts,"" a 22-year-old, who we're calling Suzanne, said. ""There was a time where we'd run over and finished around 02:30 in the morning and the managers had already put it through the system and they wouldn't add on the extra hours."" More than 10 reviews about Nando's posted on Glassdoor mention unpaid overtime ""You would be usually clocked out early and I thought that was a normal thing. I just thought they pay us for extra hours,"" said 19-year-old Jenny - not her real name - who worked at a Nando's in Cheshire. ""I did ask colleagues 'are we actually getting paid?' and they said... 'we don't actually get paid, you have to bug them for it'. ""You have to ask [managers] 'can I have the extra pay for the close' and they wouldn't always actually do it."" One current member of staff who works in the kitchen of a Nando's in the south-west of England said that he was almost always paid properly for overtime. But there were occasional mistakes. ""We had this one staff member who, when [his hours] got put through completely wrong, didn't get paid so the manager gave him the money out of his own pocket,"" the 20-year-old said. Several of those the BBC spoke to said Nando's uses an industry-standard colour-coded system to separate cleaning equipment. For example, a green mop is used in kitchens, while a red mop is used to clean toilets. Suzanne, who worked at a Nando's in Manchester city centre, claimed she rarely saw the red mop head used in the 12 months she worked there. ""The kitchen staff will close first... they wouldn't really take the time out to use the correct coloured mop,"" she said. ""You can use any bucket or any mop, which was a huge problem because whatever is in the kitchen would be contaminated in the toilets."" Meanwhile, Jenny claimed she was required to cook chicken and clean toilets without protection for a week due to a supply issue. ""That means that raw chicken was being racked [cooked] without hair nets or gloves and also toilets had to be cleaned when we didn't have the option of wearing gloves at all,"" she said. Nando's - which has around 20,000 staff in Britain - has also responded to complaints which mention unpaid overtime and arduous cleaning duties made on the employment review website Glassdoor. Employment lawyer Katie Mahoney said managers' control of the clocking out system could be a breach of trust which may ""entitle the employee to resign and claim constructive dismissal"". ""Depending on the terms of the contract, they may also be able to argue that the failure to pay them for the hours they have actually worked has resulted in an unlawful deduction from their wages,"" she added. Staff said cleaning tasks ranged from mopping floors to bleaching toilet bowls and urinals The petition calling on Nando's to review its cleaning and pay policies was created on the campaigns website Organise, which told the BBC it is supported by 551 people who said they work there. It has so far gained more than 3,700 signatures. The BBC understands the company has ""reinforced"" its clocking-out policy to managers as a result of the petition. Organise founder Nat Whalley said: ""Hundreds of Nando's staff are now speaking up together to stamp out missing pay."" A Nando's spokesperson told the BBC: ""We wholeheartedly refute the accusation that we would ask or expect our employees to do unpaid work. ""Without exception, our policy across all our restaurants is to pay all of our employees for all the work they do, and we take this incredibly seriously. ""If human error ever does occur, it is rectified without delay."" ""As is standard across the industry, cleaning is an essential role for employees, and this is made clear to all job applicants,"" they added. ""Cleaning is an integral part of restaurant work and is crucial to maintaining high standards of health and hygiene, which we take very seriously. Any employee who is asked to clean is given full training."" The spokesperson said: ""99% of our restaurants across the country have a rating of four or five under the Food Hygiene Scheme"".

"Many businesses such as gyms are turning to live-streaming to help their customers in quarantine With millions of people across China under lockdown, businesses across the country are trying to come up with ways to keep their customers occupied and connected. In Hubei province, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, at least 56 million people remain under strict instruction to remain inside their residential communities and villages. At one point, around 500 million people were said to be affected by movement restrictions to contain the virus. Many people have turned to the internet as one way to cure their boredom. According to The Paper, searches for the word ""boring"" on social media site Weibo grew by 626% on 26 January and topics such as ""how to spend time at home when bored"" also started to trend on the website. Entrepreneurs began to realise there were ways of keeping in touch with their customers. Here are a few of the methods being used in China right now. Gyms across China have been forced to close amid fears that they could help spread the virus. A number of gyms have started classes online so their customers can keep fit from home. Lauren Hogan, General Manager for F45 in Shanghai, told the BBC that her gyms are offering workout sessions on WeChat, a popular messaging app in China. ""Every day my trainers have created a circuit-based workout depending on our programming. They've created a sheet of exercises and they are recording videos, but having fun with it too."" Coronavirus credit crunch hits Chinese firms Ms Hogan said there are groups in WeChat for customers where they can write in and tell other people they have completed the day's exercise. ""We also did a plank challenge and they had to tag someone in the group to take part,"" she added. This video can not be played A student in Wuhan describes what it is like to live under lockdown She said the videos have helped people talk and know that there is a resource for them, and customers have been appreciative. ""We've had personal thank you messages and also messages in the group chats. People are happy and grateful that we're taking the time to do it and show that we care. When you're stuck in your house, it turns into very long days and having someone else to talk to helps."" Other chains are following suit including Gravity Plus in Beijing. Aside from running online classes, it has also rented out gym equipment as an extra way of bringing in income, Reuters news agency reports. With nightclubs closed and music events cancelled for the foreseeable future, a number of DJs and clubs in China are turning to ""cloud clubbing"". Cloud clubbing is where people can watch live DJ sets and send in messages to give them the feeling that they're in a club. The cloud clubbing events usually take place on apps such as Douyin, China's TikTok. TAXX Shanghai is one club that has taken advantage on the demand for ""cloud clubbing sessions"". DJs have been live streaming to people in their homes Ruan Liangliang, manager of TAXX Shanghai told Sixth Tone: ""Recently many of our friends and customers have said they are bored with their indoor lives. So we planned a live broadcastto share pleasant music and ease their anxiety.,external"" He told the website he was surprised at the positive feedback from those who took part. However despite earning about $104,000 (Â£80,000) in tips, he says it is not enough to cover the rent. Strawberry Music Festival, an indie music festival that has been hosted in several Chinese cities, put on its own indoor music festival named ""Hi, I am also at home"". The festival was held for five days and featured shows from many musical acts. The shows were pre-recorded, however viewers were able to discuss the music together in the comments section as if they were watching a show together. Bookshops have also had to think of new ways of reaching customers, a double blow to an industry that is already competing against online shops. Chengdu Fang Suo Bookstore is located in the trendy Taikoo Li shopping centre in the city. One bookseller whogave their name as Jin Jin told local media,externalthat it usually brings in customers with its scenery and displays however it has turned to Wechat to help bring in any revenue. Shop workers made their own lists in WeChat groups including ""selected books of the year"" and the ""recommended reading list of Fang Suo house"". Customers could then order the books via their online store. Elsewhere in China, 1200 Bookstore in Guangzhou, a 24-hour shop, has been selling gift cards, tote bags and ""blind gift packages"" as a way to bring in income. In a post written on social media, the store's owner warned its customers that it might not be long before 1200 Bookstore would have to shut permanently.

"Finance Secretary Kate Forbes and Green co-leader Patrick Harvie welcomed the agreement The Scottish government is to set up a free bus travel scheme for under-19s as part of an SNP-Green budget deal. The agreement between the two parties will also see extra funding going to local government and the police. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said free bus travel would be a ""step change"" in supporting young people and helping tackle climate change. MSPs will vote on the budget for the first time on Thursday, with the tax and spending plans now certain to pass. No changes to tax rates in Scottish budget Ms Forbes stepped in to deliver the budget the day afterDerek Mackay resignedas finance secretary, and was subsequently appointed to replace him. The budget does not contain any changes to income tax rates, with extra money being spent on health, education and investment aimed at tackling the ""climate emergency"". Draft Income Tax plan 19%Starter rate 20%Basic rate 21%Intermediate rate 41%Higher rate 46%Top rate The commitment to set up a free public transport scheme for young people comes on the same day asfigures showed fewer people were using buses. Ministers aim to have ""national concessionary travel"" system up and running by January 2021, with people aged 18 and under joining the over-60s in being eligible for free bus trips. The deal with the Greens will also see an extra Â£95m going to local authorities, as well as Â£18m to police services and Â£45m to low carbon projects, including energy efficiency projects and active travel. The changes will be paid for using underspends, longer term income from non-domestic rates and the fossil fuel levy. The government has also agreed to review plans toupgrade the Sheriffhall roundabout,externalon the Edinburgh bypass, although ministers have rejected calls from the Greens to scrap works on the A9 and A96. MSPs will vote on the initial proposals on Thursday, with the terms of the deal with the Greens to be added in the following week when the budget is examined by a committee of MSPs. The tax rates are expected to be signed off on Wednesday 4 March, with the final vote on the budget bill the following day. Ms Forbes stepped in to deliver the budget after the resignation of Derek Mackay Ms Forbes said she was ""pleased to have reached an agreement"", particularly given the ""uncertainty"" of the UK government not yet having set its budget. She said the budget included ""record investment"" in health services and ""significant investments to tackle the climate crisis"". She said: ""I want to thank all parties for the constructive way in which they have approached this year's discussions. ""While it is not possible to meet every party's demands in full, I believe in reaching formal agreement with the Green Party I am also delivering on key asks from every party and I encourage all MSPs to consider giving their support to Scotland's budget."" Green co-leader Patrick Harvie said free bus travel would be a ""transformational step towards tackling the climate emergency"". He added: ""Clearly, a Green budget would do even more to tackle the climate emergency, but securing this important free bus travel deal for the next generation builds on the powers we won for local councils to take control of local bus services."" The other opposition parties had also been involved in talks with Ms Forbes, but hit out at the deal. The Scottish Conservatives said the plan announced on Wednesday ""still falls well short of what our economy and public services need"", with finance spokesman Donald Cameron saying Tory MSPs would not back the budget unless extra cash was added for drug rehabilitation services. Scottish Labour, which had called for a wider free bus travel system, said it was ""deeply disappointing to see the Scottish Green Party yet again sell our local councils, our environment and indeed themselves short yet again"". The Scottish Lib Dems meanwhile said they would vote against the budget as long as the SNP continued to push for an independence referendum in 2020, with leader Willie Rennie saying this was ""stopping an awful lot else being agreed"".

"The Court of Appeal is set to make a ruling over Heathrow's expansion in a case described by green groups as massively significant. Judges will decide whether Heathrow's expansion plans took into account climate change commitments. If the court rules against the environmentalists, it is likely Heathrow's third runway will be built. If it rules against the government, ministers could re-start the appraisal process. This would involve making the highly contentious case that expansion is compatible with combating climate change. Or the prime minister could also accept a negative verdict and allow the court to take the blame for scuppering the expansion proposal that he has long opposed. The case has been brought by local residents, councils, the mayor of London, and environmental groups including Greenpeace. The governmentâs climate change committee advised that expanding Heathrow is not compatible with a climate neutral economy. But the former transport secretary Chris Grayling gave the go-ahead to a third runway there in April 2018. Boris Johnson missed the Commons vote on the scheme. He was in Afghanistan in his role as foreign secretary. What is the third runway plan? What is climate change? A really simple guide Climate campaigners attack aviation duty proposal Green groups argue that before the decision was made, Mr Grayling should have taken into account the Paris deal on climate change, which pledged to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees if possible. At the time, he said: âThe step that [the] government is taking today is truly momentous. I am proud that after years of discussion and delay, this government is taking decisive action to secure the UKâs place in the global aviation market â securing jobs and business opportunities for the next decade and beyond.â Government advisers warned him that expanding aviation would increase emissions when they should be going down. And since then parliament has agreed to a climate neutral economy by 2050 â substantially more challenging than the 80% emissions reduction target in force when Mr Grayling made his decision. The green groups don't believe an expanded Heathrow will be able to meet the net zero target, even with the advent of new technologies. Aviation 'not the enemy' in climate battle Climate change to drive 'massive' investment shift They also think the governmentâs calculations over Heathrow understate the overall damage aviation does to the climate. If they win the case, the implications for other government policies in the UK and elsewhere are potentially huge. Tim Crosland from the pressure group Plan B, one of the organisations which brought the court action, told BBC News: âThis would be massively significant â it would mean that in the UK at least carbon-intensive investment shouldnât happen any more. âOther nations will be looking at this verdict and taking note [of] what it means to commit to net zero carbon emissions."" John Holland-Kaye, chief executive of Heathrow Airport, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday that the airport would play an essential part in post-Brexit Britain. ""Let's be clear, no Heathrow expansion, no global Britain,"" he said. ""That's how simple it is."" He said only a ""hub"" airport can get goods and people to ""all the big trading markets of the world"". ""If we're not flying through Heathrow, we'll be flying through Paris Charles De Gaulle,"" he said. ""We'll be handing control of our trading economy to the French - once our friends and partners, now our rivals."" ""Now, no prime minister is going to give control of the economy to the French,"" he said. ""We cannot let the French control our trading future."" The government declined to comment.

"Scientists are hoping to find a way to identify child sex abusers just from images of their hands. Often, the backs of hands are the only visible features of abusers in footage and images shared online. A new study aims to discover whether our hands are truly unique by looking at physical differences between them. Researchers plan to do this by training computers to spot anatomical features in anonymous images sent by the public. This will allow algorithms to be designed that will help police to link suspects to crimes just from images of their hands, scientists hope. Scientists from the universities of Lancaster and Dundee are now calling for more than 5,000 ""citizen scientists"" to take part in their study, so there is enough data to prove beyond reasonable doubt whether our hands are unique. Forensic anthropologist Prof Dame Sue Black said: ""Our hands display many anatomical differences due to our development, influence of genetics, ageing, environment or even accidents. ""We know that features such as vein patterns, skin creases, freckles, moles, and scars are different between our right and left hands, and even different between identical twins. ""We are looking to deliver a step-change in the science so we can analyse, and understand, all the factors that make a hand unique."" How a paedophile's hands led to his conviction A web-based app for anyone aged 18 and over to contribute their images to the project is available to use on smartphones at h-unique.lancaster.ac.uk The images are not shared with any external agencies and will be destroyed at the end of the five-year research project, funded through a 2.5m euros (Â£2.1m) grant from the European Research Council.

"Some parts of the UK such as west Wales are significantly worse off than others The government must ""think big"" and spend more if it is serious about levelling up the UK's regions, an independent inquiry has said. An extra Â£200bn of regional funds should be channelled to disadvantaged parts of the country over the next two decades, the UK2070 Commission said. The report concludes policies need to cover longer timescales and feature stronger pan-regional collaboration. It said regional inequalities have ""blighted"" Britain. ""Many people in Britain feel left behind by growth elsewhere and that has contributed to an acrimonious debate about Europe. We now face a decade of potential disruption - leaving the European Union, confronting the impact of climate change and adjusting to the fourth industrial revolution,"" said commission chairman Lord Kerslake, a former head of the civil service. The report blames ""an over-centralised system"", as well as policies that were fragmented, under-resourced and too short-lived. ""We cannot afford to keep on repeating those mistakes. Government must therefore think big, plan big and act at scale. Bluntly, if it can't go big, it should go home,"" Lord Kerslake said. Following the election in December last year, Boris Johnson pledged to ""level up"" left-behind regions, after several northern constituencies elected Conservative MPs for the first time. A lot has been promised by the government about ""levelling up"" and the regions have heard the political rhetoric coming from the top loud and clear. But what exactly does it mean? This report is one of a number seeking to take the political rhetoric from the 2019 general election and turn it into a plan, and, frankly, demands for funding. The UK2070 report, backed by many independent elected mayors, focuses on a variety of different elements driving regional inequality in the UK. It ponders the question as to why the UK is one of the most regionally unequal advanced nations in the world. The basic answer is that the unbalanced British economy is a choice, the reflection of decisions, and with the right long-term thinking, it could be rebalanced. As the name of the 2070 project suggests, its aims are long-term. And the central demand beyond better transport and more devolved powers is that post-Brexit regional funds need to be trebled to Â£15bn a year - providing Â£200bn more to transform Britain's economic geography and spread growth and opportunity to every corner. The UK2070 Commission was set up in July 2018 to look at the longer-term causes and future policy implications for the regions. It is a collaboration between several UK universities and is supported by the Sykes Charitable Trust and the RSA. Its final report recommends tripling the amount of funding that would have been directed to regions from EU grants. It proposes Â£15bn a year be channelled through the new Shared Prosperity Fund, which is due to replace EU funding at the end of this year. The report ""Make No Little Plans: Acting At Scale For a Fairer and Stronger Future"" calls for the government to make a public pledge to tackle inequality. As well as the increase in expenditure on regional development it calls for: investment in a ""new connectivity revolution"" including spending at least 3% of UK economic output on infrastructure every year creation of ""networks of excellence"" in research and development to match the London, Oxford, Cambridge triangle devolving power and funding away from London strengthening local economies in disadvantaged towns policy links between the shift to a zero-carbon and rebalancing the economy ""We also need to recognise that the price of failing to reverse this decline will far outweigh the cost of investing now in creating greater opportunities. Properly investing in levelling-up will come at a cost but so will doing nothing about it,"" Lord Kerslake said. Public spending is currently required to deal with the consequences of an unbalanced economy; investing in levelling-up could raise low incomes and reduce welfare spending, the report said. Average household wealth fell by 12% in the North East and East Midlands between 2006 and 2018, but grew by nearly 80% in London and by over 30% in south-east England, the report said, citing Office for National Statistic figures.
