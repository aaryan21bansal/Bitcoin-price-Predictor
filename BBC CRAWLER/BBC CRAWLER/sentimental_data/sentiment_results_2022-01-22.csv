"NHS England staff must be fully vaccinated by 1 April under government rules The deadline for health workers to have a Covid vaccination should be delayed to prevent staff shortages in England, the Royal College of GPs has said. NHS staff must have a first jab by 3 February and be fully vaccinated by 1 April to continue in frontline roles. The Department of Health said there were no plans to delay and it was ""the right thing to do to protect patients"". NHS workers who oppose thegovernment's mandatory vaccination policyhave staged a protest in central London. Demonstrations were also held in other cities across the UK including Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds. Scotland and Wales have not made any proposals to make Covid jabs compulsory for NHS workers or care home staff, while inNorthern Ireland there will be a public consultation. NHS staff laid their uniforms in Trafalgar Square London The UK recorded 76,807 coronavirus cases and 297 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test,daily government figures show.,external Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said compulsory vaccination for health professionals in England was ""not the right way forward"". He said the vast majority of staff were vaccinated but some 70,000 to 80,000 were not and they accounted for 10% of staff at some hospitals or GP surgeries. Some 94.3% of NHS trust health care workers in England have had a first dose of vaccine, and 91.5% have had a second dose,figures to 31 December show.,external The data also shows there were 1,480,351 staff on the electronic record - although not all in patient facing roles. Some 1,395,268 staff members had had a first jab, leaving 85,083 unvaccinated. If unvaccinated staff were taken out of frontline roles by 1 April there would be ""massive consequences"" for the NHS, Mr Marshall told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said a delay would allow time for booster jabs and a ""sensible conversation"" about whether vaccines should be mandatory at all. Danny Mortimer, deputy chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said some frontline staff would have to leave their roles if they chose not to be vaccinated. He said: ""This will reduce frontline NHS staff numbers even further and lead to more gaps in capacity at a time of intense pressure and patient demand."" Groups including NHS100K and Together Association marched against compulsory Covid jabs for health workers In London, demonstrators marched from Regents Park to the BBC headquarters in Portland Place in a peaceful protest against mandating vaccines for health workers. But Dr Nikki Kanani, medical director of primary care for NHS England, said health care professionals had ""a duty"" to make sure they were protected. She said: ""If you're marching today, just take a moment, think about the people that you've been looking after who have experienced Covid, think about your colleagues who you've been working with, and think about the best way to make sure that we're all protected, and that we're all as safe as possible, because we are very much in this together and it's down to us to look after each other too."" Protesters marched to the BBC's headquarters in central London Meanwhile, Kate, a nurse in Hampshire, told the Today programme she was prepared to lose her job rather than have a coronavirus vaccine against her will. ""I don't feel like the vaccination needs to be mandated because we are medical professionals and we have enough information to make that decision for ourselves,"" she said. ""When I had Covid I was ill but not particularly unwell and when it comes to me being forced to do something or lose my job, I just can't understand how they think that's a sensible position. ""I'm good at my job, I care about people, and I certainly have never and would never put people at risk."" 'NHS could lose experienced staff over Covid jabs' Vaccines compulsory for frontline NHS staff in England Midwife fears for job over vaccine refusal The deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, Saffron Cordery, said delaying the policy on mandatory vaccination was not the answer. She said staff who worked with patients and choose not to be vaccinated ""will be redeployed where that is possible, or potentially dismissed"". And while health bosses were worried about ""exacerbating staff shortages at a time when the service is under huge operational pressures"", the majority backed the policy. She said: ""The last thing trust leaders want to do is further deplete the workforce by dismissing their staff, but they are obliged to implement the law.""

"This video can not be played MPs should report intimidation tactics to the police, says William Wragg A Conservative backbencher who accused Downing Street of trying to ""blackmail"" MPs seeking to oust Boris Johnson is to meet police to discuss his allegations. William Wragg said he will be speaking to a Met Police detective in the House of Commons early next week, after requesting a meeting with the force. The MP, who wants the prime minister to quit, said he wanted to leave any probe to ""experts"" rather than No 10. Downing Street said it had not seen any proof of the behaviour he alleges. A spokesman said on Friday they were not investigating the allegations but would look ""carefully"" at any evidence presented to them. Chris Bryant, who is chairman of the Commons Committee on Standards, said he had spoken to about a dozen Tory MPs in the past few days who had made similar allegations of whips threatening to withdraw funding for their constituencies, including for campaigning and infrastructure such as bypasses and schools. ""I've even heard MPs alleging that the prime minister himself has been doing this,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He described the alleged behaviour as ""misconduct in public office"" and said it was a matter for the police. The Labour MP added that he believed this had happened much more over the past 10 years and there had been ""a steady erosion of standards in the way we allocate funding"". On Thursday Boris Johnson said he had seen no evidence to support Mr Wragg's allegations. No 10 not investigating MP blackmail claims What are whips and are MPs scared of them? Sue Gray report: What exactly is she looking at? It comes as Tory whips and No 10 try to shore up support for the prime minster ahead of civil servant Sue Gray's report into a series of Downing Street lockdown parties which is expected next week. Mr Johnson has been facing down an attempt from some Conservative MPs to oust him since he admitted attending a drinks event at No 10 during the first lockdown, although he says he believed it was a work event. So far six Tory MPs have publicly declared no confidence in the PM, but more are thought to have submitted letters to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, who organises Tory leadership contests. Under party rules, if 54 letters are submitted a no confidence vote is triggered which could result in a leadership election. This video can not be played Tory MP David Davis to PM: In the name of God, go Mr Wragg, MP for Hazel Grove in Greater Manchester and chairman of the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, first raised his concerns on Thursday and advised colleagues who feel threatened to go to the police. He told the committee that Tory whips - the MPs in charge of party discipline - had threatened those suspected of wanting Mr Johnson out with the removal of government investment in their constituencies. He also said he had received reports of government ministers, advisers and staff at No 10 ""encouraging the publication of stories in the press seeking to embarrass"" those suspected of lacking confidence in the prime minister. Mr Wragg, who is also vice-chairman of the 1922 committee, claimed the reports ""would seem to constitute blackmail"" - and as well as contacting police, affected MPs should contact the Commons Speaker. He told the Daily Telegraph he would outline ""several"" examples of bullying and intimidation when he speaks to police. ""I stand by what I have said. No amount of gas-lighting will change that,"" he said. ""The offer of No 10 to investigate is kind but I shall leave it to the experts."" A Met Police spokesman said: ""As with any such allegations, should a criminal offence be reported to the Met, it would be considered."" ANALYSIS:Christian Wakeford's long walk to defection REALITY CHECK:The Covid rules when Downing Street parties were held PROFILE:What is Sue Gray investigating? TIMELINE:Alleged government lockdown gatherings After Mr Wragg made his allegations on Thursday, Christian Wakeford - who this week defected from the Conservatives to the Labour Party - said he was threatened he would not get a high school in his constituency if he did not vote in a certain way. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng later questioned Mr Wakeford's claims, saying he had ""never heard of anything like this"" since becoming an MP but if it had happened it would be ""very seriously regarded"" by the government. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, who is chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, also said he had not experienced or been told about any instances of blackmail, despite voting against the government on several occasions. He told BBC Breakfast his relationship with whips had always been ""productive"".

"The student officers had been due to commence training in March The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) is to postpone the recruitment of 85 officers due to financial pressures. In a letter to the Policing Board, Chief Constable Simon Byrne described the move as ""prudent"" in the circumstances. The student officers had been due to start training in March and would have upped costs by up to Â£5m this year. It is understood the Northern Ireland Executive is aware of the development. The move comes amid police concerns at Stormont's current draft budget and a warning that, if implemented, officer numbers could drop by 900 over the next three years. It currently has about 7,000 officers. The PSNI has said that in its current form the budget would leave it facing an operational shortfall of Â£180m between 2022 and 2025. Simon Byrne described the postponement as ""prudent"" in the circumstances It believes the financial squeeze could only be addressed by having fewer officers - those retiring at a rate of 300 a year would likely not be replaced. However, some level of recruitment is seen as preferable. Police recruitment 'a challenge' in working class areas Catholic recruitment an issue as PSNI turns 20 In the 2020 New Decade, New Approach political agreement, which led to the restoration of devolved government at Stormont, the executive pledged to increase officer numbers to 7,500. The PSNI is largely funded through the Department of Justice. The department told the BBC that Justice Minister Naomi Long believed Stormont's draft budget ""would be damaging to the fabric of the justice system"". ""Whilst the minister secured funding to increase [police officer] numbers last year, that progress would be reversed if the current draft budget were to be agreed,"" said the department. ""Given around 70% of the justice budget is spent on policing, there will potentially be significant reductions in the numbers employed in policing and significant and detrimental impacts to key public services provided by the justice system in order to live within the draft budget. ""There would be very damaging outcomes for some of the most vulnerable in our society."" In 2020 the Stormont executive pledged to increase police officer numbers to 7,500 Almost 80% of the PSNI's allocation goes on staff operating costs. In his letter to the Policing Board, seen by BBC News NI, Mr Byrne states while recognising consultation on the budget is still ongoing, ""we consider it prudent to defer recruitment planned for March"". It goes on: ""The impact is that 85 student officers will not now commence training."" Mr Byrne adds that if there was a ""remedy"" to the budget, ""we are in a position to accelerate recruitment intakes to maintain operational capability"". Policing Board member Jonathan Buckley, who is a Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) assembly member, said he was aware of the decision to postpone recruitment and was ""extremely concerned"". The DUP is against the draft budget in its current form. ""We need more officers, not less, and the finance minister needs to provide the funding required to ensure the commitment to 7,500 officers is met,"" said Mr Buckley.

"This video can not be played The secret rescue network to evade hamster Covid cull Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has warned that Covid-19 infections could be growing exponentially in one part of the city and more cases spreading due to an outbreak in pet hamsters. Earlier this week, authorities ordered a hamster cull following the outbreak. The spate of Delta cases had been linked to a pet shop worker which prompted officials to test hamsters, with some found positive. Hong Kong pursues a ""zero-Covid"" strategy to eliminate the disease. Ms Lam urged people to avoid gatherings ahead of next week's Lunar New Year as the territory also tackles an outbreak of the Omicron variant. The Asian financial hub has some of the world's tightest coronavirus rules as it follows mainland China's tough zero-Covid policies. ""We are worried that the exponential growth of cases that we have seen in other parts of the world is now happening in Kwai Chung,"" she is quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. Kwai Chung is a highly-populated residential area north of the city's Kowloon peninsula. The outbreak was linked to an employee of this pet shop in the Causeway Bay area She said cases involving the Delta variant were also rising because of the hamster outbreak. ""I understand that pet owners are unhappy... the biggest public interest is to control the pandemic,"" she said. Some 2,000 hamsters and other small mammals are set to be culled because of the outbreak linked to the pet shop. Officials say it may be an example of animal-to-human Covid transmission. Thousands of people have signed a petition against the move, and thousands more have offered on social media to save the pets.

"Ukrainian paratroopers patrol the frontline The UK must do more to support Ukraine as ""combat-ready"" Russian troops gather on its borders, the chair of the Commons Defence Select Committee says. Tobias Ellwood said Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""taking full advantage of a weakened West"". ""We are looking risk-adverse and somewhat timid... I suspect an invasion is now imminent,"" he told the BBC. He warned that Mr Putin was ""redrawing the map of eastern Europe"" adding ""it's so important that we step forward"". Western and Ukrainian intelligence services have suggested an invasion or incursion could happen some time in early 2022, after Russian forces amassed on the border. Russia has denied it is planning an invasion, but Mr Putin issued demands to the West which he says concern Russia's security, including that Ukraine be stopped from joining Nato. He also wants Nato to abandon military exercises and stop sending weapons to eastern Europe, seeing this as a direct threat to Russia's security. Mr Ellwood said he was ""really pleased"" that the UK had recently agreed to supply Ukraine withdefensive weapons and extra troopsfor training, albeit ""late in the day"" - and that France and Spain were following Britain's example. But he said the US ""was looking a little bit timid"", suggesting that the US administration was caught up with domestic issues, with foreign policy focused on Taiwan and China. ""Politicians and leaders need to make the case [for Ukraine's defence],"" said Mr Ellwood. ""From where I sit the world is getting more dangerous, not less. ""We need to explain it to the British people, we need to explain it to the American people, the consequences... of allowing Russia to advance and change the borders in eastern Europe. ""There are ripple effects, that affect international security and, by extension, prosperity as well."" His views were backed by Labour leader Keir Starmerwho tweeted on Saturday,external: ""To protect our values and our security we must be steadfast in our opposition to Russian aggression. We must stand with our Ukrainian allies."" Hours after Russia's foreign minister and his US counterpart held what they called""frank"" talks to try to reduce the chance of a wider conflict in Ukraine, a US shipment of ""lethal aid""arrived in Ukraine's capital, Kyivon Saturday. The delivery, including ammunition for ""front line defenders"", marked the first part of a $200m (Â£147.5m) security support package approved by US President Joe Biden in December. In a post on Facebook,,externalUS embassy in Kyiv said the shipment demonstrated its ""firm commitment to Ukraine's sovereign right to self-defense"". EXPLAINED:Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine?

Emailyourquestions@bbc.co.uk On Friday, Downing Street said the Russian government will be ""punished"" if it ""crosses the line"" on Ukraine. The PM's deputy official spokesman said ""any destabilising action"" by Russia would be a strategic mistake with significant consequences. Mr Ellwood said it was important to look at ""the wider picture"" as far as Mr Putin's approach was concerned: ""He wants a legacy, he wants to be seen as the most powerful state in Europe."" He suggested the Russian president had ""boxed himself into a corner"" with some 100,000 Russian troops currently amassed on the border ""but he also recognises that he will never again be as strong as this."" ""This is more than just about Ukraine, this is about Putin wanting to establish, absolutely, a sphere of influence way beyond Ukraine itself."" ""He certainly doesn't want the EU or Nato rubbing up against the Russian Empire; he needs that buffer zone."" ""Nato needs to develop a fresh sense of purpose,"" he cautioned. This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line Nato's 30 members - including the UK, US and several former Soviet Union states which share a border with Russia - agree that an armed attack against one is an attack against them all, and they will come to the aid of one another. Dozens of British troops have been in Ukraine since 2015 to help train their armed forces, and the UK has also made a commitment to help rebuild Ukraine's navy following Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014. ""The only way forward is for Russia to deescalate and engage in meaningful discussions,"" a Downing Street spokesman said on Friday. Speaking from trade talks in Sydney, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Mr Putin must ""desist and step back from Ukraine before he makes a massive strategic mistake"", she said. Russia's president has long claimed that the US broke a guarantee it made in 1990 that Nato would not expand further east. ""They simply deceived us!"" he said at a news conference last month. Interpretations differ over what exactly was promised to the then-Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. But it is clear that Mr Putin believes the guarantee was made. Since then, several central and eastern European countries, which used to be part of the Soviet Union or its sphere of influence, have joined Nato. Four of them - Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - have borders with Russia. Russia argues that this expansion, and the presence of Nato troops and military equipment near its borders, is a direct threat to its security. The country seized and annexed the Crimean peninsula in southern Ukraine in 2014 after Ukrainians overthrew their pro-Russian president. Ever since, Ukraine's military has been locked in a war with Russian-backed rebels in areas of the east near Russia's borders. There are fears that the conflict, which has claimed 14,000 lives and caused at least two million people to flee their homes, may reignite and that Russia's military will cross the border.

"This video can not be played MPs should report intimidation tactics to the police, says William Wragg A Conservative backbencher who accused Downing Street of trying to ""blackmail"" MPs seeking to oust Boris Johnson is to meet police to discuss his allegations. William Wragg said he will be speaking to a Met Police detective in the House of Commons early next week, after requesting a meeting with the force. The MP, who wants the prime minister to quit, said he wanted to leave any probe to ""experts"" rather than No 10. Downing Street said it had not seen any proof of the behaviour he alleges. A spokesman said on Friday they were not investigating the allegations but would look ""carefully"" at any evidence presented to them. Chris Bryant, who is chairman of the Commons Committee on Standards, said he had spoken to about a dozen Tory MPs in the past few days who had made similar allegations of whips threatening to withdraw funding for their constituencies, including for campaigning and infrastructure such as bypasses and schools. ""I've even heard MPs alleging that the prime minister himself has been doing this,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He described the alleged behaviour as ""misconduct in public office"" and said it was a matter for the police. The Labour MP added that he believed this had happened much more over the past 10 years and there had been ""a steady erosion of standards in the way we allocate funding"". On Thursday Boris Johnson said he had seen no evidence to support Mr Wragg's allegations. No 10 not investigating MP blackmail claims What are whips and are MPs scared of them? Sue Gray report: What exactly is she looking at? It comes as Tory whips and No 10 try to shore up support for the prime minster ahead of civil servant Sue Gray's report into a series of Downing Street lockdown parties which is expected next week. Mr Johnson has been facing down an attempt from some Conservative MPs to oust him since he admitted attending a drinks event at No 10 during the first lockdown, although he says he believed it was a work event. So far six Tory MPs have publicly declared no confidence in the PM, but more are thought to have submitted letters to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, who organises Tory leadership contests. Under party rules, if 54 letters are submitted a no confidence vote is triggered which could result in a leadership election. This video can not be played Tory MP David Davis to PM: In the name of God, go Mr Wragg, MP for Hazel Grove in Greater Manchester and chairman of the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, first raised his concerns on Thursday and advised colleagues who feel threatened to go to the police. He told the committee that Tory whips - the MPs in charge of party discipline - had threatened those suspected of wanting Mr Johnson out with the removal of government investment in their constituencies. He also said he had received reports of government ministers, advisers and staff at No 10 ""encouraging the publication of stories in the press seeking to embarrass"" those suspected of lacking confidence in the prime minister. Mr Wragg, who is also vice-chairman of the 1922 committee, claimed the reports ""would seem to constitute blackmail"" - and as well as contacting police, affected MPs should contact the Commons Speaker. He told the Daily Telegraph he would outline ""several"" examples of bullying and intimidation when he speaks to police. ""I stand by what I have said. No amount of gas-lighting will change that,"" he said. ""The offer of No 10 to investigate is kind but I shall leave it to the experts."" A Met Police spokesman said: ""As with any such allegations, should a criminal offence be reported to the Met, it would be considered."" ANALYSIS:Christian Wakeford's long walk to defection REALITY CHECK:The Covid rules when Downing Street parties were held PROFILE:What is Sue Gray investigating? TIMELINE:Alleged government lockdown gatherings After Mr Wragg made his allegations on Thursday, Christian Wakeford - who this week defected from the Conservatives to the Labour Party - said he was threatened he would not get a high school in his constituency if he did not vote in a certain way. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng later questioned Mr Wakeford's claims, saying he had ""never heard of anything like this"" since becoming an MP but if it had happened it would be ""very seriously regarded"" by the government. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, who is chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, also said he had not experienced or been told about any instances of blackmail, despite voting against the government on several occasions. He told BBC Breakfast his relationship with whips had always been ""productive"".

"When BBC correspondent Dan Johnson posted on Twitter shortly before Christmas that he had finished editing a project capturing the voice of his late father Graeme, he was surprised by the reaction. It made him consider the importance of preserving the memories of loved ones. Through the dark days of December, my dad was a constant companion. He spoke to me almost every day while I limited my social life to protect my Christmas plans. I couldn't speak to him, though. He'd died four years earlier. I'd finally got round to editing his own personal version ofDesert Island Discs- the long-running BBC radio programme where guests share the soundtrack of their lives - recorded in his last few months. I listened over and over to set the sound levels, carefully piecing together his audio jigsaw - the music that meant the most to him, and the comedians who made him laugh. He had lung cancer, despite never smoking, and while we knew his life would be shortened, his outlook was positive - he was responding to treatment and focused entirely on living. We never discussed death. His suggestion, that we sit down and cover everything from Dusty Springfield to The Moody Blues, Morecambe and Wise to Eddie Izzard, was the only hint of something to leave behind, apart from a bench overlooking his favourite view across Green Moor cricket ground high on a hill in South Yorkshire. It's the sort of talking we didn't do much of. He was a fairly typical Yorkshireman when it came to emotions. Besides that, I wouldn't have felt able to raise the idea for fear of negatively affecting his optimistic outlook, maybe even his chances. But thankfully, he was up for it and signalled a willingness to step outside our usual comfort zone. Even if his intention was to speak only about songs and sketches, I saw a chance to nudge him into reflecting a little on life and the things that made him tick. We started recording on a wet and windy night in September 2017, hunkered down in the old station master's house at Ribblehead, by the impressive viaduct in the Yorkshire Dales. We were away for a few days in one of his favourite spots, where he'd stayed decades before as a boy scout on his first night away from family in Hull. Now he'd been drawn back. Graeme said he was introduced to the power of music through a neighbour's radiogram in Hull He'd already given me a scrawled list of clips to play next to the warming fire as trains passed by the window. I waved a microphone towards him and he explained he thought it would be a nice thing to hand on, something he wished he had from his parents and grandparents. As we embarked on the list, he described a fascination with sound, its power and projection, that began as a young boy at the house of a neighbour who had a big radiogram. He captured typical family life at the end of the 1960s, gathered around watching the Morecambe and Wise Christmas special and having to take his turn on the new ""Hi-Fi system"" to play his budding LP collection that started with the Beatles' Abbey Road. The older girls next door had asked if he wanted to see the Beatles with them at Hull's ABC cinema. His parents said 12-year-old Graeme was too young. I never knew he'd flunked his A-Levels and been forced to take a gap year to weigh up his options. He spent that summer in France, working on a campsite, where the local kids played Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon on the bar's jukebox. Graeme had hidden a teenage love of Motown because he said it wasn't cool at the time He went on to build a career in town planning, which took him to Liverpool, Nottingham and Barnsley, where he worked on redeveloping a landscape scarred by coal mines and coke works. He'd drag me and my sister along the redundant railway lines converted to cycle paths or march us up replanted slag heaps to see the new roads and modern warehouses which were replacing the old industries. In the old station master's house, we talked about Van Morrison being a grumpy old man but a great performer. He remembered Bruce Springsteen's epic live gigs full of energy. He described a secret teenage love of Motown, hidden because it wasn't deemed cool at the time. Making my Dad's Desert Island Discs: Listen on BBC Sounds As he relaxed a bit, he confessed some thoughts of ""what if"", but was content things had worked out well. He'd made plans in life but had always been flexible, prepared to take opportunities and confident things would be fine. After three recording sessions, we were about two thirds of the way down his playlist when time ran out. I started editing soon after his lungs suddenly deteriorated at the end of 2017. But I found it tough. It was upsetting and I faced a difficult decision. Without a proper ending, I wasn't sure how to wrap up his unfinished symphony. I wonder if I was also reluctant to complete what had become the last task of his life. Dan and Graeme on the weekend they made the recording in the Yorkshire Dales True to form, he'd left a list of scribbled suggestions, so eventually I took that, explained his spoken contribution would end there, then let his other choices play through. There was other stuff that went unsaid. He chose Dear John, sung by Eddi Reader but written by Kirsty MacColl about the end of her marriage. My dad referred to his own divorce, but he didn't say much and I didn't press him. ""It had a resonance, it rang a bell,"" he said. ""It made me think, yes, she's captured that very well."" These were hints of deeper meaning behind his choices, even the entire project. He was more emotionally engaged than he let on. He'd learned to love music listening to albums in their entirety, through upbeat hits and darker melodies, changing moods and different tones. He took the rough with the smooth and focused on the overarching narrative, aware that development comes in stages and hopeful that it would be alright in the end - whatever happens along the way. Some of my family were wary of listening to the finished recording. They'd had four years of radio silence and had to brace themselves to hear his voice again. My sister said it wasn't the gut punch that she'd feared it might be. She found it warm and comforting, not distant or upsetting. The familiarity reassured her that she hadn't forgotten him. Van Morrison brought tears because Brown Eyed Girl had been set as his ringtone. Graeme with his grandson Ted I appreciate we're really fortunate to have this. I know so many others do not, and I'm sorry. I hope photos, videos and stories can help keep memories fresh and flowing. Death has snatched suddenly from so many families, without even the chance to say goodbye. But if you have the opportunity, make the most of it - get something recorded. It doesn't matter what you talk about. The reflections and insights are powerful but really, it's much simpler than that. I'll never hear my dad as an old man, the tales he would have told his grandsons, the new interests he'd have immersed himself in. But he left me his snorting, sniggering laughter, the traces of his Hull accent still stretching out his words, and his friendly voice preserved in all its rich, gentle warmth. ""I may be old, but at least I got to see all the best bands,"" he said, quoting one of his own statement t-shirts. It's arguable. He'd only just turned 63 and, as he said himself, he never did see the Beatles.

"Matthew Willson had been visiting his girlfriend when he was shot, according to US police An English astrophysicist was killed by a stray bullet that travelled through a wall and hit him in his bed, US authorities have said. Dr Matthew Willson, 31, from Chertsey, Surrey, was found with a single gunshot wound to the head. Police were called to an apartment in Brookhaven, Atlanta, at 02:00 local time (07:00 GMT) last Sunday. Sgt Jake Kissel, from the Brookhaven Police Department, said the shooting was believed to have been a random act. There have been no arrests so far. Sgt Kissel said the stray bullet that hit Dr Willson travelled less than 100 yards (91m) and entered through an exterior wall of the apartment. ""The two apartment complexes where the gunfire took place and where Matthew was staying, they're separated by a patch of woods, so they back up to each other,"" he said. ""We're saying it's the reckless discharge of firearms from one apartment complex and the stray bullet travelled through the woods and entered his apartment."" Dr Willson was in the US visiting his girlfriend Katherine Shepard. Aman Kar, who shared the flat with Ms Shepard, told BBC Breakfast ""multiple rounds of gunshots"" were fired in the opposite complex ""about 20ft away"" in the early hours of Sunday 16 January. Mr Kar added that the gunfire ""had happened before... but not for so long"". He said the pair moved into the apartment last August and recalled two similar incidents in October and November when police had been called - but said it was ""just a few shots"" on those occasions. ""This time it kept going on for 20 or 30 minutes, until one of the stray bullets hit Matthew."" Mr Kar said he hoped somebody would come forward with more information on the incident ""because as much as it's an accident, it's also not, because the sheer number of shots that were fired. ""It's hard to see how something so random happened. It's reckless... reckless people with guns."" Dr Willson was in an apartment block on Clairmont Road in Brookhaven when he was killed Sgt Kissel said investigators were following up on all leads, adding: ""We're receiving tips from the public and our investigator team has been working around the clock to ensure that we're tracking down the individuals that are responsible."" He said an innocent bystander being struck by a stray bullet was the first incident ""of its kind"" in Brookhaven and was an ""alarming"" and ""tragic event"". ""Even though we believe that it was a random act and complete reckless discharging of firearms, we're still approaching it as a homicide,"" he added. Dr Willson was taken to a local trauma centre but died of his injuries. The Foreign Office said it was ""supporting the family of a British man following his death"".

"Ana de Armas appeared in the latest Bond film No Time to Die Two US fans of Cuban-Spanish actress Ana de Armas have sued Hollywood studio Universal Pictures, saying they were duped into renting a film because she was in the trailer. Conor Woulfe and Peter Rosza say they each paid $3.99 (Â£2.94) for the comedy Yesterday, only to discover the actress had been removed from the final cut. They are seeking $5m in compensation on behalf of all affected viewers. Universal Pictures has so far not commented on the issue. The fans say they were victims of deceptive marketing, and that Universal used de Armas's ""fame, radiance and brilliance"" to promote a film she wasn't in. ""Although defendant included the scenes with Ms de Armas in the movie trailer advertisements, for the purposes of promoting Yesterday and enticing film sales and rentals, Ms de Armas is not and was never in the publicly released version of the movie,"" says the complaint filed in California on Friday, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Yesterday is about a singer-songwriter who hits his head and wakes up to discover he is the only person on Earth who remembers the Beatles. Ana de Armas - who appeared in the latest Bond film No Time to Die - was to have co-starred as a love interest of the singer in the comedy. Daniel Craig's last Bond film finally premieres But the scenes with the 33-year-old actress were cut, apparently because audiences did not like that aspect of the storyline. Richard Curtis, the screenwriter, said in 2019 that it had been a ""very traumatic cut"", because de Armas was ""brilliant"" in the role.

"Olympic champion Chris Boardman is to lead a new body that aims to encourage cycling and walking. Active Travel England will seek to improve infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians as well as funding projects to improve air quality. Mr Boardman, previously commissioner for Transport for Greater Manchester, is to become the interim commissioner of the York-based organisation. It comes as ministers pledged Â£5.5m of investment in cycling and walking. Active Travel England also has a role in inspecting the standards of local highways and ensuring that major planning applications cater for the interests of cyclists and walkers. Boardman appointed Sport England chair London becomes worldâs most congested city Cyclist deaths soar on rural roads in England In his Manchester post, Mr Boardman helped to set up the first phase of the city'sBee Network,externalfor cyclists and walkers. He said high levels of cycling and walking had positive benefits which are ""clearly visible in pockets around the country where people have been given easy and safe alternatives to driving"". Mr Boardman, who won Olympic cycling gold at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, said: ""Perhaps most important of all, though, it makes for better places to live while helping both the NHS and our mission to decarbonise."" He told the BBC he was inspired to help improve cycling and waking infrastructure when he felt it was not safe for his daughter to ride less than 550 metres to their local park. He said the body would ensure schemes met a national standard ""so you would feel comfortable letting your kids ride or walk to school in the mornings"". ""A lot of the time we haven't got a consistent standard so we can't trust what we see. And sometimes it's, 'let's get people who want to ride bikes out of the way of the car' and it's not convenient and it doesn't make people feel safe,"" he added. This video can not be played Tips from the Netherlands on how to build a nation of cyclists Duncan Dollimore, from Cycling UK, told BBC Breakfast his organisation had been campaigning for separate infrastructure for active travel for many years but that needed investment. However, for places such as rural roads, where new infrastructure is unlikely to be built soon, he said it was also important to change the behaviour of drivers and raise awareness about how to keep cyclists safe. Active Travel England begins its work in the summer and Mr Boardman said it was time to ""enable the whole nation to travel easily and safely around their neighbourhoods without feeling compelled to rely on cars"". The Department of Transport confirmed its funding for England, which was previously announced, will include Â£3m to boost cycling infrastructure around railway stations and Â£300,000 to subsidise 250 electric cargo delivery bikes for small businesses. A total of Â£2.2m is also being made available to local authorities to explore making cycling and walking part of NHS ""social prescribing"" schemes, which sees patients being referred to non-clinical services for support.

"Ukrainian paratroopers patrol the frontline The UK must do more to support Ukraine as ""combat-ready"" Russian troops gather on its borders, the chair of the Commons Defence Select Committee says. Tobias Ellwood said Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""taking full advantage of a weakened West"". ""We are looking risk-adverse and somewhat timid... I suspect an invasion is now imminent,"" he told the BBC. He warned that Mr Putin was ""redrawing the map of eastern Europe"" adding ""it's so important that we step forward"". Western and Ukrainian intelligence services have suggested an invasion or incursion could happen some time in early 2022, after Russian forces amassed on the border. Russia has denied it is planning an invasion, but Mr Putin issued demands to the West which he says concern Russia's security, including that Ukraine be stopped from joining Nato. He also wants Nato to abandon military exercises and stop sending weapons to eastern Europe, seeing this as a direct threat to Russia's security. Mr Ellwood said he was ""really pleased"" that the UK had recently agreed to supply Ukraine withdefensive weapons and extra troopsfor training, albeit ""late in the day"" - and that France and Spain were following Britain's example. But he said the US ""was looking a little bit timid"", suggesting that the US administration was caught up with domestic issues, with foreign policy focused on Taiwan and China. ""Politicians and leaders need to make the case [for Ukraine's defence],"" said Mr Ellwood. ""From where I sit the world is getting more dangerous, not less. ""We need to explain it to the British people, we need to explain it to the American people, the consequences... of allowing Russia to advance and change the borders in eastern Europe. ""There are ripple effects, that affect international security and, by extension, prosperity as well."" His views were backed by Labour leader Keir Starmerwho tweeted on Saturday,external: ""To protect our values and our security we must be steadfast in our opposition to Russian aggression. We must stand with our Ukrainian allies."" Hours after Russia's foreign minister and his US counterpart held what they called""frank"" talks to try to reduce the chance of a wider conflict in Ukraine, a US shipment of ""lethal aid""arrived in Ukraine's capital, Kyivon Saturday. The delivery, including ammunition for ""front line defenders"", marked the first part of a $200m (Â£147.5m) security support package approved by US President Joe Biden in December.

Emailyourquestions@bbc.co.uk On Friday, Downing Street said the Russian government will be ""punished"" if it ""crosses the line"" on Ukraine. The PM's deputy official spokesman said ""any destabilising action"" by Russia would be a strategic mistake with significant consequences. Mr Ellwood said it was important to look at ""the wider picture"" as far as Mr Putin's approach was concerned: ""He wants a legacy, he wants to be seen as the most powerful state in Europe."" He suggested the Russian president had ""boxed himself into a corner"" with some 100,000 Russian troops currently amassed on the border ""but he also recognises that he will never again be as strong as this."" ""This is more than just about Ukraine, this is about Putin wanting to establish, absolutely, a sphere of influence way beyond Ukraine itself."" ""He certainly doesn't want the EU or Nato rubbing up against the Russian Empire; he needs that buffer zone."" ""Nato needs to develop a fresh sense of purpose,"" he cautioned. This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line Nato's 30 members - including the UK, US and several former Soviet Union states which share a border with Russia - agree that an armed attack against one is an attack against them all, and they will come to the aid of one another. Dozens of British troops have been in Ukraine since 2015 to help train their armed forces, and the UK has also made a commitment to help rebuild Ukraine's navy following Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014. ""The only way forward is for Russia to deescalate and engage in meaningful discussions,"" a Downing Street spokesman said on Friday. Speaking from trade talks in Sydney, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Mr Putin must ""desist and step back from Ukraine before he makes a massive strategic mistake"", she said. Russia's president has long claimed that the US broke a guarantee it made in 1990 that Nato would not expand further east. ""They simply deceived us!"" he said at a news conference last month. Interpretations differ over what exactly was promised to the then-Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. But it is clear that Mr Putin believes the guarantee was made. Since then, several central and eastern European countries, which used to be part of the Soviet Union or its sphere of influence, have joined Nato. Four of them - Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - have borders with Russia. Russia argues that this expansion, and the presence of Nato troops and military equipment near its borders, is a direct threat to its security. The country seized and annexed the Crimean peninsula in southern Ukraine in 2014 after Ukrainians overthrew their pro-Russian president. Ever since, Ukraine's military has been locked in a war with Russian-backed rebels in areas of the east near Russia's borders. There are fears that the conflict, which has claimed 14,000 lives and caused at least two million people to flee their homes, may reignite and that Russia's military will cross the border.

"Janet was one of 69 victims who had a total of nearly Â£4m stolen ""It just seems like you're put in a heap, you're just one of a number."" After having Â£25,000 stolen by fraudsters, 74-year-old Janet from Essex was told the police would not investigate her case. BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme has discovered she is one of 69 known victims of one particular scam which has seen criminals steal Â£3.9m since 2018 - but only one of their cases has been investigated. Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services, Matt Parr, has described the police response as ""woeful"". ""These people [victims] shouldn't be discounted,"" he says. ""These are high-harm crimes. And it's impossible to imagine, from my perspective, how those people are feeling with that kind of service."" Criminals pretended to be from the legitimate private bank Kleinwort Hambros, convincing victims to transfer money to them using branded documents and names of real employees at the bank. Janet was in recovery from a stroke when she was targeted. While her loss was smaller than most victims, with the highest having been Â£465,000, she says the impact was more than just financial. ""The money was my mum and dad's and I just felt I let them down. I know it may sound silly, but, I just thought that was it."" It was the largest amount of money she'd ever had, following the sale of her mother's bungalow after her death. ""I had sleepless nights thinking about it. It was always on my mind."" The public are encouraged to report fraud to Action Fraud, the UK's national reporting centre for fraud and cybercrime, run by the City of London Police Reports to Action Fraud are sent to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) The NFIB decides if cases should be passed to a police force for further investigation, based on those with the ""best opportunity"" to investigate Local police forces then decide whether or not to investigate The City of London Police, which is the UK lead police force for fraud, makes the decision about whether to forward reports to the police. It says it takes into consideration the amount lost, but prioritises those ""most likely to present an investigative opportunity for local police forces, those where a crime is ongoing and those that present the greatest threat and harm to the victim or victims concerned"". Of the 69 cases, the City of London Police says just five of the frauds were sent on to a regional force - in this case, Greater Manchester Police (GMP). GMP says it can only find a record of receiving just one, saying: ""This crime has been closed with no further action to be taken."" The force went on to say that all available lines of enquiry were undertaken, but not enough evidence was found to continue with the investigation. Of the 69 victims, police only investigated one case and no arrests were made The Home Office has admitted failings in these cases and told Money Box: ""Fraud can have a devastating impact on victims and it's vital that people have the confidence to come forward and know that their case will be dealt with properly. This did not happen for these victims and the public should rightly expect more from policing."" The Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales, Dame Vera Baird QC, says she is worried the public are losing confidence in fraud policing. ""Confidence is hard to find, but we are promised action, so let's hope a corner can be turned soon. It can't come quickly enough."" The Nationwide Building Society, where Janet had held her money, initially refused to refund her the money that was stolen, despite its being a signatory toa code designed to protect individuals tricked into transferring money to fraudsters. The code, which was created in May 2019, obliges banks and building societies to refund ""no-blame"" victims of this type of authorised push payment (APP) fraud.

"Ukrainian paratroopers patrol the frontline The UK must do more to support Ukraine as ""combat-ready"" Russian troops gather on its borders, the chair of the Commons Defence Select Committee says. Tobias Ellwood said Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""taking full advantage of a weakened West"". ""We are looking risk-adverse and somewhat timid... I suspect an invasion is now imminent,"" he told the BBC. He warned that Mr Putin was ""redrawing the map of eastern Europe"" adding ""it's so important that we step forward"". Western and Ukrainian intelligence services have suggested an invasion or incursion could happen some time in early 2022, after Russian forces amassed on the border. Russia has denied it is planning an invasion, but Mr Putin issued demands to the West which he says concern Russia's security, including that Ukraine be stopped from joining Nato. He also wants Nato to abandon military exercises and stop sending weapons to eastern Europe, seeing this as a direct threat to Russia's security. Mr Ellwood said he was ""really pleased"" that the UK had recently agreed to supply Ukraine withdefensive weapons and extra troopsfor training, albeit ""late in the day"" - and that France and Spain were following Britain's example. But he said the US ""was looking a little bit timid"", suggesting that the US administration was caught up with domestic issues, with foreign policy focused on Taiwan and China. ""Politicians and leaders need to make the case [for Ukraine's defence],"" said Mr Ellwood. ""From where I sit the world is getting more dangerous, not less. ""We need to explain it to the British people, we need to explain it to the American people, the consequences... of allowing Russia to advance and change the borders in eastern Europe. ""There are ripple effects, that affect international security and, by extension, prosperity as well."" His views were backed by Labour leader Keir Starmerwho tweeted on Saturday,external: ""To protect our values and our security we must be steadfast in our opposition to Russian aggression. We must stand with our Ukrainian allies."" Hours after Russia's foreign minister and his US counterpart held what they called""frank"" talks to try to reduce the chance of a wider conflict in Ukraine, a US shipment of ""lethal aid""arrived in Ukraine's capital, Kyivon Saturday. The delivery, including ammunition for ""front line defenders"", marked the first part of a $200m (Â£147.5m) security support package approved by US President Joe Biden in December. In a post on Facebook,,externalUS embassy in Kyiv said the shipment demonstrated its ""firm commitment to Ukraine's sovereign right to self-defense"". EXPLAINED:Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? FROM KYIV:Ukrainians wait as Russia faces off with the West FROM BRUSSELS:EU 'closest to war' in decades over Russia-Ukraine crisis UK SUPPORT:UK says it is sending weapons to defend Ukraine What do you want to know about the tensions between Russia and Ukraine? Emailyourquestions@bbc.co.uk On Friday, Downing Street said the Russian government will be ""punished"" if it ""crosses the line"" on Ukraine. The PM's deputy official spokesman said ""any destabilising action"" by Russia would be a strategic mistake with significant consequences. Mr Ellwood said it was important to look at ""the wider picture"" as far as Mr Putin's approach was concerned: ""He wants a legacy, he wants to be seen as the most powerful state in Europe."" He suggested the Russian president had ""boxed himself into a corner"" with some 100,000 Russian troops currently amassed on the border ""but he also recognises that he will never again be as strong as this."" ""This is more than just about Ukraine, this is about Putin wanting to establish, absolutely, a sphere of influence way beyond Ukraine itself."" ""He certainly doesn't want the EU or Nato rubbing up against the Russian Empire; he needs that buffer zone."" ""Nato needs to develop a fresh sense of purpose,"" he cautioned. This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line Nato's 30 members - including the UK, US and several former Soviet Union states which share a border with Russia - agree that an armed attack against one is an attack against them all, and they will come to the aid of one another. Dozens of British troops have been in Ukraine since 2015 to help train their armed forces, and the UK has also made a commitment to help rebuild Ukraine's navy following Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014. ""The only way forward is for Russia to deescalate and engage in meaningful discussions,"" a Downing Street spokesman said on Friday. Speaking from trade talks in Sydney, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Mr Putin must ""desist and step back from Ukraine before he makes a massive strategic mistake"", she said. Russia's president has long claimed that the US broke a guarantee it made in 1990 that Nato would not expand further east. ""They simply deceived us!"" he said at a news conference last month. Interpretations differ over what exactly was promised to the then-Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. But it is clear that Mr Putin believes the guarantee was made. Since then, several central and eastern European countries, which used to be part of the Soviet Union or its sphere of influence, have joined Nato. Four of them - Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - have borders with Russia. Russia argues that this expansion, and the presence of Nato troops and military equipment near its borders, is a direct threat to its security. The country seized and annexed the Crimean peninsula in southern Ukraine in 2014 after Ukrainians overthrew their pro-Russian president.

"Thich Nhat Hanh died in Vietnam on Saturday Thich Nhat Hanh, an influential Vietnamese Buddhist monk, has died at the age of 95. His Zen teaching organisation, Plum Village, said the monk ""passed away peacefully"" at the Tu Hieu Temple in Hue, Vietnam on Saturday. A prolific author and peace activist, Thich Nhat Hanh, is often referred to as the ""father of mindfulness"". On Twitter, his organisation called for its followers to hold Thich Nhat Hanh ""in our hearts"". Thich Nhat Hanh, was exiled from Vietnam in the 1960s after opposing the war. During the height of the Vietnam War, he met with Martin Luther King, persuading the civil rights leader to speak out against the conflict. King later nominated Thich Nhat Hanh for a Nobel Peace Prize, describing him as ""an apostle of peace and non violence"". After hearing of the monk's death, King's daughter Bernice shared an image of the pair together. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The monk spent decades in France after being exiled and went on to establish monasteries and meditation centres around the world, known as the Plum Village Tradition. During his lifetime, he wrote more than 100 books that were translated into more than 40 languages. His last book was published in October 2021. He travelled on regular speaking tours of Europe and the US, talking about the practice of mindfulness. But his movement was hindered by Vietnam's communist government in 2009, when his Zen centre in Lam Dong was forced to close. In 2018, he returned to Vietnam and was permitted by authorities to spend his final days at the Tu Hieu temple. It is not yet clear how the government will react to his funeral, which is set to begin in Hue on Saturday and last five days.

"Hospitality restrictions have been relaxed in Northern Ireland Health Minister Robin Swann has said he hopes further relaxations of Covid restrictions signal ""the beginning of the end"" of the pandemic. On Friday, rules on self-isolation and table service in pubs and restaurants in Northern Ireland were relaxed. Next week, nightclubs will reopen and vaccine passports will not be needed to enter pubs, restaurants or cinemas. But Mr Swann said working from home guidance ""still stands"" and that it would be removed on a ""phased"" basis. In England, the advice to work from home has been removed, but in Northern Ireland the guidance is that people should work from home if they can, with employers ""encouraged to facilitate this"". This video can not be played Northern Ireland is coming to end of this wave of coronavirus, if not the pandemic, says Robin Swann. On Friday, the health minister told BBC News NI that any further changes would be in line with health advice and would be made clear by the executive. He also said there would be a ""full stock take"" by Stormont ministers of the remaining Covid regulations at their meeting on 10 February, including the laws on mandatory wearing of face coverings. ""I would encourage people to continue to wear them where appropriate, face coverings have played a vital role in our daily protection,"" Mr Swann added. The minister also said it was ""hugely frustrating"" that details of planned changes to Covid rules were leaked to the media ahead of Thursday's executive meeting. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said she had found out about the proposals through media outlets, rather than receiving detailed papers from ministerial colleagues. This video can not be played A Bangor restaurant owner says his business has suffered due to measures now being eased. Mr Swann said it was ""not a good way to do government or governance"" and said it had been a regular occurrence during the past two years of the pandemic. ""Sometimes the executive message has been divided, but that's been caused by messages being leaked before ministers have even had a chance to discuss them,"" he added. He also said while people needed to continue to exercise a level of caution, he was optimistic that ""we are moving in the right direction"" and thanked people for making continued sacrifices. The minimum period of self-isolation for those with Covid in Northern Ireland has changed to five full days from seven. People who test positive will need to produce negative lateral flow tests on day five and day six to end their period in isolation. As of noon on Friday, premises that serve alcohol were able to drop table service. The rule of six - in which tables are limited to up to six people from no more than six households - was also lifted. Other rule changes that came into force at noon included: Guidance limiting the number of households meeting indoors to three will be removed The requirement to provide proof of exemption for not wearing a face covering will be removed with the excuse of ""severe distress"" reintroduced The guidance on working from home will revert to doing so where you can, with employers encouraged to facilitate this Further rules are due to be relaxed from noon next Wednesday, 26 January, including dropping the use of vaccine passports at pubs, restaurants and cinemas, the reopening of nightclubs and the resumption of dancing and indoor standing events. Table service is no longer be required at premises that serve alcohol Vaccine passports will still be needed for nightclubs and indoor unseated and partially-seated events with 500 or more people in attendance. Also from 26 January, the need for offices to ""take reasonable measures for 2m (6ft) social distancing"" will be removed, although risk assessments should be carried out. The moves were agreed at a Northern Ireland Executive meeting on Thursday, with ministers due to review all remaining Covid restrictions again on 10 February. NI to scrap Covid passports in pubs and restaurants What are the Covid rules after new relaxations? The restrictions that have been easedcame into place just after Christmasin a bid to manage the number of cases of the Omicron variant. First Minister Paul Givan described the changes as a ""step in the right direction"" and said they reflected the changing circumstances in Northern Ireland. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was ""clear we were past the peak"" in terms of coronavirus case numbers and the number of Covid-19 patients in hospital. At their meeting on Thursday, ministers were advised by health officials that there may be a ""secondary peak"" in cases in the next two weeks as a result of further spread in school-aged children, but that existing measures would be ""sufficient"" to manage hospital admissions. Paul Givan and Michelle O'Neill announced the changes to the rules while on a visit to Londonderry Mr Givan also said the next executive meeting on 10 February would be an important one, when other measures would be discussed, adding that he wanted changes to the rules regarding face coverings. The decision to drop the need for vaccine passports was welcomed by several trade bodies. Angela McGowan, the Northern Ireland director of the Confederation of British Industry, said companies would be hopeful that ""we are finally starting to turn the corner on Covid-19"". Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill said the moves would provide ""incredible relief to our industry, but it will come too late for some"". ""The work only begins now in building back and pushing forward to reinstate hospitality as the Â£2bn sector it once was."" Irish government ministers aredue to meet in Dublin laterto discuss a possible easing of Covid-19 restrictions. It is understood the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) has given the green light to ending most public health measures, which came into force last month to curb the spread of the Omicron variant. Scotland, England and Wales have already announced some easing of restrictions. A number of Covid measures in England are to end from 27 January, with the advice for people to work from home being dropped, along with Covid passports and the requirement to wear a face covering in public places. In Scotland,rules on table service in hospitality venues will be lifted from Monday, when nightclubs will also be allowed to reopen, whilein Wales a three-week plan for scrapping restrictionshas been set out. The Republic of Ireland's government has suggestedchanges are likely to its restrictionstoo, including large crowds returning to outdoor events. RULES:What are the restrictions in Northern Ireland?

It will be the American's first ever Grand Slam fourth round appearance, and it promises to be a rather tough match... Evans 4-6 1-6 1-6 Auger-Aliassime Felix Auger-Aliassime hit 40 winners in that victory, compared to just 10 from Dan Evans. Evans 4-6 1-6 1-6 Auger-Aliassime Felix Auger-Aliassime, speaking on court:""That's definitely one of the best Grand Slam performances I've had. ""I was fortunate to get the break point and take the first set and after that, for some reason, everything was working for me today. ""I always hear good things about this court. It's the first time I've played on it so to get the win is probably a good sign."" Evans 4-6 1-6 1-6 Auger-Aliassime After a competitive first set that was a pretty underwhelming contest, if we're being honest. Felix Auger-Aliassime is through to the fourth round for a second year in a row at Melbourne Park. He'll play either former finalist Marin Cilic or fifth seed Andrey Rublev.

Ace number 18 ensures he races through a love hold and move within a game of the fourth round. Greek fourth seedStefanos Tsitsipashas also progressed to the fourth round with victory in four sets against Benoit Paire. Tsitsipas recorded a 6-3 7-5 6-7 (2-7) 6-4 victory on Rod Laver Arena against Frenchman Paire, ranked 56th. The two-time semi-finalist will face American 20th seedTaylor Fritznext for a place in the quarter-finals.

The Pole, who shot to fame by winning the 2020 French Open title as a 19-year-old, is the latest WTA Tour star to feature in a BBC Sport column. In her latest piece, she talks about finding a healthy work-life balance and how she is doing that in Melbourne with trips to St Kilda Beach. ""Even though I'm moving around the world all the time and switching time-zones, it can be easy for me to get bored,"" she says. ""And if I am going to get bored then I won't be as passionate on court - which is what me and my team want to avoid. ""Clearly, practising and preparing properly for a Grand Slam are the priorities but we also understand - and plan - that I have the time to do something cool every few days."" Read more from Iga here. Evans 4-6 1-6 1-2 Auger-Aliassime* No mistake from Auger-Aliassime this time! Another brilliant return of serve allows him to put his foot on the gas and eventually an under pressure Evans nets. *Evans 4-6 1-6 1-1 Auger-Aliassime That's just long again on the backhand from Evans as he's pushed into the corner of the court, and Auger-Aliassime will haveanother go at breaking.

"This video can not be played MPs should report intimidation tactics to the police, says William Wragg A Conservative backbencher who accused Downing Street of trying to ""blackmail"" MPs seeking to oust Boris Johnson is to meet police to discuss his allegations. William Wragg said he will be speaking to a Met Police detective in the House of Commons early next week, after requesting a meeting with the force. The MP, who wants the prime minister to quit, said he wanted to leave any probe to ""experts"" rather than No 10. Downing Street said it had not seen any proof of the behaviour he alleges. A spokesman said on Friday they were not investigating the allegations but would look ""carefully"" at any evidence presented to them. Chris Bryant, who is chairman of the Commons Committee on Standards, said he had spoken to about a dozen Tory MPs in the past few days who had made similar allegations of whips threatening to withdraw funding for their constituencies, including for campaigning and infrastructure such as bypasses and schools. ""I've even heard MPs alleging that the prime minister himself has been doing this,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He described the alleged behaviour as ""misconduct in public office"" and said it was a matter for the police. The Labour MP added that he believed this had happened much more over the past 10 years and there had been ""a steady erosion of standards in the way we allocate funding"". On Thursday Boris Johnson said he had seen no evidence to support Mr Wragg's allegations. No 10 not investigating MP blackmail claims What are whips and are MPs scared of them? Sue Gray report: What exactly is she looking at? It comes as Tory whips and No 10 try to shore up support for the prime minster ahead of civil servant Sue Gray's report into a series of Downing Street lockdown parties which is expected next week. Mr Johnson has been facing down an attempt from some Conservative MPs to oust him since he admitted attending a drinks event at No 10 during the first lockdown, although he says he believed it was a work event. So far six Tory MPs have publicly declared no confidence in the PM, but more are thought to have submitted letters to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, who organises Tory leadership contests. Under party rules, if 54 letters are submitted a no confidence vote is triggered which could result in a leadership election. This video can not be played Tory MP David Davis to PM: In the name of God, go Mr Wragg, MP for Hazel Grove in Greater Manchester and chairman of the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, first raised his concerns on Thursday and advised colleagues who feel threatened to go to the police. He told the committee that Tory whips - the MPs in charge of party discipline - had threatened those suspected of wanting Mr Johnson out with the removal of government investment in their constituencies. He also said he had received reports of government ministers, advisers and staff at No 10 ""encouraging the publication of stories in the press seeking to embarrass"" those suspected of lacking confidence in the prime minister. Mr Wragg, who is also vice-chairman of the 1922 committee, claimed the reports ""would seem to constitute blackmail"" - and as well as contacting police, affected MPs should contact the Commons Speaker. He told the Daily Telegraph he would outline ""several"" examples of bullying and intimidation when he speaks to police. ""I stand by what I have said. No amount of gas-lighting will change that,"" he said. ""The offer of No 10 to investigate is kind but I shall leave it to the experts."" A Met Police spokesman said: ""As with any such allegations, should a criminal offence be reported to the Met, it would be considered."" ANALYSIS:Christian Wakeford's long walk to defection REALITY CHECK:The Covid rules when Downing Street parties were held PROFILE:What is Sue Gray investigating? TIMELINE:Alleged government lockdown gatherings After Mr Wragg made his allegations on Thursday, Christian Wakeford - who this week defected from the Conservatives to the Labour Party - said he was threatened he would not get a high school in his constituency if he did not vote in a certain way. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng later questioned Mr Wakeford's claims, saying he had ""never heard of anything like this"" since becoming an MP but if it had happened it would be ""very seriously regarded"" by the government. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, who is chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, also said he had not experienced or been told about any instances of blackmail, despite voting against the government on several occasions. He told BBC Breakfast his relationship with whips had always been ""productive"".

"How do you solve a problem like bad information? When it comes to understanding science and making health decisions, it can have life-or-death consequences. People dissuaded from taking vaccines as a result of reading misleading information online haveended up in hospital or even died. And inaccurate or completely made-up claims about 5G and the origins of Covid-19 have been linked toviolenceandvandalism. But completely removing information can look a lot like censorship, especially for scientists whose careers are based on the understanding that facts can and should be disputed, and that evidence changes. The Royal Society is the world's oldest continuously operating scientific institution, and it is attempting to grapple with the challenges posed by our newest ways of communicating information. In a new report, it advises against social media companies removing content that is ""legal but harmful"". Instead, the report authors believe, social media sites should adjust their algorithms to prevent it going viral - and stop people making money off false claims. But not everyone agrees with that view - especially researchers who are experts in tracking the way misinformation spreads online, and how it harms people. The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) maintains there are cases when the best thing to do is to remove content when it is very harmful, clearly wrong and spreading very widely. The team points toPlandemic- a video that went viral at the start of the pandemic, making dangerous and false claims designed to scare people away from effective ways of reducing harm from the virus, like vaccines and masks, and was eventually taken down. Social media companies were better primed for the video's sequel Plandemic 2, which fell flat after being restricted on major platforms, having nothing like the same reach as the first video. ""It's a political question...what balance we see between individual liberties and some form of restrictions on what people can and cannot say,"" says Prof Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, director of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford. Prof Nielsen acknowledges that, although it's a relatively small part of people's media diets, science misinformation can lead to disproportionate harm. But, he adds, given a lack of trust in institutions is a big driver of misinformation: ""I imagine that there are quite a lot of citizens who would have their worst suspicions confirmed about how society works, if established institutions took a much more hands-on role in limiting people's access to information."" An anti-vaccine protest Echoing this concern, the Royal Society says: ""Removing content may exacerbate feelings of distrust and be exploited by others to promote misinformation content."" This ""may cause more harm than good by driving misinformation content...towards harder-to-address corners of the internet."" The fact that those corners are ""harder to reach"", though, is arguably part of the point. It reduces the risk that someone who is not already committed to potentially harmful beliefs, and isn't seeking them out, will be exposed to them by chance. Some of theviolent protests that were driven at least in part by conspiracieshad their origin not in obscure corners of the internet, but on Facebook. And there is little clear evidence that removing content drives people further into harmful beliefs. Scientific misinformation is nothing new. The HIV misinformation still circulating in 2021 The incorrect belief in a link between the MMR vaccine and autism came from a published (and later retracted) academic paper, while widespread unevidenced beliefs in the harm of water fluoridation were driven by the print media, campaign groups and word of mouth. What's changed is the speed at which false facts travel, and the huge numbers of people who can end up reading them. Rather than removing content, one way suggested by the report's authors of tackling misinformation is making it harder to find and share, and less likely to appear automatically on someone's feed. This video can not be played BBC Reality Check answers your vaccine concerns This, Prof Gina Neff, a social scientist at the Oxford Internet Institute explained, was to ""ensure that people still can speak their mind"" - they just aren't guaranteed an audience of millions. ""They can still post this information, but the platforms don't have to make it go viral."" The Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a think tank which monitors extremism, points out a substantial proportion of misinformation relies on the appropriation and misuse of genuine data and research. ""This is sometimes more dangerous than outright false information, because it can take substantially longer to debunk by explaining how and why this is a misreading or misuse of the data,"" its spokesperson says. That's where fact-checking comes in - another tool which the Royal Society supports. One of the most common pieces of vaccine misinformation over the past year - which the BBC hasrepeatedly fact-checked- was the notion that people are being harmed in high numbers by the jab. This claim is based on amisinterpretation of real figures. The ISD says research has shown that a small group of accounts spreading misinformation had a ""disproportionate influence on the public debate across social media"". ""Many of these accounts have been labelled by fact-checkers as sharing false or misleading content on multiple occasions, yet remain live."" The Royal Society did not investigate removing the accounts of ""influencers"" who are especially prolific spreaders of harmful misinformation. But this is seen as an important tool by many disinformation experts, and research intoISIS,externalandthe far-right,externalsuggests it can be successful. When David Icke, a prolific spreader of Covid misinformation as well as anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, was removed from YouTube, research from the CCDH found his ability to reach people was considerably reduced. While his videos remained on alternative video-hosting platform BitChute, their views fell from 150,000 on average before the YouTube ban to 6,711 afterwards. On YouTube, 64 of his videos had been viewed 9.6 million times. Research from Cardiff University,external, found that the de-platforming ofKate Shemirani, a former nurse and prolific spreader of Covid misinformation, decreased her reach in the short term. This video can not be played  ""Part of the issue is that current models of de-platforming need to be developed. It's not enough to just take down a piece of content, or a small number of accounts,"" one of the paper's authors - Prof Martin Innes - explains. Research from organised crime and counter-terrorism shows the need to disrupt the whole network, he says. But he believes ""this level of sophistication isn't embedded yet"" in the way we tackle disinformation that could put people in danger.
