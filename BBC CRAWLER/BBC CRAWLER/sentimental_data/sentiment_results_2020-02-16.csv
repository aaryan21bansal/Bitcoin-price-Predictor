"Demonstrators take part in an anti-Tesla protest in Germany Tesla has been ordered to temporarily halt preparations for a car factory in Germany after environmentalists won a court injunction on Sunday. The electric carmaker had been clearing forest land near the capital, Berlin, ahead of building its first European car and battery plant. The court emphasised the injunction was temporary and subject to further hearings, probably this week. Protesters say the factory is a threat to local wildlife and water supplies. To much fanfare, Tesla's boss Elon Musk announced plans last November to build a European facility known as a ""gigafactory"" in GrÃ¼nheide, in the eastern state of Brandenburg. But the factory has become a flashpoint between environmentalists and Germany's pro-business Christian Democrat and Free Democrat parties, who fear the issue could damage the country's image as a place to do business. Is Tesla really worth $150bn? Tesla starts work on huge new China plant Musk expects 'robotaxis' to start in US next year The dispute highlights the risks for the US carmaker, which has not been officially granted permission to build the factory. Tesla was, however, granted permission by Germany's environment ministry to begin site preparations ""at its own risk"". This has involved clearing about 91 hectares (225 acres) of forest and the felling of thousands of trees - something that outraged an alliance of environmentalists called the Green League. In a statement on Sunday, the court representing the Berlin and Brandenburg region cautioned: ""It should not be assumed that the motion seeking legal protection brought by the Green League lacks any chance of succeeding."" Tesla bought almost 300 hectares (the size of more than 400 football pitches) in GrÃ¼nheide from the state of Brandenburg to build the factory, which is scheduled to open in 2021. Tesla has ambitions to produce up to 500,000 cars a year at the factory, employing about 12,000 people. But the company is in a race to get production up and running as Germany's big motor manufacturers are investing heavily in new electric car technology. According to local media reports, Tesla has promised to relocate colonies of forest ants, reptiles and bats, and is working with conservationists. Last month, authorities defused seven Second World War bombs discovered at the site. Tesla currently has two Gigafactories in the US and one in Shanghai, China. Is Tesla really worth $150bn?

"England are ranked number three in the world following this series Third Twenty20 international, Centurion South Africa 222-6 (20 overs):Klaasen 66, Bavuma 49; Curran 2-33 England 226-5 (19.1 overs):Bairstow 64, Morgan 57*, Buttler 57 England win by five wickets Scorecard England pulled off a stunning chase of 223 to beat South Africa in the third Twenty20 in Centurion and take a pulsating series 2-1. Captain Eoin Morgan hit a blistering 57 not out from 22 balls, leading England to their second-highest chase in T20s - and the fourth-highest of all-time - with five balls remaining. Morgan smashed seven sixes to take his side over the line after Jos Buttler (57) and Jonny Bairstow (64) also made half-centuries. Heinrich Klaasen propelled South Africa to their total with a 33-ball 66 after the hosts had made a rapid start, but England's big hitting always kept them in the chase. They stuttered, losing two wickets for seven runs shortly after halfway but, with 53 runs needed from the final four overs, Morgan, helped by Ben Stokes' 22, took control in sensational style. Stokes holed out on the first ball of the penultimate over but Morgan hit back-to-back sixes before Moeen Ali sealed the win with a boundary. The victory sees England take a gripping series which had produced final-ball finishes in the previous two games. England were later fined 20% of their match fee for maintaining a slow over-rate during the game - having been found to be one over short of their target. Hales recall not likely soon - Morgan TMS podcast: England storm to series win to cap off memorable tour Eoin Morgan equalled his own record for the fastest T20 half-century for England When England wobbled mid innings they were in danger of letting the platform set by Buttler and Bairstow go to waste. Unlike in the first game, when Morgan was one of those culpable in his side throwing away a winning position, he seized the game emphatically. The left-hander hit Dale Steyn over long-on for six off the final ball of the 16th over to keep the required rate in check and then plundered 14 runs from his next three balls, launching Lungi Ngidi into the stands twice more. He equalled his own record for England's fastest T20 50 with his seventh six, reaching the landmark from 21 balls. Morgan's stunning assault ensured England remarkably reached such a high total with balls to spare. Morgan's heroics would not have been possible but for the platform set by Bairstow and Buttler. Having lost Jason Roy for seven in the second over, the pair shared a partnership of 91 to keep England in the game. Buttler's role as opener has been questioned in this series but he found form after an uncertain start. Buttler and Bairstow took England to 62-1 at the end of the six-over powerplay and then increased their intent immediately, taking 19 runs from spinner Tabraiz Shamsi's first over. Buttler fell lobbing an attempted scoop to short third man off Pretorius for a 29-ball 57, but afterwards Bairstow took up the scoring, targeting Shamsi again with three consecutive boundaries. Bairstow was bowled by Andile Phehlukwayo with 83 runs still needed and Dawid Malan edged behind off Shamsi in the following over, but Morgan was able to guide his team to a memorable victory. Mark Wood conceded five fours and three sixes in three overs In total there were 28 sixes hit in the match and 448 runs scored - the bowlers not helped by a supreme batting pitch or the fact the game was being played at altitude, which helped the ball sail over the short boundaries. From the outset England failed to gain control with South Africa openers Quinton de Kock and Temba Bavuma scoring 52 runs from the first 22 balls. The usually dependable Chris Jordan was hit for three consecutive leg-side sixes in the fourth over which cost 19. Mark Wood was even more expensive, pummelled for 47 runs in three overs, including 23 from his second with three wides. Conditions did not help England but they harmed their own cause by bowling nine wides in the innings. With no spin on offer, Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid were unable to peg South Africa back as they had done in the previous matches with Tom Curran the only bowler to offer any kind of control. England will celebrate the win and take solace from the fact South Africa's bowlers fared no better, but there is improvement needed with just six games before the Twenty20 World Cup begins in October. There were 1207 runs across the series. More than any other three-match series in the history of T20 internationals. Only six other T20 internationals have had more runs scored than the 448 in this one in Centurion. And there was still five balls to go... The 15 sixes equals England's best in a T20, joining the 15 they plundered against New Zealand at Auckland in 2013. Eoin Morgan, who hit seven sixes, became first England player to score 100 T20I sixes -  he now has 105, the same as West Indies' Chris Gayle Jacob Wadsworth on Twitter:""Absolutely brilliant, embrace this period, we won't see anything like we've seen in the last four years again, so good."" Kevin Ticehurst on Twitter:""Get in there England, our bowling wasn't great today. But it just shows you how far we have come in five years under Morgan. That result will give other countries a look over their shoulder. Is there anything we can't chase down?"" Alex Williams on Twitter:""Can't think of a better T20 series than this one. Pure entertainment from start to finish."" England bowlers Saqib Mahmood, Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali celebrate victory England captain Eoin Morgan, speaking to the Test Match Special podcast:""It's brilliant. When a series is so tight, to come out on top says a lot about the side. ""Probably where it's a little bit disappointing from everyone, upon reflection, is how we started the series(losing in East London). ""We started pretty slow, we still managed to stay in the first game, the chase actually turned out pretty well and we should have won but we capitulated at the end. ""That is a big learning curve for us going forward - how we start a series and how we might start a World Cup."" England all-rounder Moeen Ali:""It was another amazing game. There have been three quality games, some amazing cricket, some top batting obviously and some great death bowling from some of the guys. ""It was a tough game today, because the wicket was amazing and the ball flies here but it was a great win.""

""I had my daughter crying upstairs. You don't know how high it's going to come, and when we could see the cars floating down the road... it just happened so quickly. ""We had a phone call at 4am - by 4.30 we were underwater."" Ian has already taken up his kitchen floor. ""I spoke to the insurers,"" he said. ""As long as we take plenty of photos we can take it up and start drying the rooms out - but the floor underneath doesn't look too good."" ""We've got another room we can't get into at the moment because the furniture's floated and I can't open the door so I'll have to take the door frame off. ""Devastated doesn't come close to it.

Labour leadership candidate Sir Keir Starmer says it's an ""appalling decision"" not to hold a meeting of the government's emergency committee, Cobra, to discuss the severe flooding.

"An ITV boss has said staff at the TV station are ""devastated"" by the ""tragic"" death of ex-Love Island presenter Caroline Flack. Director of television Kevin Lygo said that when Flack stepped down after being charged with assaulting her boyfriend, the door was left open for her to return as host on the ITV2 show. Tonight's episode will carry a tribute to her from Iain Stirling and the team. A lawyer for Flack's family said she had taken her own life. In a statement, Lygo, ITV's director of television, said Flack had been part of the dating show ""from the very beginning"" and her ""passion, dedication and boundless energy contributed to the show's success"". Caroline ""was very vocal"" in her support of the show, and viewers ""could relate to her and she to them"", he said. Lygo added that, after Flack stepped down, the channel ""made it clear that the door was left open for her to return"". He said the show's team remained in ""regular contact with her"" and ""continued to offer support over the last few months"". ""We will all miss her very much,"" he added. Who decides whether someone should go on trial? Looking back at Caroline Flack's career Love Island is to return tonight after two episodes over the weekend were cancelled after the 40-year-old was found dead in her north London home on Saturday. ITV confirmed companion show Love Island: Aftersun will not air on Monday while the Morning After podcast will not take place on Tuesday. In a joint statement, ITV and Just Eat, Love Island's advertising partner, said they have worked with Samaritans to replace the branding for tonight's episode ""so that anyone affected by Caroline's death can access support"". Laura Whitmore replaced her as host of the dating show after Flack was charged with assaulting her boyfriend, Lewis Burton, last December, and had been due to stand trial. Flack denied the charge. Her management company said she had been ""under huge pressure"" since the assault charge. Following her death, a petition was launched calling for new laws to prevent sections of the media ""knowingly and relentlessly bullying people, famous or not"".

Flack's friend Mollie Grosberg called Flack's death a ""massive and painful and heartbreaking loss"". She also shared on Instagram a picture of Flack taken on Friday night, the last time she saw her. On Sunday, Mr Burton wrotean emotional tribute to FlackonInstagram,external, promising he would ""try [to] make you proud everyday"". ""I am so lost for words I am in so much pain I miss you so much I know you felt safe with me you always said I don't think about anything else when I am with you and I was not allowed to be there this time I kept asking and asking,"" the 27-year-old tennis player wrote. Flack's management company has criticised the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for refusing to drop the charge against her, even though Mr Burton said he did not want the case to go ahead. Bail conditions had stopped Flack having any contact with Mr Burton ahead of her trial next month.

A statement said: ""We do not decide whether a person is guilty of a criminal offence - that is for the jury, judge or magistrate - but we must make the key decision of whether a case should be put before a court."" It said every decision over whether to charge someone is based on the same two-stage test - does the evidence provide a realistic prospect of conviction, and is it in the public interest to prosecute? That includes asking how serious the offence is, the harm caused to the victim and whether prosecution is a proportionate response. Former chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal said his impression was that the case had been determined to be a serious case, and one which the CPS felt it should proceed with ""regardless of what the victim thought"".

"The process takes 30 days and relatives can then scatter the remains on plants or under a tree A US firm has given scientific details of its ""human composting"" process for environmentally friendly funerals. A pilot study on deceased volunteers showed that soft tissue broke down safely and completely within 30 days. The firm, Recompose, claims that its process saves more than a tonne of carbon, compared to cremation or traditional burial. It says that it will offer the world's first human composting service in Washington state from next February. Speaking exclusively to BBC News, Recompose's chief executive and founder, Katrina Spade, said that concerns about climate change had been a big factor in so many people expressing interest in the service. ""So far 15,000 people have signed up to our newsletter. And the legislation to allow this in the state received bi-partisan support enabling it to pass the first time it was tabled,"" she said. ""The project has moved forward so quickly because of the urgency of climate change and the awareness we have to put it right."" Recompose boss Katrina Spade says her plan has proved so popular because of climate change Ms Spade spoke to me as results of the scientific study into the composting process, which Recompose calls natural organic reduction, was being presented at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Seattle. ""There is a loving practicability to it,"" she said, in one of the few interviews she has givensince announcing details of the project a year ago. She told me that she came up with the idea 13 years ago when she began to ponder her own mortality - at the ripe old age of 30! ""When I die, this planet, which has protected and supported me my whole life, shouldn't I give back what I have left? ""It is just logical and also beautiful."" How do you compost a human body - and why? The rise of alternative funerals Ms Spade draws a distinction between decomposing and recomposing. The former is what happens when a body is above ground. Recomposing involves integrating it with the soil. She claims that natural organic reduction of a body prevents 1.4 tonnes of carbon being released into the atmosphere, compared with cremation. And she believes there is a similar saving compared to traditional burial when transportation and the construction of the casket is taken into account. ""For a lot of folks it resonates with the way they try to lead their lives. They want to pick a death care plan that resonates with the way they live."" The process involves laying the body in a closed vessel with woodchips, alfalfa and straw grass. The body is slowly rotated to allow microbes to break it down.

"Helicopters moved snow from higher mountains to slopes at the Luchon-SuperbagnÃ¨res resort A French ski resort has used helicopters to deliver snow after mild weather dried out its slopes, threatening it with closure. The Luchon-SuperbagnÃ¨res resort in the Pyrenees arranged for around 50 tonnes of snow to be dropped on its slopes. Taken from higher mountains, the snow was dumped on slopes for beginners and children on Friday and Saturday. Temperatures have risen above 10C across the Pyrenees this week, leaving ski slopes devoid of snow. Milder weather and a lack of snow during winter are trends that meteorologists have linked to climate change. In order to keep Luchon-SuperbagnÃ¨res open, the local council arranged for snow to be sent at a cost of more than 5,000 euros (Â£4,150). Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. HervÃ© Pounau, director of the local council, said it was a worthwhile investment. ""We're not going to cover the entire ski station in snow, but without it we would have had to close a huge part of the ski domain, and it's during the holidays that we have the most activity for beginners and the ski schools,"" Mr Pounau said. The school holidays in February and March are typically the busiest time of year for ski resorts in France. Mild weather and a lack of snow have left ski slopes bare in the French Pyrenees The jobs of up to 80 people, including lift operators, ski school teachers and child minders, will be protected by keeping the resort open, Mr Pounau said. However, the delivery of snow has been criticised by environmental groups. Moscow brings in artificial snow for New Year in mild winter Climate change is 'shrinking winter' Where in the world is snow getting rarer? ""Instead of adapting to global warming we're going to end up with a double problem: something that costs a lot of energy, that contributes heavily to global warming and that in addition is only for an elite group of people who can afford it. It is the world upside down,"" Bastien Ho, of green group Europe Ãcologie Les Verts (EELV), told French television. Helicopters were hired to move around 50 tonnes of snow to the slopes Mr Pounau conceded that moving the snow was not a ""particularly ecological"" solution but said ""we had no choice"". Many other ski resorts in the Pyrenees mountains are facing an uncertain future, as low snowfall levels result in fewer visitors. This month, the ski resort of Le Mourtis was forced to temporarily close down its ski runs in mid-season, impacting the local economy. Unseasonably mild temperatures have melted snow at lower altitude ski resorts. France experienced its mildest January since 1900, according to Meteo-France, the country's national forecaster.

"England are ranked number three in the world following this series Third Twenty20 international, Centurion South Africa 222-6 (20 overs):Klaasen 66, Bavuma 49; Curran 2-33 England 226-5 (19.1 overs):Bairstow 64, Morgan 57*, Buttler 57 England win by five wickets Scorecard England pulled off a stunning chase of 223 to beat South Africa in the third Twenty20 in Centurion and take a pulsating series 2-1. Captain Eoin Morgan hit a blistering 57 not out from 22 balls, leading England to their second-highest chase in T20s - and the fourth-highest of all-time - with five balls remaining. Morgan smashed seven sixes to take his side over the line after Jos Buttler (57) and Jonny Bairstow (64) also made half-centuries. Heinrich Klaasen propelled South Africa to their total with a 33-ball 66 after the hosts had made a rapid start, but England's big hitting always kept them in the chase. They stuttered, losing two wickets for seven runs shortly after halfway but, with 53 runs needed from the final four overs, Morgan, helped by Ben Stokes' 22, took control in sensational style. Stokes holed out on the first ball of the penultimate over but Morgan hit back-to-back sixes before Moeen Ali sealed the win with a boundary. The victory sees England take a gripping series which had produced final-ball finishes in the previous two games. England were later fined 20% of their match fee for maintaining a slow over-rate during the game - having been found to be one over short of their target. Hales recall not likely soon - Morgan TMS podcast: England storm to series win to cap off memorable tour Eoin Morgan equalled his own record for the fastest T20 half-century for England When England wobbled mid innings they were in danger of letting the platform set by Buttler and Bairstow go to waste. Unlike in the first game, when Morgan was one of those culpable in his side throwing away a winning position, he seized the game emphatically. The left-hander hit Dale Steyn over long-on for six off the final ball of the 16th over to keep the required rate in check and then plundered 14 runs from his next three balls, launching Lungi Ngidi into the stands twice more. He equalled his own record for England's fastest T20 50 with his seventh six, reaching the landmark from 21 balls. Morgan's stunning assault ensured England remarkably reached such a high total with balls to spare. Morgan's heroics would not have been possible but for the platform set by Bairstow and Buttler. Having lost Jason Roy for seven in the second over, the pair shared a partnership of 91 to keep England in the game. Buttler's role as opener has been questioned in this series but he found form after an uncertain start. Buttler and Bairstow took England to 62-1 at the end of the six-over powerplay and then increased their intent immediately, taking 19 runs from spinner Tabraiz Shamsi's first over. Buttler fell lobbing an attempted scoop to short third man off Pretorius for a 29-ball 57, but afterwards Bairstow took up the scoring, targeting Shamsi again with three consecutive boundaries. Bairstow was bowled by Andile Phehlukwayo with 83 runs still needed and Dawid Malan edged behind off Shamsi in the following over, but Morgan was able to guide his team to a memorable victory. Mark Wood conceded five fours and three sixes in three overs In total there were 28 sixes hit in the match and 448 runs scored - the bowlers not helped by a supreme batting pitch or the fact the game was being played at altitude, which helped the ball sail over the short boundaries. From the outset England failed to gain control with South Africa openers Quinton de Kock and Temba Bavuma scoring 52 runs from the first 22 balls. The usually dependable Chris Jordan was hit for three consecutive leg-side sixes in the fourth over which cost 19. Mark Wood was even more expensive, pummelled for 47 runs in three overs, including 23 from his second with three wides. Conditions did not help England but they harmed their own cause by bowling nine wides in the innings. With no spin on offer, Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid were unable to peg South Africa back as they had done in the previous matches with Tom Curran the only bowler to offer any kind of control. England will celebrate the win and take solace from the fact South Africa's bowlers fared no better, but there is improvement needed with just six games before the Twenty20 World Cup begins in October. There were 1207 runs across the series. More than any other three-match series in the history of T20 internationals. Only six other T20 internationals have had more runs scored than the 448 in this one in Centurion. And there was still five balls to go... The 15 sixes equals England's best in a T20, joining the 15 they plundered against New Zealand at Auckland in 2013. Eoin Morgan, who hit seven sixes, became first England player to score 100 T20I sixes -  he now has 105, the same as West Indies' Chris Gayle Jacob Wadsworth on Twitter:""Absolutely brilliant, embrace this period, we won't see anything like we've seen in the last four years again, so good."" Kevin Ticehurst on Twitter:""Get in there England, our bowling wasn't great today. But it just shows you how far we have come in five years under Morgan. That result will give other countries a look over their shoulder. Is there anything we can't chase down?"" Alex Williams on Twitter:""Can't think of a better T20 series than this one. Pure entertainment from start to finish."" England bowlers Saqib Mahmood, Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali celebrate victory England captain Eoin Morgan, speaking to the Test Match Special podcast:""It's brilliant. When a series is so tight, to come out on top says a lot about the side. ""Probably where it's a little bit disappointing from everyone, upon reflection, is how we started the series(losing in East London). ""We started pretty slow, we still managed to stay in the first game, the chase actually turned out pretty well and we should have won but we capitulated at the end. ""That is a big learning curve for us going forward - how we start a series and how we might start a World Cup."" England all-rounder Moeen Ali:""It was another amazing game. There have been three quality games, some amazing cricket, some top batting obviously and some great death bowling from some of the guys. ""It was a tough game today, because the wicket was amazing and the ball flies here but it was a great win.""

Tonight's episode will carry a tribute to her from Iain Stirling and the team. A lawyer for Flack's family said she had taken her own life.

"This video can not be played Grant Shapps: ""I don't think we've said it will definitely go ahead on the same date that was mentioned before"" The government's budget may be delayed, a cabinet minister has said. It had been set for 11 March, but the timetable was thrown into doubt afterthe surprise resignation of former Chancellor Sajid Javid on Thursday. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the date would be a matter for Mr Javid's replacement, Rishi Sunak. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme: ""The guy's only been in place for a few days, let's give him a few days to decide on the date."" Mr Shapps said the government had not confirmed the budget would ""definitely go ahead on the same date as mentioned before"", but added: ""Clearly, we'll need to have a budget."" The acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, accused the government of being ""chaotic"". He added: ""Any delay in the budget will send out alarm bells that a major change of economic policy is now being planned without any democratic legitimacy from the Tory manifesto just weeks ago."" Sajid Javid quits as chancellor Who is the new chancellor Rishi Sunak? Who is in Boris Johnson's new cabinet? Earlier, Mr Shapps told Sky's Sophy Ridge programme that plans were ""well advanced"", but Mr Sunak ""may want time"" and would be looking at the plans this week. The budget is the government's annual announcement on its plans for tax and spending for the coming financial year. Mr Javid had been due to present his plans to Parliament in November, but cancelled it to make way for a general election. He confirmed the new date in January, promising an ""infrastructure revolution"", with billions of pounds invested ""across the country"". But the chancellor stood down from his role during the government's reshuffle - just four weeks before the budget was due - rejecting the prime minister's order to fire his team of aides. Mr Javid said his advisers had worked ""incredibly hard"" and he could not agree to them being replaced. ""I felt I was left with no option but to resign,"" he said, adding that Mr Sunak and the rest of the government retained his ""full support"". This video can not be played Sajid Javid: I had no option but to resign Mr Javid's resignation followed rumours of tensions between him and the prime minister's senior adviser Dominic Cummings. After he stepped down, No 10 announced there would now be a joint team of economic advisers for both the new chancellor and prime minister. A former adviser to Mr Javid said Downing Street had misjudged the reshuffle and the budget could be delayed as a result. Salma Shah told BBC Newscast she thought No 10 believed Mr Javid would take up an offer to remain in his post, despite being told to fire his aides. This video can not be played A former advisor to Mr Javid says Downing Street misjudged the reshuffle. Further delays could stop the Office for Budget Responsibility - which monitors the government's performance on money management -  from complying with its legal requirement of publishing two forecasts in the financial year.

"England are ranked number three in the world following this series Third Twenty20 international, Centurion South Africa 222-6 (20 overs):Klaasen 66, Bavuma 49; Curran 2-33 England 226-5 (19.1 overs):Bairstow 64, Morgan 57*, Buttler 57 England win by five wickets Scorecard England pulled off a stunning chase of 223 to beat South Africa in the third Twenty20 in Centurion and take a pulsating series 2-1. Captain Eoin Morgan hit a blistering 57 not out from 22 balls, leading England to their second-highest chase in T20s - and the fourth-highest of all-time - with five balls remaining. Morgan smashed seven sixes to take his side over the line after Jos Buttler (57) and Jonny Bairstow (64) also made half-centuries. Heinrich Klaasen propelled South Africa to their total with a 33-ball 66 after the hosts had made a rapid start, but England's big hitting always kept them in the chase. They stuttered, losing two wickets for seven runs shortly after halfway but, with 53 runs needed from the final four overs, Morgan, helped by Ben Stokes' 22, took control in sensational style. Stokes holed out on the first ball of the penultimate over but Morgan hit back-to-back sixes before Moeen Ali sealed the win with a boundary. The victory sees England take a gripping series which had produced final-ball finishes in the previous two games. England were later fined 20% of their match fee for maintaining a slow over-rate during the game - having been found to be one over short of their target. Hales recall not likely soon - Morgan TMS podcast: England storm to series win to cap off memorable tour Eoin Morgan equalled his own record for the fastest T20 half-century for England When England wobbled mid innings they were in danger of letting the platform set by Buttler and Bairstow go to waste. Unlike in the first game, when Morgan was one of those culpable in his side throwing away a winning position, he seized the game emphatically. The left-hander hit Dale Steyn over long-on for six off the final ball of the 16th over to keep the required rate in check and then plundered 14 runs from his next three balls, launching Lungi Ngidi into the stands twice more. He equalled his own record for England's fastest T20 50 with his seventh six, reaching the landmark from 21 balls. Morgan's stunning assault ensured England remarkably reached such a high total with balls to spare. Morgan's heroics would not have been possible but for the platform set by Bairstow and Buttler. Having lost Jason Roy for seven in the second over, the pair shared a partnership of 91 to keep England in the game. Buttler's role as opener has been questioned in this series but he found form after an uncertain start. Buttler and Bairstow took England to 62-1 at the end of the six-over powerplay and then increased their intent immediately, taking 19 runs from spinner Tabraiz Shamsi's first over. Buttler fell lobbing an attempted scoop to short third man off Pretorius for a 29-ball 57, but afterwards Bairstow took up the scoring, targeting Shamsi again with three consecutive boundaries. Bairstow was bowled by Andile Phehlukwayo with 83 runs still needed and Dawid Malan edged behind off Shamsi in the following over, but Morgan was able to guide his team to a memorable victory. Mark Wood conceded five fours and three sixes in three overs In total there were 28 sixes hit in the match and 448 runs scored - the bowlers not helped by a supreme batting pitch or the fact the game was being played at altitude, which helped the ball sail over the short boundaries. From the outset England failed to gain control with South Africa openers Quinton de Kock and Temba Bavuma scoring 52 runs from the first 22 balls. The usually dependable Chris Jordan was hit for three consecutive leg-side sixes in the fourth over which cost 19. Mark Wood was even more expensive, pummelled for 47 runs in three overs, including 23 from his second with three wides. Conditions did not help England but they harmed their own cause by bowling nine wides in the innings. With no spin on offer, Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid were unable to peg South Africa back as they had done in the previous matches with Tom Curran the only bowler to offer any kind of control. England will celebrate the win and take solace from the fact South Africa's bowlers fared no better, but there is improvement needed with just six games before the Twenty20 World Cup begins in October. There were 1207 runs across the series. More than any other three-match series in the history of T20 internationals. Only six other T20 internationals have had more runs scored than the 448 in this one in Centurion. And there was still five balls to go... The 15 sixes equals England's best in a T20, joining the 15 they plundered against New Zealand at Auckland in 2013. Eoin Morgan, who hit seven sixes, became first England player to score 100 T20I sixes -  he now has 105, the same as West Indies' Chris Gayle Jacob Wadsworth on Twitter:""Absolutely brilliant, embrace this period, we won't see anything like we've seen in the last four years again, so good."" Kevin Ticehurst on Twitter:""Get in there England, our bowling wasn't great today. But it just shows you how far we have come in five years under Morgan.

"Bernie Sanders is firmly the front-runner in the race to become the Democratic challenger to Republican President Donald Trump, fresh from a victory this week in the second state-by-state contest. His support is fervent but is his party, let alone the country, ready to embrace such an unusual candidate? Bernie Sanders likes to call his presidential campaign a revolution, but these days it feels more like a touring rock concert. The Vermont senator may seem like an unlikely front-man for bands like Vampire Weekend and The Strokes, but both have served as his warm-up acts, playing at recent campaign rallies. But the thousands of fans in packed arenas reserve their loudest cheers for the scruffy-haired 78-year-old candidate with a clipped Brooklyn accent. After nearly a year-long marathon of rallies, meetings, debates and ground-laying, the Sanders campaign is now entering a sprint of near-nonstop activity that will carry it through dozens of states across the country - an impressive test of endurance for a man who just months ago was hospitalised for a heart attack. ""Bernie Sanders is the only candidate that has given me the courage to believe that we cannot only demand bold, radical change, but that it's actually very attainable,"" said Aletha Shapiro, who travelled to New Hampshire from Long Island, New York, to help the Sanders campaign. ""If the people stick together, we can actually put power back in the hands of the people."" The end result of all this effort was a split decision in Iowa, as former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg claimed the most delegates to the Democratic National Convention even though Sanders won a few thousand more votes. In New Hampshire, Sanders finished narrowly ahead of Buttigieg again, with the two tied in the state's delegate count. That didn't stop Sanders from claiming victory both in Iowa and New Hampshire on Tuesday night, however, and looking ahead to a showdown with Trump in November. A simple guide to US primaries and caucuses How Bernie Sanders always beats the odds ""The reason we won tonight in New Hampshire, we won last week in Iowa, is because of the hard work of so many volunteers,"" he said. ""Let me say tonight that this victory here is the beginning of the end for Donald Trump."" The crowd, packed into a college gymnasium, responded with deafening applause, as though the volume of their cheers could will their beloved candidate to more victories in the days ahead. ""It was electric,"" said Scott Sandvik, a music teacher from Boston. ""I really think it was a release of tension after a nail-biter of an election."" If the Sanders ""revolution"" does take hold - an outsider campaign pitted as much against the Democratic Party's establishment as it is the incumbent president - New Hampshire could very well be seen as where it all began. But the campaign still has a long road ahead. Four years ago, Sanders also followed a tight result in Iowa with a victory in New Hampshire. That contest was actually more decisive - a 20-point win over Hillary Clinton, who was considered the prohibitive favourite entering the race. Sanders' 2016 New Hampshire triumph, however, was a springboard into an empty pool. He followed his win in the overwhelmingly white New England state with a narrow loss in Nevada and a drubbing in South Carolina, where the Democratic voting population is majority black. Although there were a few bright spots after that - victories in Michigan and Wisconsin - Clinton spent the next few months pulling away from Sanders in the nomination race. Now Sanders is back, hoping history doesn't repeat itself. Facing a more crowded field, he appears to be in a much better position, as the nomination fight becomes a state-by-state slog on a battleground that stretches the breadth of the nation. There is no Clinton machine waiting to do battle against the Sanders insurgency this time around. Instead, the Vermont senator heads out of New Hampshire along with a ragtag mix of candidates all scrambling for a foothold. Joe Biden, the apparent front-runner through much of 2019, is grievously wounded by poor showings in the first two contests. Elizabeth Warren, the other candidate appealing to the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, has finished behind Sanders twice now and shows no signs gaining any ground. Meanwhile, the continued presence of Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar among the moderates of the party ensures middle-of-the road and establishment Democrats will remain divided. Buttigieg has money, but a thin resume and doubts about his appeal to the more diverse rank-and-file of the Democratic Party. Klobuchar is counting on media coverage of her late surge in New Hampshire to make up for depleted campaign coffers and a virtually non-existent national organisation. Sanders had his first political victory in Burlington, Vermont, where he toppled the reigning six-term Democrat in 1981 for the mayoral seat by a margin of just 10 votes Despite efforts by establishment Democrats to thwart his early career, Sanders served four terms as mayor before being elected to the US House of Representatives in 1990 - the first independent politician in four decades to do so He won his current senate seat in 2007 and is currently in his third term Sanders has an older brother, Larry, who lives in the UK and is currently the health and social care spokesman for the Green Party The Sanders brothers: A tale of two underdogs How Bernie Sanders always beat the odds Meanwhile, Sanders has risen in national polls as Biden has faltered. He boasts a veteran campaign structure that has basically been up and running since 2015, and a donor and volunteer network that spans the nation. His $25m (Â£19m) fundraising haul in January alone will ensure he has more than enough resources to compete in every state on the crowded March primary calendar. He has been officially or unofficially supported by figures from UK Labour MP Diane Abbott to YouTube star Joe Rogan. On Friday, he picked up another endorsement, from New York mayor and erstwhile 2020 candidate Bill de Blasio. If Bernie Sanders isn't the Democratic front-runner at this point, the word has little meaning. He's far from a lock for the nomination, but his path ahead appears to be the clearest of any of his competitors. On Tuesday night, Sanders essentially said as much. ""The reason I believe we are going to win is because we have an unprecedented grass-roots movement from coast to coast of millions of people,"" he said. ""The reason that we are going to win is that we are putting together an unprecedented multi-generational, multi-racial movement."" History is certainly on Sanders' side. Putting the Iowa popular-vote result in his column means the Vermont senator joins Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004, both eventual nominees, as the only non-incumbents to win there and New Hampshire. In fact, no candidate has finished outside the top two in New Hampshire and gone on to the nomination. ""I think the people of the United States will unite around his message supporting the true hard working people of this country,"" said Tomas Amadeo of Hooksett, New Hampshire, echoing the optimism of many at the New Hampshire Sanders rally. ""He can resonate with people of all ages."" The current disposition of the Sanders campaign has his supporters hoping for the best, however, a big chunk of the Democratic establishment and moderates in the party are fearing the worst. Last Friday, in the spin room before the Democratic candidate debate in Manchester, senior Sanders campaign adviser Jeff Weaver was clear-eyed about what's in store for his candidate, as a Democratic establishment that views Sanders as a meddlesome and disruptive outsider prepares to fight back. ""There's always a target on his back,"" he said of Sanders. ""They won't stop until they're beaten. Well, we're ready for it."" In Iowa, Sanders was the subject of negative television advertisements from both the left and the right. The conservative Club for Growth aired a spot that painted the Vermont senator as an extremist - and said that his health was suspect after his heart attack last autumn. A pro-Israel Democratic group ran an advert featuring Iowa voters saying Sanders couldn't beat Trump. ""It is no secret that our campaign is taking on the political establishment and the big-money interests who are now running negative ads against us in Iowa,"" Sanders said in response. ""The billionaire class is getting nervous, and they should."" There's reason to believe Sanders' political-jujitsu strategy could be effective. In 2016, as the Republican establishment finally acknowledged the threat that Donald Trump's candidacy posed, its scions - including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney - began to speak out. Their attacks only made Trump stronger, however, as he painted them as the ""swamp's"" last-gasp efforts to stop him. ""The establishment has never taken Sanders seriously, and now that they're having to they're going to attack him,"" said Caleb Gates, a Sanders supporter from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, who joined Sanders at a volunteer organisation event the day before the Iowa Caucuses. ""But I think that will only increase his appeal to a lot of people, especially those who are not politically active."" In New Hampshire, Biden and Buttigieg hit at Sanders directly, both warning he was too extreme to be the party's nominee and that his ideological views were too rigid. Buttigieg accused Sanders of ""dividing people with the politics that says, 'If you don't go all the way to the edge, it doesn't count', a politics that says, 'It's my way or the highway'."" ""Medicare for All"" single-payer health system Eliminate medical and student loan debt Free public colleges, universities, trade schools Green New Deal Wealth tax Time and again, it's the ""electability"" criticism that is used as a cudgel against Sanders, a self-described Democratic Socialist. One recent poll indicated that more than half of Americans would not vote for a ""socialist"" president. Trump, at his rallies, regularly promises to his cheering support that ""American will never be a socialist nation"". The ""conventional"" view of a Sanders candidacy can be summed up in in a tweet by Sean Trende, an elections analyst with the website RealClear Politics. ""Bernie Sanders is a complete wildcard,"" he wrote. ""He could win by 10 points or lose by 20."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A blunter take by a Sanders critic was offered by New York Magazine's Jonathan Chait in a column that particularly irked the Sanders faithful. ""No party nomination, with the possible exception of Barry Goldwater in 1964, has put forth a presidential nominee with the level of downside risk exposure as a Sanders-led ticket would bring,"" he wrote. ""To nominate Sanders would be insane."" When the stakes are so high - defeating Trump has been a central focus of Democrats since the day he was elected in 2016 - why, they ask, would the party choose a candidate so far away from the comfortable middle of American politics? Moderate members of Congress, in particular, have expressed apprehension about sharing a ticket with the independent-minded Vermont senator who only joined the Democratic Party to run for president. Dean Phillips, a newly elected congressman from Minnesota who has endorsed Klobuchar, told CNN that Sanders could have a ""disastrous"" effect on congressional races in November, jeopardising the majority Democrats won in the 435-seat chamber in 2018.. ""There are probably 25 to 30 seats that absolutely would be impacted directly by having a self-avowed socialist at the top of the ticket,"" he said. ""He's not a Democrat, you know, and that's something that I wish was better understood."" The Sanders campaign clearly realises that winning the ""electability"" debate is essential to securing the party's 2020 nomination. It's why they hand out ""Sanders beats Trump"" stickers at their campaign events and chanted the refrain at his New Hampshire victory celebration. They're quick to cite head-to-head polling that shows little significant difference between a Sanders-Trump matchup and one between Trump and Biden, the candidate frequently offered as the safe and electable option. A recentNBC/Wall Street Journal poll,externalhad Biden on top 50-44, while Sanders led Trump 49-45 - a statistically insignificant difference. They also argue that the entire debate about electability is framed incorrectly. American politics, they say, isn't a battle for the middle, it's a battle of ideas and a battle for authenticity. ""What we did last time was nominate someone who was down the middle and another Washington person who wasn't going to change anything,"" said Pat Miguel Tomaino of Boston. ""There are people hurting in this country who bought a lot of fake change from Donald Trump, and now we're all suffering for it.""

""We have no illusion about elites coming to save us or tinkering around a little bit for a better technocratic way of ordering an elitist system where just 1% benefit,"" he said. ""We know that Bernie Sanders doesn't want any of that. We know he has our back, and we have his."" To pull this off, however, the Sanders campaign has to successfully identify and turn out voters who have sat out past elections. They're counting on the younger voters who polls show overwhelmingly back Sanders for the nomination, as well other disaffected Americans who have been marginalised by the system. In Iowa, at least, the results were not encouraging. Although young voters made up a larger share of caucus participants, the total numbers were down from 2008, when Barack Obama's first campaign was electrifying many Democrats. New Hampshire's numbers were better, but early indications are the higher turnout was in part due to moderate and independent voters showing up to support Klobuchar and Buttigieg. ""I've always believed strongly that our case for winning this nomination and also beating Trump is that we can expand the base,"" said Faiz Shakir, the Sanders campaign manager. ""We have the most ambitious and difficult path to winning this nomination because it requires, by its nature, that people will be brought into this process."" He added that he thought the campaign had laid the groundwork for increased turnout in the states ahead, but there is reason the whole party should be concerned. ""We've got much more work to do,"" he said.

The union then released a statement saying that Sanders supporters, upon learning of the union's criticism, had ""viciously"" attacked the organisation. Already Sanders' Democratic opponents, sensing a vulnerability in Nevada, are positioning themselves as defenders of union healthcare plans.

"This video can not be played Grant Shapps: ""I don't think we've said it will definitely go ahead on the same date that was mentioned before"" The government's budget may be delayed, a cabinet minister has said. It had been set for 11 March, but the timetable was thrown into doubt afterthe surprise resignation of former Chancellor Sajid Javid on Thursday. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the date would be a matter for Mr Javid's replacement, Rishi Sunak. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme: ""The guy's only been in place for a few days, let's give him a few days to decide on the date."" Mr Shapps said the government had not confirmed the budget would ""definitely go ahead on the same date as mentioned before"", but added: ""Clearly, we'll need to have a budget."" The acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, accused the government of being ""chaotic"". He added: ""Any delay in the budget will send out alarm bells that a major change of economic policy is now being planned without any democratic legitimacy from the Tory manifesto just weeks ago."" Sajid Javid quits as chancellor Who is the new chancellor Rishi Sunak? Who is in Boris Johnson's new cabinet? Earlier, Mr Shapps told Sky's Sophy Ridge programme that plans were ""well advanced"", but Mr Sunak ""may want time"" and would be looking at the plans this week. The budget is the government's annual announcement on its plans for tax and spending for the coming financial year. Mr Javid had been due to present his plans to Parliament in November, but cancelled it to make way for a general election. He confirmed the new date in January, promising an ""infrastructure revolution"", with billions of pounds invested ""across the country"". But the chancellor stood down from his role during the government's reshuffle - just four weeks before the budget was due - rejecting the prime minister's order to fire his team of aides. Mr Javid said his advisers had worked ""incredibly hard"" and he could not agree to them being replaced. ""I felt I was left with no option but to resign,"" he said, adding that Mr Sunak and the rest of the government retained his ""full support"". This video can not be played Sajid Javid: I had no option but to resign Mr Javid's resignation followed rumours of tensions between him and the prime minister's senior adviser Dominic Cummings. After he stepped down, No 10 announced there would now be a joint team of economic advisers for both the new chancellor and prime minister. A former adviser to Mr Javid said Downing Street had misjudged the reshuffle and the budget could be delayed as a result. Salma Shah told BBC Newscast she thought No 10 believed Mr Javid would take up an offer to remain in his post, despite being told to fire his aides.

"Bernie Sanders is firmly the front-runner in the race to become the Democratic challenger to Republican President Donald Trump, fresh from a victory this week in the second state-by-state contest. His support is fervent but is his party, let alone the country, ready to embrace such an unusual candidate? Bernie Sanders likes to call his presidential campaign a revolution, but these days it feels more like a touring rock concert. The Vermont senator may seem like an unlikely front-man for bands like Vampire Weekend and The Strokes, but both have served as his warm-up acts, playing at recent campaign rallies. But the thousands of fans in packed arenas reserve their loudest cheers for the scruffy-haired 78-year-old candidate with a clipped Brooklyn accent. After nearly a year-long marathon of rallies, meetings, debates and ground-laying, the Sanders campaign is now entering a sprint of near-nonstop activity that will carry it through dozens of states across the country - an impressive test of endurance for a man who just months ago was hospitalised for a heart attack. ""Bernie Sanders is the only candidate that has given me the courage to believe that we cannot only demand bold, radical change, but that it's actually very attainable,"" said Aletha Shapiro, who travelled to New Hampshire from Long Island, New York, to help the Sanders campaign. ""If the people stick together, we can actually put power back in the hands of the people."" The end result of all this effort was a split decision in Iowa, as former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg claimed the most delegates to the Democratic National Convention even though Sanders won a few thousand more votes. In New Hampshire, Sanders finished narrowly ahead of Buttigieg again, with the two tied in the state's delegate count. That didn't stop Sanders from claiming victory both in Iowa and New Hampshire on Tuesday night, however, and looking ahead to a showdown with Trump in November. A simple guide to US primaries and caucuses How Bernie Sanders always beats the odds ""The reason we won tonight in New Hampshire, we won last week in Iowa, is because of the hard work of so many volunteers,"" he said. ""Let me say tonight that this victory here is the beginning of the end for Donald Trump."" The crowd, packed into a college gymnasium, responded with deafening applause, as though the volume of their cheers could will their beloved candidate to more victories in the days ahead. ""It was electric,"" said Scott Sandvik, a music teacher from Boston. ""I really think it was a release of tension after a nail-biter of an election."" If the Sanders ""revolution"" does take hold - an outsider campaign pitted as much against the Democratic Party's establishment as it is the incumbent president - New Hampshire could very well be seen as where it all began. But the campaign still has a long road ahead. Four years ago, Sanders also followed a tight result in Iowa with a victory in New Hampshire. That contest was actually more decisive - a 20-point win over Hillary Clinton, who was considered the prohibitive favourite entering the race. Sanders' 2016 New Hampshire triumph, however, was a springboard into an empty pool. He followed his win in the overwhelmingly white New England state with a narrow loss in Nevada and a drubbing in South Carolina, where the Democratic voting population is majority black. Although there were a few bright spots after that - victories in Michigan and Wisconsin - Clinton spent the next few months pulling away from Sanders in the nomination race. Now Sanders is back, hoping history doesn't repeat itself. Facing a more crowded field, he appears to be in a much better position, as the nomination fight becomes a state-by-state slog on a battleground that stretches the breadth of the nation. There is no Clinton machine waiting to do battle against the Sanders insurgency this time around. Instead, the Vermont senator heads out of New Hampshire along with a ragtag mix of candidates all scrambling for a foothold. Joe Biden, the apparent front-runner through much of 2019, is grievously wounded by poor showings in the first two contests. Elizabeth Warren, the other candidate appealing to the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, has finished behind Sanders twice now and shows no signs gaining any ground. Meanwhile, the continued presence of Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar among the moderates of the party ensures middle-of-the road and establishment Democrats will remain divided. Buttigieg has money, but a thin resume and doubts about his appeal to the more diverse rank-and-file of the Democratic Party. Klobuchar is counting on media coverage of her late surge in New Hampshire to make up for depleted campaign coffers and a virtually non-existent national organisation. Sanders had his first political victory in Burlington, Vermont, where he toppled the reigning six-term Democrat in 1981 for the mayoral seat by a margin of just 10 votes Despite efforts by establishment Democrats to thwart his early career, Sanders served four terms as mayor before being elected to the US House of Representatives in 1990 - the first independent politician in four decades to do so He won his current senate seat in 2007 and is currently in his third term Sanders has an older brother, Larry, who lives in the UK and is currently the health and social care spokesman for the Green Party The Sanders brothers: A tale of two underdogs How Bernie Sanders always beat the odds Meanwhile, Sanders has risen in national polls as Biden has faltered. He boasts a veteran campaign structure that has basically been up and running since 2015, and a donor and volunteer network that spans the nation. His $25m (Â£19m) fundraising haul in January alone will ensure he has more than enough resources to compete in every state on the crowded March primary calendar. He has been officially or unofficially supported by figures from UK Labour MP Diane Abbott to YouTube star Joe Rogan. On Friday, he picked up another endorsement, from New York mayor and erstwhile 2020 candidate Bill de Blasio. If Bernie Sanders isn't the Democratic front-runner at this point, the word has little meaning. He's far from a lock for the nomination, but his path ahead appears to be the clearest of any of his competitors. On Tuesday night, Sanders essentially said as much. ""The reason I believe we are going to win is because we have an unprecedented grass-roots movement from coast to coast of millions of people,"" he said. ""The reason that we are going to win is that we are putting together an unprecedented multi-generational, multi-racial movement."" History is certainly on Sanders' side. Putting the Iowa popular-vote result in his column means the Vermont senator joins Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004, both eventual nominees, as the only non-incumbents to win there and New Hampshire. In fact, no candidate has finished outside the top two in New Hampshire and gone on to the nomination. ""I think the people of the United States will unite around his message supporting the true hard working people of this country,"" said Tomas Amadeo of Hooksett, New Hampshire, echoing the optimism of many at the New Hampshire Sanders rally. ""He can resonate with people of all ages."" The current disposition of the Sanders campaign has his supporters hoping for the best, however, a big chunk of the Democratic establishment and moderates in the party are fearing the worst. Last Friday, in the spin room before the Democratic candidate debate in Manchester, senior Sanders campaign adviser Jeff Weaver was clear-eyed about what's in store for his candidate, as a Democratic establishment that views Sanders as a meddlesome and disruptive outsider prepares to fight back. ""There's always a target on his back,"" he said of Sanders. ""They won't stop until they're beaten. Well, we're ready for it."" In Iowa, Sanders was the subject of negative television advertisements from both the left and the right. The conservative Club for Growth aired a spot that painted the Vermont senator as an extremist - and said that his health was suspect after his heart attack last autumn. A pro-Israel Democratic group ran an advert featuring Iowa voters saying Sanders couldn't beat Trump. ""It is no secret that our campaign is taking on the political establishment and the big-money interests who are now running negative ads against us in Iowa,"" Sanders said in response. ""The billionaire class is getting nervous, and they should."" There's reason to believe Sanders' political-jujitsu strategy could be effective. In 2016, as the Republican establishment finally acknowledged the threat that Donald Trump's candidacy posed, its scions - including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney - began to speak out. Their attacks only made Trump stronger, however, as he painted them as the ""swamp's"" last-gasp efforts to stop him. ""The establishment has never taken Sanders seriously, and now that they're having to they're going to attack him,"" said Caleb Gates, a Sanders supporter from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, who joined Sanders at a volunteer organisation event the day before the Iowa Caucuses. ""But I think that will only increase his appeal to a lot of people, especially those who are not politically active."" In New Hampshire, Biden and Buttigieg hit at Sanders directly, both warning he was too extreme to be the party's nominee and that his ideological views were too rigid. Buttigieg accused Sanders of ""dividing people with the politics that says, 'If you don't go all the way to the edge, it doesn't count', a politics that says, 'It's my way or the highway'."" ""Medicare for All"" single-payer health system Eliminate medical and student loan debt Free public colleges, universities, trade schools Green New Deal Wealth tax Time and again, it's the ""electability"" criticism that is used as a cudgel against Sanders, a self-described Democratic Socialist. One recent poll indicated that more than half of Americans would not vote for a ""socialist"" president. Trump, at his rallies, regularly promises to his cheering support that ""American will never be a socialist nation"". The ""conventional"" view of a Sanders candidacy can be summed up in in a tweet by Sean Trende, an elections analyst with the website RealClear Politics. ""Bernie Sanders is a complete wildcard,"" he wrote. ""He could win by 10 points or lose by 20."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A blunter take by a Sanders critic was offered by New York Magazine's Jonathan Chait in a column that particularly irked the Sanders faithful. ""No party nomination, with the possible exception of Barry Goldwater in 1964, has put forth a presidential nominee with the level of downside risk exposure as a Sanders-led ticket would bring,"" he wrote. ""To nominate Sanders would be insane."" When the stakes are so high - defeating Trump has been a central focus of Democrats since the day he was elected in 2016 - why, they ask, would the party choose a candidate so far away from the comfortable middle of American politics? Moderate members of Congress, in particular, have expressed apprehension about sharing a ticket with the independent-minded Vermont senator who only joined the Democratic Party to run for president. Dean Phillips, a newly elected congressman from Minnesota who has endorsed Klobuchar, told CNN that Sanders could have a ""disastrous"" effect on congressional races in November, jeopardising the majority Democrats won in the 435-seat chamber in 2018.. ""There are probably 25 to 30 seats that absolutely would be impacted directly by having a self-avowed socialist at the top of the ticket,"" he said. ""He's not a Democrat, you know, and that's something that I wish was better understood."" The Sanders campaign clearly realises that winning the ""electability"" debate is essential to securing the party's 2020 nomination. It's why they hand out ""Sanders beats Trump"" stickers at their campaign events and chanted the refrain at his New Hampshire victory celebration. They're quick to cite head-to-head polling that shows little significant difference between a Sanders-Trump matchup and one between Trump and Biden, the candidate frequently offered as the safe and electable option. A recentNBC/Wall Street Journal poll,externalhad Biden on top 50-44, while Sanders led Trump 49-45 - a statistically insignificant difference. They also argue that the entire debate about electability is framed incorrectly. American politics, they say, isn't a battle for the middle, it's a battle of ideas and a battle for authenticity. ""What we did last time was nominate someone who was down the middle and another Washington person who wasn't going to change anything,"" said Pat Miguel Tomaino of Boston. ""There are people hurting in this country who bought a lot of fake change from Donald Trump, and now we're all suffering for it."" This video can not be played âWe voted for Obama, then Trumpâ Tomaino, who volunteered for Sanders in New Hampshire, added that the economic collapse of 2008 destroyed the trust many Americans have in the current economic and political order, and unless the Democratic Party acknowledges this and adjust to the new reality, it's going to lose to Trump again.

"Sandbags in Appleby-in-Westmorland, one of the northern towns flooded by Storm Ciara last week Just over 1% of government infrastructure spending in England will go towards flood defences, analysis by BBC News has found. Current figures show nearly Â£5bn is due to be spent on flood defences up until 2026, with a third of the money spent in London and the South East. MPs in northern England said flood defence funding needed reallocating. The government said it was investing ""record"" amounts in new flood defences that would protect 300,000 homes. And it said in terms of money spent per home at risk of flooding, the North received more than the South. Large parts of the country were battered last weekend by Storm Ciara, which resulted inmore than 500 homes being flooded in Cumbria, Yorkshire and Lancashire. Storm Dennis is bringing further disruptionwith dozens of flood warnings in place across England. The Army was deployed to Ilkley and Calderdale in West Yorkshire to assist in flood relief efforts. In York, the Environment Agency has predicted the River Ouse could reach record levels of 5.4m on Monday, a height not seen since 2000. Appleby sits in a crook of the River Eden meaning its town centre is susceptible to flooding The Cumbrian town of Appleby-in-Westmorland was one of many rural towns affected by Storm Ciara's bad weather. ""Someone needs to stand up and be counted,"" said Dominic Boffin, as he swept flood water out of his home. ""We've had no help with the clean-up, and when it comes to the town being repeatedly flooded everyone seems to have their head in the sand."" Appleby was also badly affected in 2015 when Storm Desmond flooded more than 5,000 homes across the UK. The then Prime Minister David Cameron said theflood defences in Cumbria ""were not enough"". Appleby cafe owner James Brighurst said despite promises of new defences, none had materialised. ""We've seen a few subsidies for some individual buildings in the town but nothing has changed dramatically. ""There is a feeling we're being ignored and forgotten about"". Cafe owner James Brighurst said residents in Appleby had seen little investment in new flood defences The latest infrastructure spending figures published by the Treasury,externalshowed nearly Â£5bn was earmarked to be spent on flood defences in England over the next six years. The money was due to be spent on more than 1,300 projects. But flood defence spending makes up just 1.5% of the total Â£317bn set to be spent on all infrastructure across England, which includes upgrading roads and railway lines. ""Cumbria has had three 'one in 200-year' storm events in the last 10 years,"" said Tim Farron MP, Liberal Democrat spokesperson for Northern England, whose constituency is in the county. ""We know the climate is changing, and we also know that the climate is changing with the most impact here in the North West of England. ""So it is odd the government has chosen to spend so much money on London and the South East, and so little on the North. ""It's also staggering that we're spending so little money on flood defences altogether,"" added the Westmorland and Lonsdale MP. Tim Farron MP said the government needs to spend more money on building new flood defences York Central MP Rachel Maskell said the government had already failed to deliver on previous commitments made to upgrade flood defences in the historic cathedral city. ""Promises broken and programmes undelivered,"" said the Labour MP in the House of Commons. ""We have also seen a lack of delivery when it comes to issues like insurance and upper catchment management and even putting in extra flood resilience measures within the city."" In London and the South East, some of the Â£1.5bn earmarked for flood defences will be spent on the Thames Barrier Speaking before the government reshuffle on Thursday, the then Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers told MPs measures introduced by the government had protected 25,000 homes from being flooded by Storm Ciara. ""We are investing more than ever before in a Â£2.6bn flood defence programme up to 2021,"" she said. ""In the Autumn I announced an extra Â£60m to boost flood schemes in the North. ""Our manifesto commits us to an another Â£4bn of new flood defences funding up to 2026."" Grazing cattle blamed for weakening flood defences Anger after storm floods town for second time Animal trailer swept away by floods The Department for the Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) said investment in flood defences took place where the risk was highest, wherever it was across the country, and each scheme was carefully considered. ""Funding is allocated consistently across the country, targeting national investment to reduce the risks of flooding and coastal erosion to as many people as possible and to get the best outcome for every pound we spend,"" a spokesperson said. ""We work with local partners to take into account local needs and opportunities when deciding where to invest."" Defra said its own figures showed that between 2015 and 2021, investment per home at risk of flooding was equivalent to Â£700 in the North, compared with Â£335 in the South.

"The duchess appeared on Giovanna Fletcher's Happy Mum, Happy Baby podcast The Duchess of Cambridge has revealed she used hypnobirthing techniques of mindfulness and meditation to cope with severe morning sickness. Catherine suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum, which causes severe vomiting, during her pregnancies. In her first podcast interview, she said the illness meant she was ""not the happiest of pregnant people"". However, she said after trying everything to overcome it she realised the importance of ""mind over the body"". The duchess joked: ""I'm not going to say that William was standing there sort of, chanting sweet nothings at me. ""He definitely wasn't. I didn't even ask him about it, but it was just something I wanted to do for myself. ""I saw the power of it really, the meditation and the deep breathing and things like that, that they teach you in hypnobirthing, when I was really sick, and actually I realised that this was something I could take control of, I suppose, during labour. It was hugely powerful."" Speaking on theHappy Mum, Happy Baby podcast,external, Catherine told author and host Giovanna Fletcher that theFive Big Questions On The Under Fives,externalsurvey she has launched aims to ask people ""what is it that matters for them in raising their children today."" ""I had an amazing granny who devoted a lot of time to us, playing with us, doing arts and crafts and going to the greenhouse to do gardening, and cooking with us,"" she said. Kate launches childhood survey to help under-fives Duchess of Cambridge in surprise NI visit Duchess's teachers delighted at surprise royal hug ""And I try and incorporate a lot of the experiences that she gave us at the time into the experiences that I give my children now."" By Daniela Relph, royal correspondent These are some of the most open and candid words we've heard from the Duchess of Cambridge. She speaks personally about her childhood and reflects on the value of her stable upbringing. There are many insights into her own experience of pregnancy and motherhood that many will recognise. She shares the misery of extreme morning sickness, the power of hypnobirthing, the uncertainty of those early days with a new baby and the guilt of working and relying on others to help you. She also describes how she felt in the moments before facing the world's media outside the hospital just a day after giving birth and holding a newborn Prince George in her arms. She said it was terrifying. It's clear the duchess felt comfortable speaking to the podcast host, Giovanna Fletcher. That ease comes from the fact this area is now a real priority for Catherine. Her royal work has a sharp focus on family and specifically early intervention - helping vulnerable parents with children under the age of five who need extra support. The Five Big Questions survey she launched last month asking for people's views on early childhood has so far drawn more than 200,000 responses. The duchess said her own priorities included providing her children with the ""happy home"" and ""safe environment"" she had enjoyed as a child. She said she was ""passionate"" about children spending a lot of time outside, adding that it was ""so great for physical and mental wellbeing"" and laying the foundations for healthy development. ""It's such a great environment to spend time in, building those quality relationships without the distractions of 'I've got to cook' and 'I've got to do this'. And actually, it's so simple,"" she said. The image of Princess Charlotte smelling a bluebell was taken by the duchess at their home in Norfolk last spring A picture of Catherine's daughter, Princess Charlotte, smelling a bluebell has been released following the duchess's interview. The image of the four-year-old was taken by the duchess at their home in Norfolk in spring last year. The month-long online poll, conducted by Ipsos Mori on behalf of Catherine's Royal Foundation, aims to ""spark a national conversation"" on early childhood, Kensington Palace has said. Launched in January, it is thought to be the biggest survey of its kind and the results are intended to guide the duchess's future work. ""It's going to take a long time, I'm talking about a generational change, but hopefully this is the first small step: to start a conversation around the importance of early childhood development,"" Catherine said. The duchess appeared on the podcast after visiting children at a nursery in south London ""It's not just about happy, healthy children. This is for lifelong consequences and outcomes."" Ms Fletcher - who is married to Tom Fletcher from McFly - said Kate seemed ""passionate"" about the subject and it was ""beyond wonderful to sit and talk further about the survey, her work - for which she has so much knowledge, and her own experiences of being a mother"". ""It doesn't matter who you are, what you have, or where you come from - we're all trying to do our best with our children while continuously doubting our decisions and wondering if we're getting it completely wrong. Talking helps unite us all,"" she said. 1.What do you believe is most important for children growing up in the UK today to live a happy adult life?Rank from most important to least important: Good physical and mental health Good friendships and relationships Access to opportunities Access to a good education 2.Which of these statements is closest to your opinion? It is primarily the responsibility of parents to give children aged 0-5 the best chance of health and happiness It is primarily the responsibility of others in society to give children aged 0-5 the best chance of health and happiness It is the shared responsibility of parents and others in society to give children aged 0-5 the best chance of health and happiness Don't know 3.How much do you agree or disagree with this statement?The mental health and wellbeing of parents and carers has a great impact on the development of their child(ren) Strongly agree Tend to agree Neither agree nor disagree Tend to disagree Strongly disagree 4.Which of the following is closest to your opinion of what influences how children develop from the start of pregnancy to age five? Mostly the traits a child is born with (i.e. nature) Mostly the experiences of a child in the early years (i.e. nurture) Both nature and nurture equally Don't know 5.Which period of a child and young person's life do you think is the most important for health and happiness in adulthood?
