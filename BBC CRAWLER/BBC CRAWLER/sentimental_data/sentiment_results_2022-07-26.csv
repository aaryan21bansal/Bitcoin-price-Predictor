"An NHS worker was left feeling ""sad"" and ""incredulous"" after bosses sent staff an email with advice on how to access food banks. A body that provides logistical support for the health service across Wales sent the email about the cost of living crisis to all its staff in July. ""It was knowing that people were suffering, and we're just being left to it,"" the employee said. The organisation said the email was not intended to cause offence. A pay increase has been announced for NHS workers in Wales, with doctors, consultants, GPs and nurses in Wales offered between 4% and 5.5%. The pay rises are below the 9.4% rate of inflation. The worker, who wished to remain anonymous, told BBC Wales the increase was ""a step in the right direction"" but added: ""I don't know how much help that will be considering how much inflation is going up. ""I can't really get started in life on my current wages. I feel very stuck."" Student nurse down to her last Â£1 'It feels like I'm being priced out of existence' The email, sent to NHS Wales Shared Services Partnership (NWSSP) staff, was entitled ""Financial well-being support"" and said: ""Things are difficult for many of us, with the ongoing cost of living crisis."" Alongside money saving tips for parents on ""surviving the school holidays"", and information about the Money Helper advice website, it linked to articles on how to access a food bank, and a service providing information on where to find them. An email to staff at NWSSP provided advice on how to access a food bank The NWSSP provides a wide range of administrative services to health boards across Wales including procurement, audit and employment support. The staff member said that after putting in so much extra work during the pandemic the email felt ""very hollow - like what we were doing was not appreciated enough by governing bodies"". ""I was sad that people were struggling so much that we were left with no other alternative option other than to go to the foodbanks. ""I was a bit incredulous as well that people would be left to suffer after giving so much of their time and energy to helping others."" Hugh McDyer, head of health at the Unison Cymru Wales union, said it came as ""no surprise"", and his organisation had seen claims of work poverty and members not being able to pay the bills ""rise exponentially"". He said while the advice was in ""some ways well intentioned"" the irony would not be lost on healthcare workers. ""It's a sad day when our members are having to make choices to heat or eat or go to a food bank to ensure their family does eat,"" he said. He said the NHS pay review body's recommendations - which were accepted by the Welsh government - were ""simply not enough"". How does public sector pay get sorted in Wales? Biggest squeeze for public sector pay in 20 years An NWSSP spokesperson said: ""A health and well-being themed internal communication was circulated to NWSSP staff on 13 July 2022, in response to a series of questions from our staff."" The spokesperson said it included ""a minor reference about how to access a foodbank"". They added that the organisation recognised ""the incredible hard work, commitment and dedication that our staff undertake on a day to day basis"" and that the email ""was not intended to cause offence but rather communicate the wide range of support on offer"". Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""Last week's pay announcement - way below the sky-high inflation figures - represented a real terms pay cut. That means increasing in-work poverty, something that has scandalously become all-too-common. ""This message from health bosses, pointing staff to food banks, shows how far we've gone down the road of thinking this is somehow 'normal'. It isn't."" Last week's pay announcements by the Welsh government angered trade unions after both game in below inflation. The Royal College of Nurses (RCN) said it would ballot members on possible industrial action, andtwo teaching unionsare also expected to ask if their members want to do the same. The Welsh government declined to respond but pointed to its statement last week, where Health Minister Eluned Morgan said ""without additional funding from the UK government, there are inevitably limits to how far we can go in Wales"". The UK government previously said the Welsh government has had more funding than at any time since devolution began.

"There is a ""strong association"" between the early outbreak and the sale of live animals in a market, scientists say Scientists say there is ""compelling evidence"" that Wuhan's Huanan seafood and wildlife market was at the centre of the Covid-19 outbreak.Â Two peer-reviewed studies published on Tuesday re-examine information from the initial outbreak in the Chinese city. One of the studies shows that the earliest known caseswere clustered around that market,external. The other uses genetic information to track the timing of the outbreak. It suggeststhere were two variants introduced into humans,externalin November or early December 2019. Together, the researchers say this evidence paints a picture that Sars-Cov-2 was present in live mammals that were sold at Huanan market in late 2019. They say it was transmitted into people who were working or shopping there in two separate ""spillover events"", where a human contracted the virus from an animal. One of the researchers involved, virologist Prof David Robertson from the University of Glasgow, told BBC News that he hoped the studies would ""correct the false record that the virus came from a lab"". Two years of scientific effort to understand the virus that causes Covid-19 have provided these researchers with a more informed perspective. This has enabled them to address a key conundrum in the earliest patient data: That out of hundreds of people who were hospitalised with Covid-19 in Wuhan, only about 50 had a direct, traceable link to the market. Early cases clustered around the Huanan market (c) Science ""That was really puzzling that most cases could not be linked to the market,"" said Prof Robertson. ""But knowing what we know about the virus now, it's exactly what we would expect - because many people only get very mildly ill, so they would be out in the community transmitting the virus to others and the severe cases would be hard to link to each other."" This Covid-19 case-mapping research found that a large percentage of early patients -  with no known connection to the market, meaning they neither worked nor shopped there - did turn out to live near it. This supports the idea that the market was the epicentre of the epidemic, said Prof Michael Worobey, lead author and biologist from the University of Arizona, with sellers getting infected first and setting off a ""chain of infections among community members in the surrounding area"". ""In a city covering more than 3,000 sq miles (7,770 sq km), the area with the highest probability of containing the home of someone who had one of the earliest Covid-19 cases in the world was an area of a few city blocks, with the Huanan market smack dab inside it,"" said Prof Worobey. Live animals, including species now known to be susceptible to Covid-19, were sold in Huanan market That study also zoomed in on the market itself. The scientists created a map of the samples - swabs of fluid from drains and on market stalls - that tested positive for the virus. ""Most of the positive samples clustered around the south-western side of the market,"" explained Prof Robertson. ""And that's the location where we report species like raccoon dogs being sold. ""So we have confirmation of animals we now know are susceptible [to Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19] were sold there in late 2019."" Over the last two years, the search for the origin of the deadly pandemic turned from a scientific investigation into a toxic political row. Viewers in the UK can watchthis BBC documentaryon the hunt for Covid-19's origins. One of the subjects of a fierce international blame game - primarily between politicians in the US and China - was a theory that the virus could have been leaked from a Wuhan laboratory, the Wuhan Institute of Virology. But that hypothesis, said Prof Stuart Neil from Kings College, ""can't explain the data"". ""We're now as sure as we can be, based on the fragmentary evidence we do have, that this was a spillover event that happened in the market."" Crowded, live animal markets, many scientists agree, provide an ideal transmission hotspot for new diseases to ""spill over"" from animals. And between 2017 and 2019, to the beginning of the pandemic, a separate study showed that nearly 50,000 animals - of 38 different species - were sold at markets in Wuhan. Prof Neil said the pandemic was very likely to have been a consequence of an ""unhealthy, cruel and unhygienic practice that Chinese authorities had been warned about"". The major risk of being distracted by looking for someone in a laboratory to blame for all this, he added, ""is that we run the risk of letting this happen again because we've focused on the wrong problem.""

"Thousands of council workers across Scotland have voted to take industrial action after rejecting a pay offer of 2%. Staff at schools, nurseries and waste and recycling centres throughout the country took part in the strike ballot. It was the largest strike ballot among council workers in more than a decade, the Unison union said. Nine local authority branches exceeded the required 50% turnout threshold required by the Trade Union Act. Unison said it intended to shut schools across Scotland when children return after the school summer break in August. The unions also said strike action could leave waste ""piling up in the streets"" if workers did not get a pay increase of more than the ""miserly"" 2% that was currently being offered. Unison's Johanna Baxter said: ""Cosla leaders meet on Friday and must put an improved offer on the table if we are to avoid large-scale disruption to council services across Scotland. Council workers to vote on strike action ""Council workers south of the border yesterday were offered a flat rate uplift of Â£1925, which for those on the lowest pay equates to a 10.5% increase. You have to wonder why council workers north of the border have only been offered a measly 2% increase when the cost of living continues to spiral. ""Unison have been calling for a flat rate payment to help those on lower incomes. Most council workers earn less than Â£25k per year."" Unison said it intended to shut schools when pupils return after the summer holiday The Unison, Unite and GMB unionshad urged members to vote to strikeafter Finance Minister Kate Forbes refused an offer of ""last-ditch talks"". The unions said they had called for a summit with Ms Forbes and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in a bid to avoid strike action. Ms Forbes wrote to Unison last month and said ""it would not be appropriate to interfere in these negotiations, given their devolved nature"" and ""respectfully declined"" a meeting proposed by Cosla, the local authority body. GMB Scotland senior organiser Keir Greenaway said: ""The 2% that's already been massively rejected is a shameful proposal, it's worth less than a tenner a week extra for those earning Â£25,000 or under, and it will turn a cost-of-living crisis into a catastrophe for many workers and their families. ""Two years ago, these workers were applauded on the doorstep by political leaders, but now they are being told to suffer massive real terms pay cuts ahead of a brutal winter with forecasts of double-digit inflation and energy bills over Â£3,000. ""Our members are angry and scared, and the prospect of tens of thousands of council workers falling into the growing ranks of the working poor is not something GMB is prepared to leave unchallenged."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Pay settlements for council workers - excluding teachers - are a matter for Cosla and are determined through negotiations at the Scottish Joint Committee (SJC). ""As it is not a member of the SJC, the Scottish government cannot directly intervene in pay negotiations, which are for the trade unions to negotiate with Cosla. ""The Scottish government urges all parties to continue dialogue and seek a resolution which avoids industrial action.""

"This video can not be played Watch: Tory leader debate disrupted after crash is heard The latest Tory leadership debate between Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss has been cancelled after the presenter fainted on air. The Sun and TalkTV debate, hosted by journalist Kate McCann, abruptly halted around halfway through after a loud crash was heard. TalkTV said McCann was ""fine"" but the channel had been given medical advice not to continue. ""We apologise to our viewers and listeners,"" the channel added. The leadership candidates tweeted that they were relieved to hear McCann was fine, and indicated they would be happy to stage a rematch. The TalkTV presenter had been due to co-host the debate alongside the Sun's political editor Harry Cole, but he pulled out after testing positive for Covid. Rishi Sunak: Former chancellor bidding for top job Liz Truss: Fast-track career of foreign secretary Before it was halted, the latest televised debate between the two candidates had been covering tax, the state of the NHS and rising living costs. They had been about to begin a section on the UK's support for Ukraine when the debate went off air. TalkTV said Kate McCann was fine but medical advice was not to continue with the debate The candidates displayed a more conciliatory tone, in contrast to thefierce clashesthat had marked Monday's debate on BBC One. Ms Truss repeated her charge that the former chancellor had been ""morally wrong"" to put up National Insurance. She added that economic growth was ""anaemic"" and his plan to raise corporation tax next year would tip the UK economy into recession. But Mr Sunak responded that the NI hike had been a ""brave decision"" to raise money for the NHS, and it was ""entirely reasonable"" to ask bigger companies to pay more to repair the public finances in the wake of the Covid pandemic. In a pointed rejoinder, he said: ""What's morally wrong is asking our children and grandchildren to pick up the tab for the bills that we are not prepared to meet."" There had been a much calmer tone to this debate, without quite as much of the spikiness seen in previous clashes. Mr Sunak, in particular, seemed less on the attack than in the BBC debate, where he was accused by some of ""mansplaining"". When offered the chance to ask Rishi Sunak a question, Liz Truss noticeably swerved going for a personal blow, instead asking about the cost of living. Mr Sunak used his question to mark the fact that it was Ms Truss's birthday; a very different tone to when they were given the same opportunity on ITV a couple of weeks earlier. The differences on the economy and taxation were still clear though, with both labelling the other's strategy ""morally wrong"". Questions from Sun readers also took the debate further into policy areas they hadn't debated as much before, such as the NHS and fracking. A lot more of the policy, and less of the personal. Ms Truss said putting up National Insurance was not needed to give the NHS money to help clear Covid backlogs, which she said could be funded through ""general taxation"". Asked how she would improve NHS services, the foreign secretary said she would cut down on layers of management and give NHS leaders ""more power locally"". Mr Sunak also set out his plan for healthcare, which involved increasing the number of ""community hubs"" for treatment and diagnosis. Both candidates also said they would supportfracking for energydomestically if local communities supported it. The contenders were challenged about what they would do to improve cancer treatment by an audience member with the disease who said he had been forced to receive help from a cancer charity. John Hughes, in Birmingham, asked the candidates: ""Why is the NHS broken?"" After Mr Sunak said he was glad he was getting ""the support that you need,"" Mr Hughes replied: ""I'm not getting that, Mr Sunak."" And while Ms Truss said she would give local leaders more power, Mr Hughes said the Conservatives had ""had the chance already, and its still not enough for the NHS"". Mr Sunak, who resigned as Boris Johnson's chancellor as part of the cabinet mutiny against him earlier this month, had qualified for the final round of the leadership contest with the most votes from Tory MPs.  But opinion polls have suggested Ms Truss is thecurrent favouriteof the 160,000 or so Tory party members who will actually pick the eventual winner. Members will be able to vote by post or online form early August until 2 September, with a result announced three days later.

"Former first minister Donald Dewar had concerns about providing compensation to survivors Scotland's inaugural first minister Donald Dewar feared compensating people infected by contaminated blood could result in an ""open cheque book"". The UK Infected Blood Inquiry was told that his concerns appeared in an email sent in September 1999. In the 1970s and 1980s, about 3,000 people in Scotland contracted Hepatitis C and HIV through blood products used to treat conditions like haemophilia. Those left with Hepatitis C did not receive financial support until 2004. Ministers given 'inaccurate' blood scandal briefing Contaminated blood: The Scottish questions The blood inquiry was set up in 2017 to examine what has been called the worst treatment disaster in NHS history. While many victims died others who were left with lifelong serious illness have provided evidence to the investigation which is being chaired by former QC Sir Brian Langstaff. The Haemophilia Society has long believed that some of these infections could have been prevented and that between 1985 and 1987, the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service was negligent in not using safer blood products. More than 3,000 people in Scotland were infected with contaminated blood Mr Dewar, who was Scotland's first minister following devolution, had faced demands to provide compensation to victims. On Tuesday the inquiry heard Scottish ministers were against providing payouts because the NHS had not been found to be negligent or at fault. Theemail sent on behalf of Mr Dewar,externalon 23 September 1999 said he was ""a little concerned about the possible financial implications and fears that an open mind could be taken to mean an open cheque book"". A handwritten note added that the then health minister Susan Deacon's office ""advises that this is very much a PR exercise and there is unlikely to be any compensation paid"". Ms Deacon is due to give evidence to the inquiry on Friday. The email was sent nine days after the health minister had met with the Haemophilia Society, pledging that an internal investigation into the Hepatitis C infections would be open and transparent. That probe concluded that no blame was attributable to the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service. This video can not be played Prof Aileen Keel told the inquiry: ""I certainly don't agree with the use of term 'PR exercise'."" Prof Aileen Keel, a haematologist who held several senior roles advising government between 1992 and 2015, told the inquiry that victims of the scandal received the best treatment at the time. However, she distanced herself from some of the comments in correspondence at the time. Prof Keel said: ""I certainly don't agree with the use of term 'PR exercise'. ""Undoubtedly, ministers were under great pressure to further investigate this area. And the Haemophilia Society undoubtedly had in mind compensation at the end of that period."" She added: ""However, I don't think that means that the internal investigation was not conducted in an entirely proper way â finding out the facts, detailing the chronology so that we could really understand whether what the Haemophilia Society were alleging was true or not. ""So the use of this terminology does not tally with my recollection of that period around the investigation."" The inquiry before Sir Brian Langstaff continues.

"The global growth outlook has ""darkened significantly"", the IMF says The UK is set for the slowest growth of the G7 richest economies next year, the International Monetary Fund has warned. It is predicting UK growth will fall to just 0.5% in 2023, much lower than its forecast in April of 1.2%. The global economy has shrunk for the first time since 2020, the IMF said, hit by the Ukraine war and Covid-19. With growth stalling in the UK, US, China and Europe, the world ""may soon be teetering on the edge of a global recession"", it said. ""We know that people are feeling the impact of rising prices, caused by global economic factors, triggered by the illegal Russian invasion of Ukraine,"" a HM Treasury spokesperson said in a statement, adding that help for households included Â£400 off energy bills plus personal tax cuts worth up to Â£330 a year. The IMF has cut its 2022 global growth forecast to just 3.2% and warned the slowdown risks being even more severe. It said fast-rising prices were to blame for much of the slowdown, with households and businesses squeezed by a combination of higher prices and higher borrowing costs as policymakers raise interest rates to try to counter inflation. ""The global economy, still reeling from the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, is facing an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook,"" economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in a blog outlining the international lending body's latest economic forecast. ""The outlook has darkened significantly"" since April, the last time the IMF issued forecasts, he added. Why is the UK economy suffering more than others? China economy shrinks on zero-Covid policy The global economy contracted in the three months to July, which was the first decline since the pandemic hit, the IMF said. The probability of a recession in the G7 economies - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US and UK - now stands at roughly 15% - nearly four times higher than usual. While UK growth is expected to remain relatively strong this year, Mr Gourinchas said unusually high inflation - faster than in Europe or the US - is expected to take a toll in 2023. ""If you were to look at both years together, it's actually not very far from where the other advanced economies are,"" he told the BBC. ""The one thing that worries me more about the UK economy is that their inflation numbers seem to be quite high. There is a fairly high pass through from high gas prices to broader prices in the economy. ""That would signal even further monetary policy tightening by the Bank of England and that would also weigh down on growth going forward."" The IMF now expects inflation to reach 6.6% in advanced economies and 9.5% in emerging market and developing economies - nearly a full percentage point higher than it expected in April. ""Inflation at current levels represents a clear risk for current and future macroeconomic stability and bringing it back to central bank targets should be the top priority for policymakers,"" Mr Gourinchas said. ""Tighter monetary policy will inevitably have real economic costs, but delaying it will only exacerbate the hardship."" The fallout from the war in Ukraine is being felt in pockets across the world. Soaring food and fuel prices and higher interest rates means the IMF sees more gloomy prospects for all major economies - but it's the UK that, Russia apart, remains bottom of the pile for 2023. Brexit may not have helped but it's our reliance on fossil fuels - they make up 75% of our energy mix, more than in the EU  - that's made us particularly vulnerable to this shock. Those prices are determined on international markets but affect us all. This report comes on the day that, with the energy price cap set to top Â£3,000 in October, a committee of MPs warns that further government help for households may be needed. But the IMF is among those economists who've noted that the UK faces more fundamental issues than the current crisis, with living standards having dropped behind many competitors over the last 15 years, something many attribute to a lack of investment in skills, equipment and infrastructure. Officials from the IMF have previously told me that one way to remedy that would be to raise, not lower taxes, to fund more investment. The US saw the steepest downgrade of any country for 2022. The IMF cut its growth forecast for the world's largest economy to 2.3% this year, from 3.7% previously, and to just 1% in 2023. Meanwhile growth in China is expected to fall to 3.3% this year, the slowest rate in nearly four decades, as the country wrestles with new Covid lockdowns and a property crisis. Questions about the reliability of Europe's natural gas supplies from Russia, as well as political unrest generated by high food and fuel prices, are among the risks the global economy is facing in the months ahead, the IMF said. ""We can be reasonably hopeful that China might be rebound,"" Mr Gourinchas said, adding that he was ""much more concerned about both the inflation path and the tightening of monetary policy leading to a slowdown going ahead"". It warned that in a ""plausible"" scenario, in which only some of those risks materialise, like a shutdown of Russian gas flows to Europe, global economic growth could fall to 2% next year - a pace the world has fallen below just five times since 1970.

This Covid-19 case-mapping research found that a large percentage of early patients -  with no known connection to the market, meaning they neither worked nor shopped there - did turn out to live near it. This supports the idea that the market was the epicentre of the epidemic, said Prof Michael Worobey, lead author and biologist from the University of Arizona, with sellers getting infected first and setting off a ""chain of infections among community members in the surrounding area"". ""In a city covering more than 3,000 sq miles (7,770 sq km), the area with the highest probability of containing the home of someone who had one of the earliest Covid-19 cases in the world was an area of a few city blocks, with the Huanan market smack dab inside it,"" said Prof Worobey. Live animals, including species now known to be susceptible to Covid-19, were sold in Huanan market That study also zoomed in on the market itself. The scientists created a map of the samples - swabs of fluid from drains and on market stalls - that tested positive for the virus. ""Most of the positive samples clustered around the south-western side of the market,"" explained Prof Robertson. ""And that's the location where we report species like raccoon dogs being sold. ""So we have confirmation of animals we now know are susceptible [to Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19] were sold there in late 2019."" Over the last two years, the search for the origin of the deadly pandemic turned from a scientific investigation into a toxic political row. Viewers in the UK can watchthis BBC documentaryon the hunt for Covid-19's origins. One of the subjects of a fierce international blame game - primarily between politicians in the US and China - was a theory that the virus could have been leaked from a Wuhan laboratory, the Wuhan Institute of Virology. But that hypothesis, said Prof Stuart Neil from Kings College, ""can't explain the data"". ""We're now as sure as we can be, based on the fragmentary evidence we do have, that this was a spillover event that happened in the market."" Crowded, live animal markets, many scientists agree, provide an ideal transmission hotspot for new diseases to ""spill over"" from animals. And between 2017 and 2019, to the beginning of the pandemic, a separate study showed that nearly 50,000 animals - of 38 different species - were sold at markets in Wuhan. Prof Neil said the pandemic was very likely to have been a consequence of an ""unhealthy, cruel and unhygienic practice that Chinese authorities had been warned about"". The major risk of being distracted by looking for someone in a laboratory to blame for all this, he added, ""is that we run the risk of letting this happen again because we've focused on the wrong problem.""

summerâs European Championships, becoming the countryâs top scorer in the
competitionâs history in the process, while no player has scored more goals in
a single edition of the competition than her (Inka Grings also six for Germany
in 2009). Alessia Russo has now
scored four goals at this summerâs European Championships, all coming as a

goals in the competition, doing so previously against Norway in a 4-3
semi-final defeat in February 1995. FT: England 4-0 Sweden Jonas EidevallArsenal manager on BBC One For English women's football this is a great moment.

Championships for the third time, doing so previously in 1984 and 2009. Indeed,
the Lionesses have ended a run of losing each of their last three semi-finals
at either the World Cup (2015 and 2019) and Euros (2017). They have now
beaten Sweden for a fourth time in all competitions (D8 L15), with three of

"An NHS worker was left feeling ""sad"" and ""incredulous"" after bosses sent staff an email with advice on how to access food banks. A body that provides logistical support for the health service across Wales sent the email about the cost of living crisis to all its staff in July. ""It was knowing that people were suffering, and we're just being left to it,"" the employee said. The organisation said the email was not intended to cause offence. A pay increase has been announced for NHS workers in Wales, with doctors, consultants, GPs and nurses in Wales offered between 4% and 5.5%. The pay rises are below the 9.4% rate of inflation. The worker, who wished to remain anonymous, told BBC Wales the increase was ""a step in the right direction"" but added: ""I don't know how much help that will be considering how much inflation is going up. ""I can't really get started in life on my current wages. I feel very stuck."" Student nurse down to her last Â£1 'It feels like I'm being priced out of existence' The email, sent to NHS Wales Shared Services Partnership (NWSSP) staff, was entitled ""Financial well-being support"" and said: ""Things are difficult for many of us, with the ongoing cost of living crisis."" Alongside money saving tips for parents on ""surviving the school holidays"", and information about the Money Helper advice website, it linked to articles on how to access a food bank, and a service providing information on where to find them. An email to staff at NWSSP provided advice on how to access a food bank The NWSSP provides a wide range of administrative services to health boards across Wales including procurement, audit and employment support. The staff member said that after putting in so much extra work during the pandemic the email felt ""very hollow - like what we were doing was not appreciated enough by governing bodies"". ""I was sad that people were struggling so much that we were left with no other alternative option other than to go to the foodbanks. ""I was a bit incredulous as well that people would be left to suffer after giving so much of their time and energy to helping others."" Hugh McDyer, head of health at the Unison Cymru Wales union, said it came as ""no surprise"", and his organisation had seen claims of work poverty and members not being able to pay the bills ""rise exponentially"". He said while the advice was in ""some ways well intentioned"" the irony would not be lost on healthcare workers. ""It's a sad day when our members are having to make choices to heat or eat or go to a food bank to ensure their family does eat,"" he said. He said the NHS pay review body's recommendations - which were accepted by the Welsh government - were ""simply not enough"". How does public sector pay get sorted in Wales? Biggest squeeze for public sector pay in 20 years An NWSSP spokesperson said: ""A health and well-being themed internal communication was circulated to NWSSP staff on 13 July 2022, in response to a series of questions from our staff."" The spokesperson said it included ""a minor reference about how to access a foodbank"". They added that the organisation recognised ""the incredible hard work, commitment and dedication that our staff undertake on a day to day basis"" and that the email ""was not intended to cause offence but rather communicate the wide range of support on offer"". Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""Last week's pay announcement - way below the sky-high inflation figures - represented a real terms pay cut. That means increasing in-work poverty, something that has scandalously become all-too-common. ""This message from health bosses, pointing staff to food banks, shows how far we've gone down the road of thinking this is somehow 'normal'. It isn't."" Last week's pay announcements by the Welsh government angered trade unions after both game in below inflation. The Royal College of Nurses (RCN) said it would ballot members on possible industrial action, andtwo teaching unionsare also expected to ask if their members want to do the same. The Welsh government declined to respond but pointed to its statement last week, where Health Minister Eluned Morgan said ""without additional funding from the UK government, there are inevitably limits to how far we can go in Wales"". The UK government previously said the Welsh government has had more funding than at any time since devolution began.

"This video can not be played Watch: Tory leader debate disrupted after crash is heard The latest Tory leadership debate between Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss has been cancelled after the presenter fainted on air. The Sun and TalkTV debate, hosted by journalist Kate McCann, abruptly halted around halfway through after a loud crash was heard. TalkTV said McCann was ""fine"" but the channel had been given medical advice not to continue. ""We apologise to our viewers and listeners,"" the channel added. The leadership candidates tweeted that they were relieved to hear McCann was fine, and indicated they would be happy to stage a rematch. The TalkTV presenter had been due to co-host the debate alongside the Sun's political editor Harry Cole, but he pulled out after testing positive for Covid. Rishi Sunak: Former chancellor bidding for top job Liz Truss: Fast-track career of foreign secretary Before it was halted, the latest televised debate between the two candidates had been covering tax, the state of the NHS and rising living costs. They had been about to begin a section on the UK's support for Ukraine when the debate went off air. TalkTV said Kate McCann was fine but medical advice was not to continue with the debate The candidates displayed a more conciliatory tone, in contrast to thefierce clashesthat had marked Monday's debate on BBC One. Ms Truss repeated her charge that the former chancellor had been ""morally wrong"" to put up National Insurance. She added that economic growth was ""anaemic"" and his plan to raise corporation tax next year would tip the UK economy into recession. But Mr Sunak responded that the NI hike had been a ""brave decision"" to raise money for the NHS, and it was ""entirely reasonable"" to ask bigger companies to pay more to repair the public finances in the wake of the Covid pandemic. In a pointed rejoinder, he said: ""What's morally wrong is asking our children and grandchildren to pick up the tab for the bills that we are not prepared to meet."" There had been a much calmer tone to this debate, without quite as much of the spikiness seen in previous clashes. Mr Sunak, in particular, seemed less on the attack than in the BBC debate, where he was accused by some of ""mansplaining"". When offered the chance to ask Rishi Sunak a question, Liz Truss noticeably swerved going for a personal blow, instead asking about the cost of living. Mr Sunak used his question to mark the fact that it was Ms Truss's birthday; a very different tone to when they were given the same opportunity on ITV a couple of weeks earlier. The differences on the economy and taxation were still clear though, with both labelling the other's strategy ""morally wrong"". Questions from Sun readers also took the debate further into policy areas they hadn't debated as much before, such as the NHS and fracking. A lot more of the policy, and less of the personal. Ms Truss said putting up National Insurance was not needed to give the NHS money to help clear Covid backlogs, which she said could be funded through ""general taxation"". Asked how she would improve NHS services, the foreign secretary said she would cut down on layers of management and give NHS leaders ""more power locally"". Mr Sunak also set out his plan for healthcare, which involved increasing the number of ""community hubs"" for treatment and diagnosis. Both candidates also said they would supportfracking for energydomestically if local communities supported it. The contenders were challenged about what they would do to improve cancer treatment by an audience member with the disease who said he had been forced to receive help from a cancer charity. John Hughes, in Birmingham, asked the candidates: ""Why is the NHS broken?"" After Mr Sunak said he was glad he was getting ""the support that you need,"" Mr Hughes replied: ""I'm not getting that, Mr Sunak."" And while Ms Truss said she would give local leaders more power, Mr Hughes said the Conservatives had ""had the chance already, and its still not enough for the NHS"". Mr Sunak, who resigned as Boris Johnson's chancellor as part of the cabinet mutiny against him earlier this month, had qualified for the final round of the leadership contest with the most votes from Tory MPs.  But opinion polls have suggested Ms Truss is thecurrent favouriteof the 160,000 or so Tory party members who will actually pick the eventual winner. Members will be able to vote by post or online form early August until 2 September, with a result announced three days later.

"One of the vandalised trees in Heath Park Twenty cherry trees gifted by Japan to celebrate 150 years of friendship with Wales have been vandalised. The trees were planted in Heath Park, Cardiff, as part of the Sakura Cherry Tree Project. One councillor labelled the ""mindless destruction"" shown by the vandals as ""sickening"". South Wales police said it was investigating and would increase patrols around parks over the summer to tackle anti-social behaviour. This video can not be played Two rows of cherry trees were planted in Heath Park, Cardiff The project was launched in Japan in 2017 by the then leaders of the two countries, Shinzo Abe and Theresa May. Sandy Sano, joint chairman and founder of the Sakura Cherry Tree Planting Project described the situation as ""tragic and an unfortunate"". ""I feel, knowing the kind mind of the Welsh people, I am sure it is a shock to Welsh people. We share the same feeling,"" he said. Sandy Sano said the Sakura Cherry Tree Planting Project wishes to donate trees to re-plant those that were vandalised ""We'd like to donate once again, to re-plant those twenty cherry blossom trees that have been damaged,"" he added. Mr Sano wanted to highlight the respect he has for the people of Wales and the close relationship between the two nations. ""We have a strong feeling, a very close relationship, with you."" Resident Corinne Williams said: ""There's no words for someone going along and doing that. I wonder if there's any point in replanting them really."" Corrine wonders whether ""there is any point"" in replanting the trees And Sharron Whatley added: ""I walked through yesterday and I just hoped it was perhaps just a strong wind or something. But to see them broken like this it really had to be vandalism. ""It's dreadful, so upsetting."" Sharon Whatley initially thought they had fallen down in the wind Cardiff councillor Jennifer Burke-Davies said the trees were only planed in January and ""were meant to symbolise friendship and understanding"". She added: ""It's a deliberate act of vandalism, a crime, and I fully condemn this completely unacceptable behaviour."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Keith Dunn, the honorary consul for Japan in Wales, said he was ""shocked and saddened"" to hear of the vandalism. The trees were planted in January in Heath Park and Bute Park in Cardiff ""This is a totally unacceptable act and I know that my colleagues who have been responsible for organising the Sakura Cherry Tree Project... will be incredibly disappointed and saddened by this news,"" he said. ""I would urge anyone that has any information about this crime to come forward and report to the police."" A total of 120 trees were planted in Cardiff, with 20 planted at Bute Park in response totrees being vandalised therein September. The rest were planted at Heath Park. Heath and Birchgrove councillor Graham Hinchey said: ""The trees will be replaced, we won't let the vandals win. ""It's really disappointing that young people have planted for the future helping with climate change work and this happens.""

He added that he had spoken to the local police inspector and asked for them to carry out more regular visits to the area. The idea was to create a colourful avenue of blossoming cherry trees Insp Scott Threadgold, of South Wales Police, said: ""This is an incident which has caused significant concern to residents surrounding the park as well as the wider general public, the trees were donated to the community to mark the relationship between Wales and Japan in January this year and they hold a place in many people's hearts as a result.""

""Not long after I first started in this role, the BBC covered the 2009 Women's Euros in Finland. ""The truth is there was limited audience interest, the total reach for the tournament was just 2.5 million. ""The springboard was London 2012, when 70-odd thousand people crammed into Wembley to watch Team GB's women's team beat the mighty Brazil. ""It was a moment in time, when we knew the sport was ready to move to the next level. ""We invested heavily in our coverage and in 2019, 27 million tuned into the Women's World Cup in France on the BBC - the most watched sporting event of the year. ""Women's football has developed beyond all recognition in the last decade and BBC Sport has been there every step of the way.""

"The global growth outlook has ""darkened significantly"", the IMF says The UK is set for the slowest growth of the G7 richest economies next year, the International Monetary Fund has warned. It is predicting UK growth will fall to just 0.5% in 2023, much lower than its forecast in April of 1.2%. The global economy has shrunk for the first time since 2020, the IMF said, hit by the Ukraine war and Covid-19. With growth stalling in the UK, US, China and Europe, the world ""may soon be teetering on the edge of a global recession"", it said. ""We know that people are feeling the impact of rising prices, caused by global economic factors, triggered by the illegal Russian invasion of Ukraine,"" a HM Treasury spokesperson said in a statement, adding that help for households included Â£400 off energy bills plus personal tax cuts worth up to Â£330 a year. The IMF has cut its 2022 global growth forecast to just 3.2% and warned the slowdown risks being even more severe. It said fast-rising prices were to blame for much of the slowdown, with households and businesses squeezed by a combination of higher prices and higher borrowing costs as policymakers raise interest rates to try to counter inflation. ""The global economy, still reeling from the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, is facing an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook,"" economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in a blog outlining the international lending body's latest economic forecast. ""The outlook has darkened significantly"" since April, the last time the IMF issued forecasts, he added. Why is the UK economy suffering more than others? China economy shrinks on zero-Covid policy The global economy contracted in the three months to July, which was the first decline since the pandemic hit, the IMF said. The probability of a recession in the G7 economies - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US and UK - now stands at roughly 15% - nearly four times higher than usual. While UK growth is expected to remain relatively strong this year, Mr Gourinchas said unusually high inflation - faster than in Europe or the US - is expected to take a toll in 2023. ""If you were to look at both years together, it's actually not very far from where the other advanced economies are,"" he told the BBC. ""The one thing that worries me more about the UK economy is that their inflation numbers seem to be quite high. There is a fairly high pass through from high gas prices to broader prices in the economy. ""That would signal even further monetary policy tightening by the Bank of England and that would also weigh down on growth going forward."" The IMF now expects inflation to reach 6.6% in advanced economies and 9.5% in emerging market and developing economies - nearly a full percentage point higher than it expected in April. ""Inflation at current levels represents a clear risk for current and future macroeconomic stability and bringing it back to central bank targets should be the top priority for policymakers,"" Mr Gourinchas said. ""Tighter monetary policy will inevitably have real economic costs, but delaying it will only exacerbate the hardship."" The fallout from the war in Ukraine is being felt in pockets across the world. Soaring food and fuel prices and higher interest rates means the IMF sees more gloomy prospects for all major economies - but it's the UK that, Russia apart, remains bottom of the pile for 2023. Brexit may not have helped but it's our reliance on fossil fuels - they make up 75% of our energy mix, more than in the EU  - that's made us particularly vulnerable to this shock. Those prices are determined on international markets but affect us all. This report comes on the day that, with the energy price cap set to top Â£3,000 in October, a committee of MPs warns that further government help for households may be needed. But the IMF is among those economists who've noted that the UK faces more fundamental issues than the current crisis, with living standards having dropped behind many competitors over the last 15 years, something many attribute to a lack of investment in skills, equipment and infrastructure. Officials from the IMF have previously told me that one way to remedy that would be to raise, not lower taxes, to fund more investment. The US saw the steepest downgrade of any country for 2022. The IMF cut its growth forecast for the world's largest economy to 2.3% this year, from 3.7% previously, and to just 1% in 2023. Meanwhile growth in China is expected to fall to 3.3% this year, the slowest rate in nearly four decades, as the country wrestles with new Covid lockdowns and a property crisis. Questions about the reliability of Europe's natural gas supplies from Russia, as well as political unrest generated by high food and fuel prices, are among the risks the global economy is facing in the months ahead, the IMF said. ""We can be reasonably hopeful that China might be rebound,"" Mr Gourinchas said, adding that he was ""much more concerned about both the inflation path and the tightening of monetary policy leading to a slowdown going ahead"". It warned that in a ""plausible"" scenario, in which only some of those risks materialise, like a shutdown of Russian gas flows to Europe, global economic growth could fall to 2% next year - a pace the world has fallen below just five times since 1970.

"The ISS has orbited Earth since 1998 Russia says it will withdraw from the International Space Station (ISS) after 2024 and build its own station instead. The US and Russia, along with other partners, have successfully worked together on the ISS since 1998. But relations have soured since Russia invaded Ukraine, and Russia previously threatened to quit the project because of Western sanctions against it. Nasa said it had not yet received any official notice of Russia's intention to withdraw from the programme. The ISS - a joint project involving five space agencies - has been in orbit around Earth since 1998 and has been used to conduct thousands of scientific experiments. It is approved to operate until 2024, but the US wants to extend that for six more years with the agreement of all partners. At a meeting with Russia's President Vladimir Putin, Mr Borisov said Roskosmos would fulfil its obligations to its partners, but the decision had been taken to quit the project after 2024. ""I think that by this time we will start putting together a Russian orbital station,"" Mr Borisov said, adding that the new station was his agency's top priority. ""Good,"" replied Mr Putin. It is not immediately clear what the decision means for the future of the ISS, and the US space agency Nasa says it has not received any formal notice from Russia of its plans. Former ISS commander and retired US astronaut Dr Leroy Chiao believes it is unlikely Russia will decide to leave the project. ""I think this is posturing by the Russians. They don't have the money to build their own station and it would take several years to do it. They've got nothing else if they go this route,"" he told the BBC. The Russians have been making noises about withdrawal for some time but it's not clear how serious they are. They've talked about building their own outpost - the Russian Orbital Service Station - but it would require a financial commitment the Russian government has not shown to the country's existing space exploits. Certainly, Russian elements on the ISS are ageing but the view of engineers is that the modules can do a job through to 2030. If Russia does leave, there's no question it would be problematic. The station is designed in a way that makes the partners dependent on each other. The US side of the ISS provides the power; the Russian side provides the propulsion and keeps the platform from falling to Earth. If that propulsive capability is withdrawn, the US and its other partners - Europe, Japan and Canada - will need to devise other means of periodically boosting the station higher in the sky. It's something American robotic freighters could do. Cooperation on the ISS between Russia and the US had appeared relatively unharmed by the war in Ukraine, with the two countries signing an agreement earlier this month to allow Russian cosmonauts to travel to the station on US spacecraft and vice versa. ""We're all flyers. We learned to appreciate each other's perspectives,"" Dr Chaio said of his time commanding the space station from 2004-5. However, the war in Ukraine has hit other areas of cooperation between Russia and the West. The European Space Agency (ESA) ended its collaboration with Roskosmos to launch a rover to Mars, and Russia has stopped launches of its Soyuz spacecraft from an ESA launch site in French Guiana. Russian cosmonauts on the ISS recently displayed the flag of the self-declared Luhansk People's Republic Dr Chaio says in recent years Russia had politicised the space station, for example Russian cosmonauts have posed for photographs with the flags of pro-Russian separatist regions in east Ukraine. ""You can imagine how much trouble they would be in if they didn't do it,"" he told the BBC. The Soviet Union and Russia have a long history of space exploration, and accomplishments such as putting the first man in space in 1961 remain a source of national pride. In his meeting with Mr Putin, Roskosmos head Mr Borisov said the new Russian space station would provide Russia with space-based services needed for modern life, for example navigation and data transmission.

"The Tory leadership debate on TalkTV is cancelled after presenter Kate McCann faints and collapses live on air In a statement, Talk TV says McCann is fine but ""the medical advice was that we shouldn't continue with the debate"" Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak had been taking part in a second head-to-head debate, this time for The Sun and TalkTV, when a loud crash was heard in the studio Truss looked panicked and the broadcast was suspended Earlier both campaign teams were urged ""to be mindful of tone"" and have a debate that's ""respectful and dignified"" During Monday's BBC debate in Stoke-on-Trent, Sunak and Truss talked over each other and clashed on taxes, their Brexit records and the schools they went to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says both Tory leadership candidates ""are the architects of the mess this country is in"" Edited by Andrew Humphrey Well, that didn't quite play out as we thought it would... The second head-to-head debate between Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak was in full swing when the host Kate McCann fainted live on air. Thankfully she's OK, but unfortunately he debate was not able to resume following medical advice. It all played out while Truss was discussing how to keep the public on side in supporting Ukraine, given the war's role in exacerbating rising energy and food costs during a cost of living crisis. During her answer, there was a loud bang - which led to the foreign secretary shouting ""Oh my god!"", put her hands to her mouth and then leave the stage to check on the stricken host. After the unexpected interruption, both candidates spoke to the studio audience - who had been previously grilling them alongside McCann. Thanks for sticking with us during the unexpected twist that has brought this page to a close a little earlier than anticipated. The writers today have been Emily McGarvey, Marita Moloney, Malu Cursino, Jack Burgess, Aoife Walsh, Laura Gozzi, James FitzGerald and Adam Durbin, while the page has been edited by Claudia Allen, Jeremy Gahagan, Nathan Williams and Andrew Humphrey. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent First of all, thankfully weâre hearing everyone
involved in the debate is OK. From the head-to-head that we did witness, itâs obvious tax is still the key issue. Both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have fundamentally
different approaches when it comes to managing the economy. Sunak insists some tax rises will deal with inflation and pay
back debt; Truss believes tax cuts can stimulate the economy. And theyâre both willing to say their opponent is
âmorallyâ misguided on this issue. Those are pretty stern words for MPs to use
about party colleagues. Though tonightâs event seemed a bit better tempered than the
first debate, this contest has a long way to go. Sunak and Truss will start travelling the country
in the coming days for hustings with party members. No-oneâs voted yet, so this is a key period in the
contest. But the big question is how respectful can this competition
stay as they sling it out for votes? In the half hour before the debate went offline when presenter Kate McCann fainted, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss managed to touch upon some of the more contentious issues in this leadership contest, such as: The cost of living crisis  The NHS  Taxation Fellow TV presenters have complimented Kate McCann for how she was moderating the debate before she fainted. TalkTV host Tom Newton Dunn describes his colleague as ""one of the very best in the business at holding politicians to account"". She proved that in the first half hour of the debate, and she will prove that again. She is a fantastic talent and Iâm hugely proud of her.""  Sky's Kay Burley agrees, noting the TalkTV political editor was doing a ""senasational"" job in the 30 or so minutes she was in charge.  Iâm sure the candidates will return to continue the debate under her expert stewardship. Get some rest Kate x""  ITV's Paul Brand expresses sympathy to ""one of the smoothest operators in TV news"" over medical problems happening out of nowhere on air, pointing out he once ""suffered a wasp attack on live TV"" Very glad to hear sheâs OK and sheâll bounce back in no time.""

This video can not be played As we've been reporting, the TalkTV debate abruptly went off air after an incident in the studio. Here's the moment when Liz Truss was interrupted mid-sentence after a crash is heard. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent A spokesperson for News UK, which owns the Sun, has said ""there was a medical issue, hope to
be back on air soonâ. A well informed source has told the BBC the Tory debate crashed off air because presenter Kate McCann is understood to have fainted and collapsed.

She was presenting alone, after Harry Cole pulled out with Covid. We'll bring you more when we have it. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent Something appears to have happened during the Talk TV debate. There was a loud crash, Liz Truss looked very concerned and then the programme was taken off air. The production teamâs main concern will rightly be ensuring everyone is OK, so itâs not clear if this debate will resume. Well, we're not sure exactly what's going on the TalkTV studio right now - as the feed has come off air. In the moments beforehand, the two Tory leadership hopefuls were discussing the UK's support for Ukraine. They'd been asked a question about the potential rise in energy costs to British households, as a result of sanctions against Russia. Sunak admitted that standing up to Russia's President Putin required ""toughness"" which could mean that all of us go through ""difficult times"". Truss said ""the cost of not doing anything to stand up to Putin is immense"". Shortly afterwards she looked panicked as a crash was heard in the studio, and the broadcast feed was cut. A moment of disruption while Liz Truss answers a question about the UK's support for Ukraine amid the Russian invasion. It appears a podium has been knocked over, but we don't know for sure. Truss looks panicked as a loud crash is heard in the studio. The broadcast feed has gone off air for now. Stay tuned as we bring you updates. Rishi Sunak has said he thinks it's ""reasonable"" to ask the largest companies to pay a bit more tax to help pay our debts. Liz Truss replies saying she thinks Sunakâs policies are making the UK less competitive. She warns against raising corporation tax too high, saying that the exchequer will get less money coming in. Moving away from the NHS now, and a question from a member of the audience who raises the rising cost of living, specifically the increased cost of meat. She asks should her family go vegetarian? Liz Truss responds that the global food crisis has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and Britain needs to look at producing more food domestically by cutting red tape for farmers. The UK needs a resilient food supply not be solely dependent on ""countries we can't trust"", she says. Truss adds that inflation is also a global problem, reiterating that tax cuts are needed as national insurance rises have been ""morally wrong"". Rishi Sunak's answer focuses on reducing inflation, turning again to his economic policies. He says supermarkets and other parties in the supply chain must be held to account to ensure prices are kept fair for consumers. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent The first topic up for discussion is the NHS, prompting less of a fiery start than last nightâs debate. Theyâre getting to talk with fewer interruptions this evening. Rishi Sunak highlights the extra health funding heâs provided through a national insurance increase introduced in April when he was chancellor. He calls this a âbraveâ decision, proving his commitment to the NHS. Ms Truss insists sheâs committed to this extra funding, but promises to reverse the increase in tax. How would she fund it? She says it can be done via general taxation, and says Mr Sunak did not have to take more money from peopleâs pay cheques. Weâre talking about the NHS, but weâve come back to taxes â the key dividing point between these two candidates. Both candidates are asked how long they were on hold for the last time they tried to book a GPs appointment. Sunak doesn't say when the last time he asked for an appointment, but does say he is currently relying on the NHS to care for his grandfather and daughter, who have been in hospitals recently for treatment Truss says she got good service before the pandemic the last time she needed to call 111, adding  her daughter has recently needed treatment for a hand condition and received a good service. She also says that friends of hers have had to wait much longer more recently and that she recognises it is difficult at the moment. Â© 2025 BBC.

FT: England 4-0 Sweden Ian WrightFormer England striker on BBC One This is as proud as Iâve ever felt of any England side. FT: England 4-0 Sweden Englandâs Beth Mead scored her sixth goal at this
summerâs European Championships, becoming the countryâs top scorer in the
competitionâs history in the process, while no player has scored more goals in
a single edition of the competition than her (Inka Grings also six for Germany
in 2009). Alessia Russo has now
scored four goals at this summerâs European Championships, all coming as a
substitute. Indeed, no nation has scored more goals via subs than England (5)
at Euro 2022. How did you rate the players out of 10 as England beat Sweden in the Euro 2022 semi-finals at Bramall Lane? FT: England 4-0 Sweden The records keep coming... This the biggest ever semi-final victory in the history of the Womenâs European Championships. It is also Swedenâs heaviest ever defeat at the Womenâs
European Championships, while itâs just the second time they have conceded four
goals in the competition, doing so previously against Norway in a 4-3
semi-final defeat in February 1995. FT: England 4-0 Sweden Jonas EidevallArsenal manager on BBC One For English women's football this is a great moment. It's not only a month's work, this is years and years of years of work, investment, passion and commitment. You're bearing the fruits of it now. FT: England 4-0 Sweden And so, England have reached the final of the Womenâs European
Championships for the third time, doing so previously in 1984 and 2009. Indeed,
the Lionesses have ended a run of losing each of their last three semi-finals
at either the World Cup (2015 and 2019) and Euros (2017). They have now
beaten Sweden for a fourth time in all competitions (D8 L15), with three of

"The Tory leadership debate on TalkTV is cancelled after presenter Kate McCann faints and collapses live on air In a statement, Talk TV says McCann is fine but ""the medical advice was that we shouldn't continue with the debate"" Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak had been taking part in a second head-to-head debate, this time for The Sun and TalkTV, when a loud crash was heard in the studio Truss looked panicked and the broadcast was suspended Earlier both campaign teams were urged ""to be mindful of tone"" and have a debate that's ""respectful and dignified"" During Monday's BBC debate in Stoke-on-Trent, Sunak and Truss talked over each other and clashed on taxes, their Brexit records and the schools they went to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says both Tory leadership candidates ""are the architects of the mess this country is in"" Edited by Andrew Humphrey Well, that didn't quite play out as we thought it would... The second head-to-head debate between Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak was in full swing when the host Kate McCann fainted live on air. Thankfully she's OK, but unfortunately he debate was not able to resume following medical advice. It all played out while Truss was discussing how to keep the public on side in supporting Ukraine, given the war's role in exacerbating rising energy and food costs during a cost of living crisis. During her answer, there was a loud bang - which led to the foreign secretary shouting ""Oh my god!"", put her hands to her mouth and then leave the stage to check on the stricken host. After the unexpected interruption, both candidates spoke to the studio audience - who had been previously grilling them alongside McCann.

David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent First of all, thankfully weâre hearing everyone
involved in the debate is OK. From the head-to-head that we did witness, itâs obvious tax is still the key issue. Both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have fundamentally
different approaches when it comes to managing the economy. Sunak insists some tax rises will deal with inflation and pay
back debt; Truss believes tax cuts can stimulate the economy. And theyâre both willing to say their opponent is
âmorallyâ misguided on this issue. Those are pretty stern words for MPs to use
about party colleagues. Though tonightâs event seemed a bit better tempered than the
first debate, this contest has a long way to go. Sunak and Truss will start travelling the country
in the coming days for hustings with party members. No-oneâs voted yet, so this is a key period in the
contest. But the big question is how respectful can this competition
stay as they sling it out for votes? In the half hour before the debate went offline when presenter Kate McCann fainted, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss managed to touch upon some of the more contentious issues in this leadership contest, such as: The cost of living crisis  The NHS  Taxation Fellow TV presenters have complimented Kate McCann for how she was moderating the debate before she fainted.

This video can not be played As we've been reporting, the TalkTV debate abruptly went off air after an incident in the studio. Here's the moment when Liz Truss was interrupted mid-sentence after a crash is heard. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent A spokesperson for News UK, which owns the Sun, has said ""there was a medical issue, hope to
be back on air soonâ. A well informed source has told the BBC the Tory debate crashed off air because presenter Kate McCann is understood to have fainted and collapsed.

She was presenting alone, after Harry Cole pulled out with Covid. We'll bring you more when we have it. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent Something appears to have happened during the Talk TV debate. There was a loud crash, Liz Truss looked very concerned and then the programme was taken off air. The production teamâs main concern will rightly be ensuring everyone is OK, so itâs not clear if this debate will resume. Well, we're not sure exactly what's going on the TalkTV studio right now - as the feed has come off air. In the moments beforehand, the two Tory leadership hopefuls were discussing the UK's support for Ukraine. They'd been asked a question about the potential rise in energy costs to British households, as a result of sanctions against Russia. Sunak admitted that standing up to Russia's President Putin required ""toughness"" which could mean that all of us go through ""difficult times"". Truss said ""the cost of not doing anything to stand up to Putin is immense"". Shortly afterwards she looked panicked as a crash was heard in the studio, and the broadcast feed was cut. A moment of disruption while Liz Truss answers a question about the UK's support for Ukraine amid the Russian invasion. It appears a podium has been knocked over, but we don't know for sure. Truss looks panicked as a loud crash is heard in the studio. The broadcast feed has gone off air for now. Stay tuned as we bring you updates. Rishi Sunak has said he thinks it's ""reasonable"" to ask the largest companies to pay a bit more tax to help pay our debts. Liz Truss replies saying she thinks Sunakâs policies are making the UK less competitive. She warns against raising corporation tax too high, saying that the exchequer will get less money coming in. Moving away from the NHS now, and a question from a member of the audience who raises the rising cost of living, specifically the increased cost of meat. She asks should her family go vegetarian? Liz Truss responds that the global food crisis has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and Britain needs to look at producing more food domestically by cutting red tape for farmers. The UK needs a resilient food supply not be solely dependent on ""countries we can't trust"", she says. Truss adds that inflation is also a global problem, reiterating that tax cuts are needed as national insurance rises have been ""morally wrong"". Rishi Sunak's answer focuses on reducing inflation, turning again to his economic policies. He says supermarkets and other parties in the supply chain must be held to account to ensure prices are kept fair for consumers. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent The first topic up for discussion is the NHS, prompting less of a fiery start than last nightâs debate. Theyâre getting to talk with fewer interruptions this evening. Rishi Sunak highlights the extra health funding heâs provided through a national insurance increase introduced in April when he was chancellor. He calls this a âbraveâ decision, proving his commitment to the NHS. Ms Truss insists sheâs committed to this extra funding, but promises to reverse the increase in tax. How would she fund it? She says it can be done via general taxation, and says Mr Sunak did not have to take more money from peopleâs pay cheques.

A moment of disruption while Liz Truss answers a question about the UK's support for Ukraine amid the Russian invasion. It appears a podium has been knocked over, but we don't know for sure. Truss looks panicked as a loud crash is heard in the studio. The broadcast feed has gone off air for now. Stay tuned as we bring you updates. Rishi Sunak has said he thinks it's ""reasonable"" to ask the largest companies to pay a bit more tax to help pay our debts. Liz Truss replies saying she thinks Sunakâs policies are making the UK less competitive. She warns against raising corporation tax too high, saying that the exchequer will get less money coming in. Moving away from the NHS now, and a question from a member of the audience who raises the rising cost of living, specifically the increased cost of meat. She asks should her family go vegetarian? Liz Truss responds that the global food crisis has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and Britain needs to look at producing more food domestically by cutting red tape for farmers. The UK needs a resilient food supply not be solely dependent on ""countries we can't trust"", she says. Truss adds that inflation is also a global problem, reiterating that tax cuts are needed as national insurance rises have been ""morally wrong"". Rishi Sunak's answer focuses on reducing inflation, turning again to his economic policies. He says supermarkets and other parties in the supply chain must be held to account to ensure prices are kept fair for consumers. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent The first topic up for discussion is the NHS, prompting less of a fiery start than last nightâs debate. Theyâre getting to talk with fewer interruptions this evening. Rishi Sunak highlights the extra health funding heâs provided through a national insurance increase introduced in April when he was chancellor. He calls this a âbraveâ decision, proving his commitment to the NHS. Ms Truss insists sheâs committed to this extra funding, but promises to reverse the increase in tax. How would she fund it? She says it can be done via general taxation, and says Mr Sunak did not have to take more money from peopleâs pay cheques. Weâre talking about the NHS, but weâve come back to taxes â the key dividing point between these two candidates. Both candidates are asked how long they were on hold for the last time they tried to book a GPs appointment. Sunak doesn't say when the last time he asked for an appointment, but does say he is currently relying on the NHS to care for his grandfather and daughter, who have been in hospitals recently for treatment Truss says she got good service before the pandemic the last time she needed to call 111, adding  her daughter has recently needed treatment for a hand condition and received a good service. She also says that friends of hers have had to wait much longer more recently and that she recognises it is difficult at the moment. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Alexander Lebedev in Moscow in 2019 Boris Johnson has said he did not discuss government business at a meeting with ex-KGB officer Alexander Lebedev ""as far as I am aware"". The prime minister is facing questions about why no officials were present to take notes at the 2018 meeting with the Russian oligarch. The PM - who was foreign secretary at the time - says it was a private social event that had not been pre-arranged. Labour said his ""mealy-mouthed statement"" raised more questions. The Soviet KGB was the main Cold War rival of Western security services and President Vladimir Putin - along with some of his closest comrades - worked for the agency. Mr Lebedev's son Evgeny Lebedev, the owner of the London Evening Standard and a shareholder in The Independent, was given a seat in the House of Lords by Mr Johnson in 2020. Boris Johnson met Russian oligarch without aides PM was warned of Lebedev concerns, says Cummings Iâm not a UK security risk, Russian-born peer says The appointment has been shrouded in controversy after The Sunday Times newspaper alleged security services withdrew an assessment that the peerage posed a national security risk after the prime minister intervened. Mr Johnson has previously denied this and Lord Lebedev has rejected the suggestion he posed a ""security risk"" to the UK. In an article,external, he acknowledged his father ""was a foreign intelligence agent of the KGB"", but insisted he was not ""some agent of Russia"" and condemned its invasion of Ukraine. Labour raised concerns about Lord Lebedev's appointment. Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee demanded documents about the process of giving him a seat in the Lords. But ministers withheld information from Parliament citing national security - despite MPs voting for it to be released. As London mayor Boris Johnson (L) socialised with Evgeny Lebedev (2009 pic) Meanwhile, Mr Johnson has been under mounting pressure to explain the nature of his meeting with Mr Lebedev's father Alexander in April 2018, at the oligarch's Italian home. Mr Johnson has been criticised for not having security officers with him on the trip, which took place after a Nato summit at which Russia was on the agenda. Weeks earlier a former Russian military officer and his daughter were poisoned in the English city of Salisbury, in an attack the UK blamed on the Kremlin. The prime minister confirmed the meeting with Mr Lebedev, who bought the Evening Standard with his son in 2009 but later stepped down from the company, at the Commons Liaison Committee earlier this month. Mr Johnson was asked to provide further written answers on a number of questions after the appearance in front of senior MPs. In a letter, Mr Johnson said he declared the overnight stay at Mr Lebedev's house ""in the interests of transparency"" and insisted the trip was ""in line with established security protocols"". ""It would not have been normal practice for civil servants or security staff to have accompanied me to such a private, social occasion,"" he wrote. He also noted he took no ministerial papers with him, adding: ""As far as I am aware, no government business was discussed."" Labour said the prime minister's letter raised ""more questions than it answers"" because ""he apparently still can't recall whether he discussed government business or not"" and it suggested the PM ""has something to hide"". The party's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""Keeping the British people safe should be a priority of government, but this web of murky relationships shows the Conservatives cannot be trusted with our national security.""

"The Tory leadership debate on TalkTV is cancelled after presenter Kate McCann faints and collapses live on air In a statement, Talk TV says McCann is fine but ""the medical advice was that we shouldn't continue with the debate"" Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak had been taking part in a second head-to-head debate, this time for The Sun and TalkTV, when a loud crash was heard in the studio Truss looked panicked and the broadcast was suspended Earlier both campaign teams were urged ""to be mindful of tone"" and have a debate that's ""respectful and dignified"" During Monday's BBC debate in Stoke-on-Trent, Sunak and Truss talked over each other and clashed on taxes, their Brexit records and the schools they went to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says both Tory leadership candidates ""are the architects of the mess this country is in"" Edited by Andrew Humphrey Well, that didn't quite play out as we thought it would... The second head-to-head debate between Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak was in full swing when the host Kate McCann fainted live on air. Thankfully she's OK, but unfortunately he debate was not able to resume following medical advice. It all played out while Truss was discussing how to keep the public on side in supporting Ukraine, given the war's role in exacerbating rising energy and food costs during a cost of living crisis. During her answer, there was a loud bang - which led to the foreign secretary shouting ""Oh my god!"", put her hands to her mouth and then leave the stage to check on the stricken host. After the unexpected interruption, both candidates spoke to the studio audience - who had been previously grilling them alongside McCann. Thanks for sticking with us during the unexpected twist that has brought this page to a close a little earlier than anticipated. The writers today have been Emily McGarvey, Marita Moloney, Malu Cursino, Jack Burgess, Aoife Walsh, Laura Gozzi, James FitzGerald and Adam Durbin, while the page has been edited by Claudia Allen, Jeremy Gahagan, Nathan Williams and Andrew Humphrey. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent First of all, thankfully weâre hearing everyone
involved in the debate is OK. From the head-to-head that we did witness, itâs obvious tax is still the key issue. Both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have fundamentally
different approaches when it comes to managing the economy. Sunak insists some tax rises will deal with inflation and pay
back debt; Truss believes tax cuts can stimulate the economy. And theyâre both willing to say their opponent is
âmorallyâ misguided on this issue. Those are pretty stern words for MPs to use
about party colleagues. Though tonightâs event seemed a bit better tempered than the
first debate, this contest has a long way to go. Sunak and Truss will start travelling the country
in the coming days for hustings with party members. No-oneâs voted yet, so this is a key period in the
contest. But the big question is how respectful can this competition
stay as they sling it out for votes? In the half hour before the debate went offline when presenter Kate McCann fainted, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss managed to touch upon some of the more contentious issues in this leadership contest, such as: The cost of living crisis  The NHS  Taxation Fellow TV presenters have complimented Kate McCann for how she was moderating the debate before she fainted. TalkTV host Tom Newton Dunn describes his colleague as ""one of the very best in the business at holding politicians to account"". She proved that in the first half hour of the debate, and she will prove that again. She is a fantastic talent and Iâm hugely proud of her.""  Sky's Kay Burley agrees, noting the TalkTV political editor was doing a ""senasational"" job in the 30 or so minutes she was in charge.  Iâm sure the candidates will return to continue the debate under her expert stewardship. Get some rest Kate x""  ITV's Paul Brand expresses sympathy to ""one of the smoothest operators in TV news"" over medical problems happening out of nowhere on air, pointing out he once ""suffered a wasp attack on live TV"" Very glad to hear sheâs OK and sheâll bounce back in no time.""

This video can not be played As we've been reporting, the TalkTV debate abruptly went off air after an incident in the studio. Here's the moment when Liz Truss was interrupted mid-sentence after a crash is heard. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent A spokesperson for News UK, which owns the Sun, has said ""there was a medical issue, hope to
be back on air soonâ. A well informed source has told the BBC the Tory debate crashed off air because presenter Kate McCann is understood to have fainted and collapsed.

She was presenting alone, after Harry Cole pulled out with Covid. We'll bring you more when we have it. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent Something appears to have happened during the Talk TV debate. There was a loud crash, Liz Truss looked very concerned and then the programme was taken off air. The production teamâs main concern will rightly be ensuring everyone is OK, so itâs not clear if this debate will resume. Well, we're not sure exactly what's going on the TalkTV studio right now - as the feed has come off air. In the moments beforehand, the two Tory leadership hopefuls were discussing the UK's support for Ukraine. They'd been asked a question about the potential rise in energy costs to British households, as a result of sanctions against Russia. Sunak admitted that standing up to Russia's President Putin required ""toughness"" which could mean that all of us go through ""difficult times"". Truss said ""the cost of not doing anything to stand up to Putin is immense"". Shortly afterwards she looked panicked as a crash was heard in the studio, and the broadcast feed was cut.

"Nineteen months after he first entered Downing Street as PM, Rishi Sunak faces the fight of his political life to hang on to the job. Four Conservative prime ministers had already come and gone when, at the age of 42, just seven years an MP, he was tasked with keeping the Tory show on the road. The MPs who put him there hoped he would steady the ship after turbulent times under Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, before mounting a comeback for the party trailing a long way behind Labour in the opinion polls. So farthat comeback has yet to materialise. With a general election having to be called by January 2025, the assumption was that Mr Sunak would play it long and go to the country in the autumn, in the hope his political fortunes would eventually pick up. His surprise calling of an election on 4 July has left some some Conservative MPs scratching their heads but his allies insist it was a smart move. The youngest occupant of No 10 in modern times, Mr Sunak is also the first British-Indian to be prime minister. A son of first generation immigrants, who worked hard to send him to one of the country's top fee-paying schools, Winchester College, where he was head boy. He spent time in California and worked at investment bank Goldman Sachs - and two multibillion dollar hedge funds - before entering politics. Akshata Murty: Who is Rishi Sunak's wife? A self-confessed ""huge Star Wars fan"" with a sizeable collection of lightsabers, he is sometimes portrayed as a ""geek"". He generally swears off alcohol in favour of Mexican Coca-Cola, which, he says, is made with ""cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup"". Colleagues describe him as a details man, who is always the best-briefed person in any meeting. He became prime minister in extraordinary circumstances after his predecessor Liz Truss - whom he lost to in a leadership contest after the collapse of Boris Johnson's premiership - quitafter just 45 days in the job. Age:44 Place of birth:Southampton, Hampshire Home:London and Yorkshire Education:Winchester College, Oxford University, Stanford University Family:Married to businesswoman Akshata Murty with two daughters Parliamentary constituency:Richmond (Yorkshire) This video can not be played Watch: Rishi Sunak says that when it comes to helping the most vulnerable ""that's what I did"". Mr Sunak's parents came to the UK from east Africa and are both of Indian origin. He was born in Southampton in 1980, where his father was a GP, and his mother ran her own pharmacy. ""In terms of cultural upbringing, I'd be at the temple at the weekend - I'm a Hindu - but I'd also be at [Southampton Football Club] the Saints game as well on a Saturday - you do everything, you do both."" In the interview he said he had been fortunate not to have endured a lot of racism growing up, but that there was one incident that had stayed with him. ""I was just out with my younger brother and younger sister, and I think, probably pretty young, I was probably a mid-teenager, and we were out at a fast food restaurant and I was just looking after them. There were people sitting nearby, it was the first time I'd experienced it, just saying some very unpleasant things. The 'P' word. ""And it stung. I still remember it. It seared in my memory. You can be insulted in many different ways."" However, he said he ""can't conceive of that happening today"" in the UK. He attended Winchester College and worked as a waiter at a Southampton curry house during his summer holidays. After finishing school he went on to Oxford to study philosophy, politics and economics, before studying for an MBA at Stanford University in California. There he met his wife, and the couple have two daughters. His rise to the top of British politics has been rapid - he only became an MP in 2015, in the rock solid Conservative seat of Richmond, in North Yorkshire. His political opponents have made much of his personal wealth, claiming he is out touch with the lives of most voters. Together, he and hiswife Akshata Murty- daughter of Indian billionaire Narayana Murthy, who co-founder of IT services giant Infosys - havean estimated worth of more than Â£650m. In 2022, Ms Murty announced she wouldstart paying UK tax on her incometo relieve political pressure on her husband. He was arguing for Britain's departure from the EU from his earliest days in politics and supported the Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum. But he first came to wider public attention during the coronavirus pandemic, when as the recently-appointed chancellor he spent eye-watering sums on the furlough scheme and other support measures, as well as launching the controversial Eat Out to Help Out scheme. His personal popularity soared but he also got caught up in the Partygate controversies that rocked Downing Street, being fined, in June 2020, for attending one of the now infamous gatherings. And he found himself increasingly at odds with his boss Boris Johnson over the economy - pushing for lower taxes and spending cuts. In July 2022, he resigned from the cabinet, a move that was instrumental in ousting Mr Johnson, which some of the former PM's allies have not forgotten. He was not elected leader by Conservative Party members. He was, in effect, crowned by Tory grandees desperate for some stability after the chaos presided over by Liz Truss and latterly by Boris Johnson. He inherited a financial crisis and a party in disarray but also a near 70-seat majority - which has since been significantly eroded by a series of by-election defeats featuring big swings against his party. At the start of 2023, Mr Sunak set out five promises to voters, he wanted to be judged by: Halving inflation Growing the economy Reducing debt Cutting NHS waiting times Stopping small boat crossings Progress on thesehas been slow. The overall number of patients waiting for treatment on the NHS is higher than when Mr Sunak came to office, but inflation has dropped sharply in recent months. The headline rate for the year to April was 2.3%, hailed by the prime minister as a ""major moment"" - and a clear sign that his economic plan is working. On small boats, the government passed legislation allowing it to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda - but this was declared unlawful by the Supreme Court. The government responded by signing a new treaty with Rwanda, declaring it a safe country. This became law in April and the prime minister argues it will deter migrants from crossing the English Channel in small boats. Critics have dismissed it as a hugely expensive gimmick. Mr Sunakhas now said no asylum seekers will be flown to Rwanda before the election - and will go there only if he is re-elected. He has delayed a ban on new petrol and diesel cars in a major change to the government's approach to achieving net zero by 2050. seeking to portray himself as the friend of the motorist and voters who are unhappy about the personal sacrifices required to reach the net zero target. He also scaled back the HS2 high speed rail link. Mr Sunak has pledged to create a ""smoke-free generation"" by phasing out the sale of tobacco products. The billcould fall by the wayside with Parliament shutting down on Fridaybut it is likely to be in the Conservative manifesto. The prime minister's personal ratings have suffered as series of resets has not had the desired effect on Tory fortunes, but he insists he can defy the odds and retain the keys to Downing Street on 4 July.

"This video can not be played Watch: Tory leader debate disrupted after crash is heard The latest Tory leadership debate between Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss has been cancelled after the presenter fainted on air. The Sun and TalkTV debate, hosted by journalist Kate McCann, abruptly halted around halfway through after a loud crash was heard. TalkTV said McCann was ""fine"" but the channel had been given medical advice not to continue. ""We apologise to our viewers and listeners,"" the channel added. The leadership candidates tweeted that they were relieved to hear McCann was fine, and indicated they would be happy to stage a rematch. The TalkTV presenter had been due to co-host the debate alongside the Sun's political editor Harry Cole, but he pulled out after testing positive for Covid. Rishi Sunak: Former chancellor bidding for top job Liz Truss: Fast-track career of foreign secretary Before it was halted, the latest televised debate between the two candidates had been covering tax, the state of the NHS and rising living costs. They had been about to begin a section on the UK's support for Ukraine when the debate went off air. TalkTV said Kate McCann was fine but medical advice was not to continue with the debate The candidates displayed a more conciliatory tone, in contrast to thefierce clashesthat had marked Monday's debate on BBC One. Ms Truss repeated her charge that the former chancellor had been ""morally wrong"" to put up National Insurance. She added that economic growth was ""anaemic"" and his plan to raise corporation tax next year would tip the UK economy into recession. But Mr Sunak responded that the NI hike had been a ""brave decision"" to raise money for the NHS, and it was ""entirely reasonable"" to ask bigger companies to pay more to repair the public finances in the wake of the Covid pandemic. In a pointed rejoinder, he said: ""What's morally wrong is asking our children and grandchildren to pick up the tab for the bills that we are not prepared to meet."" There had been a much calmer tone to this debate, without quite as much of the spikiness seen in previous clashes. Mr Sunak, in particular, seemed less on the attack than in the BBC debate, where he was accused by some of ""mansplaining"". When offered the chance to ask Rishi Sunak a question, Liz Truss noticeably swerved going for a personal blow, instead asking about the cost of living. Mr Sunak used his question to mark the fact that it was Ms Truss's birthday; a very different tone to when they were given the same opportunity on ITV a couple of weeks earlier. The differences on the economy and taxation were still clear though, with both labelling the other's strategy ""morally wrong"". Questions from Sun readers also took the debate further into policy areas they hadn't debated as much before, such as the NHS and fracking. A lot more of the policy, and less of the personal. Ms Truss said putting up National Insurance was not needed to give the NHS money to help clear Covid backlogs, which she said could be funded through ""general taxation"". Asked how she would improve NHS services, the foreign secretary said she would cut down on layers of management and give NHS leaders ""more power locally"". Mr Sunak also set out his plan for healthcare, which involved increasing the number of ""community hubs"" for treatment and diagnosis. Both candidates also said they would supportfracking for energydomestically if local communities supported it. The contenders were challenged about what they would do to improve cancer treatment by an audience member with the disease who said he had been forced to receive help from a cancer charity. John Hughes, in Birmingham, asked the candidates: ""Why is the NHS broken?"" After Mr Sunak said he was glad he was getting ""the support that you need,"" Mr Hughes replied: ""I'm not getting that, Mr Sunak."" And while Ms Truss said she would give local leaders more power, Mr Hughes said the Conservatives had ""had the chance already, and its still not enough for the NHS"". Mr Sunak, who resigned as Boris Johnson's chancellor as part of the cabinet mutiny against him earlier this month, had qualified for the final round of the leadership contest with the most votes from Tory MPs.  But opinion polls have suggested Ms Truss is thecurrent favouriteof the 160,000 or so Tory party members who will actually pick the eventual winner. Members will be able to vote by post or online form early August until 2 September, with a result announced three days later.

"Liz Truss has resigned as prime minister after a chaotic 45 days in Downing Street. But where did she come from and what makes her tick? A Remain supporter who became the darling of the Brexit-backing Conservative right wing. A former Liberal Democrat activist, who marched against Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, but claimed to be the keeper of the Thatcherite flame. It is fair to say that Mary Elizabeth Truss has been on a political journey. She was not a household name, like her predecessor Boris Johnson, when she became PM. But she leaves having made history; serving the shortest tenure of any UK prime minister. During the leadership election this summer, her promise to return to fundamental Conservative values - cutting taxes and shrinking the state - proved to be exactly what party members, who got the final say over who took over from Mr Johnson, wanted to hear. And, crucially, as foreign secretary she had remained loyal to Mr Johnson until the bitter end, as other ministers deserted him. It won her favour with Johnson loyalists. Grassroots Tory supporters of Liz Truss saw in her the steadfast, tenacious and determined qualities they admired in Margaret Thatcher - an image Ms Truss herself has tried to cultivate. But despite her shifting political positions and allegiances over the years, these words also come up frequently when friends and family are asked to describe her character - along with ""ambitious"". Age:47 Place of birth:Oxford Home:London and Norfolk Education:Roundhay School in Leeds, Oxford University Family:Married to accountant Hugh O'Leary with two teenage daughters Parliamentary constituency:South West Norfolk ""She's a very opinionated person in terms of what she wants,"" said her brother Francis in 2017, when recalling his older sister's teenage dalliance with vegetarianism. ""When you go to a restaurant, you might be 14 but she was precocious about what she wants, what she didn't want."" When the family played Cluedo or Monopoly, ""she was someone who had to win,"" added Francis ina BBC Radio 4 profile of Truss. ""She would create some special system to work out how she could win."" Maurizio Giuliano, a university contemporary who first met her at a Liberal Democrat event, says she stood out from the other students. ""I remember her being very well-dressed compared to other 18 to 19-year-olds. She also had the demeanour of a real adult compared to what we were at that age. ""She was forceful and opinionated and she had very strong views."" Serious political debate was the order of the day in the Truss household, according to Francis, the youngest of her three younger brothers. ""You didn't sit around talking about the latest Megadrive game at the dinner table, it was much more issues, political campaigns etc,"" he told Radio 4's Profile programme. It must have felt inevitable that she would get involved in politics in some capacity when she grew up, but no-one in her family would have predicted the path she eventually took. Born in Oxford in 1975, Ms Truss has described her father, a mathematics professor, and her mother, a nurse, as ""left-wing"". As a young girl, her mother took her on marches for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, an organisation vehemently opposed to the Thatcher government's decision to allow US nuclear warheads to be installed at RAF Greenham Common, west of London. Though she is now proudly a Conservative from Leeds, back then she was a Scottish liberal. The family moved to Paisley, just west of Glasgow, when Ms Truss was four-years-old. In a BBC interview, she recalled shouting ""Maggie, Maggie, Maggie - oot, oot, oot,"" in a Scottish accent, as she took part in marches. The Truss family campaigned for nuclear disarmament The Truss family later decamped to Leeds, where she attended Roundhay, a state secondary school. She has described seeing ""children who failed and were let down by low expectations"" during her time there. Some of Ms Truss's contemporaries at Roundhay have disputed her account of the school, includingGuardian journalist Martin Pengelly,external, who wrote: ""Perhaps she is selectively deploying her upbringing, and casually traducing the school and teachers who nurtured her, for simple political gain."" One Roundhay school mate, who did not want to be named, told the BBC:  ""It was a really good school, really supportive teachers. Quite a lot of us have gone on to good universities and good careers."" Although not part of her friendship group, he has clear memories of the young Truss. ""She was quite studious, serious,"" he says, with a ""heavy social conscience"" and part of a group that were into environmentalism. ""I remember a school trip to Sellafield and her asking difficult questions and giving them a grilling. I remember that quite distinctly."" At Oxford University, Ms Truss read philosophy, politics and economics. Friends recall a well-liked, if frenetic student. The teenage Truss caused a stir at the Lib Dem conference with her anti-monarchy stance ""I remember her determination which was very impressive for me,"" says Jamshid Derakhshan, who was studying for a postgrad degree in mathematics when Truss was an undergraduate. ""She was very quick with everything. Going around the college quickly, being everywhere."" As to what sort of prime minister his old friend will make, Dr Derakhshan says: ""My feeling is she's not going to be stuck with one particular idea, she's very flexible in her mind and what will be best for the time."" Ms Truss was involved in many campaigns and causes at Oxford but devoted much of her time to politics, becoming president of the university's Liberal Democrats. At the party's 1994 conference, she spoke in favour of abolishing the monarchy, telling delegates in Brighton: ""We Liberal Democrats believe in opportunity for all. We do not believe people are born to rule."" She also campaigned for the decriminalisation of cannabis. ""Liz had a very strong radical liberal streak to her,"" said fellow Lib Dem student Alan Renwick in 2017. ""We were setting up the Freshers Fair stall, Liz was there with a pile of posters, saying 'Free the Weed' and she just wanted the whole stall to be covered with these posters. ""I was scurrying around after Liz trying to take these down and put up a variety of messages, rather than just this one message all over the stall."" Her Instagram posts have seen a transformation, from candid shots posing with rhubarb... to striding out of high-level meetings flanked by assistants Her conversion to conservatism, towards the end of her time at Oxford is said to have shocked her left-leaning parents, but for Mark Littlewood, a fellow Oxford Lib Dem, it was a natural progression. ""She's been a market liberal all of her adult life,"" according to Mr Littlewood, who is now director general of the libertarian, free market think-tank, the Institute of Economic Affairs. ""Her political career reflects her ideology - she has always been highly sceptical of big government and privileged institutions who think they know best,"" Mr Littlewood said. She clearly changed parties, but that ""was a judgement about what's the best and most likely vehicle for her to succeed in politics and get what she wants to get done,"" Mr Littlewood said. Nevertheless, what she has described as her ""dubious past"" came back to haunt her as she tried to convince Tory members she was truly one of them. At a leadership hustings in Eastbourne, some in the audience jeered, as she told them: ""We all make mistakes, we all had teenage misadventures, and that was mine. ""Some people have sex, drugs and rock and roll, I was in the Liberal Democrats. I'm sorry."" She had become a Conservative because she had met like-minded people who shared her commitment to ""personal freedom, the ability to shape your own life and shape your own destiny,"" she explained. After graduating from Oxford she worked as an accountant for Shell, and Cable & Wireless, and married fellow accountant Hugh O'Leary in 2000. The couple have two children. Ms Truss stood as the Tory candidate for Hemsworth, West Yorkshire, in the 2001 general election, but lost. She suffered another defeat in Calder Valley, also in West Yorkshire, in 2005. But, her political ambitions undimmed, she was elected as a councillor in Greenwich, south-east London, in 2006, and from 2008 also worked for the right-of-centre Reform think tank. Liz Truss became an MP in 2010 Conservative leader David Cameron put Ms Truss on his ""A-list"" of priority candidates for the 2010 election and she was selected to stand for the safe seat of South West Norfolk. But she quickly faced a battle against de-selection by the constituency Tory association, after it was revealed she had had an affair with Tory MP Mark Field some years earlier. The effort to oust her failed and Ms Truss went on to win the seat by more than 13,000 votes. She co-authored a book, Britannia Unchained, with four other Conservative MPs elected in 2010, which recommended stripping back state regulation to boost the UK's position in the world, marking her out as a prominent advocate of free market policies on the Tory benches. During a BBC leadership debate, she was challenged about a comment in Britannia Unchained, describing British workers as ""among the worst idlers in the world"". She insisted she had not written it. In 2012, just over two years after becoming an MP, she entered government as an education minister and in 2014 was promoted to environment secretary. At the 2014 Conservative conference, she made a speech in which she said, in an impassioned voice:""We import two-thirds of our cheese.That. Is. A. Disgrace."" The speech was little noticed at the time, but it has taken on a life of its own on social media, attracting much mockery and becoming widely shared. Two years later came arguably the biggest political event in a generation - the EU referendum. Ms Truss campaigned for Remain,writing in the Sun newspaper,externalthat Brexit would be ""a triple tragedy - more rules, more forms and more delays when selling to the EU"". However, after her side lost, she changed her mind, arguing that Brexit provided an opportunity to ""shake up the way things work"". Becoming the first female Lord Chancellor and justice secretary in 2016 Under Theresa May's premiership, she became the first female Lord Chancellor and justice secretary, but she had several high-profile clashes with the judiciary. Her initial failure to defend judges after they werebranded ""enemies of the people"" by the Daily Mail,external, when they ruled Parliament had to be given a vote on triggering Brexit, upset the legal establishment. She later issued a statement supporting the judges, but she was criticised by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd as ""completely and absolutely wrong"" for not speaking out sooner. After 11 months as justice secretary, she was demoted to chief secretary to the Treasury. When Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019, Ms Truss was moved to international trade secretary - a job which meant meeting global political and business leaders to promote UK PLC. Liz Truss held a frosty joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in the weeks before the invasion of Ukraine In 2021, aged 46, she moved to one of the most senior jobs in government, taking over from Dominic Raab as foreign secretary. In this role she has sought to solve the knotty problem of the Northern Ireland Protocol, by scrapping parts of a post-Brexit EU-UK deal - a move the EU fiercely criticised. She secured the release of two British-Iranian nationals who had both been arrested and detained in Iran. And when Russia invaded Ukraine in February she took a hard line, insisting all of Vladimir Putin's forces should be driven from the country. But shefaced criticismfor backing people from the UK who wanted to fight in Ukraine. Her decision to pose for photographs in a tank while visiting British troops in Estonia, was seen as an attempt to emulate Margaret Thatcher, who had famously been pictured aboard a Challenger tank in 1986. It also fuelled speculation that she was on leadership manoeuvres. Claims she was deliberately trying to channel Thatcher grew even louder when she posed for a photograph in a white pussy bow collar of the kind favoured by the Iron Lady. But she has always dismissed such criticism, telling GB News: ""It is quite frustrating that female politicians always get compared to Margaret Thatcher while male politicians don't get compared to Ted Heath."" Liz Truss posed for official shots in a tank whilst visiting British troops in Estonia last year Ms Truss's campaign for the party leadership was not free of controversy. Pressed on how she would tackle the cost-of-living crisis, she said she would focus her efforts on ""lowering the tax burden, not giving out handouts"". She has been forced to scrap a plan to link public sector pay to regional living costs by a backlash from senior Tories who said it would mean lower pay for millions of workers outside London. And she called Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon an ""attention seeker"", adding it was best to ""ignore her"". She also got intoa spat with French President Emmanuel Macron, who accused her of ""playing to the gallery"" at a leadership hustings. Asked if Mr Macron was a ""friend or foe"", she had said the jury was still out. But it was domestic issues, or rather one domestic issue, that dominated the sometimes fractious leadership contest with Rishi Sunak. Ms Truss's response to the cost-of-living crisis was always likely to define her premiership. And ultimately her time in Downing Street began to rapidly unravel following her disastrous ""mini-budget"". Liz Truss now becomes the shortest-serving prime minister in UK history.

"This video can not be played Watch: Tory leader debate disrupted after crash is heard The latest Tory leadership debate between Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss has been cancelled after the presenter fainted on air. The Sun and TalkTV debate, hosted by journalist Kate McCann, abruptly halted around halfway through after a loud crash was heard. TalkTV said McCann was ""fine"" but the channel had been given medical advice not to continue. ""We apologise to our viewers and listeners,"" the channel added. The leadership candidates tweeted that they were relieved to hear McCann was fine, and indicated they would be happy to stage a rematch. The TalkTV presenter had been due to co-host the debate alongside the Sun's political editor Harry Cole, but he pulled out after testing positive for Covid. Rishi Sunak: Former chancellor bidding for top job Liz Truss: Fast-track career of foreign secretary Before it was halted, the latest televised debate between the two candidates had been covering tax, the state of the NHS and rising living costs. They had been about to begin a section on the UK's support for Ukraine when the debate went off air. TalkTV said Kate McCann was fine but medical advice was not to continue with the debate The candidates displayed a more conciliatory tone, in contrast to thefierce clashesthat had marked Monday's debate on BBC One. Ms Truss repeated her charge that the former chancellor had been ""morally wrong"" to put up National Insurance. She added that economic growth was ""anaemic"" and his plan to raise corporation tax next year would tip the UK economy into recession. But Mr Sunak responded that the NI hike had been a ""brave decision"" to raise money for the NHS, and it was ""entirely reasonable"" to ask bigger companies to pay more to repair the public finances in the wake of the Covid pandemic. In a pointed rejoinder, he said: ""What's morally wrong is asking our children and grandchildren to pick up the tab for the bills that we are not prepared to meet."" There had been a much calmer tone to this debate, without quite as much of the spikiness seen in previous clashes. Mr Sunak, in particular, seemed less on the attack than in the BBC debate, where he was accused by some of ""mansplaining"". When offered the chance to ask Rishi Sunak a question, Liz Truss noticeably swerved going for a personal blow, instead asking about the cost of living. Mr Sunak used his question to mark the fact that it was Ms Truss's birthday; a very different tone to when they were given the same opportunity on ITV a couple of weeks earlier. The differences on the economy and taxation were still clear though, with both labelling the other's strategy ""morally wrong"". Questions from Sun readers also took the debate further into policy areas they hadn't debated as much before, such as the NHS and fracking. A lot more of the policy, and less of the personal. Ms Truss said putting up National Insurance was not needed to give the NHS money to help clear Covid backlogs, which she said could be funded through ""general taxation"". Asked how she would improve NHS services, the foreign secretary said she would cut down on layers of management and give NHS leaders ""more power locally"". Mr Sunak also set out his plan for healthcare, which involved increasing the number of ""community hubs"" for treatment and diagnosis. Both candidates also said they would supportfracking for energydomestically if local communities supported it. The contenders were challenged about what they would do to improve cancer treatment by an audience member with the disease who said he had been forced to receive help from a cancer charity. John Hughes, in Birmingham, asked the candidates: ""Why is the NHS broken?"" After Mr Sunak said he was glad he was getting ""the support that you need,"" Mr Hughes replied: ""I'm not getting that, Mr Sunak."" And while Ms Truss said she would give local leaders more power, Mr Hughes said the Conservatives had ""had the chance already, and its still not enough for the NHS"". Mr Sunak, who resigned as Boris Johnson's chancellor as part of the cabinet mutiny against him earlier this month, had qualified for the final round of the leadership contest with the most votes from Tory MPs.  But opinion polls have suggested Ms Truss is thecurrent favouriteof the 160,000 or so Tory party members who will actually pick the eventual winner. Members will be able to vote by post or online form early August until 2 September, with a result announced three days later.

"One of the vandalised trees in Heath Park Twenty cherry trees gifted by Japan to celebrate 150 years of friendship with Wales have been vandalised. The trees were planted in Heath Park, Cardiff, as part of the Sakura Cherry Tree Project. One councillor labelled the ""mindless destruction"" shown by the vandals as ""sickening"". South Wales police said it was investigating and would increase patrols around parks over the summer to tackle anti-social behaviour. This video can not be played Two rows of cherry trees were planted in Heath Park, Cardiff The project was launched in Japan in 2017 by the then leaders of the two countries, Shinzo Abe and Theresa May. Sandy Sano, joint chairman and founder of the Sakura Cherry Tree Planting Project described the situation as ""tragic and an unfortunate"". ""I feel, knowing the kind mind of the Welsh people, I am sure it is a shock to Welsh people. We share the same feeling,"" he said. Sandy Sano said the Sakura Cherry Tree Planting Project wishes to donate trees to re-plant those that were vandalised ""We'd like to donate once again, to re-plant those twenty cherry blossom trees that have been damaged,"" he added. Mr Sano wanted to highlight the respect he has for the people of Wales and the close relationship between the two nations. ""We have a strong feeling, a very close relationship, with you."" Resident Corinne Williams said: ""There's no words for someone going along and doing that. I wonder if there's any point in replanting them really."" Corrine wonders whether ""there is any point"" in replanting the trees And Sharron Whatley added: ""I walked through yesterday and I just hoped it was perhaps just a strong wind or something. But to see them broken like this it really had to be vandalism. ""It's dreadful, so upsetting."" Sharon Whatley initially thought they had fallen down in the wind Cardiff councillor Jennifer Burke-Davies said the trees were only planed in January and ""were meant to symbolise friendship and understanding"". She added: ""It's a deliberate act of vandalism, a crime, and I fully condemn this completely unacceptable behaviour."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The council said the process of sourcing replacement trees had already begun, with the cost of replanting them estimated to be in the region of Â£4,000. Keith Dunn, the honorary consul for Japan in Wales, said he was ""shocked and saddened"" to hear of the vandalism. The trees were planted in January in Heath Park and Bute Park in Cardiff ""This is a totally unacceptable act and I know that my colleagues who have been responsible for organising the Sakura Cherry Tree Project... will be incredibly disappointed and saddened by this news,"" he said. ""I would urge anyone that has any information about this crime to come forward and report to the police."" A total of 120 trees were planted in Cardiff, with 20 planted at Bute Park in response totrees being vandalised therein September. The rest were planted at Heath Park. Heath and Birchgrove councillor Graham Hinchey said: ""The trees will be replaced, we won't let the vandals win. ""It's really disappointing that young people have planted for the future helping with climate change work and this happens."" Violence in Bute Park 'dark and sinister' Donated trees from Japan could help attacked park Cherry trees planted after city park vandal attack He added: ""There were two avenues of trees, they were starting to blossom already and the purpose was to plant them near the hospital to show after Covid there was hope for the future."" He added that he had spoken to the local police inspector and asked for them to carry out more regular visits to the area. The idea was to create a colourful avenue of blossoming cherry trees Insp Scott Threadgold, of South Wales Police, said: ""This is an incident which has caused significant concern to residents surrounding the park as well as the wider general public, the trees were donated to the community to mark the relationship between Wales and Japan in January this year and they hold a place in many people's hearts as a result.""

"Nineteen months after he first entered Downing Street as PM, Rishi Sunak faces the fight of his political life to hang on to the job. Four Conservative prime ministers had already come and gone when, at the age of 42, just seven years an MP, he was tasked with keeping the Tory show on the road. The MPs who put him there hoped he would steady the ship after turbulent times under Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, before mounting a comeback for the party trailing a long way behind Labour in the opinion polls. So farthat comeback has yet to materialise. With a general election having to be called by January 2025, the assumption was that Mr Sunak would play it long and go to the country in the autumn, in the hope his political fortunes would eventually pick up. His surprise calling of an election on 4 July has left some some Conservative MPs scratching their heads but his allies insist it was a smart move. The youngest occupant of No 10 in modern times, Mr Sunak is also the first British-Indian to be prime minister. A son of first generation immigrants, who worked hard to send him to one of the country's top fee-paying schools, Winchester College, where he was head boy. He spent time in California and worked at investment bank Goldman Sachs - and two multibillion dollar hedge funds - before entering politics. Akshata Murty: Who is Rishi Sunak's wife? A self-confessed ""huge Star Wars fan"" with a sizeable collection of lightsabers, he is sometimes portrayed as a ""geek"". He generally swears off alcohol in favour of Mexican Coca-Cola, which, he says, is made with ""cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup"". Colleagues describe him as a details man, who is always the best-briefed person in any meeting. He became prime minister in extraordinary circumstances after his predecessor Liz Truss - whom he lost to in a leadership contest after the collapse of Boris Johnson's premiership - quitafter just 45 days in the job. Age:44 Place of birth:Southampton, Hampshire Home:London and Yorkshire Education:Winchester College, Oxford University, Stanford University Family:Married to businesswoman Akshata Murty with two daughters Parliamentary constituency:Richmond (Yorkshire) This video can not be played Watch: Rishi Sunak says that when it comes to helping the most vulnerable ""that's what I did"". Mr Sunak's parents came to the UK from east Africa and are both of Indian origin. He was born in Southampton in 1980, where his father was a GP, and his mother ran her own pharmacy. ""In terms of cultural upbringing, I'd be at the temple at the weekend - I'm a Hindu - but I'd also be at [Southampton Football Club] the Saints game as well on a Saturday - you do everything, you do both."" In the interview he said he had been fortunate not to have endured a lot of racism growing up, but that there was one incident that had stayed with him. ""I was just out with my younger brother and younger sister, and I think, probably pretty young, I was probably a mid-teenager, and we were out at a fast food restaurant and I was just looking after them. There were people sitting nearby, it was the first time I'd experienced it, just saying some very unpleasant things. The 'P' word. ""And it stung. I still remember it. It seared in my memory. You can be insulted in many different ways."" However, he said he ""can't conceive of that happening today"" in the UK. He attended Winchester College and worked as a waiter at a Southampton curry house during his summer holidays. After finishing school he went on to Oxford to study philosophy, politics and economics, before studying for an MBA at Stanford University in California. There he met his wife, and the couple have two daughters. His rise to the top of British politics has been rapid - he only became an MP in 2015, in the rock solid Conservative seat of Richmond, in North Yorkshire. His political opponents have made much of his personal wealth, claiming he is out touch with the lives of most voters. Together, he and hiswife Akshata Murty- daughter of Indian billionaire Narayana Murthy, who co-founder of IT services giant Infosys - havean estimated worth of more than Â£650m. In 2022, Ms Murty announced she wouldstart paying UK tax on her incometo relieve political pressure on her husband. He was arguing for Britain's departure from the EU from his earliest days in politics and supported the Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum. But he first came to wider public attention during the coronavirus pandemic, when as the recently-appointed chancellor he spent eye-watering sums on the furlough scheme and other support measures, as well as launching the controversial Eat Out to Help Out scheme. His personal popularity soared but he also got caught up in the Partygate controversies that rocked Downing Street, being fined, in June 2020, for attending one of the now infamous gatherings. And he found himself increasingly at odds with his boss Boris Johnson over the economy - pushing for lower taxes and spending cuts. In July 2022, he resigned from the cabinet, a move that was instrumental in ousting Mr Johnson, which some of the former PM's allies have not forgotten. He was not elected leader by Conservative Party members. He was, in effect, crowned by Tory grandees desperate for some stability after the chaos presided over by Liz Truss and latterly by Boris Johnson. He inherited a financial crisis and a party in disarray but also a near 70-seat majority - which has since been significantly eroded by a series of by-election defeats featuring big swings against his party. At the start of 2023, Mr Sunak set out five promises to voters, he wanted to be judged by: Halving inflation Growing the economy Reducing debt Cutting NHS waiting times Stopping small boat crossings Progress on thesehas been slow. The overall number of patients waiting for treatment on the NHS is higher than when Mr Sunak came to office, but inflation has dropped sharply in recent months. The headline rate for the year to April was 2.3%, hailed by the prime minister as a ""major moment"" - and a clear sign that his economic plan is working. On small boats, the government passed legislation allowing it to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda - but this was declared unlawful by the Supreme Court. The government responded by signing a new treaty with Rwanda, declaring it a safe country. This became law in April and the prime minister argues it will deter migrants from crossing the English Channel in small boats. Critics have dismissed it as a hugely expensive gimmick. Mr Sunakhas now said no asylum seekers will be flown to Rwanda before the election - and will go there only if he is re-elected. He has delayed a ban on new petrol and diesel cars in a major change to the government's approach to achieving net zero by 2050. seeking to portray himself as the friend of the motorist and voters who are unhappy about the personal sacrifices required to reach the net zero target. He also scaled back the HS2 high speed rail link. Mr Sunak has pledged to create a ""smoke-free generation"" by phasing out the sale of tobacco products. The billcould fall by the wayside with Parliament shutting down on Fridaybut it is likely to be in the Conservative manifesto. The prime minister's personal ratings have suffered as series of resets has not had the desired effect on Tory fortunes, but he insists he can defy the odds and retain the keys to Downing Street on 4 July.

"The Tory leadership debate on TalkTV is cancelled after presenter Kate McCann faints and collapses live on air In a statement, Talk TV says McCann is fine but ""the medical advice was that we shouldn't continue with the debate"" Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak had been taking part in a second head-to-head debate, this time for The Sun and TalkTV, when a loud crash was heard in the studio Truss looked panicked and the broadcast was suspended Earlier both campaign teams were urged ""to be mindful of tone"" and have a debate that's ""respectful and dignified"" During Monday's BBC debate in Stoke-on-Trent, Sunak and Truss talked over each other and clashed on taxes, their Brexit records and the schools they went to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says both Tory leadership candidates ""are the architects of the mess this country is in"" Edited by Andrew Humphrey Well, that didn't quite play out as we thought it would... The second head-to-head debate between Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak was in full swing when the host Kate McCann fainted live on air. Thankfully she's OK, but unfortunately he debate was not able to resume following medical advice. It all played out while Truss was discussing how to keep the public on side in supporting Ukraine, given the war's role in exacerbating rising energy and food costs during a cost of living crisis. During her answer, there was a loud bang - which led to the foreign secretary shouting ""Oh my god!"", put her hands to her mouth and then leave the stage to check on the stricken host. After the unexpected interruption, both candidates spoke to the studio audience - who had been previously grilling them alongside McCann. Thanks for sticking with us during the unexpected twist that has brought this page to a close a little earlier than anticipated. The writers today have been Emily McGarvey, Marita Moloney, Malu Cursino, Jack Burgess, Aoife Walsh, Laura Gozzi, James FitzGerald and Adam Durbin, while the page has been edited by Claudia Allen, Jeremy Gahagan, Nathan Williams and Andrew Humphrey. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent First of all, thankfully weâre hearing everyone
involved in the debate is OK. From the head-to-head that we did witness, itâs obvious tax is still the key issue. Both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have fundamentally
different approaches when it comes to managing the economy. Sunak insists some tax rises will deal with inflation and pay
back debt; Truss believes tax cuts can stimulate the economy. And theyâre both willing to say their opponent is
âmorallyâ misguided on this issue. Those are pretty stern words for MPs to use
about party colleagues. Though tonightâs event seemed a bit better tempered than the
first debate, this contest has a long way to go. Sunak and Truss will start travelling the country
in the coming days for hustings with party members. No-oneâs voted yet, so this is a key period in the
contest. But the big question is how respectful can this competition
stay as they sling it out for votes? In the half hour before the debate went offline when presenter Kate McCann fainted, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss managed to touch upon some of the more contentious issues in this leadership contest, such as: The cost of living crisis  The NHS  Taxation Fellow TV presenters have complimented Kate McCann for how she was moderating the debate before she fainted. TalkTV host Tom Newton Dunn describes his colleague as ""one of the very best in the business at holding politicians to account"". She proved that in the first half hour of the debate, and she will prove that again. She is a fantastic talent and Iâm hugely proud of her.""  Sky's Kay Burley agrees, noting the TalkTV political editor was doing a ""senasational"" job in the 30 or so minutes she was in charge.  Iâm sure the candidates will return to continue the debate under her expert stewardship. Get some rest Kate x""  ITV's Paul Brand expresses sympathy to ""one of the smoothest operators in TV news"" over medical problems happening out of nowhere on air, pointing out he once ""suffered a wasp attack on live TV"" Very glad to hear sheâs OK and sheâll bounce back in no time.""

This video can not be played As we've been reporting, the TalkTV debate abruptly went off air after an incident in the studio. Here's the moment when Liz Truss was interrupted mid-sentence after a crash is heard. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent A spokesperson for News UK, which owns the Sun, has said ""there was a medical issue, hope to
be back on air soonâ. A well informed source has told the BBC the Tory debate crashed off air because presenter Kate McCann is understood to have fainted and collapsed.

She was presenting alone, after Harry Cole pulled out with Covid. We'll bring you more when we have it. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent Something appears to have happened during the Talk TV debate. There was a loud crash, Liz Truss looked very concerned and then the programme was taken off air. The production teamâs main concern will rightly be ensuring everyone is OK, so itâs not clear if this debate will resume. Well, we're not sure exactly what's going on the TalkTV studio right now - as the feed has come off air. In the moments beforehand, the two Tory leadership hopefuls were discussing the UK's support for Ukraine. They'd been asked a question about the potential rise in energy costs to British households, as a result of sanctions against Russia. Sunak admitted that standing up to Russia's President Putin required ""toughness"" which could mean that all of us go through ""difficult times"". Truss said ""the cost of not doing anything to stand up to Putin is immense"". Shortly afterwards she looked panicked as a crash was heard in the studio, and the broadcast feed was cut. A moment of disruption while Liz Truss answers a question about the UK's support for Ukraine amid the Russian invasion. It appears a podium has been knocked over, but we don't know for sure. Truss looks panicked as a loud crash is heard in the studio. The broadcast feed has gone off air for now. Stay tuned as we bring you updates. Rishi Sunak has said he thinks it's ""reasonable"" to ask the largest companies to pay a bit more tax to help pay our debts. Liz Truss replies saying she thinks Sunakâs policies are making the UK less competitive. She warns against raising corporation tax too high, saying that the exchequer will get less money coming in. Moving away from the NHS now, and a question from a member of the audience who raises the rising cost of living, specifically the increased cost of meat. She asks should her family go vegetarian? Liz Truss responds that the global food crisis has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and Britain needs to look at producing more food domestically by cutting red tape for farmers. The UK needs a resilient food supply not be solely dependent on ""countries we can't trust"", she says. Truss adds that inflation is also a global problem, reiterating that tax cuts are needed as national insurance rises have been ""morally wrong"". Rishi Sunak's answer focuses on reducing inflation, turning again to his economic policies. He says supermarkets and other parties in the supply chain must be held to account to ensure prices are kept fair for consumers. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent The first topic up for discussion is the NHS, prompting less of a fiery start than last nightâs debate. Theyâre getting to talk with fewer interruptions this evening. Rishi Sunak highlights the extra health funding heâs provided through a national insurance increase introduced in April when he was chancellor. He calls this a âbraveâ decision, proving his commitment to the NHS. Ms Truss insists sheâs committed to this extra funding, but promises to reverse the increase in tax. How would she fund it? She says it can be done via general taxation, and says Mr Sunak did not have to take more money from peopleâs pay cheques. Weâre talking about the NHS, but weâve come back to taxes â the key dividing point between these two candidates. Both candidates are asked how long they were on hold for the last time they tried to book a GPs appointment. Sunak doesn't say when the last time he asked for an appointment, but does say he is currently relying on the NHS to care for his grandfather and daughter, who have been in hospitals recently for treatment Truss says she got good service before the pandemic the last time she needed to call 111, adding  her daughter has recently needed treatment for a hand condition and received a good service. She also says that friends of hers have had to wait much longer more recently and that she recognises it is difficult at the moment. Â© 2025 BBC.

This video can not be played As we've been reporting, the TalkTV debate abruptly went off air after an incident in the studio. Here's the moment when Liz Truss was interrupted mid-sentence after a crash is heard. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent A spokesperson for News UK, which owns the Sun, has said ""there was a medical issue, hope to
be back on air soonâ. A well informed source has told the BBC the Tory debate crashed off air because presenter Kate McCann is understood to have fainted and collapsed.

She was presenting alone, after Harry Cole pulled out with Covid. We'll bring you more when we have it. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent Something appears to have happened during the Talk TV debate. There was a loud crash, Liz Truss looked very concerned and then the programme was taken off air. The production teamâs main concern will rightly be ensuring everyone is OK, so itâs not clear if this debate will resume. Well, we're not sure exactly what's going on the TalkTV studio right now - as the feed has come off air. In the moments beforehand, the two Tory leadership hopefuls were discussing the UK's support for Ukraine. They'd been asked a question about the potential rise in energy costs to British households, as a result of sanctions against Russia. Sunak admitted that standing up to Russia's President Putin required ""toughness"" which could mean that all of us go through ""difficult times"". Truss said ""the cost of not doing anything to stand up to Putin is immense"". Shortly afterwards she looked panicked as a crash was heard in the studio, and the broadcast feed was cut. A moment of disruption while Liz Truss answers a question about the UK's support for Ukraine amid the Russian invasion. It appears a podium has been knocked over, but we don't know for sure. Truss looks panicked as a loud crash is heard in the studio. The broadcast feed has gone off air for now. Stay tuned as we bring you updates. Rishi Sunak has said he thinks it's ""reasonable"" to ask the largest companies to pay a bit more tax to help pay our debts. Liz Truss replies saying she thinks Sunakâs policies are making the UK less competitive. She warns against raising corporation tax too high, saying that the exchequer will get less money coming in.

"The global growth outlook has ""darkened significantly"", the IMF says The UK is set for the slowest growth of the G7 richest economies next year, the International Monetary Fund has warned. It is predicting UK growth will fall to just 0.5% in 2023, much lower than its forecast in April of 1.2%. The global economy has shrunk for the first time since 2020, the IMF said, hit by the Ukraine war and Covid-19. With growth stalling in the UK, US, China and Europe, the world ""may soon be teetering on the edge of a global recession"", it said. ""We know that people are feeling the impact of rising prices, caused by global economic factors, triggered by the illegal Russian invasion of Ukraine,"" a HM Treasury spokesperson said in a statement, adding that help for households included Â£400 off energy bills plus personal tax cuts worth up to Â£330 a year. The IMF has cut its 2022 global growth forecast to just 3.2% and warned the slowdown risks being even more severe. It said fast-rising prices were to blame for much of the slowdown, with households and businesses squeezed by a combination of higher prices and higher borrowing costs as policymakers raise interest rates to try to counter inflation. ""The global economy, still reeling from the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, is facing an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook,"" economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in a blog outlining the international lending body's latest economic forecast. ""The outlook has darkened significantly"" since April, the last time the IMF issued forecasts, he added. Why is the UK economy suffering more than others? China economy shrinks on zero-Covid policy The global economy contracted in the three months to July, which was the first decline since the pandemic hit, the IMF said. The probability of a recession in the G7 economies - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US and UK - now stands at roughly 15% - nearly four times higher than usual. While UK growth is expected to remain relatively strong this year, Mr Gourinchas said unusually high inflation - faster than in Europe or the US - is expected to take a toll in 2023. ""If you were to look at both years together, it's actually not very far from where the other advanced economies are,"" he told the BBC. ""The one thing that worries me more about the UK economy is that their inflation numbers seem to be quite high. There is a fairly high pass through from high gas prices to broader prices in the economy. ""That would signal even further monetary policy tightening by the Bank of England and that would also weigh down on growth going forward."" The IMF now expects inflation to reach 6.6% in advanced economies and 9.5% in emerging market and developing economies - nearly a full percentage point higher than it expected in April. ""Inflation at current levels represents a clear risk for current and future macroeconomic stability and bringing it back to central bank targets should be the top priority for policymakers,"" Mr Gourinchas said. ""Tighter monetary policy will inevitably have real economic costs, but delaying it will only exacerbate the hardship."" The fallout from the war in Ukraine is being felt in pockets across the world. Soaring food and fuel prices and higher interest rates means the IMF sees more gloomy prospects for all major economies - but it's the UK that, Russia apart, remains bottom of the pile for 2023. Brexit may not have helped but it's our reliance on fossil fuels - they make up 75% of our energy mix, more than in the EU  - that's made us particularly vulnerable to this shock. Those prices are determined on international markets but affect us all. This report comes on the day that, with the energy price cap set to top Â£3,000 in October, a committee of MPs warns that further government help for households may be needed. But the IMF is among those economists who've noted that the UK faces more fundamental issues than the current crisis, with living standards having dropped behind many competitors over the last 15 years, something many attribute to a lack of investment in skills, equipment and infrastructure. Officials from the IMF have previously told me that one way to remedy that would be to raise, not lower taxes, to fund more investment. The US saw the steepest downgrade of any country for 2022. The IMF cut its growth forecast for the world's largest economy to 2.3% this year, from 3.7% previously, and to just 1% in 2023. Meanwhile growth in China is expected to fall to 3.3% this year, the slowest rate in nearly four decades, as the country wrestles with new Covid lockdowns and a property crisis. Questions about the reliability of Europe's natural gas supplies from Russia, as well as political unrest generated by high food and fuel prices, are among the risks the global economy is facing in the months ahead, the IMF said. ""We can be reasonably hopeful that China might be rebound,"" Mr Gourinchas said, adding that he was ""much more concerned about both the inflation path and the tightening of monetary policy leading to a slowdown going ahead"". It warned that in a ""plausible"" scenario, in which only some of those risks materialise, like a shutdown of Russian gas flows to Europe, global economic growth could fall to 2% next year - a pace the world has fallen below just five times since 1970.

This video can not be played As we've been reporting, the TalkTV debate abruptly went off air after an incident in the studio. Here's the moment when Liz Truss was interrupted mid-sentence after a crash is heard. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent A spokesperson for News UK, which owns the Sun, has said ""there was a medical issue, hope to
be back on air soonâ. A well informed source has told the BBC the Tory debate crashed off air because presenter Kate McCann is understood to have fainted and collapsed.

She was presenting alone, after Harry Cole pulled out with Covid. We'll bring you more when we have it. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent Something appears to have happened during the Talk TV debate. There was a loud crash, Liz Truss looked very concerned and then the programme was taken off air. The production teamâs main concern will rightly be ensuring everyone is OK, so itâs not clear if this debate will resume. Well, we're not sure exactly what's going on the TalkTV studio right now - as the feed has come off air. In the moments beforehand, the two Tory leadership hopefuls were discussing the UK's support for Ukraine. They'd been asked a question about the potential rise in energy costs to British households, as a result of sanctions against Russia. Sunak admitted that standing up to Russia's President Putin required ""toughness"" which could mean that all of us go through ""difficult times"". Truss said ""the cost of not doing anything to stand up to Putin is immense"". Shortly afterwards she looked panicked as a crash was heard in the studio, and the broadcast feed was cut. A moment of disruption while Liz Truss answers a question about the UK's support for Ukraine amid the Russian invasion. It appears a podium has been knocked over, but we don't know for sure. Truss looks panicked as a loud crash is heard in the studio. The broadcast feed has gone off air for now. Stay tuned as we bring you updates. Rishi Sunak has said he thinks it's ""reasonable"" to ask the largest companies to pay a bit more tax to help pay our debts. Liz Truss replies saying she thinks Sunakâs policies are making the UK less competitive. She warns against raising corporation tax too high, saying that the exchequer will get less money coming in. Moving away from the NHS now, and a question from a member of the audience who raises the rising cost of living, specifically the increased cost of meat. She asks should her family go vegetarian? Liz Truss responds that the global food crisis has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and Britain needs to look at producing more food domestically by cutting red tape for farmers. The UK needs a resilient food supply not be solely dependent on ""countries we can't trust"", she says. Truss adds that inflation is also a global problem, reiterating that tax cuts are needed as national insurance rises have been ""morally wrong"". Rishi Sunak's answer focuses on reducing inflation, turning again to his economic policies. He says supermarkets and other parties in the supply chain must be held to account to ensure prices are kept fair for consumers. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent The first topic up for discussion is the NHS, prompting less of a fiery start than last nightâs debate. Theyâre getting to talk with fewer interruptions this evening. Rishi Sunak highlights the extra health funding heâs provided through a national insurance increase introduced in April when he was chancellor. He calls this a âbraveâ decision, proving his commitment to the NHS. Ms Truss insists sheâs committed to this extra funding, but promises to reverse the increase in tax. How would she fund it? She says it can be done via general taxation, and says Mr Sunak did not have to take more money from peopleâs pay cheques. Weâre talking about the NHS, but weâve come back to taxes â the key dividing point between these two candidates. Both candidates are asked how long they were on hold for the last time they tried to book a GPs appointment. Sunak doesn't say when the last time he asked for an appointment, but does say he is currently relying on the NHS to care for his grandfather and daughter, who have been in hospitals recently for treatment Truss says she got good service before the pandemic the last time she needed to call 111, adding  her daughter has recently needed treatment for a hand condition and received a good service. She also says that friends of hers have had to wait much longer more recently and that she recognises it is difficult at the moment. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Former first minister Donald Dewar had concerns about providing compensation to survivors Scotland's inaugural first minister Donald Dewar feared compensating people infected by contaminated blood could result in an ""open cheque book"". The UK Infected Blood Inquiry was told that his concerns appeared in an email sent in September 1999. In the 1970s and 1980s, about 3,000 people in Scotland contracted Hepatitis C and HIV through blood products used to treat conditions like haemophilia. Those left with Hepatitis C did not receive financial support until 2004. Ministers given 'inaccurate' blood scandal briefing Contaminated blood: The Scottish questions The blood inquiry was set up in 2017 to examine what has been called the worst treatment disaster in NHS history. While many victims died others who were left with lifelong serious illness have provided evidence to the investigation which is being chaired by former QC Sir Brian Langstaff. The Haemophilia Society has long believed that some of these infections could have been prevented and that between 1985 and 1987, the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service was negligent in not using safer blood products. More than 3,000 people in Scotland were infected with contaminated blood Mr Dewar, who was Scotland's first minister following devolution, had faced demands to provide compensation to victims. On Tuesday the inquiry heard Scottish ministers were against providing payouts because the NHS had not been found to be negligent or at fault. Theemail sent on behalf of Mr Dewar,externalon 23 September 1999 said he was ""a little concerned about the possible financial implications and fears that an open mind could be taken to mean an open cheque book"". A handwritten note added that the then health minister Susan Deacon's office ""advises that this is very much a PR exercise and there is unlikely to be any compensation paid"". Ms Deacon is due to give evidence to the inquiry on Friday. The email was sent nine days after the health minister had met with the Haemophilia Society, pledging that an internal investigation into the Hepatitis C infections would be open and transparent. That probe concluded that no blame was attributable to the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service. This video can not be played Prof Aileen Keel told the inquiry: ""I certainly don't agree with the use of term 'PR exercise'."" Prof Aileen Keel, a haematologist who held several senior roles advising government between 1992 and 2015, told the inquiry that victims of the scandal received the best treatment at the time. However, she distanced herself from some of the comments in correspondence at the time. Prof Keel said: ""I certainly don't agree with the use of term 'PR exercise'. ""Undoubtedly, ministers were under great pressure to further investigate this area. And the Haemophilia Society undoubtedly had in mind compensation at the end of that period."" She added: ""However, I don't think that means that the internal investigation was not conducted in an entirely proper way â finding out the facts, detailing the chronology so that we could really understand whether what the Haemophilia Society were alleging was true or not. ""So the use of this terminology does not tally with my recollection of that period around the investigation."" The inquiry before Sir Brian Langstaff continues.

"European Union members have agreed to cut gas use in case Russia halts supplies but some countries will have exemptions to avoid rationing. EU members, locked in talks since the idea was suggested last week, have now agreed to voluntarily reduce 15% of gas use between August and March. ""This was not a Mission Impossible!"",tweeted,externalthe Czech Republic, which holds the rotating EU presidency. However, the deal was watered down after previously not having exemptions. The EU has said its aim from the deal is to make savings and store gas ahead of winter, warning that Russia is ""continuously using energy supplies as a weapon"". The voluntary agreement would become mandatory if supplies reach crisis levels. Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Russian gas boss says 'our product, our rules' Russia waging gas war with supply cuts - Zelensky However, some countries not connected to the EU's gas pipe lines, such as Ireland, Malta and Cyprus, would be exempt from any mandatory gas reduction order as they would not be able to source alternative supplies. Elsewhere the Baltic nations, which are not hooked up to the European electricity system and are heavily reliant on gas for electricity production are also exempt from compulsory targets in order to avoid the risk of an electricity supply crisis. Countries can also ask to be exempt if they exceed gas storage filling targets, if they are heavily dependent on gas for ""critical"" industries, or if their gas consumption has increased by at least 8% in the past year compared to the average of the past five years. Nathan Piper, an oil and gas analyst for Investec, said there is a ""high political and economic price"" as the EU looks to reduce its dependence on Russian gas - and that price was being reflected in the exemptions for members, which would likely reduce the impact of the measures. But Kadri Simson, European Commissioner for Energy, said initial calculations indicated that even if all exemptions to ration were used, the EU as a whole would still reduce demand to a level ""that would help us safely through an average winter"". She also outlined work to boost alternative gas supplies from countries including Azerbaijan, the United States, Canada, Norway, Egypt and Israel. Ahead of the deal announcement, Germany's Economy Minister Robert Habeck said: ""Of course there are a lot of compromises in this text now. This is how Europe works."" Mr Habeck said a ""problem might occur"" that all the exemptions cause ""too much bureaucracy so that we are too slow in times of crisis"", but he added the exemptions were ""reasonable"". Hungary was the only member to oppose the deal. This agreement is packed full of compromises. There are exemptions outlined for some countries now, along with potential carve-outs for others in future. ""This plan looks like Emmental cheese,"" one EU diplomat told me. There is talk in Brussels that this whole scheme was rushed ahead of the August break. And with winter looming, as well as Gazprom's announcement on Monday, ministers were under even more pressure to act. Meanwhile, there's also the matter of Hungary. It was the only country to finally oppose the agreement, raising questions over whether they will even try and implement the plan. Not only this but, in recent days, Budapest's foreign minister met his Russian counterpart in Moscow to request additional gas supplies. None of this is ""on message"" for the EU, to say the least. Viktor Orban's government, already known for relatively warm ties with the Kremlin, looks like an increasingly alarming outlier from the Brussels perspective when it comes to tackling the EU's tricky energy question. The agreement comes after Russian energy firm Gazprom announced it had once again reduced gas flows into Germany to allow work on a turbine on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. The pipeline, which pumps gas from Russia to Germany, has been running well below capacity for weeks andUkraine has accused Moscow of waging a ""gas war"" against Europe. Gazprom has cut gas supplies altogether to Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Poland over their refusal to comply with a Kremlin order to pay their bills in roubles, instead of euros or dollars. Russia supplied the EU with 40% of its gas last year, and since the invasion of Ukraine European leaders have held talks over how to reduce its dependence on Russian fossil fuels. The EU agreed in May to ban all Russian oil importswhich come in by sea by the end of this year, but a deal over gas bans has taken longer. While the UK would not be directly impacted by gas supply disruption, as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it would be affected by prices rising in the global markets as demand in Europe increases. UK natural gas was trading at around 350p per therm on Tuesday, a level not seen since early March, due to the uncertainty over Russian supplies. UK energy bills increased by an unprecedented Â£700 in April, and are expected to rise again to Â£3,244 a year for a typical household in October. ""The EU is united and solidary,"" said Jozef SÃ­kela, Czech minister of industry and trade, on announcing the deal. ""Today's decision has clearly shown the member states will stand tall against any Russian attempt to divide the EU by using energy supplies as a weapon. ""Saving gas now will improve preparedness. The winter will be much cheaper and easier for EU's citizens and industry."" When choosing how to reduce gas usage, EU members agreed to prioritise measures that do not affect households and essential services such as healthcare and defence. The EU said possible measures include measures to encourage fuel changes in industry, national awareness raising campaigns and targeted obligations to reduce heating and cooling. European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, has said the prospect of Russia cutting off all supplies to the EU is a ""likely scenario"". Wholesale gas prices have soared since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, with a knock-on impact on consumer energy bills. How are sanctions affecting Russia's energy exports?

"The Tory leadership debate on TalkTV is cancelled after presenter Kate McCann faints and collapses live on air In a statement, Talk TV says McCann is fine but ""the medical advice was that we shouldn't continue with the debate"" Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak had been taking part in a second head-to-head debate, this time for The Sun and TalkTV, when a loud crash was heard in the studio Truss looked panicked and the broadcast was suspended Earlier both campaign teams were urged ""to be mindful of tone"" and have a debate that's ""respectful and dignified"" During Monday's BBC debate in Stoke-on-Trent, Sunak and Truss talked over each other and clashed on taxes, their Brexit records and the schools they went to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says both Tory leadership candidates ""are the architects of the mess this country is in"" Edited by Andrew Humphrey Well, that didn't quite play out as we thought it would... The second head-to-head debate between Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak was in full swing when the host Kate McCann fainted live on air. Thankfully she's OK, but unfortunately he debate was not able to resume following medical advice. It all played out while Truss was discussing how to keep the public on side in supporting Ukraine, given the war's role in exacerbating rising energy and food costs during a cost of living crisis. During her answer, there was a loud bang - which led to the foreign secretary shouting ""Oh my god!"", put her hands to her mouth and then leave the stage to check on the stricken host. After the unexpected interruption, both candidates spoke to the studio audience - who had been previously grilling them alongside McCann.

David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent First of all, thankfully weâre hearing everyone
involved in the debate is OK. From the head-to-head that we did witness, itâs obvious tax is still the key issue. Both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have fundamentally
different approaches when it comes to managing the economy. Sunak insists some tax rises will deal with inflation and pay
back debt; Truss believes tax cuts can stimulate the economy. And theyâre both willing to say their opponent is
âmorallyâ misguided on this issue. Those are pretty stern words for MPs to use
about party colleagues. Though tonightâs event seemed a bit better tempered than the
first debate, this contest has a long way to go. Sunak and Truss will start travelling the country
in the coming days for hustings with party members. No-oneâs voted yet, so this is a key period in the
contest. But the big question is how respectful can this competition
stay as they sling it out for votes? In the half hour before the debate went offline when presenter Kate McCann fainted, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss managed to touch upon some of the more contentious issues in this leadership contest, such as: The cost of living crisis  The NHS  Taxation Fellow TV presenters have complimented Kate McCann for how she was moderating the debate before she fainted. TalkTV host Tom Newton Dunn describes his colleague as ""one of the very best in the business at holding politicians to account"". She proved that in the first half hour of the debate, and she will prove that again. She is a fantastic talent and Iâm hugely proud of her.""  Sky's Kay Burley agrees, noting the TalkTV political editor was doing a ""senasational"" job in the 30 or so minutes she was in charge.  Iâm sure the candidates will return to continue the debate under her expert stewardship. Get some rest Kate x""  ITV's Paul Brand expresses sympathy to ""one of the smoothest operators in TV news"" over medical problems happening out of nowhere on air, pointing out he once ""suffered a wasp attack on live TV"" Very glad to hear sheâs OK and sheâll bounce back in no time.""

"The Tory leadership debate on TalkTV is cancelled after presenter Kate McCann faints and collapses live on air In a statement, Talk TV says McCann is fine but ""the medical advice was that we shouldn't continue with the debate"" Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak had been taking part in a second head-to-head debate, this time for The Sun and TalkTV, when a loud crash was heard in the studio Truss looked panicked and the broadcast was suspended Earlier both campaign teams were urged ""to be mindful of tone"" and have a debate that's ""respectful and dignified"" During Monday's BBC debate in Stoke-on-Trent, Sunak and Truss talked over each other and clashed on taxes, their Brexit records and the schools they went to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says both Tory leadership candidates ""are the architects of the mess this country is in"" Edited by Andrew Humphrey Well, that didn't quite play out as we thought it would... The second head-to-head debate between Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak was in full swing when the host Kate McCann fainted live on air. Thankfully she's OK, but unfortunately he debate was not able to resume following medical advice. It all played out while Truss was discussing how to keep the public on side in supporting Ukraine, given the war's role in exacerbating rising energy and food costs during a cost of living crisis. During her answer, there was a loud bang - which led to the foreign secretary shouting ""Oh my god!"", put her hands to her mouth and then leave the stage to check on the stricken host. After the unexpected interruption, both candidates spoke to the studio audience - who had been previously grilling them alongside McCann.

David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent First of all, thankfully weâre hearing everyone
involved in the debate is OK. From the head-to-head that we did witness, itâs obvious tax is still the key issue. Both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have fundamentally
different approaches when it comes to managing the economy. Sunak insists some tax rises will deal with inflation and pay
back debt; Truss believes tax cuts can stimulate the economy. And theyâre both willing to say their opponent is
âmorallyâ misguided on this issue. Those are pretty stern words for MPs to use
about party colleagues. Though tonightâs event seemed a bit better tempered than the
first debate, this contest has a long way to go. Sunak and Truss will start travelling the country
in the coming days for hustings with party members. No-oneâs voted yet, so this is a key period in the
contest. But the big question is how respectful can this competition
stay as they sling it out for votes? In the half hour before the debate went offline when presenter Kate McCann fainted, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss managed to touch upon some of the more contentious issues in this leadership contest, such as: The cost of living crisis  The NHS  Taxation Fellow TV presenters have complimented Kate McCann for how she was moderating the debate before she fainted.

This video can not be played As we've been reporting, the TalkTV debate abruptly went off air after an incident in the studio. Here's the moment when Liz Truss was interrupted mid-sentence after a crash is heard. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent A spokesperson for News UK, which owns the Sun, has said ""there was a medical issue, hope to
be back on air soonâ. A well informed source has told the BBC the Tory debate crashed off air because presenter Kate McCann is understood to have fainted and collapsed.

She was presenting alone, after Harry Cole pulled out with Covid. We'll bring you more when we have it. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent Something appears to have happened during the Talk TV debate. There was a loud crash, Liz Truss looked very concerned and then the programme was taken off air. The production teamâs main concern will rightly be ensuring everyone is OK, so itâs not clear if this debate will resume. Well, we're not sure exactly what's going on the TalkTV studio right now - as the feed has come off air. In the moments beforehand, the two Tory leadership hopefuls were discussing the UK's support for Ukraine. They'd been asked a question about the potential rise in energy costs to British households, as a result of sanctions against Russia. Sunak admitted that standing up to Russia's President Putin required ""toughness"" which could mean that all of us go through ""difficult times"". Truss said ""the cost of not doing anything to stand up to Putin is immense"". Shortly afterwards she looked panicked as a crash was heard in the studio, and the broadcast feed was cut. A moment of disruption while Liz Truss answers a question about the UK's support for Ukraine amid the Russian invasion. It appears a podium has been knocked over, but we don't know for sure. Truss looks panicked as a loud crash is heard in the studio. The broadcast feed has gone off air for now. Stay tuned as we bring you updates. Rishi Sunak has said he thinks it's ""reasonable"" to ask the largest companies to pay a bit more tax to help pay our debts. Liz Truss replies saying she thinks Sunakâs policies are making the UK less competitive. She warns against raising corporation tax too high, saying that the exchequer will get less money coming in. Moving away from the NHS now, and a question from a member of the audience who raises the rising cost of living, specifically the increased cost of meat. She asks should her family go vegetarian? Liz Truss responds that the global food crisis has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and Britain needs to look at producing more food domestically by cutting red tape for farmers. The UK needs a resilient food supply not be solely dependent on ""countries we can't trust"", she says. Truss adds that inflation is also a global problem, reiterating that tax cuts are needed as national insurance rises have been ""morally wrong"". Rishi Sunak's answer focuses on reducing inflation, turning again to his economic policies. He says supermarkets and other parties in the supply chain must be held to account to ensure prices are kept fair for consumers.

"The ISS has orbited Earth since 1998 Russia says it will withdraw from the International Space Station (ISS) after 2024 and build its own station instead. The US and Russia, along with other partners, have successfully worked together on the ISS since 1998. But relations have soured since Russia invaded Ukraine, and Russia previously threatened to quit the project because of Western sanctions against it. Nasa said it had not yet received any official notice of Russia's intention to withdraw from the programme. The ISS - a joint project involving five space agencies - has been in orbit around Earth since 1998 and has been used to conduct thousands of scientific experiments. It is approved to operate until 2024, but the US wants to extend that for six more years with the agreement of all partners. At a meeting with Russia's President Vladimir Putin, Mr Borisov said Roskosmos would fulfil its obligations to its partners, but the decision had been taken to quit the project after 2024. ""I think that by this time we will start putting together a Russian orbital station,"" Mr Borisov said, adding that the new station was his agency's top priority. ""Good,"" replied Mr Putin. It is not immediately clear what the decision means for the future of the ISS, and the US space agency Nasa says it has not received any formal notice from Russia of its plans. Former ISS commander and retired US astronaut Dr Leroy Chiao believes it is unlikely Russia will decide to leave the project. ""I think this is posturing by the Russians. They don't have the money to build their own station and it would take several years to do it. They've got nothing else if they go this route,"" he told the BBC. The Russians have been making noises about withdrawal for some time but it's not clear how serious they are. They've talked about building their own outpost - the Russian Orbital Service Station - but it would require a financial commitment the Russian government has not shown to the country's existing space exploits. Certainly, Russian elements on the ISS are ageing but the view of engineers is that the modules can do a job through to 2030. If Russia does leave, there's no question it would be problematic. The station is designed in a way that makes the partners dependent on each other. The US side of the ISS provides the power; the Russian side provides the propulsion and keeps the platform from falling to Earth. If that propulsive capability is withdrawn, the US and its other partners - Europe, Japan and Canada - will need to devise other means of periodically boosting the station higher in the sky. It's something American robotic freighters could do. Cooperation on the ISS between Russia and the US had appeared relatively unharmed by the war in Ukraine, with the two countries signing an agreement earlier this month to allow Russian cosmonauts to travel to the station on US spacecraft and vice versa. ""We're all flyers. We learned to appreciate each other's perspectives,"" Dr Chaio said of his time commanding the space station from 2004-5. However, the war in Ukraine has hit other areas of cooperation between Russia and the West. The European Space Agency (ESA) ended its collaboration with Roskosmos to launch a rover to Mars, and Russia has stopped launches of its Soyuz spacecraft from an ESA launch site in French Guiana. Russian cosmonauts on the ISS recently displayed the flag of the self-declared Luhansk People's Republic Dr Chaio says in recent years Russia had politicised the space station, for example Russian cosmonauts have posed for photographs with the flags of pro-Russian separatist regions in east Ukraine. ""You can imagine how much trouble they would be in if they didn't do it,"" he told the BBC. The Soviet Union and Russia have a long history of space exploration, and accomplishments such as putting the first man in space in 1961 remain a source of national pride. In his meeting with Mr Putin, Roskosmos head Mr Borisov said the new Russian space station would provide Russia with space-based services needed for modern life, for example navigation and data transmission.

"Amazon is to raise the price of its Prime service for UK customers due to higher operating costs. From September, monthly subscriptions will go up Â£1 to Â£8.99 and annual membership will rise from Â£79 to Â£95. Amazon said the price rise, its first in the UK since 2014, was partly due to inflation, which is at a 40-year high. Other services such as Netflix have also increased subscription prices, despite signs people are beginning to cut back on streaming services. However, Amazon Prime offers more than just its streaming service. Prime also offer unlimited deliveries of products. Amazon said the new pricing would begin from September, or at the customer's next membership renewal date, adding that switching to an annual plan or cancellation of membership was also an option. The move comes at a time when many households are looking to cut back on spending, with prices of goods rising at the fastest pace for 40 years. Retail analyst Natalie Berg, who has written a book about how Amazon will shape the future of shopping, said the Prime price hike was ""not really a surprise"" after Amazonput up its prices for Prime in the US in February. ""It is an incredibly bold move to increase fees smack in the middle of the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation, but Amazon is indispensable to many shoppers and they [the company] know that,"" she told the BBC. ""Amazon has become so deeply embedded in our daily lives that so many people will accept the hike."" Amazon price matches Tesco in grocery customer war Amazon targets 10,000 fake review Facebook groups Amazon to create 4,000 new UK jobs Earlier this year, a BBC-commissioned survey found people struggling with soaring energy bills and fuel prices were cutting back on food and car journeys to save money. More than half (56%) the4,011 people asked had bought fewer groceries, and the same proportion had skipped meals. Recent research has suggested that more people are cancelling video streaming subscriptions, such as Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime, due to the rising cost of living. A total of 1.66 million services were dropped in the second quarter of 2022, market research firm Kantar said, with the under-24s age group most likely to cancel. More than a third of cancellations were attributed to cutting costs, with the primary reason as ""wanting to save money"". It might only be an extra pound a month, but with everyone looking to tighten their budgets at the moment every pound counts, so here's a few ideas on how to beat the rise. Most people pay monthly for Amazon Prime, which means the price rise will kick in from mid-September. But if you've got the cash handy then you can save by paying for a full year's subscription upfront before that point. That will lock you in at the lower price until 2023, and save you about Â£30. It's worth checking if you're signed up to Prime even if you think you're not, because it's easy to click 'join' by mistake when making a purchase and get rolled into membership without realising. Take a long hard look at your subscriptions. There's no charge to cancel your monthly Prime membership and, after a lot of pressure, Amazon have made it easier to find and click through to that cancellation process. They should even refund you if you've only just paid for that month. If you decide to sign up again later you might even be able to get one month free when re-joining, which would save you that Â£8.99. If you've a few different TV subscriptions, it's worth thinking about rotating. Maybe your Christmas fix is on one provider but your summer love is with another - switch them so you're only paying for one at a time. Binge-watch, then cancel your membership, and switch to another service rather than paying for each of them all year-round. High competition in the streaming industry has led to competitive pricing and offers for customers. But Netflix increased the price of its plans in 2021 and 2022. It recently announced it hadlost almost a million subscribers between April and July, and it has now lost members for two quarters in a row. However, Ms Berg added Amazon Prime could not be directly compared to Netflix and other streaming platforms due to brand's main service being free shipping for products. ""Amazon has got a lot more stickiness because of the shopping element,"" she said. Amazon said it had invested billions of pounds in streaming content in recent years, with original series such as The Terminal List, as well as Clarkson's Farm. It has also moved into sports broadcasting, after successfully bidding for the rights to screen Tuesday night Champions League football matches from 2024. Amazon already has the exclusive rights to 20 Premier League matches a season, including the entire round of matches on and around Boxing Day each year. And it has a five-year deal to exclusively broadcast the US Open tennis tournament in the UK.

Amazon said the price rise, its first in the UK since 2014, was partly due to inflation, which is at a 40-year high. Other services such as Netflix have also increased subscription prices, despite signs people are beginning to cut back on streaming services. However, Amazon Prime offers more than just its streaming service. Prime also offer unlimited deliveries of products. Amazon said the new pricing would begin from September, or at the customer's next membership renewal date, adding that switching to an annual plan or cancellation of membership was also an option. The move comes at a time when many households are looking to cut back on spending, with prices of goods rising at the fastest pace for 40 years. Retail analyst Natalie Berg, who has written a book about how Amazon will shape the future of shopping, said the Prime price hike was ""not really a surprise"" after Amazonput up its prices for Prime in the US in February. ""It is an incredibly bold move to increase fees smack in the middle of the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation, but Amazon is indispensable to many shoppers and they [the company] know that,"" she told the BBC. ""Amazon has become so deeply embedded in our daily lives that so many people will accept the hike."" Amazon price matches Tesco in grocery customer war Amazon targets 10,000 fake review Facebook groups Amazon to create 4,000 new UK jobs Earlier this year, a BBC-commissioned survey found people struggling with soaring energy bills and fuel prices were cutting back on food and car journeys to save money. More than half (56%) the4,011 people asked had bought fewer groceries, and the same proportion had skipped meals. Recent research has suggested that more people are cancelling video streaming subscriptions, such as Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime, due to the rising cost of living. A total of 1.66 million services were dropped in the second quarter of 2022, market research firm Kantar said, with the under-24s age group most likely to cancel. More than a third of cancellations were attributed to cutting costs, with the primary reason as ""wanting to save money"". It might only be an extra pound a month, but with everyone looking to tighten their budgets at the moment every pound counts, so here's a few ideas on how to beat the rise. Most people pay monthly for Amazon Prime, which means the price rise will kick in from mid-September. But if you've got the cash handy then you can save by paying for a full year's subscription upfront before that point. That will lock you in at the lower price until 2023, and save you about Â£30. It's worth checking if you're signed up to Prime even if you think you're not, because it's easy to click 'join' by mistake when making a purchase and get rolled into membership without realising. Take a long hard look at your subscriptions. There's no charge to cancel your monthly Prime membership and, after a lot of pressure, Amazon have made it easier to find and click through to that cancellation process. They should even refund you if you've only just paid for that month. If you decide to sign up again later you might even be able to get one month free when re-joining, which would save you that Â£8.99. If you've a few different TV subscriptions, it's worth thinking about rotating. Maybe your Christmas fix is on one provider but your summer love is with another - switch them so you're only paying for one at a time. Binge-watch, then cancel your membership, and switch to another service rather than paying for each of them all year-round. High competition in the streaming industry has led to competitive pricing and offers for customers. But Netflix increased the price of its plans in 2021 and 2022. It recently announced it hadlost almost a million subscribers between April and July, and it has now lost members for two quarters in a row. However, Ms Berg added Amazon Prime could not be directly compared to Netflix and other streaming platforms due to brand's main service being free shipping for products. ""Amazon has got a lot more stickiness because of the shopping element,"" she said. Amazon said it had invested billions of pounds in streaming content in recent years, with original series such as The Terminal List, as well as Clarkson's Farm. It has also moved into sports broadcasting, after successfully bidding for the rights to screen Tuesday night Champions League football matches from 2024. Amazon already has the exclusive rights to 20 Premier League matches a season, including the entire round of matches on and around Boxing Day each year. And it has a five-year deal to exclusively broadcast the US Open tennis tournament in the UK.

"Ministers must offer bigger cost-of-living support payments as energy bills are expected to soar further this winter, a committee of MPs has said. Financial help for the vulnerable and poor needed to be ""updated"" to reflect higher bills in October, they said. Witnesses told the Business Committee: ""If you think things are bad now, you've not seen anything yet."" Its report also called energy regulator Ofgem ""incompetent"". Ofgem said it was working hard to reform the market. In recent days, millions of low-income households on benefits have been receiving the first Â£326 instalment of payments to assist with the rising cost of living. Further payments will come later in the year, including extra support for pensioners and people with disabilities, and a Â£400 discount on everyone's domestic energy bill. Those payments were set when the typical energy bill was anticipated to rise by Â£800 - a prediction Ofgem says is now too low. Influential industry analyst Cornwall Insight has predicted a rise of more than Â£1,200 a year in October, pushing the typical bill to Â£3,244 a year from October, then Â£3,363 a year from January.

It said there was too much focus on competition instead. Owing to the failure of 29 companies, 2.4 million customers were moved to other suppliers, and often to more expensive tariffs, and one large supplier - Bulb - is in special administration. ""Ofgem has proved incompetent as the regulatory authority of the energy retail market over the last decade,"" the report said. ""It allowed suppliers to enter the market without ensuring they had access to sufficient capital, acceptable business plans, and were run by individuals with relevant expertise."" A spokesman for Ofgem said the regulator had been ""clear and transparent"" that suppliers and its own regime had not been robust enough. ""No regulator can, or should, guarantee companies will not fail in a competitive market but we are working hard to reform the entire market, as well as closely scrutinising and holding individual energy suppliers to account, to further strengthen the regulatory regime,"" he said. The committee also questioned the future of the price cap, which sets a limit on the cost of each unit of energy and the standing charge for domestic customers in England, Wales and Scotland. It said the government should consider a social tariff instead for the most vulnerable, and then a relative tariff for everyone else. Social tariffs were phased out by suppliers about a decade ago. Prepayment meter customers, who pay for their energy in advance, have a different - slightly more expensive - price cap. Citizens Advice has warned that the number of people seeking help because they cannot afford to top up their meter has reached a new record.

"European Union members have agreed to cut gas use in case Russia halts supplies but some countries will have exemptions to avoid rationing. EU members, locked in talks since the idea was suggested last week, have now agreed to voluntarily reduce 15% of gas use between August and March. ""This was not a Mission Impossible!"",tweeted,externalthe Czech Republic, which holds the rotating EU presidency. However, the deal was watered down after previously not having exemptions. The EU has said its aim from the deal is to make savings and store gas ahead of winter, warning that Russia is ""continuously using energy supplies as a weapon"". The voluntary agreement would become mandatory if supplies reach crisis levels. Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Russian gas boss says 'our product, our rules' Russia waging gas war with supply cuts - Zelensky However, some countries not connected to the EU's gas pipe lines, such as Ireland, Malta and Cyprus, would be exempt from any mandatory gas reduction order as they would not be able to source alternative supplies. Elsewhere the Baltic nations, which are not hooked up to the European electricity system and are heavily reliant on gas for electricity production are also exempt from compulsory targets in order to avoid the risk of an electricity supply crisis. Countries can also ask to be exempt if they exceed gas storage filling targets, if they are heavily dependent on gas for ""critical"" industries, or if their gas consumption has increased by at least 8% in the past year compared to the average of the past five years. Nathan Piper, an oil and gas analyst for Investec, said there is a ""high political and economic price"" as the EU looks to reduce its dependence on Russian gas - and that price was being reflected in the exemptions for members, which would likely reduce the impact of the measures. But Kadri Simson, European Commissioner for Energy, said initial calculations indicated that even if all exemptions to ration were used, the EU as a whole would still reduce demand to a level ""that would help us safely through an average winter"". She also outlined work to boost alternative gas supplies from countries including Azerbaijan, the United States, Canada, Norway, Egypt and Israel. Ahead of the deal announcement, Germany's Economy Minister Robert Habeck said: ""Of course there are a lot of compromises in this text now. This is how Europe works."" Mr Habeck said a ""problem might occur"" that all the exemptions cause ""too much bureaucracy so that we are too slow in times of crisis"", but he added the exemptions were ""reasonable"". Hungary was the only member to oppose the deal. This agreement is packed full of compromises. There are exemptions outlined for some countries now, along with potential carve-outs for others in future. ""This plan looks like Emmental cheese,"" one EU diplomat told me. There is talk in Brussels that this whole scheme was rushed ahead of the August break. And with winter looming, as well as Gazprom's announcement on Monday, ministers were under even more pressure to act. Meanwhile, there's also the matter of Hungary. It was the only country to finally oppose the agreement, raising questions over whether they will even try and implement the plan. Not only this but, in recent days, Budapest's foreign minister met his Russian counterpart in Moscow to request additional gas supplies. None of this is ""on message"" for the EU, to say the least. Viktor Orban's government, already known for relatively warm ties with the Kremlin, looks like an increasingly alarming outlier from the Brussels perspective when it comes to tackling the EU's tricky energy question. The agreement comes after Russian energy firm Gazprom announced it had once again reduced gas flows into Germany to allow work on a turbine on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. The pipeline, which pumps gas from Russia to Germany, has been running well below capacity for weeks andUkraine has accused Moscow of waging a ""gas war"" against Europe. Gazprom has cut gas supplies altogether to Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Poland over their refusal to comply with a Kremlin order to pay their bills in roubles, instead of euros or dollars. Russia supplied the EU with 40% of its gas last year, and since the invasion of Ukraine European leaders have held talks over how to reduce its dependence on Russian fossil fuels. The EU agreed in May to ban all Russian oil importswhich come in by sea by the end of this year, but a deal over gas bans has taken longer. While the UK would not be directly impacted by gas supply disruption, as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it would be affected by prices rising in the global markets as demand in Europe increases. UK natural gas was trading at around 350p per therm on Tuesday, a level not seen since early March, due to the uncertainty over Russian supplies. UK energy bills increased by an unprecedented Â£700 in April, and are expected to rise again to Â£3,244 a year for a typical household in October. ""The EU is united and solidary,"" said Jozef SÃ­kela, Czech minister of industry and trade, on announcing the deal. ""Today's decision has clearly shown the member states will stand tall against any Russian attempt to divide the EU by using energy supplies as a weapon. ""Saving gas now will improve preparedness. The winter will be much cheaper and easier for EU's citizens and industry."" When choosing how to reduce gas usage, EU members agreed to prioritise measures that do not affect households and essential services such as healthcare and defence. The EU said possible measures include measures to encourage fuel changes in industry, national awareness raising campaigns and targeted obligations to reduce heating and cooling. European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, has said the prospect of Russia cutting off all supplies to the EU is a ""likely scenario"".

"The boss of Heathrow Airport has hit back at criticism from Ryanair, saying it is ""bizarre"" to blame airports for not having enough staff. John Holland-Kaye told the BBC it was up to airlines, not airports, to provide ground handling workers. On Monday, a Ryanair executivecriticised airports for not recruiting enough staffto cater for the rebound in travellers. Thousands of passengers have faced delays and cancellations recently. A shortage of staff has contributed to the disruption. Airports and airlines, which cut jobs during Covid lockdowns, have struggled to recruit workers as demand for travel has returned. Ground handling staff are responsible for a range of services at airports, including loading and unloading baggage. Heathrow tells airlines not to sell summer tickets Union suspends Heathrow refuelling staff strike The row comes as the UK's largest airport reported a Â£263m pre-tax profit for the first half of the year. However, on an adjusted basis, which strips out the impact of changes in interest rates, Heathrow posted a loss before tax of Â£321m for the period. On Monday, Ryanair's chief financial officer said airports had not recruited enough staff to cater for the rebound in travellers, saying they ""had one job to do to"". Neil Sorahan said ""various governments"" and airports needed to be held to account for ""not staffing up appropriately"". Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Holland-Kaye labelled those comments as ""bizarre"". He added: ""Airports don't provide ground handling, that's provided by the airlines themselves. So this is like accusing us of not having enough pilots."" John Strickland, an air transport consultant, said passengers ""don't care who's to blame, they just want to get away"". ""There's clearly a war of words going on,"" he said. ""I think it's not helpful, as everyone in the industry is exposed to this challenge, from airlines to airports to third parties such as handling agencies."" Mr Strickland said that the pandemic had led to staff shortages across the industry, and that it was still taking time to build numbers back up. ""It would've helped to have a deeper engagement earlier, between airlines and airports, to avoid these problems,"" he said. by Caroline Davies, BBC business correspondent Airports blaming airlines. Airlines blaming airports. But when will travel settle down? The long queues, lost bags and flight cancellations have soured the start of the summer for many travellers and left those still waiting to pack their suitcases feeling nervous about what awaits them. Heathrow said today that the cap on departing passengers is working, improving punctuality. It says the cap will be in place until airlines start to increase the number of ground handling staff which, by their estimates, might not be back to pre-pandemic levels for another 12 to 18 months. That means we could see the cap imposed again at busy periods like Christmas. Airlines have repeatedly said issues like queues at security are nothing to do with them and that airports need to improve their plans to get back to normal. But some airlines have struggled to recruit ground handling staff which has a knock-on effect on all the others. The idea of the cap cropping up again after the summer will fill many airlines with dread. Mr Holland-Kaye said the summer getaway had started well, but added that a shortage of airline ground handling staff was a constraint on Heathrow's capacity. He added punctuality had improved since the airport introduced a daily passenger cap. Earlier this month, Heathrow announced it was limiting the number of passengers who can depart each day over the peak summer months to 100,000. Mr Holland-Kaye said: ""We've seen a material improvement in performance since [the cap] came into place. ""Punctuality has improved, baggage performance has improved, and that shows that the difficult decisions we took two weeks ago are having the impact so that passengers can travel with confidence at Heathrow this summer."" Separately, EasyJet reported a pre-tax loss of Â£114m for the three months to the end of June, after taking a Â£133m hit from recent airport disruption. The Luton-based airline blamed ""widespread operational challenges"" and a ""tight labour market"" for flight cancellations. Speaking to BBC 5 Live, boss Johan Lundgren said: ""There's no airline, there's no ground handler, there's no airport who hasn't felt the pressure and the squeeze."" But he added that EasyJet's operations have now ""definitely stabilised"", adding: ""We are operating very much in line with 2019 levels of operational performance.""

The second head-to-head debate between Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak was in full swing when the host Kate McCann fainted live on air. Thankfully she's OK, but unfortunately he debate was not able to resume following medical advice. It all played out while Truss was discussing how to keep the public on side in supporting Ukraine, given the war's role in exacerbating rising energy and food costs during a cost of living crisis. During her answer, there was a loud bang - which led to the foreign secretary shouting ""Oh my god!"", put her hands to her mouth and then leave the stage to check on the stricken host. After the unexpected interruption, both candidates spoke to the studio audience - who had been previously grilling them alongside McCann.

involved in the debate is OK. From the head-to-head that we did witness, itâs obvious tax is still the key issue. Both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have fundamentally
different approaches when it comes to managing the economy. Sunak insists some tax rises will deal with inflation and pay
back debt; Truss believes tax cuts can stimulate the economy. And theyâre both willing to say their opponent is
âmorallyâ misguided on this issue. Those are pretty stern words for MPs to use
about party colleagues. Though tonightâs event seemed a bit better tempered than the
first debate, this contest has a long way to go. Sunak and Truss will start travelling the country
in the coming days for hustings with party members. No-oneâs voted yet, so this is a key period in the
contest. But the big question is how respectful can this competition
stay as they sling it out for votes? In the half hour before the debate went offline when presenter Kate McCann fainted, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss managed to touch upon some of the more contentious issues in this leadership contest, such as: The cost of living crisis  The NHS  Taxation Fellow TV presenters have complimented Kate McCann for how she was moderating the debate before she fainted. TalkTV host Tom Newton Dunn describes his colleague as ""one of the very best in the business at holding politicians to account"". She proved that in the first half hour of the debate, and she will prove that again. She is a fantastic talent and Iâm hugely proud of her.""  Sky's Kay Burley agrees, noting the TalkTV political editor was doing a ""senasational"" job in the 30 or so minutes she was in charge.  Iâm sure the candidates will return to continue the debate under her expert stewardship. Get some rest Kate x""  ITV's Paul Brand expresses sympathy to ""one of the smoothest operators in TV news"" over medical problems happening out of nowhere on air, pointing out he once ""suffered a wasp attack on live TV"" Very glad to hear sheâs OK and sheâll bounce back in no time.""  Liz Truss has also tweeted her support for TalkTV host Kate McCann, after the presenter fainted while hosting the leadership debate. Allow Twitter content?

This video can not be played As we've been reporting, the TalkTV debate abruptly went off air after an incident in the studio. Here's the moment when Liz Truss was interrupted mid-sentence after a crash is heard. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent A spokesperson for News UK, which owns the Sun, has said ""there was a medical issue, hope to
be back on air soonâ. A well informed source has told the BBC the Tory debate crashed off air because presenter Kate McCann is understood to have fainted and collapsed.

She was presenting alone, after Harry Cole pulled out with Covid. We'll bring you more when we have it. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent Something appears to have happened during the Talk TV debate. There was a loud crash, Liz Truss looked very concerned and then the programme was taken off air. The production teamâs main concern will rightly be ensuring everyone is OK, so itâs not clear if this debate will resume. Well, we're not sure exactly what's going on the TalkTV studio right now - as the feed has come off air. In the moments beforehand, the two Tory leadership hopefuls were discussing the UK's support for Ukraine. They'd been asked a question about the potential rise in energy costs to British households, as a result of sanctions against Russia. Sunak admitted that standing up to Russia's President Putin required ""toughness"" which could mean that all of us go through ""difficult times"". Truss said ""the cost of not doing anything to stand up to Putin is immense"". Shortly afterwards she looked panicked as a crash was heard in the studio, and the broadcast feed was cut. A moment of disruption while Liz Truss answers a question about the UK's support for Ukraine amid the Russian invasion. It appears a podium has been knocked over, but we don't know for sure. Truss looks panicked as a loud crash is heard in the studio. The broadcast feed has gone off air for now. Stay tuned as we bring you updates. Rishi Sunak has said he thinks it's ""reasonable"" to ask the largest companies to pay a bit more tax to help pay our debts. Liz Truss replies saying she thinks Sunakâs policies are making the UK less competitive. She warns against raising corporation tax too high, saying that the exchequer will get less money coming in. Moving away from the NHS now, and a question from a member of the audience who raises the rising cost of living, specifically the increased cost of meat. She asks should her family go vegetarian? Liz Truss responds that the global food crisis has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and Britain needs to look at producing more food domestically by cutting red tape for farmers. The UK needs a resilient food supply not be solely dependent on ""countries we can't trust"", she says. Truss adds that inflation is also a global problem, reiterating that tax cuts are needed as national insurance rises have been ""morally wrong"". Rishi Sunak's answer focuses on reducing inflation, turning again to his economic policies. He says supermarkets and other parties in the supply chain must be held to account to ensure prices are kept fair for consumers. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent The first topic up for discussion is the NHS, prompting less of a fiery start than last nightâs debate. Theyâre getting to talk with fewer interruptions this evening. Rishi Sunak highlights the extra health funding heâs provided through a national insurance increase introduced in April when he was chancellor. He calls this a âbraveâ decision, proving his commitment to the NHS. Ms Truss insists sheâs committed to this extra funding, but promises to reverse the increase in tax. How would she fund it? She says it can be done via general taxation, and says Mr Sunak did not have to take more money from peopleâs pay cheques. Weâre talking about the NHS, but weâve come back to taxes â the key dividing point between these two candidates. Both candidates are asked how long they were on hold for the last time they tried to book a GPs appointment. Sunak doesn't say when the last time he asked for an appointment, but does say he is currently relying on the NHS to care for his grandfather and daughter, who have been in hospitals recently for treatment Truss says she got good service before the pandemic the last time she needed to call 111, adding  her daughter has recently needed treatment for a hand condition and received a good service. She also says that friends of hers have had to wait much longer more recently and that she recognises it is difficult at the moment. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Former first minister Donald Dewar had concerns about providing compensation to survivors Scotland's inaugural first minister Donald Dewar feared compensating people infected by contaminated blood could result in an ""open cheque book"". The UK Infected Blood Inquiry was told that his concerns appeared in an email sent in September 1999. In the 1970s and 1980s, about 3,000 people in Scotland contracted Hepatitis C and HIV through blood products used to treat conditions like haemophilia. Those left with Hepatitis C did not receive financial support until 2004. Ministers given 'inaccurate' blood scandal briefing Contaminated blood: The Scottish questions The blood inquiry was set up in 2017 to examine what has been called the worst treatment disaster in NHS history. While many victims died others who were left with lifelong serious illness have provided evidence to the investigation which is being chaired by former QC Sir Brian Langstaff. The Haemophilia Society has long believed that some of these infections could have been prevented and that between 1985 and 1987, the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service was negligent in not using safer blood products. More than 3,000 people in Scotland were infected with contaminated blood Mr Dewar, who was Scotland's first minister following devolution, had faced demands to provide compensation to victims. On Tuesday the inquiry heard Scottish ministers were against providing payouts because the NHS had not been found to be negligent or at fault. Theemail sent on behalf of Mr Dewar,externalon 23 September 1999 said he was ""a little concerned about the possible financial implications and fears that an open mind could be taken to mean an open cheque book"". A handwritten note added that the then health minister Susan Deacon's office ""advises that this is very much a PR exercise and there is unlikely to be any compensation paid"". Ms Deacon is due to give evidence to the inquiry on Friday. The email was sent nine days after the health minister had met with the Haemophilia Society, pledging that an internal investigation into the Hepatitis C infections would be open and transparent. That probe concluded that no blame was attributable to the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service. This video can not be played Prof Aileen Keel told the inquiry: ""I certainly don't agree with the use of term 'PR exercise'."" Prof Aileen Keel, a haematologist who held several senior roles advising government between 1992 and 2015, told the inquiry that victims of the scandal received the best treatment at the time. However, she distanced herself from some of the comments in correspondence at the time. Prof Keel said: ""I certainly don't agree with the use of term 'PR exercise'. ""Undoubtedly, ministers were under great pressure to further investigate this area. And the Haemophilia Society undoubtedly had in mind compensation at the end of that period."" She added: ""However, I don't think that means that the internal investigation was not conducted in an entirely proper way â finding out the facts, detailing the chronology so that we could really understand whether what the Haemophilia Society were alleging was true or not. ""So the use of this terminology does not tally with my recollection of that period around the investigation."" The inquiry before Sir Brian Langstaff continues.

Tributes paid to 'man of courage and wisdom' Lord Trimble Lord Trimble: Life in pictures Former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern described Lord Trimble as a ""passionate and determined peacemaker"", pictured in June Former Taoiseach (Irish PM) Bertie Ahern, who led the Irish government at the Good Friday Agreement negotiations, said Lord Trimble was courageous and that although they had ""many a row, many arguments"", they were able to laugh about that in later years. ""We got on very well. We had lots of one-to-one conversations,"" he told theBBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""Of course we fought, of course we had differences and some of them were fiery. There's no use saying they were not. But we always kept negotiating and dealing with the issues in front of us. ""The reality is, in his time as first minister, with the up and downs and suspensions in the institutions, he stuck with it."" Gerry Adams, the Sinn FÃ©in leader at the time of the Belfast Agreement, said that although he and Lord Trimble had fundamentally different opinions, he always believed the then UUP leader was committed to the peace process. ""David's contribution to the Good Friday Agreement and to the quarter century of relative peace that followed cannot be underestimated,"" Mr Adams said. Current UUP leader Doug Beattie described Lord Trimble as a ""political giant"". ""David Trimble was a man of courage and vision. He chose to grasp the opportunity for peace when it presented itself and sought to end the decades of violence that blighted his beloved Northern Ireland,"" Mr Beattie said. U2 frontman Bono endorsed Lord Trimble and John Hume's calls for peace ahead of the 1998 referendum on the Good Friday Agreement ""The bravery and courage he demonstrated whilst battling his recent illness was typical of the qualities he showed in his political career, at Stormont and at Westminster."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson described Lord Trimble as ""a giant of British and international politics"". ""[He] will be long remembered for his intellect, personal bravery and fierce determination to change politics for the better,"" Mr Johnson added. Current Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin said Lord Trimble played ""a crucial and courageous role in bringing peace to Northern Ireland"". Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill said Lord Trimble's courage in helping negotiate the agreement ""leaves a legacy a quarter century on for which he and his family should be rightly proud"". Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the former first minister ""made a huge contribution to Northern Ireland, and to political life in the United Kingdom"" and was a ""committed and passionate unionist who always wanted the best for Northern Ireland"". David Trimble with his wife, Daphne, at the unveiling of a portrait of him at Queen's University in Belfast last month Sir Jeffrey's disagreements with Lord Trimble over the Good Friday Agreement led to him quitting the UUP in 2003 and defecting to the DUP. ""Whilst our political paths parted within the Ulster Unionist Party, there can be no doubting his bravery and determination in leadership at that time,"" Sir Jeffrey added. The Dalai Lama met Lord Trimble alongside the then Secretary of State Peter Mandelson and Seamus Mallon in the Waterfront hall on 20 October 2000, during his three-day visit to Northern Ireland Former prime minister Sir John Major, said: ""When David Trimble became leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, he made a critical contribution to the Northern Ireland peace process. ""He shed his former opposition to the process, and became an innovative advocate for a peaceful settlement. ""He thoroughly merits an honourable place amongst peacemakers."" But Lord Trimble also came in for sustained criticism from others within political unionism for signing up to  the Good Friday Agreement, particularly the DUP. He was criticised for agreeing a deal which allowed Sinn FÃ©in - the political wing of the IRA - to enter into the devolved government while the IRA had not decommissioned its weapons. In 2005, he lost his House of Commons seat to a DUP challenger and went on to enter the House of Lords where he sat as a Conservative Party peer. Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said the Good Friday Agreement was Lord Trimble's greatest legacy. ""His contribution to the peace process and the ending of violence in our society helped secure his place in history,"" she said. Labour party leader Sir Keir Starmer described him as a ""towering figure of Northern Ireland and British politics"".

"The Tory leadership debate on TalkTV is cancelled after presenter Kate McCann faints and collapses live on air In a statement, Talk TV says McCann is fine but ""the medical advice was that we shouldn't continue with the debate"" Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak had been taking part in a second head-to-head debate, this time for The Sun and TalkTV, when a loud crash was heard in the studio Truss looked panicked and the broadcast was suspended Earlier both campaign teams were urged ""to be mindful of tone"" and have a debate that's ""respectful and dignified"" During Monday's BBC debate in Stoke-on-Trent, Sunak and Truss talked over each other and clashed on taxes, their Brexit records and the schools they went to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says both Tory leadership candidates ""are the architects of the mess this country is in"" Edited by Andrew Humphrey Well, that didn't quite play out as we thought it would... The second head-to-head debate between Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak was in full swing when the host Kate McCann fainted live on air. Thankfully she's OK, but unfortunately he debate was not able to resume following medical advice. It all played out while Truss was discussing how to keep the public on side in supporting Ukraine, given the war's role in exacerbating rising energy and food costs during a cost of living crisis. During her answer, there was a loud bang - which led to the foreign secretary shouting ""Oh my god!"", put her hands to her mouth and then leave the stage to check on the stricken host. After the unexpected interruption, both candidates spoke to the studio audience - who had been previously grilling them alongside McCann. Thanks for sticking with us during the unexpected twist that has brought this page to a close a little earlier than anticipated. The writers today have been Emily McGarvey, Marita Moloney, Malu Cursino, Jack Burgess, Aoife Walsh, Laura Gozzi, James FitzGerald and Adam Durbin, while the page has been edited by Claudia Allen, Jeremy Gahagan, Nathan Williams and Andrew Humphrey. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent First of all, thankfully weâre hearing everyone
involved in the debate is OK. From the head-to-head that we did witness, itâs obvious tax is still the key issue. Both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have fundamentally
different approaches when it comes to managing the economy. Sunak insists some tax rises will deal with inflation and pay
back debt; Truss believes tax cuts can stimulate the economy. And theyâre both willing to say their opponent is
âmorallyâ misguided on this issue. Those are pretty stern words for MPs to use
about party colleagues. Though tonightâs event seemed a bit better tempered than the
first debate, this contest has a long way to go. Sunak and Truss will start travelling the country
in the coming days for hustings with party members. No-oneâs voted yet, so this is a key period in the
contest. But the big question is how respectful can this competition
stay as they sling it out for votes? In the half hour before the debate went offline when presenter Kate McCann fainted, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss managed to touch upon some of the more contentious issues in this leadership contest, such as: The cost of living crisis  The NHS  Taxation Fellow TV presenters have complimented Kate McCann for how she was moderating the debate before she fainted. TalkTV host Tom Newton Dunn describes his colleague as ""one of the very best in the business at holding politicians to account"". She proved that in the first half hour of the debate, and she will prove that again. She is a fantastic talent and Iâm hugely proud of her.""  Sky's Kay Burley agrees, noting the TalkTV political editor was doing a ""senasational"" job in the 30 or so minutes she was in charge.  Iâm sure the candidates will return to continue the debate under her expert stewardship. Get some rest Kate x""  ITV's Paul Brand expresses sympathy to ""one of the smoothest operators in TV news"" over medical problems happening out of nowhere on air, pointing out he once ""suffered a wasp attack on live TV"" Very glad to hear sheâs OK and sheâll bounce back in no time.""

This video can not be played As we've been reporting, the TalkTV debate abruptly went off air after an incident in the studio. Here's the moment when Liz Truss was interrupted mid-sentence after a crash is heard. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent A spokesperson for News UK, which owns the Sun, has said ""there was a medical issue, hope to
be back on air soonâ. A well informed source has told the BBC the Tory debate crashed off air because presenter Kate McCann is understood to have fainted and collapsed.

She was presenting alone, after Harry Cole pulled out with Covid. We'll bring you more when we have it. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent Something appears to have happened during the Talk TV debate. There was a loud crash, Liz Truss looked very concerned and then the programme was taken off air. The production teamâs main concern will rightly be ensuring everyone is OK, so itâs not clear if this debate will resume. Well, we're not sure exactly what's going on the TalkTV studio right now - as the feed has come off air. In the moments beforehand, the two Tory leadership hopefuls were discussing the UK's support for Ukraine. They'd been asked a question about the potential rise in energy costs to British households, as a result of sanctions against Russia. Sunak admitted that standing up to Russia's President Putin required ""toughness"" which could mean that all of us go through ""difficult times"". Truss said ""the cost of not doing anything to stand up to Putin is immense"". Shortly afterwards she looked panicked as a crash was heard in the studio, and the broadcast feed was cut. A moment of disruption while Liz Truss answers a question about the UK's support for Ukraine amid the Russian invasion. It appears a podium has been knocked over, but we don't know for sure. Truss looks panicked as a loud crash is heard in the studio. The broadcast feed has gone off air for now. Stay tuned as we bring you updates. Rishi Sunak has said he thinks it's ""reasonable"" to ask the largest companies to pay a bit more tax to help pay our debts. Liz Truss replies saying she thinks Sunakâs policies are making the UK less competitive. She warns against raising corporation tax too high, saying that the exchequer will get less money coming in. Moving away from the NHS now, and a question from a member of the audience who raises the rising cost of living, specifically the increased cost of meat. She asks should her family go vegetarian? Liz Truss responds that the global food crisis has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and Britain needs to look at producing more food domestically by cutting red tape for farmers. The UK needs a resilient food supply not be solely dependent on ""countries we can't trust"", she says. Truss adds that inflation is also a global problem, reiterating that tax cuts are needed as national insurance rises have been ""morally wrong"". Rishi Sunak's answer focuses on reducing inflation, turning again to his economic policies. He says supermarkets and other parties in the supply chain must be held to account to ensure prices are kept fair for consumers. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent The first topic up for discussion is the NHS, prompting less of a fiery start than last nightâs debate. Theyâre getting to talk with fewer interruptions this evening. Rishi Sunak highlights the extra health funding heâs provided through a national insurance increase introduced in April when he was chancellor. He calls this a âbraveâ decision, proving his commitment to the NHS. Ms Truss insists sheâs committed to this extra funding, but promises to reverse the increase in tax. How would she fund it? She says it can be done via general taxation, and says Mr Sunak did not have to take more money from peopleâs pay cheques. Weâre talking about the NHS, but weâve come back to taxes â the key dividing point between these two candidates. Both candidates are asked how long they were on hold for the last time they tried to book a GPs appointment. Sunak doesn't say when the last time he asked for an appointment, but does say he is currently relying on the NHS to care for his grandfather and daughter, who have been in hospitals recently for treatment Truss says she got good service before the pandemic the last time she needed to call 111, adding  her daughter has recently needed treatment for a hand condition and received a good service. She also says that friends of hers have had to wait much longer more recently and that she recognises it is difficult at the moment. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Heavy home drinking during the pandemic may have set habits that will lead to rises in alcohol-related deaths and illness in England, forecasters warn. The work, commissioned for the NHS, suggests even under the best-case scenario of people cutting back to pre-pandemic boozing levels, there could be 1,830 extra deaths within two decades. At worst it could be 25,000, along with a million extra hospital admissions. Experts say the findings are a wake-up call. The warnings come from two separate modelling studies - one by the Institute of Alcohol Studies and another by University of Sheffield. Both agree there could be a high toll of alcohol-related disease, premature deaths and hospital admissions, costing the NHS billions. Not everyone drank more during the pandemic. Surveys suggest, on average, light and moderate drinkers decreased their consumption. But heavy drinkers drank even more. Colin Angus, who led the University of Sheffield study, said: ""These figures highlight that the pandemic's impact on our drinking behaviour is likely to cast a long shadow on our health, and paint a worrying picture at a time when NHS services are already under huge pressure due to treatment backlogs.""

"The global growth outlook has ""darkened significantly"", the IMF says The UK is set for the slowest growth of the G7 richest economies next year, the International Monetary Fund has warned. It is predicting UK growth will fall to just 0.5% in 2023, much lower than its forecast in April of 1.2%. The global economy has shrunk for the first time since 2020, the IMF said, hit by the Ukraine war and Covid-19. With growth stalling in the UK, US, China and Europe, the world ""may soon be teetering on the edge of a global recession"", it said. ""We know that people are feeling the impact of rising prices, caused by global economic factors, triggered by the illegal Russian invasion of Ukraine,"" a HM Treasury spokesperson said in a statement, adding that help for households included Â£400 off energy bills plus personal tax cuts worth up to Â£330 a year. The IMF has cut its 2022 global growth forecast to just 3.2% and warned the slowdown risks being even more severe. It said fast-rising prices were to blame for much of the slowdown, with households and businesses squeezed by a combination of higher prices and higher borrowing costs as policymakers raise interest rates to try to counter inflation. ""The global economy, still reeling from the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, is facing an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook,"" economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in a blog outlining the international lending body's latest economic forecast. ""The outlook has darkened significantly"" since April, the last time the IMF issued forecasts, he added. Why is the UK economy suffering more than others? China economy shrinks on zero-Covid policy The global economy contracted in the three months to July, which was the first decline since the pandemic hit, the IMF said. The probability of a recession in the G7 economies - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US and UK - now stands at roughly 15% - nearly four times higher than usual. While UK growth is expected to remain relatively strong this year, Mr Gourinchas said unusually high inflation - faster than in Europe or the US - is expected to take a toll in 2023. ""If you were to look at both years together, it's actually not very far from where the other advanced economies are,"" he told the BBC. ""The one thing that worries me more about the UK economy is that their inflation numbers seem to be quite high. There is a fairly high pass through from high gas prices to broader prices in the economy. ""That would signal even further monetary policy tightening by the Bank of England and that would also weigh down on growth going forward."" The IMF now expects inflation to reach 6.6% in advanced economies and 9.5% in emerging market and developing economies - nearly a full percentage point higher than it expected in April. ""Inflation at current levels represents a clear risk for current and future macroeconomic stability and bringing it back to central bank targets should be the top priority for policymakers,"" Mr Gourinchas said. ""Tighter monetary policy will inevitably have real economic costs, but delaying it will only exacerbate the hardship."" The fallout from the war in Ukraine is being felt in pockets across the world. Soaring food and fuel prices and higher interest rates means the IMF sees more gloomy prospects for all major economies - but it's the UK that, Russia apart, remains bottom of the pile for 2023. Brexit may not have helped but it's our reliance on fossil fuels - they make up 75% of our energy mix, more than in the EU  - that's made us particularly vulnerable to this shock. Those prices are determined on international markets but affect us all. This report comes on the day that, with the energy price cap set to top Â£3,000 in October, a committee of MPs warns that further government help for households may be needed. But the IMF is among those economists who've noted that the UK faces more fundamental issues than the current crisis, with living standards having dropped behind many competitors over the last 15 years, something many attribute to a lack of investment in skills, equipment and infrastructure. Officials from the IMF have previously told me that one way to remedy that would be to raise, not lower taxes, to fund more investment. The US saw the steepest downgrade of any country for 2022. The IMF cut its growth forecast for the world's largest economy to 2.3% this year, from 3.7% previously, and to just 1% in 2023. Meanwhile growth in China is expected to fall to 3.3% this year, the slowest rate in nearly four decades, as the country wrestles with new Covid lockdowns and a property crisis. Questions about the reliability of Europe's natural gas supplies from Russia, as well as political unrest generated by high food and fuel prices, are among the risks the global economy is facing in the months ahead, the IMF said. ""We can be reasonably hopeful that China might be rebound,"" Mr Gourinchas said, adding that he was ""much more concerned about both the inflation path and the tightening of monetary policy leading to a slowdown going ahead"". It warned that in a ""plausible"" scenario, in which only some of those risks materialise, like a shutdown of Russian gas flows to Europe, global economic growth could fall to 2% next year - a pace the world has fallen below just five times since 1970.

"Biometric scanning allows pictures to be compared with a database of offenders The Southern Co-Op chain is facing a legal challenge to its use of facial recognition technology to cut crime. Big Brother Watch has complained to the Information Commissioner's Office about biometric surveillance at its shops. The privacy campaign group says the system at the convenience stores breaches data protection and people may end up on a watch-list without knowing. But Southern says it is only using the Facewatch system in shops with a history of crime, to protect its staff. The co-operative runs 200 convenience stores across southern England, of which 35 have the system installed. A single camera captures the faces of people who enter the shops, and the images are analysed and converted into biometric data. This is then compared with a database of people the co-operative says have stolen from its shops, or been violent. A spokeswoman said the watch-list was not a list of people with criminal convictions, but of people for which the business had evidence of criminal or anti-social behaviour. Any shopper previously banned would be asked to leave, and others would be approached by staff with an offer of ""how can I help?"" to make it clear their presence had been detected. Big Brother Watch has challenged the legality of the system in a submission to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), shared with the BBC. The group says the biometric scans are ""Orwellian in the extreme"". ""The supermarket is adding customers to secret watch-lists with no due process, meaning shoppers can be spied on, blacklisted across multiple stores and denied food shopping despite being entirely innocent,"" said Big Brother Watch's director Silkie Carlo. ""This is a deeply unethical and a frankly chilling way for any business to behave."" Face-collecting company database hacked Legality of collecting faces online challenged The complaint to the ICO claims the system breaches data protection laws because the information is processed in ways which are not proportionate to the need to prevent crime. Big Brother Watch argues that facial recognition is ""privacy-intrusive"" in general, and ""highly privacy-intrusive"" for people whose details are on the watch-list. This was not justified because the system was not necessary for preventing crime, it said. ""It does not bring serious criminals to justice... it does not protect the public from harm in any meaningful way,"" the complaint says. ""At best, it displaces crime, empowering individual businesses to keep 'undesirables' out of their stores and move them elsewhere."" The data produced from the facial recognition cameras is deleted after being compared with the watch-list, but the original picture is kept for 72 hours in case an individual subsequently breaks the law or is violent. Southern Co-Op said it would welcome any ""constructive feedback"" from the Information Commissioner. ""We take our responsibilities around the use of facial recognition extremely seriously and work hard to balance our customers' rights with the need to protect our colleagues and customers from unacceptable violence and abuse,"" it said. ""The safety of our colleagues and customers is paramount and this technology has made a significant difference to this, in the limited number of high-risk locations where it is being used. ""Signage is on display in the relevant stores. As long as it continues to prevent violent attacks, then we believe its use is justified."" Southern Co-Op has installed cameras at 35 shops The cameras are in use at Southern Co-Op shops in towns and cities including Portsmouth, Southampton, Bristol, Bournemouth, Hove, Croydon and Chichester. Facewatch also provides the biometric cameras to Costcutter, Sports Direct, Spar, Nisa stores and Frasers Group. The security system company said: ""Facial recognition may be used where it is necessary because other methods to prevent crime, such as policing, CCTV and manned guarding, have tried and failed. ""Any privacy intrusion is minimal and proportionate. Facewatch is proven to be effective at crime prevention, and our clients experience a significant reduction in crime.""

"This video can not be played WATCH: Our Next Prime Minister - BBC debate highlights Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss tore into each other over their rival visions for the future of the UK economy, in their first head-to-head TV debate. The two contenders to be the next PM did not hold back from ""blue-on-blue"" attacks in the hour-long BBC special. Mr Sunak told Ms Truss her tax cut plan would ""tip millions of people into misery"" and cost the Conservatives the next election. Ms Truss said tax rises brought in by him would lead to a recession. The foreign secretary and former chancellor, who until three weeks ago were in the same cabinet, talked over each other at times and shot angry glances across the stage at Stoke-on-Trent's Victoria Hall. It led to complaints afterwards by Ms Truss's supporters that the ex-chancellor was being too aggressive and was ""mansplaining"" - something fiercely denied by the Sunak camp. The pair were on better terms by the end of the debate, with Ms Truss saying she would ""love"" to have Mr Sunak on her team if she becomes PM. The ex-chancellor praised her stance on Russia. But the row over tax dominated the early exchanges. Five takeaways from a heated Truss-Sunak clash How accurate are Tory leadership polls? What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Ms Truss wants to scrap the rise to National Insurance, a planned rise in corporation tax and would temporarily scrap green levies on energy bills to be paid for through borrowing. Mr Sunak says he would not cut taxes until inflation was under control. Mr Sunak - who quit as chancellor earlier this month - said the coronavirus pandemic had created a large bill and that putting it on the ""country's credit card"" would ""pass the tab to our children and grandchildren"". This video can not be played Watch: Sunak and Truss angrily debate borrowing and debt Ms Truss insisted that under her plans the UK would start paying down the debt in three year's time - and paying it back straight away as Mr Sunak wanted to do would push the UK into a recession. Mr Sunak suggested her plans would lead to higher interest rates, but the foreign secretary dismiss this as ""scaremongering"" and ""project fear"" - an echo of the criticism aimed at the Remain campaign during Brexit referendum. Mr Sunak took this opportunity to point out that, unlike him, Ms Truss campaigned against Brexit. ""Maybe I learnt from that,"" she replied. She later said the Brexit referendum was when she had learnt not to trust Treasury forecasts on the economy. Other key moments in the debate included: Both candidates accusing the other of not having been tough enough on China in the past Ms Truss contrasting her comprehensive school education with that of Mr Sunak's, who attended the fee-paying Winchester College Mr Sunak said he was ""not going to apologise"" for his background, adding that his parents' aspirational values were Conservative - something that earned him the evening's first round of applause Mr Sunak's resignation as chancellor helped trigger the downfall of Mr Johnson. He praised Mr Johnson's handling of Brexit and the pandemic but said he had quit as a matter of principle over the PM's ""conduct"" and the fact that they had ""very different views about the direction of travel on the economy"". Ms Truss acknowledged the prime minister had made mistakes but said they were not ""sufficient"" enough for the Conservative Party to have ""rejected him"". Neither said they would accept Mr Johnson in their cabinet. Chief secretary to the Treasury and Truss-backer Simon Clarke told BBC Breakfast that polling after the debate showed the majority of Conservative voters thought his candidate had won the evening - and it had reaffirmed his view that she was the right candidate to lead the country. He refused to criticise Mr Sunak for interrupting, but said viewers would have to make up their own minds about his debating style. He added he thought Ms Truss had been ""cool, controlled"" and had made compelling arguments. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told BBC Breakfast the debate showed a Conservative Party which had ""lost the plot and lost its purpose"". He said Mr Sunak was acting like he had ""just come down from the moon"" and discovered the economy was in a bad way when he had been in charge of it until three weeks ago, while Ms Truss was playing ""fantasy economics"" without explaining how she would pay for tax cuts. ""We do need change in the UK but the change we need is not a change at the top of the Conservative Party, it is more fundamental than that. We need a fresh start for Britain. We need a Labour government,"" he said. A Liberal Democrat spokesperson simply said: ""Eurgh."" For all the talk of wanting the ""blue-on-blue"" attacks to subside - this debate showed they haven't gone away. Liz Truss's campaign accused Rishi Sunak of not letting her get a word in edgeways, and Rishi Sunak continued to slam Liz Truss's tax cut plans for not being economically sound. Sources close to Sunak said he had ""won the argument"" on the economy, with his argument that her tax cuts would further fuel inflation and push up interest rates and people's mortgages. Behind the scenes, Truss's camp feel positive too - claiming that while she stayed calm Sunak was ""flustered"". Debates about their backgrounds haven't gone away either. Both are keen to distance themselves from any suggestion they had certain privileges. Truss pointed to her comprehensive school education but distanced herself slightly, though, from the outright attacks on Sunak's clothing and education from some of her supporters. But the key battleground - and the biggest dividing line between the two - is still tax. What questions do you have about the Tory Leadership debate?

"Lord Trimble pictured in 2000 with former US president Bill Clinton, as well as Seamus Mallon (SDLP) and ex-prime minister Tony Blair Former US President Bill Clinton has paid tribute to former Northern Ireland first minister Lord Trimble, calling him a ""leader of courage and vision"". And former prime minister Sir Tony Blair said without David Trimble, the Good Friday Agreement would not have been possible. Lord Trimble died on Monday aged 77. He was instrumental in the negotiation of the 1998Good Friday Agreement. This was the peace deal which ended the worst of Northern Ireland's Troubles. Lord Trimble led the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) between 1995 and 2005. He won the Nobel Peace Prize, along with Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume and was the first person to serve in the role of first minister in the new Northern Ireland Executive established as part of the Good Friday Agreement. Obituary: Lord Trimble The Good Friday Agreement,external Lord Trimble and John Hume, who months later would be jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, with Tony Blair as they began to form a government for Northern Ireland in 1998 Since 2006, Lord Trimble sat in the House of Lords. In recent years, he was vocal in his opposition to theNorthern Ireland Protocol- part of the 2019 Brexit deal that keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, preventing a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. Lord Trimble argued that it put the Good Friday Agreement at risk. Assembly members look set to be recalled to Stormont next week to mark the death of the former first minister. They will be able to pay tribute to him at a special sitting on Tuesday. Lord Trimble's funeral is due to take place in Lisburn on Monday Books of condolence are being opened by a number of councils in Northern Ireland. Current Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie lays a floral tribute to Lord Trimble at Stormont In a statement, President Clinton said he and his wife were ""deeply saddened"" by Lord Trimble's death, saying his ""lifetime of service helped bring peace to Northern Ireland"". ""Time after time during the negotiations that led to the Good Friday Agreement, he made the hard choices over the politically expedient ones because he believed future generations deserved to grow up free from violence and hatred. ""His faith in the democratic process allowed him to stand up to strong opposition in his own community, persuade them of the merits of compromise, and share power with his former adversaries.  His legacy will endure in all who are living better lives because of him today."" Lord Trimble's political journey took him from a young hardliner in the 1970s to a unionist leader who compromised to help deliver an executive and assembly at Stormont where unionism and nationalism shared power. This video can not be played David Trimble: A life in front of the camera He received much praise for helping to bring to an end to decades of violence in Northern Ireland. Sir Tony said Lord Trimble's contribution to the peace process was ""immense"". ""It was a masterclass in leadership,"" he toldBBC's Radio Four's Today programme. ""He saw the chance of being able to settle the issue on terms that were acceptable to unionism. ""He was never in any doubt that he was going to be accused of betrayal. He paid the political price for that."" Lord Trimble at the Kings Hall in Belfast on 23 May, 1998, triumphantly holds the Belfast Telegraph after the majority Yes Vote mood for the Good Friday Agreement Sir Tony said Lord Trimble's vision for Northern Ireland was of ""a Northern Ireland healed and brought together in peace"". ""Once he said he would do something, he did it, that was absolutely invaluable to the trust needed to make the process work."" What is the Good Friday Agreement? Tributes paid to 'man of courage and wisdom' Lord Trimble Lord Trimble: Life in pictures Former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern described Lord Trimble as a ""passionate and determined peacemaker"", pictured in June Former Taoiseach (Irish PM) Bertie Ahern, who led the Irish government at the Good Friday Agreement negotiations, said Lord Trimble was courageous and that although they had ""many a row, many arguments"", they were able to laugh about that in later years. ""We got on very well. We had lots of one-to-one conversations,"" he told theBBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""Of course we fought, of course we had differences and some of them were fiery. There's no use saying they were not. But we always kept negotiating and dealing with the issues in front of us. ""The reality is, in his time as first minister, with the up and downs and suspensions in the institutions, he stuck with it."" Gerry Adams, the Sinn FÃ©in leader at the time of the Belfast Agreement, said that although he and Lord Trimble had fundamentally different opinions, he always believed the then UUP leader was committed to the peace process. ""David's contribution to the Good Friday Agreement and to the quarter century of relative peace that followed cannot be underestimated,"" Mr Adams said. Current UUP leader Doug Beattie described Lord Trimble as a ""political giant"". ""David Trimble was a man of courage and vision. He chose to grasp the opportunity for peace when it presented itself and sought to end the decades of violence that blighted his beloved Northern Ireland,"" Mr Beattie said. U2 frontman Bono endorsed Lord Trimble and John Hume's calls for peace ahead of the 1998 referendum on the Good Friday Agreement ""The bravery and courage he demonstrated whilst battling his recent illness was typical of the qualities he showed in his political career, at Stormont and at Westminster."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson described Lord Trimble as ""a giant of British and international politics"". ""[He] will be long remembered for his intellect, personal bravery and fierce determination to change politics for the better,"" Mr Johnson added. Current Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin said Lord Trimble played ""a crucial and courageous role in bringing peace to Northern Ireland"". Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill said Lord Trimble's courage in helping negotiate the agreement ""leaves a legacy a quarter century on for which he and his family should be rightly proud"". Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the former first minister ""made a huge contribution to Northern Ireland, and to political life in the United Kingdom"" and was a ""committed and passionate unionist who always wanted the best for Northern Ireland"". David Trimble with his wife, Daphne, at the unveiling of a portrait of him at Queen's University in Belfast last month Sir Jeffrey's disagreements with Lord Trimble over the Good Friday Agreement led to him quitting the UUP in 2003 and defecting to the DUP. ""Whilst our political paths parted within the Ulster Unionist Party, there can be no doubting his bravery and determination in leadership at that time,"" Sir Jeffrey added. The Dalai Lama met Lord Trimble alongside the then Secretary of State Peter Mandelson and Seamus Mallon in the Waterfront hall on 20 October 2000, during his three-day visit to Northern Ireland Former prime minister Sir John Major, said: ""When David Trimble became leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, he made a critical contribution to the Northern Ireland peace process. ""He shed his former opposition to the process, and became an innovative advocate for a peaceful settlement. ""He thoroughly merits an honourable place amongst peacemakers."" But Lord Trimble also came in for sustained criticism from others within political unionism for signing up to  the Good Friday Agreement, particularly the DUP. He was criticised for agreeing a deal which allowed Sinn FÃ©in - the political wing of the IRA - to enter into the devolved government while the IRA had not decommissioned its weapons. In 2005, he lost his House of Commons seat to a DUP challenger and went on to enter the House of Lords where he sat as a Conservative Party peer. Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said the Good Friday Agreement was Lord Trimble's greatest legacy. ""His contribution to the peace process and the ending of violence in our society helped secure his place in history,"" she said. Labour party leader Sir Keir Starmer described him as a ""towering figure of Northern Ireland and British politics"".

"The boss of Heathrow Airport has hit back at criticism from Ryanair, saying it is ""bizarre"" to blame airports for not having enough staff. John Holland-Kaye told the BBC it was up to airlines, not airports, to provide ground handling workers. On Monday, a Ryanair executivecriticised airports for not recruiting enough staffto cater for the rebound in travellers. Thousands of passengers have faced delays and cancellations recently. A shortage of staff has contributed to the disruption. Airports and airlines, which cut jobs during Covid lockdowns, have struggled to recruit workers as demand for travel has returned. Ground handling staff are responsible for a range of services at airports, including loading and unloading baggage. Heathrow tells airlines not to sell summer tickets Union suspends Heathrow refuelling staff strike The row comes as the UK's largest airport reported a Â£263m pre-tax profit for the first half of the year. However, on an adjusted basis, which strips out the impact of changes in interest rates, Heathrow posted a loss before tax of Â£321m for the period. On Monday, Ryanair's chief financial officer said airports had not recruited enough staff to cater for the rebound in travellers, saying they ""had one job to do to"". Neil Sorahan said ""various governments"" and airports needed to be held to account for ""not staffing up appropriately"". Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Holland-Kaye labelled those comments as ""bizarre"". He added: ""Airports don't provide ground handling, that's provided by the airlines themselves. So this is like accusing us of not having enough pilots."" John Strickland, an air transport consultant, said passengers ""don't care who's to blame, they just want to get away"". ""There's clearly a war of words going on,"" he said. ""I think it's not helpful, as everyone in the industry is exposed to this challenge, from airlines to airports to third parties such as handling agencies."" Mr Strickland said that the pandemic had led to staff shortages across the industry, and that it was still taking time to build numbers back up. ""It would've helped to have a deeper engagement earlier, between airlines and airports, to avoid these problems,"" he said. by Caroline Davies, BBC business correspondent Airports blaming airlines. Airlines blaming airports. But when will travel settle down? The long queues, lost bags and flight cancellations have soured the start of the summer for many travellers and left those still waiting to pack their suitcases feeling nervous about what awaits them. Heathrow said today that the cap on departing passengers is working, improving punctuality. It says the cap will be in place until airlines start to increase the number of ground handling staff which, by their estimates, might not be back to pre-pandemic levels for another 12 to 18 months. That means we could see the cap imposed again at busy periods like Christmas. Airlines have repeatedly said issues like queues at security are nothing to do with them and that airports need to improve their plans to get back to normal. But some airlines have struggled to recruit ground handling staff which has a knock-on effect on all the others. The idea of the cap cropping up again after the summer will fill many airlines with dread. Mr Holland-Kaye said the summer getaway had started well, but added that a shortage of airline ground handling staff was a constraint on Heathrow's capacity. He added punctuality had improved since the airport introduced a daily passenger cap. Earlier this month, Heathrow announced it was limiting the number of passengers who can depart each day over the peak summer months to 100,000. Mr Holland-Kaye said: ""We've seen a material improvement in performance since [the cap] came into place. ""Punctuality has improved, baggage performance has improved, and that shows that the difficult decisions we took two weeks ago are having the impact so that passengers can travel with confidence at Heathrow this summer."" Separately, EasyJet reported a pre-tax loss of Â£114m for the three months to the end of June, after taking a Â£133m hit from recent airport disruption. The Luton-based airline blamed ""widespread operational challenges"" and a ""tight labour market"" for flight cancellations. Speaking to BBC 5 Live, boss Johan Lundgren said: ""There's no airline, there's no ground handler, there's no airport who hasn't felt the pressure and the squeeze."" But he added that EasyJet's operations have now ""definitely stabilised"", adding: ""We are operating very much in line with 2019 levels of operational performance.""

"Fire chief Dave Swallow in the aftermath of a moorland fire south of Birmingham last week Last week's wildfires across London show that lessons learned tackling rural blazes must urgently be applied to built-up areas, fire chiefs say. The record-breaking heatwave, with 40C peaks, came during a prolonged spell of dry weather - and that dried out gardens, verges and green spaces. That helped to spark the kind of blazes more commonly seen in the countryside. More than 40 houses and shops were destroyedafter a number of grass fires spread to nearby buildings. The Met Office estimates that climate change makes the extreme heat seen last week in the UK 10 times more likely. Extreme heat and dry conditions are major factors contributing to wildfires. According to the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) there have been almost 500 wildfires so far this year alone in England and Wales, compared with 237 last year. NFCC lead wildfire tactical advisor David Swallow, who is also group commander for Hereford and Worcester Fire Service, said: ""Everything is bone-dry and services need to recognise the risk they've now got. If they don't, then they're naÃ¯ve. ""There are very urban services that think that wildfires are low down on the risk list. I understand the need to prioritise resources, but there needs to be a review."" A fire in Dagenham destroyed several homes and vehicles after spreading from nearby grassland The wildfire group that Mr Swallow leads draws its members - and expertise - from firefighters in predominantly rural areas more susceptible to such blazes, like Northumberland, South Wales, the Peak District, and Wiltshire. Mr Swallow believes that every fire service in the UK should have wildfire training. That way, forces could learn valuable tactics from firefighters more familiar with tackling blazes on grasslands, on moors and in woods. He said that his wildfire group had for some time been preparing for the increased risk of wildfires from climate change but  that the risk was now ""immediate"". But, last year, a report for the government's Third UK Climate Change Risk Assessment,externalfound that two out of eight fire services in the south east of England - identified as a key area at growing threat of extreme temperatures - made no reference to wildfires in their Integrated Risk Management Plans (IRMP). IRMPs are statutory strategy documents which outline every service's priorities and determine how resources will be allocated. Today, London Fire Brigade and Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service have no reference to wildfires in their IRMPs, while Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire services only have passing references. All the fire services said they followed national guidelines and worked to raise awareness of the risk of wildfires locally. A spokesman for Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service said: ""Moving forward, we will include more specific wildfire risk analysis as part of our new Community Risk Management Plan for 2023-2027."" A London Fire Brigade spokesperson said they were ""constantly looking at developing our equipment and procedures to meet all the new challenges that we face"". She added: ""We will learn lessons from the recent intense grass fires, evaluate our response and put in place any additional training that will help to keep Londoners and our firefighters safe."" Scorched earth must be dampened down - sometimes for days - to make sure it doesn't reignite South Wales Fire Service is seen as leading the way in its approach to wildfires. Its station manager, Craig Hope, is another of the UK's wildfire tactical advisers. His force keeps specialised lightweight kit, off-road vehicles, a controlled burns team and a helicopter on standby. However, 5,500 hectares of the Brecon Beacons National Park have already burned in wildfires this year. ""It's horrific, but we have predicted it,"" he said. ""I just don't think anyone would have predicted that it would happen so soon."" He added that years have been spent ""making little steps"" and that now is the time for ""big strides, because the climate is not on our side"". ""The fires we are seeing now are what they were getting in Spain in the 80s and 90s."" He urges authorities to invest more in developing a UK-wide ""national plan for wildfire"". One solution Mr Hope proposes is that, rather than each force individually spending money on improving its response, there should be funding for a deployable central specialised unit. Mr Hope added: ""The solutions are there. They are complex, but we all need to work together. ""By doing nothing, we risk losing everything."" The BBC went to the Malvern Hills to see the kind of expertise being  developed by rural fire crews working alongside landowners. Duncan Bridges, chief executive for the Malvern Hills Trust, works with the Hereford and Worcester Fire Service to map where the local access points are, and to understand how wind and fire are likely to travel through a landscape. The chief executive of the Malvern Hills Trust says he is strengthening plans to deal with wildfires As part of the trust's wildlife management, the keepers also help to reduce the amount of combustible vegetation, by rolling back bracken and allowing livestock to graze the grass. Mr Bridges says climate change means the prevention of wildfires is going to become ""increasingly more critical"". ""There doesn't seem to be any systematic approach across the whole country when it comes to dealing with landowners and land managers,"" he says. ""When dealing with fire prevention and fire safety, it's more a case of each one doing it their own way."" Defra has included wildfire in its national climate adaptation plan, and the Home Office  pointed out a plan for England it had published   last December outlined plans for ""close co-ordination... to provide an effective response to wildfire incidents."" It added: ""The government is committed to ensuring fire services have the resources they need to keep us safe, including from wildfires, and, overall, fire and rescue authorities will receive Â£2.5bn in 2022/23.""

The second head-to-head debate between Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak was in full swing when the host Kate McCann fainted live on air. Thankfully she's OK, but unfortunately he debate was not able to resume following medical advice. It all played out while Truss was discussing how to keep the public on side in supporting Ukraine, given the war's role in exacerbating rising energy and food costs during a cost of living crisis. During her answer, there was a loud bang - which led to the foreign secretary shouting ""Oh my god!"", put her hands to her mouth and then leave the stage to check on the stricken host. After the unexpected interruption, both candidates spoke to the studio audience - who had been previously grilling them alongside McCann.

David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent First of all, thankfully weâre hearing everyone
involved in the debate is OK. From the head-to-head that we did witness, itâs obvious tax is still the key issue. Both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have fundamentally
different approaches when it comes to managing the economy. Sunak insists some tax rises will deal with inflation and pay
back debt; Truss believes tax cuts can stimulate the economy. And theyâre both willing to say their opponent is
âmorallyâ misguided on this issue. Those are pretty stern words for MPs to use
about party colleagues. Though tonightâs event seemed a bit better tempered than the
first debate, this contest has a long way to go. Sunak and Truss will start travelling the country
in the coming days for hustings with party members. No-oneâs voted yet, so this is a key period in the
contest. But the big question is how respectful can this competition
stay as they sling it out for votes? In the half hour before the debate went offline when presenter Kate McCann fainted, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss managed to touch upon some of the more contentious issues in this leadership contest, such as: The cost of living crisis  The NHS  Taxation Fellow TV presenters have complimented Kate McCann for how she was moderating the debate before she fainted. TalkTV host Tom Newton Dunn describes his colleague as ""one of the very best in the business at holding politicians to account"". She proved that in the first half hour of the debate, and she will prove that again. She is a fantastic talent and Iâm hugely proud of her.""  Sky's Kay Burley agrees, noting the TalkTV political editor was doing a ""senasational"" job in the 30 or so minutes she was in charge.  Iâm sure the candidates will return to continue the debate under her expert stewardship. Get some rest Kate x""  ITV's Paul Brand expresses sympathy to ""one of the smoothest operators in TV news"" over medical problems happening out of nowhere on air, pointing out he once ""suffered a wasp attack on live TV"" Very glad to hear sheâs OK and sheâll bounce back in no time.""

This video can not be played As we've been reporting, the TalkTV debate abruptly went off air after an incident in the studio. Here's the moment when Liz Truss was interrupted mid-sentence after a crash is heard. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent A spokesperson for News UK, which owns the Sun, has said ""there was a medical issue, hope to
be back on air soonâ. A well informed source has told the BBC the Tory debate crashed off air because presenter Kate McCann is understood to have fainted and collapsed.

She was presenting alone, after Harry Cole pulled out with Covid. We'll bring you more when we have it. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent Something appears to have happened during the Talk TV debate. There was a loud crash, Liz Truss looked very concerned and then the programme was taken off air. The production teamâs main concern will rightly be ensuring everyone is OK, so itâs not clear if this debate will resume. Well, we're not sure exactly what's going on the TalkTV studio right now - as the feed has come off air. In the moments beforehand, the two Tory leadership hopefuls were discussing the UK's support for Ukraine. They'd been asked a question about the potential rise in energy costs to British households, as a result of sanctions against Russia. Sunak admitted that standing up to Russia's President Putin required ""toughness"" which could mean that all of us go through ""difficult times"". Truss said ""the cost of not doing anything to stand up to Putin is immense"". Shortly afterwards she looked panicked as a crash was heard in the studio, and the broadcast feed was cut. A moment of disruption while Liz Truss answers a question about the UK's support for Ukraine amid the Russian invasion. It appears a podium has been knocked over, but we don't know for sure. Truss looks panicked as a loud crash is heard in the studio. The broadcast feed has gone off air for now. Stay tuned as we bring you updates. Rishi Sunak has said he thinks it's ""reasonable"" to ask the largest companies to pay a bit more tax to help pay our debts. Liz Truss replies saying she thinks Sunakâs policies are making the UK less competitive. She warns against raising corporation tax too high, saying that the exchequer will get less money coming in. Moving away from the NHS now, and a question from a member of the audience who raises the rising cost of living, specifically the increased cost of meat. She asks should her family go vegetarian? Liz Truss responds that the global food crisis has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and Britain needs to look at producing more food domestically by cutting red tape for farmers. The UK needs a resilient food supply not be solely dependent on ""countries we can't trust"", she says. Truss adds that inflation is also a global problem, reiterating that tax cuts are needed as national insurance rises have been ""morally wrong"". Rishi Sunak's answer focuses on reducing inflation, turning again to his economic policies. He says supermarkets and other parties in the supply chain must be held to account to ensure prices are kept fair for consumers. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent The first topic up for discussion is the NHS, prompting less of a fiery start than last nightâs debate. Theyâre getting to talk with fewer interruptions this evening. Rishi Sunak highlights the extra health funding heâs provided through a national insurance increase introduced in April when he was chancellor. He calls this a âbraveâ decision, proving his commitment to the NHS. Ms Truss insists sheâs committed to this extra funding, but promises to reverse the increase in tax. How would she fund it? She says it can be done via general taxation, and says Mr Sunak did not have to take more money from peopleâs pay cheques. Weâre talking about the NHS, but weâve come back to taxes â the key dividing point between these two candidates. Both candidates are asked how long they were on hold for the last time they tried to book a GPs appointment. Sunak doesn't say when the last time he asked for an appointment, but does say he is currently relying on the NHS to care for his grandfather and daughter, who have been in hospitals recently for treatment Truss says she got good service before the pandemic the last time she needed to call 111, adding  her daughter has recently needed treatment for a hand condition and received a good service. She also says that friends of hers have had to wait much longer more recently and that she recognises it is difficult at the moment. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Lord Trimble pictured in 2000 with former US president Bill Clinton, as well as Seamus Mallon (SDLP) and ex-prime minister Tony Blair Former US President Bill Clinton has paid tribute to former Northern Ireland first minister Lord Trimble, calling him a ""leader of courage and vision"". And former prime minister Sir Tony Blair said without David Trimble, the Good Friday Agreement would not have been possible. Lord Trimble died on Monday aged 77. He was instrumental in the negotiation of the 1998Good Friday Agreement. This was the peace deal which ended the worst of Northern Ireland's Troubles. Lord Trimble led the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) between 1995 and 2005. He won the Nobel Peace Prize, along with Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume and was the first person to serve in the role of first minister in the new Northern Ireland Executive established as part of the Good Friday Agreement. Obituary: Lord Trimble The Good Friday Agreement,external Lord Trimble and John Hume, who months later would be jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, with Tony Blair as they began to form a government for Northern Ireland in 1998 Since 2006, Lord Trimble sat in the House of Lords. In recent years, he was vocal in his opposition to theNorthern Ireland Protocol- part of the 2019 Brexit deal that keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, preventing a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. Lord Trimble argued that it put the Good Friday Agreement at risk. Assembly members look set to be recalled to Stormont next week to mark the death of the former first minister. They will be able to pay tribute to him at a special sitting on Tuesday. Lord Trimble's funeral is due to take place in Lisburn on Monday Books of condolence are being opened by a number of councils in Northern Ireland. Current Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie lays a floral tribute to Lord Trimble at Stormont In a statement, President Clinton said he and his wife were ""deeply saddened"" by Lord Trimble's death, saying his ""lifetime of service helped bring peace to Northern Ireland"". ""Time after time during the negotiations that led to the Good Friday Agreement, he made the hard choices over the politically expedient ones because he believed future generations deserved to grow up free from violence and hatred. ""His faith in the democratic process allowed him to stand up to strong opposition in his own community, persuade them of the merits of compromise, and share power with his former adversaries.  His legacy will endure in all who are living better lives because of him today."" Lord Trimble's political journey took him from a young hardliner in the 1970s to a unionist leader who compromised to help deliver an executive and assembly at Stormont where unionism and nationalism shared power. This video can not be played David Trimble: A life in front of the camera He received much praise for helping to bring to an end to decades of violence in Northern Ireland. Sir Tony said Lord Trimble's contribution to the peace process was ""immense"". ""It was a masterclass in leadership,"" he toldBBC's Radio Four's Today programme. ""He saw the chance of being able to settle the issue on terms that were acceptable to unionism. ""He was never in any doubt that he was going to be accused of betrayal. He paid the political price for that."" Lord Trimble at the Kings Hall in Belfast on 23 May, 1998, triumphantly holds the Belfast Telegraph after the majority Yes Vote mood for the Good Friday Agreement Sir Tony said Lord Trimble's vision for Northern Ireland was of ""a Northern Ireland healed and brought together in peace"". ""Once he said he would do something, he did it, that was absolutely invaluable to the trust needed to make the process work."" What is the Good Friday Agreement? Tributes paid to 'man of courage and wisdom' Lord Trimble Lord Trimble: Life in pictures Former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern described Lord Trimble as a ""passionate and determined peacemaker"", pictured in June Former Taoiseach (Irish PM) Bertie Ahern, who led the Irish government at the Good Friday Agreement negotiations, said Lord Trimble was courageous and that although they had ""many a row, many arguments"", they were able to laugh about that in later years. ""We got on very well. We had lots of one-to-one conversations,"" he told theBBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""Of course we fought, of course we had differences and some of them were fiery. There's no use saying they were not. But we always kept negotiating and dealing with the issues in front of us. ""The reality is, in his time as first minister, with the up and downs and suspensions in the institutions, he stuck with it."" Gerry Adams, the Sinn FÃ©in leader at the time of the Belfast Agreement, said that although he and Lord Trimble had fundamentally different opinions, he always believed the then UUP leader was committed to the peace process. ""David's contribution to the Good Friday Agreement and to the quarter century of relative peace that followed cannot be underestimated,"" Mr Adams said. Current UUP leader Doug Beattie described Lord Trimble as a ""political giant"". ""David Trimble was a man of courage and vision. He chose to grasp the opportunity for peace when it presented itself and sought to end the decades of violence that blighted his beloved Northern Ireland,"" Mr Beattie said. U2 frontman Bono endorsed Lord Trimble and John Hume's calls for peace ahead of the 1998 referendum on the Good Friday Agreement ""The bravery and courage he demonstrated whilst battling his recent illness was typical of the qualities he showed in his political career, at Stormont and at Westminster."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson described Lord Trimble as ""a giant of British and international politics"". ""[He] will be long remembered for his intellect, personal bravery and fierce determination to change politics for the better,"" Mr Johnson added. Current Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin said Lord Trimble played ""a crucial and courageous role in bringing peace to Northern Ireland"". Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill said Lord Trimble's courage in helping negotiate the agreement ""leaves a legacy a quarter century on for which he and his family should be rightly proud"". Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the former first minister ""made a huge contribution to Northern Ireland, and to political life in the United Kingdom"" and was a ""committed and passionate unionist who always wanted the best for Northern Ireland"". David Trimble with his wife, Daphne, at the unveiling of a portrait of him at Queen's University in Belfast last month Sir Jeffrey's disagreements with Lord Trimble over the Good Friday Agreement led to him quitting the UUP in 2003 and defecting to the DUP. ""Whilst our political paths parted within the Ulster Unionist Party, there can be no doubting his bravery and determination in leadership at that time,"" Sir Jeffrey added. The Dalai Lama met Lord Trimble alongside the then Secretary of State Peter Mandelson and Seamus Mallon in the Waterfront hall on 20 October 2000, during his three-day visit to Northern Ireland Former prime minister Sir John Major, said: ""When David Trimble became leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, he made a critical contribution to the Northern Ireland peace process. ""He shed his former opposition to the process, and became an innovative advocate for a peaceful settlement. ""He thoroughly merits an honourable place amongst peacemakers."" But Lord Trimble also came in for sustained criticism from others within political unionism for signing up to  the Good Friday Agreement, particularly the DUP. He was criticised for agreeing a deal which allowed Sinn FÃ©in - the political wing of the IRA - to enter into the devolved government while the IRA had not decommissioned its weapons. In 2005, he lost his House of Commons seat to a DUP challenger and went on to enter the House of Lords where he sat as a Conservative Party peer. Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said the Good Friday Agreement was Lord Trimble's greatest legacy. ""His contribution to the peace process and the ending of violence in our society helped secure his place in history,"" she said. Labour party leader Sir Keir Starmer described him as a ""towering figure of Northern Ireland and British politics"".

"Ministers must offer bigger cost-of-living support payments as energy bills are expected to soar further this winter, a committee of MPs has said. Financial help for the vulnerable and poor needed to be ""updated"" to reflect higher bills in October, they said. Witnesses told the Business Committee: ""If you think things are bad now, you've not seen anything yet."" Its report also called energy regulator Ofgem ""incompetent"". Ofgem said it was working hard to reform the market. In recent days, millions of low-income households on benefits have been receiving the first Â£326 instalment of payments to assist with the rising cost of living. Further payments will come later in the year, including extra support for pensioners and people with disabilities, and a Â£400 discount on everyone's domestic energy bill. Those payments were set when the typical energy bill was anticipated to rise by Â£800 - a prediction Ofgem says is now too low. Influential industry analyst Cornwall Insight has predicted a rise of more than Â£1,200 a year in October, pushing the typical bill to Â£3,244 a year from October, then Â£3,363 a year from January. How is the rising cost of living affecting you? Get in touch. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy A normal bill at present is about Â£2,000 a year, which follows a Â£700 a year rise in April. The Business Committee's report said the government's support package was ""no longer sufficient"" ""The impact of the energy price crisis on households is likely to cause an unacceptable rise in fuel poverty and hardship this winter,"" the report said. ""The government must immediately update its support, targeting this at customers who are on low incomes, fuel poor, and in vulnerable circumstances, and develop a scheme to support vulnerable customers to accelerate the repayment of energy debt resulting from this crisis."" How will I get the cost-of-living payments? Fuel, milk and eggs push inflation to 40-year high How high will my energy bill go? The committee has been hearing from experts, ministers and industry insiders for months. ""We were told by a number of witnesses, 'if you think things are bad now, you've not seen anything yet,'"" said Darren Jones, who chairs the committee. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""No national government can control global inflationary pressures; however, we have introduced an extraordinary package of support to help households."" The wide-ranging report made a series of other recommendations, including: consideration of the introduction of cheap, social tariffs for the most vulnerable allowing prepayment meter customers to pay for energy after they have used it, rather than before bringing in a ""far-reaching"" insulation programme in UK homes Members of the Business Committeefollow the Public Accounts Committee of MPsin heavily criticising regulator Ofgem for its role in allowing suppliers to set up and operate without sufficient oversight. It said there was too much focus on competition instead. Owing to the failure of 29 companies, 2.4 million customers were moved to other suppliers, and often to more expensive tariffs, and one large supplier - Bulb - is in special administration. ""Ofgem has proved incompetent as the regulatory authority of the energy retail market over the last decade,"" the report said. ""It allowed suppliers to enter the market without ensuring they had access to sufficient capital, acceptable business plans, and were run by individuals with relevant expertise."" A spokesman for Ofgem said the regulator had been ""clear and transparent"" that suppliers and its own regime had not been robust enough. ""No regulator can, or should, guarantee companies will not fail in a competitive market but we are working hard to reform the entire market, as well as closely scrutinising and holding individual energy suppliers to account, to further strengthen the regulatory regime,"" he said. The committee also questioned the future of the price cap, which sets a limit on the cost of each unit of energy and the standing charge for domestic customers in England, Wales and Scotland. It said the government should consider a social tariff instead for the most vulnerable, and then a relative tariff for everyone else. Social tariffs were phased out by suppliers about a decade ago. Prepayment meter customers, who pay for their energy in advance, have a different - slightly more expensive - price cap. Citizens Advice has warned that the number of people seeking help because they cannot afford to top up their meter has reached a new record. This is known as self-disconnections and the committee said that Ofgem and suppliers should identify those at risk and allow them to pay for energy after they have used it. The MPs also called for an ""urgent, far-reaching, and long-term"" insulation programme for UK homes. How can better insulation cut energy bills? ""Ultimately, the UK needs to reduce its dependence on imported gas. Energy efficiency is the quickest and most cost-effective way to reduce gas demand and lower energy bills,"" the report said.

"The boss of Heathrow Airport has hit back at criticism from Ryanair, saying it is ""bizarre"" to blame airports for not having enough staff. John Holland-Kaye told the BBC it was up to airlines, not airports, to provide ground handling workers. On Monday, a Ryanair executivecriticised airports for not recruiting enough staffto cater for the rebound in travellers. Thousands of passengers have faced delays and cancellations recently. A shortage of staff has contributed to the disruption. Airports and airlines, which cut jobs during Covid lockdowns, have struggled to recruit workers as demand for travel has returned. Ground handling staff are responsible for a range of services at airports, including loading and unloading baggage. Heathrow tells airlines not to sell summer tickets Union suspends Heathrow refuelling staff strike The row comes as the UK's largest airport reported a Â£263m pre-tax profit for the first half of the year. However, on an adjusted basis, which strips out the impact of changes in interest rates, Heathrow posted a loss before tax of Â£321m for the period. On Monday, Ryanair's chief financial officer said airports had not recruited enough staff to cater for the rebound in travellers, saying they ""had one job to do to"". Neil Sorahan said ""various governments"" and airports needed to be held to account for ""not staffing up appropriately"". Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Holland-Kaye labelled those comments as ""bizarre"". He added: ""Airports don't provide ground handling, that's provided by the airlines themselves. So this is like accusing us of not having enough pilots."" John Strickland, an air transport consultant, said passengers ""don't care who's to blame, they just want to get away"". ""There's clearly a war of words going on,"" he said. ""I think it's not helpful, as everyone in the industry is exposed to this challenge, from airlines to airports to third parties such as handling agencies."" Mr Strickland said that the pandemic had led to staff shortages across the industry, and that it was still taking time to build numbers back up. ""It would've helped to have a deeper engagement earlier, between airlines and airports, to avoid these problems,"" he said. by Caroline Davies, BBC business correspondent Airports blaming airlines. Airlines blaming airports. But when will travel settle down? The long queues, lost bags and flight cancellations have soured the start of the summer for many travellers and left those still waiting to pack their suitcases feeling nervous about what awaits them. Heathrow said today that the cap on departing passengers is working, improving punctuality. It says the cap will be in place until airlines start to increase the number of ground handling staff which, by their estimates, might not be back to pre-pandemic levels for another 12 to 18 months. That means we could see the cap imposed again at busy periods like Christmas. Airlines have repeatedly said issues like queues at security are nothing to do with them and that airports need to improve their plans to get back to normal. But some airlines have struggled to recruit ground handling staff which has a knock-on effect on all the others. The idea of the cap cropping up again after the summer will fill many airlines with dread. Mr Holland-Kaye said the summer getaway had started well, but added that a shortage of airline ground handling staff was a constraint on Heathrow's capacity. He added punctuality had improved since the airport introduced a daily passenger cap. Earlier this month, Heathrow announced it was limiting the number of passengers who can depart each day over the peak summer months to 100,000. Mr Holland-Kaye said: ""We've seen a material improvement in performance since [the cap] came into place. ""Punctuality has improved, baggage performance has improved, and that shows that the difficult decisions we took two weeks ago are having the impact so that passengers can travel with confidence at Heathrow this summer."" Separately, EasyJet reported a pre-tax loss of Â£114m for the three months to the end of June, after taking a Â£133m hit from recent airport disruption. The Luton-based airline blamed ""widespread operational challenges"" and a ""tight labour market"" for flight cancellations. Speaking to BBC 5 Live, boss Johan Lundgren said: ""There's no airline, there's no ground handler, there's no airport who hasn't felt the pressure and the squeeze."" But he added that EasyJet's operations have now ""definitely stabilised"", adding: ""We are operating very much in line with 2019 levels of operational performance.""

"Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have gone head-to-head for the first time in a live TV debate hosted by the BBC after a week of increasingly personal attacks. One of them will be the next Tory leader - and the UK's next prime minister - voted in by members of the Conservative Party. In an hour of testy exchanges covering economic policy, China and even earrings - what were the standout moments? The short answer is no (even if they sometimes pretended). Within minutes, the two candidates were at loggerheads - and once again it got very heated, with multiple interruptions. Mr Sunak needs to make up ground if the polls are to be believed. He tried to get on the front foot and make the case for his cautious economic strategy right away, accusing Ms Truss of risking a huge increase in interest rates with her plans to cut tax immediately. He repeatedly came back to this, accusing his rival of wanting a short-term sugar high, which would be followed by an economic crash. Ms Truss disputed Mr Sunak's claim and argued she'll start paying back debt within three years. She accused him of ""scaremongering"" (more on the Brexit rhetoric later). Both candidates did try to be nice at certain points. Mr Sunak said he admired Ms Truss. She said he had good dress sense (after her supporter, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries, questioned the price of Mr Sunak's wardrobe - and contrasted it with Ms Truss's budget earrings). Despite the dress talk, there is a real battle for the ideological soul of the Conservative Party and there is a lot at stake. One of these two candidates will be prime minister in just over a month. But tonight was another example of how split the two candidates are on the party's future. A friendly exchange of ideas this was not - and you can see why some senior Conservatives are nervous about long-term damage being done to the party. With inflation at a 40-year high, economic policy has become the main battleground in this increasingly fractious leadership contest. Taking a combative tone, Mr Sunak and Ms Truss attacked each other's tax plans, producing some of the most explosive moments of the debate. Ms Truss has pledged about Â£30bn in immediate tax cuts, arguing they would boost economic growth, while Mr Sunak has said he would only slash taxes once inflation was under control. Who gets to choose the next PM? Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak policy guide What taxes would Tory leadership rivals cut? Ms Truss said the UK was heading for a recession if the country followed Mr Sunak's economic plans. Visibly peeved and shaking his head at that, Mr Sunak shot back with a bullish retort. He insisted the tax burden - the highest for 70 years - was the result of the unprecedented levels of government spending needed to keep the economy afloat during the Covid-19 pandemic. On Ms Truss's tax plans, Mr Sunak said: ""I don't think that's right, I don't think that's responsible, and I certainly don't think it's Conservative."" Squabbling ensued, with both candidates talking over each other, prompting moderator Sophie Raworth to intervene. A big debate on foreign policy has been on the UK's relationship with China. Mr Sunak and Ms Truss have been warning about the threat from the state. But they've also been clashing on who came to that conclusion first. It got heated here, too. Mr Sunak has been calling for a clampdown on Confucius Institutes in the UK. He denied having a dig at Ms Truss on this (she was an education minister when some of them opened). But he did suggest she had been on a ""journey"" when it came to China - arguing she had previously argued for a golden age in relations. Significantly, Ms Truss said she would like to see a clampdown on Chinese-owned companies like TikTok. There weren't any details - but many will be asking what measures she would introduce as prime minister. But she also tried to call out Mr Sunak - arguing that he was a recent convert to a clampdown on China. She said the Treasury had wanted closer ties when he was chancellor. Mr Sunak backed Brexit. Ms Truss backed remain, but has since become an enthusiastic supporter of life outside the EU. What was striking tonight was that Ms Truss used some of the language of the Leave campaign. In response to questions about her economic plans, she accused Mr Sunak of ""scaremongering"" and ""Project Fear"". That isn't just borrowing from the referendum handbook - it's a direct lift from the campaign. Mr Sunak was having none of it - reminding Ms Truss that he backed Leave, and so knew all about Project Fear. Speak to Tory MPs and many will admit their constituents aren't happy Mr Johnson is standing down. The spectre of the cabinet mutiny that brought the prime minister down is going to be a feature of the next few weeks. Mr Sunak is seen by some as betraying the prime minister. As a result, many of Mr Johnson's allies don't want the former chancellor to succeed him. Mr Sunak said tonight he was proud of the work he did in government, and resigning was a difficult decision he had made on principle. Ms Truss has the backing of some Johnson loyalists. She flagged tonight that she was an early backer of Mr Johnson and praised the ""brilliant job"" he did winning the 2019 general election. Significantly, she said tonight that the ""mistakes"" he made in office should not have brought him down. The debate ended with the quickfire round and one of the final questions was: what marks would you give Mr Johnson out of 10. Ms Truss said seven and then after some prevarication Mr Sunak came out with 10/10 for delivering Brexit - to some applause.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Our Next Prime Minister - BBC debate highlights Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss tore into each other over their rival visions for the future of the UK economy, in their first head-to-head TV debate. The two contenders to be the next PM did not hold back from ""blue-on-blue"" attacks in the hour-long BBC special. Mr Sunak told Ms Truss her tax cut plan would ""tip millions of people into misery"" and cost the Conservatives the next election. Ms Truss said tax rises brought in by him would lead to a recession. The foreign secretary and former chancellor, who until three weeks ago were in the same cabinet, talked over each other at times and shot angry glances across the stage at Stoke-on-Trent's Victoria Hall. It led to complaints afterwards by Ms Truss's supporters that the ex-chancellor was being too aggressive and was ""mansplaining"" - something fiercely denied by the Sunak camp. The pair were on better terms by the end of the debate, with Ms Truss saying she would ""love"" to have Mr Sunak on her team if she becomes PM. The ex-chancellor praised her stance on Russia. But the row over tax dominated the early exchanges. Five takeaways from a heated Truss-Sunak clash How accurate are Tory leadership polls? What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Ms Truss wants to scrap the rise to National Insurance, a planned rise in corporation tax and would temporarily scrap green levies on energy bills to be paid for through borrowing. Mr Sunak says he would not cut taxes until inflation was under control. Mr Sunak - who quit as chancellor earlier this month - said the coronavirus pandemic had created a large bill and that putting it on the ""country's credit card"" would ""pass the tab to our children and grandchildren"". This video can not be played Watch: Sunak and Truss angrily debate borrowing and debt Ms Truss insisted that under her plans the UK would start paying down the debt in three year's time - and paying it back straight away as Mr Sunak wanted to do would push the UK into a recession. Mr Sunak suggested her plans would lead to higher interest rates, but the foreign secretary dismiss this as ""scaremongering"" and ""project fear"" - an echo of the criticism aimed at the Remain campaign during Brexit referendum. Mr Sunak took this opportunity to point out that, unlike him, Ms Truss campaigned against Brexit. ""Maybe I learnt from that,"" she replied. She later said the Brexit referendum was when she had learnt not to trust Treasury forecasts on the economy. Other key moments in the debate included: Both candidates accusing the other of not having been tough enough on China in the past Ms Truss contrasting her comprehensive school education with that of Mr Sunak's, who attended the fee-paying Winchester College Mr Sunak said he was ""not going to apologise"" for his background, adding that his parents' aspirational values were Conservative - something that earned him the evening's first round of applause Mr Sunak's resignation as chancellor helped trigger the downfall of Mr Johnson. He praised Mr Johnson's handling of Brexit and the pandemic but said he had quit as a matter of principle over the PM's ""conduct"" and the fact that they had ""very different views about the direction of travel on the economy"". Ms Truss acknowledged the prime minister had made mistakes but said they were not ""sufficient"" enough for the Conservative Party to have ""rejected him"". Neither said they would accept Mr Johnson in their cabinet. Chief secretary to the Treasury and Truss-backer Simon Clarke told BBC Breakfast that polling after the debate showed the majority of Conservative voters thought his candidate had won the evening - and it had reaffirmed his view that she was the right candidate to lead the country. He refused to criticise Mr Sunak for interrupting, but said viewers would have to make up their own minds about his debating style. He added he thought Ms Truss had been ""cool, controlled"" and had made compelling arguments. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told BBC Breakfast the debate showed a Conservative Party which had ""lost the plot and lost its purpose"". He said Mr Sunak was acting like he had ""just come down from the moon"" and discovered the economy was in a bad way when he had been in charge of it until three weeks ago, while Ms Truss was playing ""fantasy economics"" without explaining how she would pay for tax cuts. ""We do need change in the UK but the change we need is not a change at the top of the Conservative Party, it is more fundamental than that. We need a fresh start for Britain. We need a Labour government,"" he said. A Liberal Democrat spokesperson simply said: ""Eurgh."" For all the talk of wanting the ""blue-on-blue"" attacks to subside - this debate showed they haven't gone away. Liz Truss's campaign accused Rishi Sunak of not letting her get a word in edgeways, and Rishi Sunak continued to slam Liz Truss's tax cut plans for not being economically sound. Sources close to Sunak said he had ""won the argument"" on the economy, with his argument that her tax cuts would further fuel inflation and push up interest rates and people's mortgages. Behind the scenes, Truss's camp feel positive too - claiming that while she stayed calm Sunak was ""flustered"". Debates about their backgrounds haven't gone away either. Both are keen to distance themselves from any suggestion they had certain privileges. Truss pointed to her comprehensive school education but distanced herself slightly, though, from the outright attacks on Sunak's clothing and education from some of her supporters. But the key battleground - and the biggest dividing line between the two - is still tax. What questions do you have about the Tory Leadership debate?

"David Trimble was the first person to serve as first minister of Northern Ireland Lord Trimble, former first minister of Northern Ireland and Ulster Unionist Party leader, has died. Lord Trimble, who was 77, led the UUP between 1995 and 2005, and was instrumental in the negotiation of theGood Friday Agreement- the peace deal which ended the worst of Northern Ireland's Troubles. His efforts won him the Nobel Peace Prize along with SDLP leader John Hume. Since 2006, he sat in the House of Lords as Baron Trimble of Lisnagarvey. He was the first person to serve in the role of first minister in the new Northern Ireland Executive established as part of the Good Friday Agreement. A statement from the UUP said: ""It is with great sadness that the family of Lord Trimble announce that he passed away peacefully earlier today following a short illness."" He is survived by his wife, Daphne and their four children. Obituary: Lord Trimble What is the Good Friday Agreement? Tributes paid to 'man of courage and wisdom' Lord Trimble Lord Trimble: Life in pictures Current UUP leader Doug Beattie described Lord Trimble as a ""political giant"". ""David Trimble was a man of courage and vision. He chose to grasp the opportunity for peace when it presented itself and sought to end the decades of violence that blighted his beloved Northern Ireland,"" Mr Beattie said. ""He will forever be associated with the leadership he demonstrated in the negotiations that led up to the 1998 Belfast Agreement. ""The bravery and courage he demonstrated whilst battling his recent illness was typical of the qualities he showed in his political career, at Stormont and at Westminster. Â Allow Twitter content?

Prime Minister Boris Johnson described Lord Trimble as ""a giant of British and international politics"". ""[He] will be long remembered for his intellect, personal bravery and fierce determination to change politics for the better,"" Mr Johnson added. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said Lord Trimble played ""a crucial and courageous role in bringing peace to Northern Ireland"". SDLP leader Colum Eastwood described him as ""one of the most consequential political leaders of the last century"". He added that without the former UUP leader's political bravery, the Good Friday Agreement would never have been signed. Lord Trimble was a hard-line political unionist leader who compromised at a critical time to cement peace in Northern Ireland. And it came at a great cost, not just a personal cost and the abuse that he received at the time, but also a great cost to his party. In the years after the Good Friday Agreement, the UUP lost its position as the top unionist party in Northern Ireland to the DUP. But there's no doubt about it, Lord Trimble got great international acclaim for the steps that he had taken, the bravery that he showed in negotiating a deal that others said was not going to be possible within a unionist leader. Of course he won the Nobel Peace Prize along with John Hume for his efforts. David Trimble often found himself facing down political adversaries And in later years, Lord Trimble became the great defender of the Good Friday Agreement in the House of Lords. In recent times, he talked about Brexit and of course his concerns about the Northern Ireland Protocol, and how he felt it undermined everything that he had achieved through the Good Friday Agreement. It was only a few weeks ago that Lord Trimble last made his public appearance at the unveiling of his portrait in Queen's University. On that occasion, he said the portrait was there for others on which to deliver their verdict. Many people now will be delivering their verdict on Lord Trimble, and his lasting legacy of peace in Northern Ireland. Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill said Lord Trimble's courage in helping negotiate the agreement ""leaves a legacy a quarter century on for which he and his family should be rightly proud"". Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the former first minister ""made a huge contribution to Northern Ireland, and to political life in the United Kingdom"" and was a ""committed and passionate unionist who always wanted the best for Northern Ireland"". Sir Jeffrey's disagreements with Lord Trimble over the Good Friday Agreement led to him quitting the UUP in 2003 and defecting to the DUP. ""Whilst our political paths parted within the Ulster Unionist Party, there can be no doubting his bravery and determination in leadership at that time,"" Sir Jeffrey added. Lord Trimble's political journey took him from a young hardliner in the 1970s to a unionist leader who compromised to help deliver an executive and assembly at Stormont where unionism and nationalism shared power. He received much praise, including the Nobel Peace Prize with Mr Hume, for helping to bring to an end to decades of violence in Northern Ireland. Mr Hume died in August 2020, a few months afterSeamus Mallon of the SDLP, who served as deputy first ministerwhen Lord Trimble was first minister. Bertie Ahern said Lord Trimble was a good negotiator Former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, who led the Irish government at the Good Friday Agreement negotiations in 1998, said Lord Trimble was courageous and that although they had ""many a row, many arguments"", they were able to laugh about that in later years. ""As a good negotiator, when he made a deal, when he settled something, he stuck by it,"" Mr Ahern told broadcaster RTÃ. ""He stuck by it subsequently and he paid a price, he lost his seat in Upper Bann, he got a lot of criticism from his wider unionist family. ""He was a good guy and he stood firmly by what he believed in and I had a long chat with him just a few weeks ago in Queen's [University] and he knew what was coming, he was brave in that, as he was in everything else."" Gerry Adams, the Sinn FÃ©in leader at the time of the Good Friday Agreement, said that although he and Lord Trimble had fundamentally different opinions, he always believed the UUP leader was committed to the peace process. ""David's contribution to the Good Friday Agreement and to the quarter century of relative peace that followed cannot be underestimated,"" Mr Adams said. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair - who headed the British side at the time of the 1998 peace talks - said Lord Trimble, ""in his support of the peace process, showed politics at its very best"". ""When some within his own ranks were opposed to the Belfast/Good Friday agreement, he supported it,"" he said. ""When we needed his willingness to go the extra mile for peace, he travelled that mile. When there was the prospect of collapse of the process without strong leadership, he provided that leadership. ""His contribution to Northern Ireland and to the United Kingdom was immense, unforgettable and frankly irreplaceable."" His predecessor, Sir John Major, said: ""When David Trimble became leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, he made a critical contribution to the Northern Ireland peace process. ""He shed his former opposition to the process, and became an innovative advocate for a peaceful settlement. ""This was a brave and principled change of policy, and critical to the creation of peace in Northern Ireland. ""He thoroughly merits an honourable place amongst peacemakers."" U2 frontman Bono endorsed Lord Trimble and John Hume's calls for peace ahead of the 1998 referendum on the Good Friday Agreement But Lord Trimble came in for sustained criticism from others within political unionism for signing up to the Good Friday Agreement, particularly the DUP. He was criticised for agreeing a deal which allowed Sinn FÃ©in - the political wing of the IRA - to enter into the devolved government while the IRA had not decommissioned its weapons. In 2005, he lost his House of Commons seat to a DUP challenger and went on to enter the House of Lords where he sat as a Conservative Party peer. Lord Trimble is survived by his wife Daphne (left) and their four children Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said the Good Friday Agreement was Lord Trimble's greatest legacy. ""His contribution to the peace process and the ending of violence in our society helped secure his place in history,"" she said. Labour party leader Sir Keir Starmer described him as a ""towering figure of Northern Ireland and British politics"". Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said that while he fundamentally disagreed with Lord Trimble over the Good Friday Agreement, he was a ""foremost thinker within unionism"".

"Fire chief Dave Swallow in the aftermath of a moorland fire south of Birmingham last week Last week's wildfires across London show that lessons learned tackling rural blazes must urgently be applied to built-up areas, fire chiefs say. The record-breaking heatwave, with 40C peaks, came during a prolonged spell of dry weather - and that dried out gardens, verges and green spaces. That helped to spark the kind of blazes more commonly seen in the countryside. More than 40 houses and shops were destroyedafter a number of grass fires spread to nearby buildings. The Met Office estimates that climate change makes the extreme heat seen last week in the UK 10 times more likely. Extreme heat and dry conditions are major factors contributing to wildfires. According to the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) there have been almost 500 wildfires so far this year alone in England and Wales, compared with 237 last year. NFCC lead wildfire tactical advisor David Swallow, who is also group commander for Hereford and Worcester Fire Service, said: ""Everything is bone-dry and services need to recognise the risk they've now got. If they don't, then they're naÃ¯ve. ""There are very urban services that think that wildfires are low down on the risk list. I understand the need to prioritise resources, but there needs to be a review."" A fire in Dagenham destroyed several homes and vehicles after spreading from nearby grassland The wildfire group that Mr Swallow leads draws its members - and expertise - from firefighters in predominantly rural areas more susceptible to such blazes, like Northumberland, South Wales, the Peak District, and Wiltshire. Mr Swallow believes that every fire service in the UK should have wildfire training. That way, forces could learn valuable tactics from firefighters more familiar with tackling blazes on grasslands, on moors and in woods. He said that his wildfire group had for some time been preparing for the increased risk of wildfires from climate change but  that the risk was now ""immediate"". But, last year, a report for the government's Third UK Climate Change Risk Assessment,externalfound that two out of eight fire services in the south east of England - identified as a key area at growing threat of extreme temperatures - made no reference to wildfires in their Integrated Risk Management Plans (IRMP). IRMPs are statutory strategy documents which outline every service's priorities and determine how resources will be allocated. Today, London Fire Brigade and Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service have no reference to wildfires in their IRMPs, while Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire services only have passing references. All the fire services said they followed national guidelines and worked to raise awareness of the risk of wildfires locally. A spokesman for Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service said: ""Moving forward, we will include more specific wildfire risk analysis as part of our new Community Risk Management Plan for 2023-2027."" A London Fire Brigade spokesperson said they were ""constantly looking at developing our equipment and procedures to meet all the new challenges that we face"". She added: ""We will learn lessons from the recent intense grass fires, evaluate our response and put in place any additional training that will help to keep Londoners and our firefighters safe."" Scorched earth must be dampened down - sometimes for days - to make sure it doesn't reignite South Wales Fire Service is seen as leading the way in its approach to wildfires. Its station manager, Craig Hope, is another of the UK's wildfire tactical advisers. His force keeps specialised lightweight kit, off-road vehicles, a controlled burns team and a helicopter on standby. However, 5,500 hectares of the Brecon Beacons National Park have already burned in wildfires this year. ""It's horrific, but we have predicted it,"" he said. ""I just don't think anyone would have predicted that it would happen so soon."" He added that years have been spent ""making little steps"" and that now is the time for ""big strides, because the climate is not on our side"". ""The fires we are seeing now are what they were getting in Spain in the 80s and 90s."" He urges authorities to invest more in developing a UK-wide ""national plan for wildfire"". One solution Mr Hope proposes is that, rather than each force individually spending money on improving its response, there should be funding for a deployable central specialised unit. Mr Hope added: ""The solutions are there. They are complex, but we all need to work together. ""By doing nothing, we risk losing everything."" The BBC went to the Malvern Hills to see the kind of expertise being  developed by rural fire crews working alongside landowners. Duncan Bridges, chief executive for the Malvern Hills Trust, works with the Hereford and Worcester Fire Service to map where the local access points are, and to understand how wind and fire are likely to travel through a landscape. The chief executive of the Malvern Hills Trust says he is strengthening plans to deal with wildfires As part of the trust's wildlife management, the keepers also help to reduce the amount of combustible vegetation, by rolling back bracken and allowing livestock to graze the grass. Mr Bridges says climate change means the prevention of wildfires is going to become ""increasingly more critical"". ""There doesn't seem to be any systematic approach across the whole country when it comes to dealing with landowners and land managers,"" he says. ""When dealing with fire prevention and fire safety, it's more a case of each one doing it their own way."" Defra has included wildfire in its national climate adaptation plan, and the Home Office  pointed out a plan for England it had published   last December outlined plans for ""close co-ordination... to provide an effective response to wildfire incidents."" It added: ""The government is committed to ensuring fire services have the resources they need to keep us safe, including from wildfires, and, overall, fire and rescue authorities will receive Â£2.5bn in 2022/23.""

"Heavy home drinking during the pandemic may have set habits that will lead to rises in alcohol-related deaths and illness in England, forecasters warn. The work, commissioned for the NHS, suggests even under the best-case scenario of people cutting back to pre-pandemic boozing levels, there could be 1,830 extra deaths within two decades. At worst it could be 25,000, along with a million extra hospital admissions. Experts say the findings are a wake-up call. The warnings come from two separate modelling studies - one by the Institute of Alcohol Studies and another by University of Sheffield. Both agree there could be a high toll of alcohol-related disease, premature deaths and hospital admissions, costing the NHS billions. Not everyone drank more during the pandemic. Surveys suggest, on average, light and moderate drinkers decreased their consumption. But heavy drinkers drank even more. Colin Angus, who led the University of Sheffield study, said: ""These figures highlight that the pandemic's impact on our drinking behaviour is likely to cast a long shadow on our health, and paint a worrying picture at a time when NHS services are already under huge pressure due to treatment backlogs."" The studies also highlight that the impacts are not evenly distributed across the population, with heavier drinkers and those in the most deprived areas - who already suffer the highest rates of alcohol harm - expected to be disproportionately affected. Poor areas spend more on lockdown alcohol I became alcoholic during lockdown Nicola Bates, from the Portman Group, the alcohol social responsibility body and marketing regulator, said: ""Total alcohol consumption has gone down consistently over the past 10 years, and Britons now drink around 15% less alcohol than they did 10 years ago. ""During the lockdowns the vast majority of people continued to drink moderately, and this research shows some lighter drinkers cut their consumption. ""However, there is a small minority who were already drinking at high harm levels when the lockdowns began, and evidence suggests some went on to drink more. The models presented in this research are stark, but they presume no interventions are made. ""This small minority of drinkers are the ones who need the most support with targeted action and a focused policy response."" Dr Sadie Boniface, from the Institute of Alcohol Studies, said: ""This research should act as a 'wake-up call' to take alcohol harm seriously as part of recovery planning from the pandemic.""

"Alix Popham played for Newport, Leeds, Scarlets and Brive In a house in Newport, three-year-old Darcy Popham plays with her toys in front of the family Christmas tree. Pointing at her dolls' house, she's explaining, with some conviction, why you should never put a table and a bed in the same room. In the room in question, there's a small figure of a bear with a light blue dress on, lying in front of a little table with one arm in the air, apparently in agreement. It seems to make perfect sense to me. ""She's going to big school next year,"" says mum Mel, pulling back her daughter's blonde hair. I suspect both the bears and mum are going to miss her. Dad Alix is never far away. Darcy has his piercing blue eyes, but she won't be following in his footsteps. ""She's actually a really good football player,"" says the former Wales and Scarlets number eight, with more pride than disappointment. Interior design or football it is, then. Alix, Mel and Darcy Popham are a happy trio. Yes, they are playing up a little for the TV cameraman, who is doing his best not to step on one of their four pet dogs, but there's no faking what the Pophams have. It's a bond that's been forged, not only in DNA but also in extreme adversity. Just over a year ago, 42-year-old Alix was diagnosed with early-onset dementia. The Pophams have already been open and honest about how their world fell in on them; about how this was not the plan and how they spent weeks in shock and in tears. They invited me to interview them at their home just weeks later - it was as raw and emotional as it gets. Mel even admitted to fainting just hours before we turned up but she was determined that their story should be told. The story is now well known. Alix and Mel are convinced Alix's condition is the result of years of head knocks sustained on the rugby field and in training. He, and others like him, are taking on the game's governing bodies in a legal fight that could set a precedent about how sport deals with concussion, and compensates those who may now be suffering as a result. Now, more than 150 former players, from journeymen to British and Irish Lions, have joined the fight and a group action is expected to be formally launched this year. The lawyers will do the hard yards in this particular tussle so Alix is focusing his attention and energy on helping others in a similar position. Head for Change is a charity set up by Alix and Mel for sportsmen and women who fear they are suffering mentally as a result of concussions. They want it to be seen as a safe space for like-minded people to share, confidentially, what their fears are and hopefully get the help they need. But it is not just former players who are reaching out. ""I've had conversations over the last year with around 20 players who are still involved in the game,"" says Alix. ""They're scared about coming forward and getting tested because they are scared of losing their jobs - that just isn't right."" Others have called him in the depths of despair. ""I've had interventions when people are suicidal and trust me, they are not nice texts to get,"" Alix adds. ""Thankfully we were able to get them the help they needed and things are more positive, but this is a real issue right now."" Talking to Alix and Mel, one year on from the last time, it is clear they have decided to throw themselves fully at this. The fight with the governing bodies will play out in the courts, potentially over years, but for obvious reasons, for the Pophams, this is a matter of life and death right now. They seem genuinely invigorated by the challenge - like the despair has also delivered them with an opportunity. ""This isn't something we need to focus on when more research comes out - the research is there,"" says Alix. ""One study shows 23% of current players with brain abnormalities - 50% of them are showing a brain that has decreased in size. ""Things need to change as soon as possible."" The tears that Mel could not hold back when she spoke to me last year have been replaced by a torrent of ideas - she is bouncing with enthusiasm and has a huge appetite to make a difference. ""Thinking back to two or three years ago when things were happening to us before the diagnosis, and thinking about how hard that was for both of us, it's really upsetting to think there are others out there going through the same thing - people who aren't aware that help and support is out there. I'm here to say that there absolutely is - do not suffer alone with this,"" she says. Dr Bennet Omalu: Rugby must settle with suing players or risk its future Premier League to trial saliva test to diagnose concussions Concussion in sport: Saliva test is 94% accurate in rugby union trial Alix has alreadytalked about his fearsthat Darcy will grow up without a dad. He has been candid with me that he might never walk her down the aisle on her wedding day, but is determined to make sure others do not have to feel that pain. He is also encouraged that change is coming, but frustrated that it seems to be taking time. World Rugby has put forward guidelines that would see full contact in training sessions limited to 15 minutes, something Alix and others have been campaigning for. ""There's not much more we can do to make the game safer on a Saturday,"" he says. ""But we can absolutely impact training sessions like the NFL did over a decade - we need to make limited contact in training mandatory."" Calls will be made to see who can be spoken to and contacts will be used to see what avenues can be opened in a bid to get there sooner. Husband and wife drive each other on and it is an impressive dynamic to witness. Change is coming to rugby and right in the eye of the storm, the Pophams are more than playing their part.
