"At least 18 councils across the UK confirmed on Thursday that they are experiencing ongoing disruptions to their bin collection services. It is due to staff self-isolating and a lack of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers for bin lorries. The Local Government Association (LGA) told the BBC that the delays were primarily affecting garden waste. However, some councils are also delaying recycling collections in order to prioritise general waste. It comes as three councils in Devon wrote to Home Secretary Priti Patel on Thursday, asking for the government to grant temporary visas for trained European HGV drivers to ease the shortage. Driver shortage: 'I got a big pay rise overnight' How serious is the HGV driver shortage? ""At the time of writing, North Devon Council are attempting to fill seven [bin lorry driver] vacancies, Torbay Council eight vacancies, and Teignbridge Council 10 vacancies,"" wrote councillors Steve Darling, David Worden and Alistair Dewhirst. ""This equates to approximately 20% of the HGV workforce in driver vacancies and it is proving very challenging to fill this resourcing gap given the dynamics of this labour market."" The UK currently has a shortfall of about 100,000 HGV drivers, after many EU workers returned home following Brexit and during the pandemic. Ministers say UK employers should hire locally to fill the gap, but the councils said it would take time to train the next generation of drivers. They also highlighteddelays in the current HGV driver recruitment process. ""With our efforts to 'grow our own' HGV drivers, we need their DVLA applications to be fast tracked, as for example in Teignbridge, there are five [bin lorry driver] applications in the system which if fast tracked could help partially tackle the challenges we face,"" the councillors stressed. The BBC understands that the DVSA has already increased the number of vocational tests from 2,000 a week to 3,000, and the DVLA are prioritising HGV provisional licence applications and taking about two weeks to issue them. Haulage firms are offering sign-on bonuses and pay rises but councils say this is affecting them and their partners Waste management giants Biffa, Veolia and FCC Environment told the BBC they are ""doing everything"" they can to mitigate the driver shortage. ""We are working hard to recruit new drivers, offering great rates of pay alongside fantastic benefits, as well as full training,"" said Biffa's human resources director Jane Pateman. Veolia said it currently has 180 bin lorry driver vacancies in the UK. In August, it launched a campaign encouraging mothers to consider a new career in driving for the waste management industry. ""To meet the industry-wide shortage of drivers, Veolia are offering incentives such as a sign-on bonus for new staff, and a retention bonus for existing drivers in areas where we are most affected,"" said Veolia UK and Ireland's chief human resources officer Beth Whittaker. ""We are also up-skilling existing staff and utilising our extensive apprenticeship scheme."" The councils confirmed to be experiencing ongoing bin collection delays are: Derby City Council Manchester City Council Milton Keynes Council South Gloucestershire Council South Holland District Council North Norfolk District Council Cambridge County Council South Cambridgeshire County Council Rossendale Borough Council Peterborough City Council Torbay Council Teignbridge District Council North Devon Council Stoke on Trent City Council South Ribble Council Dartford Council Dundee City Council Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council Recycling and waste management firm FCC Environment said it too was trying to attract more workers to the profession. ""We are focused on actively recruiting drivers across the country, offering local people local employment with job security in the waste and recycling sector, and an attractive package that includes flexible, part-time hours with no overnight stays, fitting around family life and helping work/life balance,"" said FCC Environment's operations director Steve Longdon. ""In the short-term in some areas, working in close agreement with our local authority partners, we have prioritised waste and recycling collections - enabling these to continue by temporarily suspending other services, such as garden waste collections, to allow us to reallocate drivers."" However the LGA said that the haulage industry was causing part of the problem: ""Fast inflating HGV driver salaries in the private sector risks exacerbating issues in the public sector, with the rises potentially creating a retention as well as a recruitment problem for councils and their contractors."" On Thursday, the LGAreleased a report,externalshowing 46% of councils in England and Wales experienced disruptions to their bin collection services in July. Dr Adam Read, director of external affairs at Suez Recycling & Recovery UK, told BBC Breakfast that chronic driver shortages had been going on for about 10 to 12 weeks. Veolia launched a campaign in August asking mothers to consider a new career in the waste management industry He set out what he sees as the benefits to working as an HGV driver in waste management: ""You might start early, but you finish early and you get to pick the kids up. ""You're not working long shifts and certainly not driving long distances, a lot of it is close to where you live - so there are some upsides to the sector."" He did concede, however, that waste collection firms do not typically pay as well as delivery agencies or supermarkets. ""In some geographies, we've seen some staff start to have their head turned by slightly better pay conditions,"" he added. In a bid to tackle the wider HGV driver shortage, supermarkets such asTescoand Aldi have increased wages or started to offer sign-on bonuses for delivery drivers. France closing its border with the UK in December 2020 led to a huge tailback as more than 6,300 lorries Before the pandemic, there was a shortage of an estimated 60,000 HGV drivers, according to theRoad Haulage Association,external, but that's now risen to 100,000. Since Brexit, many European drivers who worked in the UK have returned to their home countries or decided to work elsewhere due to the additional paperwork required at borders. It slows them down and costs them money, as they are often paid by distance covered rather than per hour. Pandemic travel restrictions and a lack of Covid tests for drivers have also played a part. Thousands of lorry drivers were forced tospend Christmas in their cabs in December, after France closed its border with the UK due to a backlog in coronavirus testing. About 4,000 lorries had to park at Manston Airport in Kent, with another 2,300 held on the M20, creating a long tailback.

"Warming in the Arctic region is being linked to extreme winter weather in the US A new study shows that increases in extreme winter weather in parts of the US are linked to accelerated warming of the Arctic. The scientists found that heating in the region ultimately disturbed the circular pattern of winds known as the polar vortex. This allowed colder winter weather to flow down to the US, notably in the Texas cold wave in February. The authors say that warming will see more cold winters in some locations. Weather-related disasters increase five-fold Climate change summit 'make or break' for planet One in three wild trees face extinction Over the past four decades, satellite records have shown how increasing global temperatures have had a profound effect on the Arctic. Queues form outside a grocery store in Austin, Texas, after the unexpected snow storm Warming in the region is far more pronounced than in the rest of the world, and has caused a rapid shrinkage of summer sea ice. Scientists have long been concerned about the implications of this amplification of global change for the rest of the planet. This new study indicates that the warming in the Arctic is having a significant impact on winter weather in both North America and East Asia. The researchers detail a complex meteorological chain that connects this warmer region to a rotating pattern of cold air known as the polar vortex. The authors show that the melting of ice in the Barents and Kara seas leads to increased snowfall over Siberia and a transfer of excess energy that impacts the swirling winds in the stratosphere above the North Pole. The heat ultimately causes a stretching of the vortex which then enables extremely cold weather to flow down to the US. There has been an increase in these stretching events since satellite observations began in 1979. The scientists believe this vortex stretching process led to thedeadly Texas cold wavein February this year. Fuel pumps out of action during the electrical grid shutdown in Texas during this year's cold wave ""We're arguing that melting sea ice across Northwest Eurasia, coupled with increased snowfall across Siberia is leading to a strengthening of the temperature difference from west to east across the Eurasian continent,"" explained lead author Dr Judah Cohen, who's a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a director of Atmospheric and Environmental Research, a weather risk management company. ""We know when that temperature difference increases, that leads to more disruptions of the polar vortex. And when it's weakened, that leads to more extreme winter weather such as the Texas cold wave last February."" Four ways climate change links to extreme weather A really simple guide to climate change The researchers say that their findings are based on both observations and modelling and they show a physical link between climate change in the Arctic, the stretching of the polar vortex and the impacts on ground. The authors believe their work could improve predictions about the onset of extreme cold winter events. ""One of the benefits of this study is that if you recognise these precursors and you know the conditions that are favourable for triggering such event, then you get to extend your forecast lead time,"" said Dr Cohen. ""In Texas, people could have certainly prepared better with better warnings, some people froze to death in their homes and perhaps they could have gone to seek shelter."" Looking at the bigger picture, the research team believes that their findings will help people understand that global warming is complex and perhaps dispel the idea that colder winters mean climate change isn't happening. ""There has been a long-standing apparent contradiction between the warmer temperatures globally, however, an apparent increase in cold extremes for the United States and in northern Eurasia. And this study helps to resolve this contradiction,"" said fellow author, Prof Chaim Garfinkel from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. ""In the past, these cold extremes over the US and Russia have been used to justify not reducing carbon, but there's no longer any excuse to not start reducing emissions right away.""

"Ben John was given a 24-month sentence, suspended for two years, at Leicester Crown Court The Attorney General has been asked to review a sentence given to a right-wing extremist for a terrorism offence. Ben John was handed the 24-month sentence, suspended for two years, at Leicester Crown Court on Tuesday. According to media reports, the 21-year-old was also ordered by a judge to read classic novels such as Pride and Prejudice and to return to court in January. In a letter, campaign group Hope Not Hate asked for a review of the case. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands John, of Addison Drive, Lincoln, was found guilty of possessing a record of information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism on 12 August. The offence under Section 58 of the Terrorism Act, which has a maximum sentence of 15 years' imprisonment, was brought following the discovery on a computer of a publication containing diagrams and instructions on how to construct various explosive devices. Lincolnshire Policesaid John had also amassed 67,788 documentsin bulk downloads on to hard drives, which contained ""a wealth"" of white supremacist and anti-Semitic material. During the sentencing hearing, Judge Timothy Spencer QC is reported to have asked John: ""Have you read Dickens? Austen? ""Start with Pride And Prejudice and Dickens's A Tale Of Two Cities. Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. Think about Hardy. Think about Trollope. ""On January 4 you will tell me what you have read and I will test you on it."" According to media reports, John was instructed to read classic novels, including Pride and Prejudice, as he was given a five-year serious crime prevention order The open letter, written by Hope Not Hate's chief executive Nick Lowles, stated: ""A suspended sentence and a suggested reading list of English classics for a terror conviction is unduly lenient for a crime of this nature. ""This sentence is sending a message that violent right-wing extremists may be treated leniently by the courts. ""That is a dangerous message to send when the far-right poses the fastest growing terror threat today. These sorts of lenient sentences risk encouraging other young people to access and share terrorist and extremist content because they will not fear the repercussions of their actions."" A spokesman for the Attorney General's Office said: ""We have received a request for the sentence of Ben John to be considered under the unduly lenient sentence (ULS) scheme. ""The Law Officers have 28 days from sentencing to consider the case and make a decision."" The unduly lenient sentence scheme covers a variety of serious offences including certain types of hate crime and some terrorism-related offences.

"Schools are not ""drivers"" or ""hubs"" of Covid infection, Public Health England's medical director has said. Dr Yvonne Doyle said she understood parents' nervousness about schools returning after the summer in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. She stressed that lots of measures to cut Covid spread remained in place. But Prof Calum Semple, a government scientific adviser, said with most adults vaccinated, schools were likely to be a ""greater part of the problem"". Some have suggesteda surge in cases in Scotland, where pupils returned in August, could be linked to schools. Fewer measures are in place in schools than during last term, with bubbles and masks no longer in use in England and Wales, while Northern Ireland has also scrapped social distancing requirements. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told BBC Breakfast it was right for children to have a ""much more normal education experience"", with adults being able to go back to the pub, music festivals and theatres. He said there needed to be a ""sensible balance"" and that was why mass testing of secondary school pupils was taking place. How are schools being kept Covid-safe this term? When do school pupils have to self-isolate? Mixed emotions as pupils return to English schools Dr Doyle said there were lots of regimes in place already to prevent the spread, including extra cleaning, advice on ventilation and testing. She said: ""We understand, and I understand fully, that parents may be nervous but I would stress again that schools are not the drivers and not the hubs of infection."" She added that PHE attributed some of the school-related coronavirus figures to the testing regime. This video can not be played Education Secretary Gavin Williamson says pupils deserve to have a normal education experience Prof Semple, professor of child health and outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool, said he believed schools should stay open ""nearly at all costs"" because the damage caused by a lack of education could be lifelong. He said while pupils were unlikely to get sick themselves they could transmit the disease to others, and that this should be considered when discussing vaccines for 12 to 15-year-olds. A paper,published by the Royal Society,external, suggests the reopening of schools, and particularly secondary schools, is associated with an increased risk of transmission both among school-aged pupils and in the wider community. But it said the scale of that increase depended on control measures in the classroom and community as well as compliance with mass testing. Prof Semple said his biggest worry was closing schools again because education was very important but he said school building stock was poor, with ventilation an issue. Both experts agreed that school is the best place for children. But vaccinating everyone else means that they'll look more like ""hubs"" than they did last year. If your problems get smaller and mine stay the same, I start to look worse than you. Last September, older teenagers and younger adults saw the fastest rises in infections and cases in England. This year, they'll be able to get vaccinated. Their place as ""leaders"" in infection rates and rises is likely to be taken by children because everyone else will have the vaccine to slow the spread. The decision about vaccination for under-16s is finely balanced because the risks of illness for children from Covid are so low. Parents have to balance the risks of Covid with the risks of disruption to education. Health experts currently appear more worried about missing education. Scientists have already said it is""highly likely"" that high levels of coronavirus will be seen in schoolsby the end of September. And there could be consequences for parents and carers, they say - but it remains to be seen what effect it will have on cases and hospital admissions. Imperial College epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson said the UK could expect cases to surge in step with what has happened in Scotland when schools return but the big unknown was how long that surge would last. He said that in a post-vaccine world the country could cope with much higher levels of cases and what ministers might consider an ""acceptable level of hospitalisation"" but he said that daily caseloads of 100,000 to 150,000 would put ""significant demands on the healthcare system"". In Scotland more than 32,000 pupils have been off school due to Covid-19 as of Tuesday - with 6,471 having the virus, up from 3,500 the week before, while a further 25,622 were isolating. Among the measures being implemented for safety in schools in England are carbon dioxide monitors to help improve ventilation,with 300,000 being made available, but when asked on BBC Breakfast Mr Williamson was unable to say how many were already in place. While CO2 monitors do not affect the transmission risk in schools, they can help to indicate how well ventilated a classroom is. Humans breathe out a higher concentration of carbon dioxide than is present in the atmosphere, so the monitors help to detect how much of the surrounding air has been breathed out, and how much is fresh air from outside. Asked about vaccinations for 12 to 15-year-olds the education secretary said parents would find it ""deeply reassuring to have a choice of whether their children should have a vaccination or not"" and that he was ""very keen"" to hear the decision from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). He said that government was ""ready to go"" if it did decide to extend the eligibility to children that age. Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the JCVI, said there were many arguments for and against vaccinating the age group but said whatever decision the committee reached would be in children's best interests. Prof Semple, who sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said it was a ""really difficult judgement"" with a fine balancing act between a ""rare side effect"", in myocarditis, and the low risk from Covid to children themselves and the impact of transmission on wider society.

"There are ""shocking failings"" and ""blatant hypocrisy"" in the way major UK religious groups handle child sex abuse allegations, an inquiry has found. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) said some religious organisations in England and Wales were ""morally failing"" children. It examined evidence from 38 groups, including those from Christianity, Orthodox Judaism and Islam. Leaders discouraged reporting abuse to protect reputations, the report found. It said the religious leaders also blamed victims for their abuse, and relied on religious dogma when responding to allegations. How the child sexual abuse inquiry works Church of England 'allowed child abusers to hide' Cardinal 'protected Church ahead of victims' The report,,externalwhich follows on from inquiries into the Catholic and Anglican Churches, comes after several weeks of public hearings held last year in which victims of abuse gave evidence. It covers a series of religious groups including Jehovah's Witnesses, Baptists, Methodists, Islam, Judaism, Sikhism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and non-conformist Christian denominations. The report said that many religious groups were putting children at risk by: Victim blaming Not openly discussing matters of sexuality Abuse of power by religious leaders Men dominating the leadership Mistrust of non-religious agencies Misusing the concept of ""forgiveness"" The inquiry found that in some communities ""the relationship between ideas of sexual 'purity' and social and familial standing are likely to make abuse markedly harder to report"". ""The imperative not to speak is bound up with notions of honour, with consequences for an individual's ability to marry, for their family and for the 'honour' of their community. In extreme cases, being seen as dishonourable can lead to violence against that individual or their family,"" it said. While the inquiry's press release was strongly worded, the report itself was more measured and Lloyd Evans, who campaigns against abuse in the Jehovah's Witnesses, told BBC News it was ""wishy washy"". Mr Evans, a former elder of the Jehovah's Witnesses, suggested that IICSA did not look at as much data as it could have - and that part of the problem was that the inquiry was ""under-funded"". Today's report from the inquiry is the 16th in three and a half years. With each one, the colossal scale and destructive force of child sexual abuse within British society is revealed. There is barely a corner of this country's institutional, cultural or spiritual life untarnished by the activities of abusers. Wherever the inquiry has looked, it has found. Religious organisations exist with an explicit purpose to teach right from wrong, but the authors of today's report suggest that only heightens the ""moral turpitude"" of their ""egregious"" failure in protecting children from harm. Time and again, they note how cries for help were ignored while perpetrators were protected. The inquiry suggests several reasons. Top of the list: victim-blaming, shame and honour, a sense that the abuse is somehow the child's own fault. Some faith leaders use theological texts to justify abuse and their elevated status to prevent disclosure. Smaller religious communities may be distrustful of external authorities and fearful of reputational damage. The report also suggests that in some religious settings, the concept of ""forgiveness"" is misused, to silence the abused and to justify not reporting abusers' terrible crimes. In about a year's time, the inquiry will publish its final overarching report. We already know it will be a very sobering read. The inquiry took more evidence about the Jehovah's Witnesses, which has 131,700 members in England and Wales, than any other group. The organisation has repeatedly been accused of covering up child abuse and told the inquiry allegations concerning 67 individuals had been reported to its branch office within 10 years. A particular concern in the report was that, while some organisations did have ""effective"" child protection policies, in some settings ""not even basic child protection procedures"" were in place. ""Religious believers can find it difficult to accept that members of their congregation or religious leaders could perpetrate abuse. As a result, some consider that it is not necessary to have specific child protection procedures or to adhere strictly to them,"" the inquiry concluded. In the case of the Jehovah's Witnesses, IICSA was particularly critical of a biblical rule applied by the group requiring two witnesses before an allegation of abuse is considered by elders. The Jehovah's Witnesses gave evidence that it also has policies requiring allegations to be reported to the police when there is a legal duty do so. However, the UK has no such ""mandatory reporting law"". IICSA strongly criticised the ""two witness rule"", saying it was likely to increase the suffering of victims, and failed to reflect the reality that ""child sexual abuse is most often perpetrated in the absence of witnesses"". A statement from the Jehovah's Witnesses said the protection of children was ""of utmost concern and importance to all Jehovah's Witnesses"" and they ""fully agree"" that all religious organisations should have a child protection policy. ""We will carefully and respectfully consider all the observations and recommendations contained in IICSA's investigation report,"" it added. The Union of Orthodox Hebrew Congregations, representing over 100 synagogues claimed its child protection hotline had only received four calls which ""raised concerns of a serious nature"". The Union provided no details of allegations of child sexual abuse within the previous 10 years to the inquiry. It told IICSA the ""prevailing environment and culture"" within the community led to a reduction in abuse compared with the population as a whole, according to the report. However, the inquiry said that while the figures it was given by religious organisations may reflect the ""known prevalence of child sexual abuse"", it was ""extremely unlikely that they reflect the full extent"". ""As a result of this investigation, a number of religious organisations have told us that they have altered, improved or recognised the need for policies and procedures in respect of child sexual abuse,"" the inquiry added. The inquiry in England and Wales was set up in July 2014 after hundreds of people came forward to say Jimmy Savile had abused them as children It is investigating claims against local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces and public and private institutions - as well as people in the public eye The inquiry is divided into public hearings into specific areas of concern, with witnesses giving evidence under oath; research into institutional failures in child protection, andthe Truth Project,,externalin which victims share their experiences with the inquiry either in private interviews or written form It heard evidence from 648 witnesses over four years, withthe final public hearingcoming in December 2020 The hearings have led to 16 reports so far, with another three to come this year. A final report will be published in 2022 Read morehere. The report gave the example of a girl who was sexually assaulted by a church volunteer when she was 12 years old. She disclosed the abuse to her mother, who reported it to the police. After being made aware of the allegations, a church minister told her mother that the abuser was ""valued"" and must be considered ""innocent until proven guilty"". Prof Alexis Jay, chairwoman of the inquiry, said: ""Religious organisations are defined by their moral purpose of teaching right from wrong and protection of the innocent and the vulnerable. ""However, when we heard about shocking failures to prevent and respond to child sexual abuse across almost all major religions, it became clear many are operating in direct conflict with this mission."" IICSA highlighted concerns that the law currently does not define religious leaders as holding a ""position of trust"" within child protection law. However, the inquiry did not make a finding requiring this to change. A final report following more than a dozen investigations is due next year. A key decision for the inquiry is whether to back ""mandatory reporting"" - a law making it a criminal offence for professionals not to report evidence of child abuse. Richard Scorer, a specialist abuse lawyer who acts for seven victim and survivor groups in the IICSA, said the latest report confirmed religious groups had ""catastrophically"" failed to protect children and the findings made the arguments for mandatory reporting ""overwhelming"". The Rev Dr Jonathan Hustler, secretary of the Conference of the Methodist Church, said the early indications from the report were that organisations were ""still failing their members"" and he said he was ""truly sorry"" when this happened in Methodist churches. The Muslim Council of Britain said the report made for ""difficult reading"" and said the protection of children should be at the centre of all Muslim institutions. Additional reporting by Katie Wright. Update 9 September 2021: This story has been amended after the IICSA issued a correction to its report ""to say allegations concerning 67 individuals and not 67 allegations"" had been reported to the Jehovah's Witnesses' branch office within 10 years.

"Jermaine (left) and Kofi Reid (right) pulled Frankie, 7, out of the lake when he fell off a jetty A mother whose young son fell into a lake has used social media to track down the two men who rescued him. Natasha Creek and Frankie, 7, were at Caldecotte Lake in Milton Keynes when he fell off a jetty last month. Brothers Kofi and Jermaine Reid were nearby and pulled him from the water but she said she was too shaken at the time to properly thank them. She found the pair after a Facebook appeal and was ""blown away"" to meet them again with the whole family. The family arranged to meet the brothers at a local pub after tracking them down using social media Mrs Creek said the incident, on 23 August, happened quickly and her son was not a strong swimmer. ""I was facing away for just a second and didn't hear him fall into the water as my dogs were making so much noise,"" she said. ""The two lads were sitting nearby, heard the splash and ran to drag him out. We still have our son because of their quick actions. They saved his life."" Determined to track them down, she wrotea Facebook post,externalwith a grainy picture taken just seconds before Frankie fell into the water. It was shared more than 400 times in 24 hours and a friend of one of the brothers came forward to put them in touch. Mrs Creek said: ""I am amazed at how quickly this all escalated - so many friends and complete strangers helping to find these two amazing lads."" Natasha Creek shared a grainy picture of her son and the then-strangers who rescued him at Caldecotte Lake in Milton Keynes The family - Natasha Creek, husband Phil, son Frankie and daughter Arabella - arranged to meet Kofi, 23, and Jermaine, 29, at a local pub. Mrs Creek said: ""We were blown away. They were the nicest guys and so humble about what they did."" Kofi described the reunion as ""the best thing"". ""They are such a loving family and it was a pleasure meeting and spending time together,"" he said. ""I'm just happy me and my brother were at the right place at the right time.""

"Alexanda Kotey (file image) An Islamic State (IS) group suspect from the UK has pleaded guilty in a US court to multiple charges relating to the murder of four American hostages. Alexanda Kotey is accused of belonging to an IS cell dubbed ""The Beatles"" which was involved in kidnappings in Iraq and Syria. The IS cell was allegedly responsible for the beheadings of a number of Western and Japanese hostages. Kotey, 37, pleaded guilty to all eight charges and now faces life in prison. He attended a change of plea hearing at a federal court in Alexandria, Virginia on Thursday, where he pleaded guilty to charges including hostage taking resulting in death and conspiracy to murder US citizens. ""Kotey has been afforded due process and in the face of overwhelming evidence, he made the independent decision to plead guilty to his crimes,"" lawyer Raj Parekh, a member of the prosecuting team, told reporters outside the court. ""He has agreed to spend the rest of his life in prison,"" he added. Who were the Islamic State 'Beatles'? Profile: Journalist James Foley Profile: Steven Sotloff Kotey and fellow ""Beatle"" El Shafee Elsheikh, 32, are on trial for their involvement in the murders of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and relief workers Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller. Both men are also suspected of involvement in the deaths of other hostages, including Alan Henning - a British taxi driver who was delivering aid - and Scottish aid worker David Haines, as well as two Japanese nationals. The pair initially pleaded not guilty at a hearing in October. The change of plea suggests Kotey may now co-operate with prosecutors. It is not yet clear whether Elsheikh has reached a plea deal with authorities. Clockwise from top left: Aid workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig, and journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley The two men were flown from US custody in Iraq last year to face the charges, which carry a maximum penalty of life in prison. Originally from west London, their alleged IS gang was given its Beatles nickname by hostages due to their British accents. They were stripped of their UK nationality in 2018. Some of the victims were beheaded, with their deaths filmed and broadcast on social media. The high-profile killings triggered outrage around the world. The group's alleged ringleader, Mohammed Emwazi, known as ""Jihadi John"", was killed in a drone strike in 2015. Another gang member, Aine Davis, was arrested and imprisoned in Turkey. Kotey and Elsheikh remained at large until they were captured in 2018 by Syrian Kurds fighting IS. UK sends US evidence on IS 'Beatles' Relatives of British IS hostage braced for trial The US government had wanted to put them on trial but was lacking evidence. The men were in a legal limbo for several months, held by the US military in Iraq where the US attorney general threatened to hand them over to local courts, known for their summary justice and executions. But the US said it would not carry out the death penalty if the men were convicted in a US court. British counter-terrorism officials have since shared crucial evidence with US officials. Elsheikh is scheduled to go on trial in January. Kotey's plea deal, meanwhile, carries a minimum sentence of life without parole. But after 15 years he would be eligible to be transferred to the UK to face any possible charges there. His sentencing is due to take place in March next year.

"This video can not be played Here we go again! Abba announce a new album and concerts - with a difference Pop legends Abba have surprised and delighted fans by announcing their first studio album for 40 years. Abba Voyage will be released in November, before a ""revolutionary"" set of concerts where virtual avatars will play hits like Mamma Mia and Waterloo. The quartet, who split up in 1982, said they ended up back in the recording studio while working on the stage show. ""At first it was just two songs, and then we said, 'Well, maybe we should do a few others,'"" said Benny Andersson. In the end, they recorded 10 tracks - two of which were premiered during a globally-streamed press conference on Thursday. The band first reconvened in the recording studio in 2018 The first, I Still Have Faith In You, is an affectionate piano ballad portraying the bond the four band members share. ""When Benny played the melody, I just knew it had to be about us,"" said Bjorn Ulvaeus, explaining the song's origins. Do Abba's new songs live up to their hits? Why the UK gave Abba 'nul points' at Eurovision Abba Gold spends record 1,000 weeks in UK chart ""It's about realising that it's inconceivable to be where we are. No imagination could dream up that, to release an album after 40 years and still be the best of friends, and still be enjoying each other's company, and have a total loyalty. ""Who has experienced that? Nobody."" Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

The second track, Don't Shut Me Down, is a mini-melodrama in the vein of the Abba classic The Day Before You Came, where a woman returns to her partner years after walking out. ""You asked me not to leave, well here I am again - and I love you still,"" sing Agnetha Faltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad in their trademark stacked harmonies. Both songs will feature on Abba Voyage when it is released on 5 November, with an eye on the lucrative Christmas market. The record will even include ""a little Christmas tune"", said Benny, as well as ""a number of pop songs"". He added: ""I think it's pretty good. We've done as good as we could, at our age."" Abba's records continue to sell and stream in the millions, almost 40 years after they split up The reunion had, for many years, seemed unlikely. The band reportedly turned down $1bn to tour in 2000. In an interview with the BBC in 2013,Agnetha saidshe preferred to leave Abba in the past. ""It was such a long time ago, and we are getting older, and we have our different lives,"" she explained. In a statement accompanying Thursday's announcement, the singer said she ""had no idea what to expect"" when they finally reconvened in 2018. ""But Benny's recording studio is such a friendly and safe environment, and before I knew it I was really enjoying myself!"" ""It was so joyful to be together in the studio again, the four of us, and hearing Frida and Agnetha going for it again,"" added Benny. But the pianist confessed to having nerves ahead of the initial recording session. ""Five minutes before they came into the studio, I was thinking, 'I should have asked if they can still sing,'"" he said. ""But they could and they can and you will hear it when you listen to the records."" However, neither singer attended the press launch in London's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. ""They should have been here,"" said Bjorn, half-joking, ""but they don't enjoy this [publicity] as much as Benny does."" The band's new songs will also be played during the band's virtual concert, also titled Abba Voyage, which will open next year in a specially-built arena in east London. Playing six nights a week, it will feature digital versions of Abba's band members, accompanied by a 10-piece live band performing 22 of their greatest hits. Tickets go on sale on 7 September, starting at Â£21, with the opening night on 27 May. Abba's Agnetha comes out of retirement BBC Radio 2's Abba Party The digital Abba show will initially be staged in London, but could tour the world The so-called ""Abba-tars"" were designed by Industrial Light and Magic - the visual effects company founded by Star Wars creator George Lucas. More than 850 people worked on recreating Abba ""in their prime"" using motion capture technology to scan ""every mannerism and every motion"" of the musicians, who are now in their 70s, as they performed. ""Agnetha, Frida, Benny and Bjorn got on stage in front of 160 cameras and almost as many VFX geniuses, and they performed every song in this show, to perfection, over five weeks,"" explained producer Ludvig Andersson. ""So when you see this show, it is not four people pretending to Abba, it is actually them."" Bjorn said the band had chosen London to premiere the show because ""London is the best city to be in when it comes to entertainment, theatre, musicalsâ¦ We have always felt that the Brits see us as their own."" Asked what he enjoyed most about being in Abba, Benny replied with refreshing honesty: ""Not having to worry about the money"". ""It's been a good thing for all of us,"" he continued. ""You are free to do anything. I just keep on writing music."" Here we are in 2021 with the first new Abba material since ET came out and, I'm happy to report, they haven't messed it up. We join Abba not as the pant-suited disco voyeurs of Voulez-Vous and Dancing Queen, but as they are now - in their 70s, reminiscing about their lives, and looking back at the music they made in their prime. The lead track, I Still Have Faith In You, is an ode to their friendship and to the bonds that have matured and survived despite divorce and heartbreak. Starting gently, it builds to an astronomical climax, full of power chords and dazzling harmonies, as the quartet declare: ""Through joy and the sorrow, we have a story and it survived.""

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"". This video can not be played Former member of Afghan parliament: 'The Taliban would've killed me if they found me' Former member of the Afghan parliament, Naheed Farid, left Afghanistan because she feared the Taliban could kill her, and she worried about the safety of her children. Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"". Click here to read more about what the Taliban takeover means for Africa's jihadists Guterres also warned of extremists feeling emboldened Welcome to our live coverage of the latest developments in Afghanistan. The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

"This video can not be played Here we go again! Abba announce a new album and concerts - with a difference Pop legends Abba have surprised and delighted fans by announcing their first studio album for 40 years. Abba Voyage will be released in November, before a ""revolutionary"" set of concerts where virtual avatars will play hits like Mamma Mia and Waterloo. The quartet, who split up in 1982, said they ended up back in the recording studio while working on the stage show. ""At first it was just two songs, and then we said, 'Well, maybe we should do a few others,'"" said Benny Andersson. In the end, they recorded 10 tracks - two of which were premiered during a globally-streamed press conference on Thursday. The band first reconvened in the recording studio in 2018 The first, I Still Have Faith In You, is an affectionate piano ballad portraying the bond the four band members share. ""When Benny played the melody, I just knew it had to be about us,"" said Bjorn Ulvaeus, explaining the song's origins. Do Abba's new songs live up to their hits? Why the UK gave Abba 'nul points' at Eurovision Abba Gold spends record 1,000 weeks in UK chart ""It's about realising that it's inconceivable to be where we are. No imagination could dream up that, to release an album after 40 years and still be the best of friends, and still be enjoying each other's company, and have a total loyalty. ""Who has experienced that? Nobody."" Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

The second track, Don't Shut Me Down, is a mini-melodrama in the vein of the Abba classic The Day Before You Came, where a woman returns to her partner years after walking out. ""You asked me not to leave, well here I am again - and I love you still,"" sing Agnetha Faltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad in their trademark stacked harmonies. Both songs will feature on Abba Voyage when it is released on 5 November, with an eye on the lucrative Christmas market. The record will even include ""a little Christmas tune"", said Benny, as well as ""a number of pop songs"". He added: ""I think it's pretty good. We've done as good as we could, at our age."" Abba's records continue to sell and stream in the millions, almost 40 years after they split up The reunion had, for many years, seemed unlikely. The band reportedly turned down $1bn to tour in 2000. In an interview with the BBC in 2013,Agnetha saidshe preferred to leave Abba in the past. ""It was such a long time ago, and we are getting older, and we have our different lives,"" she explained. In a statement accompanying Thursday's announcement, the singer said she ""had no idea what to expect"" when they finally reconvened in 2018. ""But Benny's recording studio is such a friendly and safe environment, and before I knew it I was really enjoying myself!"" ""It was so joyful to be together in the studio again, the four of us, and hearing Frida and Agnetha going for it again,"" added Benny. But the pianist confessed to having nerves ahead of the initial recording session. ""Five minutes before they came into the studio, I was thinking, 'I should have asked if they can still sing,'"" he said. ""But they could and they can and you will hear it when you listen to the records."" However, neither singer attended the press launch in London's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. ""They should have been here,"" said Bjorn, half-joking, ""but they don't enjoy this [publicity] as much as Benny does."" The band's new songs will also be played during the band's virtual concert, also titled Abba Voyage, which will open next year in a specially-built arena in east London. Playing six nights a week, it will feature digital versions of Abba's band members, accompanied by a 10-piece live band performing 22 of their greatest hits. Tickets go on sale on 7 September, starting at Â£21, with the opening night on 27 May. Abba's Agnetha comes out of retirement BBC Radio 2's Abba Party The digital Abba show will initially be staged in London, but could tour the world The so-called ""Abba-tars"" were designed by Industrial Light and Magic - the visual effects company founded by Star Wars creator George Lucas. More than 850 people worked on recreating Abba ""in their prime"" using motion capture technology to scan ""every mannerism and every motion"" of the musicians, who are now in their 70s, as they performed. ""Agnetha, Frida, Benny and Bjorn got on stage in front of 160 cameras and almost as many VFX geniuses, and they performed every song in this show, to perfection, over five weeks,"" explained producer Ludvig Andersson. ""So when you see this show, it is not four people pretending to Abba, it is actually them."" Bjorn said the band had chosen London to premiere the show because ""London is the best city to be in when it comes to entertainment, theatre, musicalsâ¦ We have always felt that the Brits see us as their own."" Asked what he enjoyed most about being in Abba, Benny replied with refreshing honesty: ""Not having to worry about the money"". ""It's been a good thing for all of us,"" he continued. ""You are free to do anything. I just keep on writing music."" Here we are in 2021 with the first new Abba material since ET came out and, I'm happy to report, they haven't messed it up. We join Abba not as the pant-suited disco voyeurs of Voulez-Vous and Dancing Queen, but as they are now - in their 70s, reminiscing about their lives, and looking back at the music they made in their prime. The lead track, I Still Have Faith In You, is an ode to their friendship and to the bonds that have matured and survived despite divorce and heartbreak. Starting gently, it builds to an astronomical climax, full of power chords and dazzling harmonies, as the quartet declare: ""Through joy and the sorrow, we have a story and it survived.""

"Patients will be put at risk unless the NHS receives an extra Â£10bn next year to recover from the pandemic, health bosses say A recommendation on whether under-16s should be offered Covid vaccines is due ""very, very soon"", the education secretary says A scientific adviser to the government said the decision should focus on ""what is best for the children"" Prof Peter Openshaw also warned that the UK's vaccine advisory group was at risk of making a decision on booster jabs too late Schools are not ""drivers"" or ""hubs"" of Covid infection, Public Health England's medical director has said Full vaccination against Covid-19 can cut the risk of developing long Covid by 50%, a study suggests The Duke of Sussex has called on governments to tackle the âhuge disparityâ in vaccine access worldwide Many pupils in the UK return to school today, amid concerns about the spread of Covid and funding Popular podcast host Joe Rogan, who controversially claimed young, healthy people did not need the vaccine, says he caught Covid but feels ""great"" Portugal has eased quarantine requirements for visitors from the UK, allowing non-vaccinated travellers to show a negative PCR test Edited by Alex Therrien We're now closing our coronavirus live page, but will be back tomorrow. Thanks for joining us. Thursday's coronavirus live coverage was written by Joseph Lee, Hazel Shearing and George Bowden, and edited by Alex Therrien and Rob Corp. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for today. But before we do, here's a look at the main coronavirus developments this Thursday: More news from Scotland, where thousands of long Covid patients are feared to have not been referred to a support service. Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland launched the service in February - but now says it cannot get in touch with patients because of ""NHS bureaucracy"". The Scottish government said it was working with the NHS, but ""no one approach"" would fit all circumstances. The latest figures from the ONS estimate 74,000 people in Scotland are living with ""self-reported"" long Covid. About 60,000 had experienced long Covid symptoms for more than 12 weeks and 28,000 for a year. Read morehere. Case rates are falling in all parts of England apart from the North East, according to Public Health England's latest weekly surveillance report. The highest rate is in the South West. There were 362.9 cases per 100,000 people in the week ending 29 August - down week-on-week from 491.1. London has the lowest rate, down from 256.3 to 226.8. In the North East, the rate has risen slightly from 306.5 to 314.9. In terms of age, the highest rate is among 10 to 19-year-olds (46.8) and the lowest is among those aged over 80 (110.3). Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at PHE, says: ""Cases remain high although fairly stable across the country. In the coming days and weeks, testing to return to school will detect cases of Covid-19 infection acquired during the summer holidays."" More than 32,000 pupils in Scotland were absent due to Covid this week, school attendance figures show. The figure includes those who had the virus, and those who are self-isolating as a close contact. School pupils in Scotland returned to classrooms two weeks ago - ahead of other UK nations. Pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland began their return to school on Thursday. Read morehere. A further 38,154 coronavirus cases have been reported across the UK, alongside another 178 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.  Vaccination for 16 and 17-year-olds began less than a month ago Vaccine uptake among 16 and 17-year-olds has been ""strong"", England's top GP said, as figures showed almost two-thirds of this age group in Wales (63%) and half in England have had one jab. In Scotland, the figure is 51% and in Northern Ireland it is 40%. Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and deputy lead for NHS Englandâs vaccination programme, said it was important for eligible young people to be get vaccinated as schools, colleges and universities begin term. Some nightclubs, places of worship and university campuses would be offering the jab this weekend in an effort to make it as convenient as possible, she said. They include London's G-A-Y club, the Hindu Temple in Crawley and the University of Kentâs Canterbury Campus. NHS England said 620,000 people aged 16 and 17 had now received the first dose of the vaccine. The UK vaccine advisory group the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has yet to say when people in this age group will be offered a second dose. Prof Calum Semple said he was targeted by anti-vaccination groups but abuse has come from all sides Scientists on the government's advisory committee Sage have been sent suspicious packages by members of the public who feel they are ""making bad decisions"", one of them has revealed. Prof Calum Semple from the University of Liverpool, who has frequently appeared in the media to offer expert views on the Covid-19 pandemic, was asked at a Royal Society of Medicine webinar about the abuse science advisers had received. Society president Prof Roger Kirby asked him about being ""targeted by the anti-vax group"" and suggested someone had posted messages saying ""Calum kills wildlife for fun"" and mentioned where the scientist lives. Prof Semple confirmed that and added: ""We are fortunate that the police are open to hearing from us and thereâs good liaison support for us when these threats are made. That was one particularly nasty event. âThere have been others since then and suspicious packages sent to Sage members and myself. âThis comes from both extremes â people that feel that weâre making bad decisions and they donât appreciate that Sage is not a decision-making body.â Sage - the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies - provides technical advice to ministers during a crisis but decisions are taken by ministers. Covid-19 vaccines in England are estimated to have directly averted more than 143,600 hospital admissions in those over 65, according to new figures from Public Health England. PHE said it was likely to be an underestimate due to the way the figure is calculated. Approximately 36,100 admissions were prevented in those aged 65
to 74, 58,800 in those aged 75 to 84, and 48,700 in those aged 85 and over. Estimates for the number of deaths in England directly averted by the vaccine rollout are unchanged at between 102,500 and 109,500. The first jab outside of a trial was administered in England in December 2020. Since then, more than 48 million first doses have been recorded across the UK. It is ""too early to predict"" whether supermarkets will have supply issues at Christmastime, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) says. Andrew Opie, the BRC's head of food and sustainability, says it is ""not anticipating major problems for Christmas at the moment"", but adds the festive period would be ""incredibly challenging in some areas"". ""If we do see problems then that is going to have an impact on products on the shelf,"" he tells the UK Trade and Business Commission, a group of MPs and business representatives. Alex Veitch from Logistics UK says there has been a shortage of lorry drivers for several years, but this is now an ""acute shortage"". There is a shortage of more than 100,000 drivers in the UK, according to the Road Haulage Association. ""It's really to do with Covid to a very large extent, and Brexit to a lesser extent, added to the long-term chronic problem of not enough people joining the sector,"" Veitch says . The BRC and others want the government to grant a 12-month Covid-19 recovery visa to allow workers from Europe to make up for skills shortages - not only as HGV drivers, but also in roles in food manufacturing and processing. This video can not be played BBC reporter Lucy Adams investigated long Covid after she and her daughter developed the illness As we've been reporting today, a new study suggestsbeing fully vaccinated can cut your chance of getting long Covideven if you get a rare breakthrough infection. But what is long Covid? Guidance for health workers defines long Covid as symptoms lasting for more than 12 weeks which can't be explained by another cause. They can follow a severe or a mild infection. The NHS says symptoms can include:  One large study found 200 symptoms affecting 10 organ systems in people with long Covid. They included hallucinations, insomnia, hearing and vision changes, short-term memory loss and speech and language issues. Others have reported gastro-intestinal and bladder problems, changes to periods and skin conditions. The severity of symptoms varies, but many have been left unable to perform tasks like showering, grocery shopping and remembering words. There is currently no test. Instead, doctors diagnose it in people who have had a Covid infection by ruling out other causes. Read more about long Covid Ministers should do more to prepare the public for the fact there will be waves of higher levels of infection this winter, according to the new director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Prof Liam Smeeth says he does not think there will be a return to severe lockdown restrictions as weâve seen before and that for most doubled-jabbed adults Covid will now be a ""fairly benign disease"". But he adds that the government cannot take its foot off all controls because of the numbers of people still unvaccinated who are vulnerable to severe disease. Rather than see strict lockdowns, he says there might be periods when the public need to be encouraged not to mix so much, to wear masks in indoor spaces and not to go to hospital unless really necessary. Mum Clare is relieved schools are opening with fewer restrictions Parents have been sharing their contrasting emotionsas schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland welcome back pupils for the new academic year. Clare Smyth, from Cambridgeshire, has two young sons in primary school - Seb, 10, and Joshua, who is seven. She is ""overjoyed"" that the start of term will see restrictions eased in schools. ""I'm really relieved that our school has decided to stop all social distancing restrictions - bubbles, zones in the playground. But I'm apprehensive for the winter as the season progresses, as to whether the restrictions will return,"" she says. Lisa will not be sending her children back to school Lisa Diaz's children Alex, 11, and eight-year-old Helena have not been into their Wigan primary school for more than a year after she pulled them out 10 days before the first lockdown. She says she is so angry and worried about the lack of safety measures in place this term that they won't be returning, even though she has been threatened with fines or even prison. Lisa has a genetic blood disorder which makes her particularly concerned that when schools reopen ""there will be nothing between our children and Covid-19"". Lisa says she was ""devastated"" by the choice and would like to see many more safety measures in schools, such as masks and social distancing. ""I'm not saying it's an easy decision. I fully empathise with parents up and down the country,"" she says. Read more parents' stories here. The shadow education secretary criticised the decision to end mask requirements in schools More on the return to school, as Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green accuses the government of ""sitting on its hands"" instead of preparing for the reopening. She tells the BBC News Channel that Labour had been ""pleading for months"" for a range of measures to be implemented in schools, including robust ventilation systems rather than simply monitoring levels of CO2 as the government has proposed. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson should put his ""foot on the accelerator"" to improve ventilation, she said. Asked if Labour wanted to see masks in schools, Green says she's ""at a loss"" to explain why they were made voluntary while infection rates are rising. She says many head teachers will make sensible decisions for their own schools, however. Asked if she wants the vaccine expert group the JCVI to recommend offering jabs to everyone aged 12 to 15, Green says there are ""finely balanced considerations"" but she wants to see a decision made quickly. The majority of adults (83%) arriving in England between 12 July and 17 August from an amber list country fully adhered to coronavirus quarantine requirements, according to a survey by the Office for National Statistics. During this period, people arrivals from an amber tier location were required to quarantine for 10 days unless they were exempt due to their job, or they took part in the test-to-release scheme. Some 91% of respondents said they took both of the required day-two and day-eight coronavirus tests. A change in the rules now means those who are fully vaccinated can avoid quarantine when arriving from an amber list nation, but still must take a pre-arrival and day-two Covid test. Read more about the ruleshere. Plans for nightclubs and other venues in Scotland to require proof of vaccination upon entry outweigh concerns and are preferable to another Covid lockdown, says the nation's health secretary. Humza Yousaf said: ""The benefits of a certification scheme, in terms of a public health intervention, in terms of incentivising vaccination, those benefits outweigh the concerns that still remain."" Mr Yousaf had previously voiced his scepticism about passports, including fears they could widen inequality. The passports are due to be brought in at the end of the month andwill apply to indoor and outdoor events- but the proposal will need to be approved by MSPs next week. Ministers in England want ""high-risk"" settings such as nightclubs to begin requiring valid Covid passes - which prove vaccination - by the end of September. Read morehere. Tom Cruise's films Top Gun: Maverick and Mission: Impossible 7 have been delayed due to a surge in US Covid-19 cases caused by the Delta variant. Paramount pushed the Top Gun sequel back six months to May next year, while the seventh installment of the Mission: Impossible franchise - largely filmed in the UK - has been moved from May to September next year. The studio has also delayed the release of comedy Jackass Forever. Read morehere. Some teenagers got their jab on site at music festivals As we have been reporting, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said earlier today (see post at 09:05) that he wants to see a decision on offering the jab to all 12 to 15-year-olds made very soon. Currently, all 16 and 17 year-olds are being offered a first dose. No second dose is planned as yet. Vaccinations are also recommended for those aged 12 to 15 if they are at higher risk due to:  Children of the same age who live with people who have a suppressed immune system can also be vaccinated, to protect family members. NHS organisations in England have been told to make preparations to jab all 12 to 15-year-olds, but they are waiting on a recommendation from experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. Read more about children and the vaccines Eleanor LawrieBBC News As we have been reporting, pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have been returning to schools today. The UK government has pledged about 300,000 CO2 monitors to schools in England this term to help detect poor ventilation. Covid is a respiratory virus, so it is expelled into the air
when people breathe and talk. This allows very small particles carrying the virus to
spread around a room, where they can last a couple of hours. Ventilation cuts the risk of catching the virus by reducing
the level of particles in the air that someone is exposed to. While CO2 monitors do not affect transmission risk in
schools, they can help to indicate how well ventilated a classroom is. We breathe out a higher concentration of
carbon dioxide than is present in the atmosphere, so the monitors help to
detect how much of the surrounding air has been breathed out, and how much is
fresh air from outside. Catherine Noakes, professor of environmental engineering
for buildings at the University of Leeds, and a specialist in airborne
infections, says ventilation could reduce airborne risk of
coronavirus by up to 70%, although it wonât stop close contact transmission. âIn a classroom, ventilation wonât have much effect on
transmission from the person sat next to you, but it will from the person other
side of the room,â she says. âThe monitors will help schools to realise which areas are
better or poorly ventilated. In some classrooms they will be able to open
windows, while others may need different solutions such as putting air cleaners in that room.â How are pupils being kept Covid-safe this term? Pupils are returning to schools with fewer compulsory Covid measures in place If you're just joining us, here's a quick recap of the main coronavirus stories so far today: Â© 2025 BBC.

"Eight US states will accept driver's licences and other state IDs stored on an iPhone, Apple has announced. The feature, first announced at a presentation in June, lets iPhone users store IDs in the Wallet app. Some had expressed privacy concerns about handing over smartphones to police or security officials. Apple now says users do not need to unlock or hand over their phones for the system to work for airport security. But it remains unclear if or how it might eventually work for other uses of ID, such as drivers stopped by police. Arizona, and Georgia will introduce the system first, with Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Utah also signed up. The ""first locations"" to use the system will be airport security checkpoints run by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Apple says. Americans usually need some form of state ID only to travel by air domestically, unlike other countries, in which a passport is widely used. Tapping a phone at an identity reader at supported airports will prompt passengers to use their Face ID or fingerprint to authorise sending information to the machine. ""Users do not need to unlock, show, or hand over their device to present their ID,"" Apple said. TSA administrator David Pekoske said the new system ""will enable a more seamless airport security screening experience"". Apple's announcement,externalalso stressed other security features of its new app, ""offering superior security and privacy over a physical wallet"". Neither Apple nor state authorities would know when or where ID was presented, it said, and all personal information was encrypted. But the concept of digital IDs remains controversial. Covid passports, which emerged over the past year,were initially met with some resistanceby privacy campaigners. This video can not be played Tony Blair: âPeople give a lot more information probably to their supermarkets than they will to the government.â And digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation has said digital IDs ""might be a big step towards national identification, in which every time we walk through a door or buy coffee, a record of the event is collected and aggregated"". It was ""troubled"" by the mobile-driver-licence,externaltechnology, which could ""make demands for ID more frequent in American life"", the group said. ""They may also lead to the routine use of automated or 'robot' ID checks carried out not by humans but by machines, causing such demands to proliferate even more,"" the group added.

"Patients will be put at risk unless the NHS receives an extra Â£10bn next year to recover from the pandemic, health bosses say A recommendation on whether under-16s should be offered Covid vaccines is due ""very, very soon"", the education secretary says A scientific adviser to the government said the decision should focus on ""what is best for the children"" Prof Peter Openshaw also warned that the UK's vaccine advisory group was at risk of making a decision on booster jabs too late Schools are not ""drivers"" or ""hubs"" of Covid infection, Public Health England's medical director has said Full vaccination against Covid-19 can cut the risk of developing long Covid by 50%, a study suggests The Duke of Sussex has called on governments to tackle the âhuge disparityâ in vaccine access worldwide Many pupils in the UK return to school today, amid concerns about the spread of Covid and funding Popular podcast host Joe Rogan, who controversially claimed young, healthy people did not need the vaccine, says he caught Covid but feels ""great"" Portugal has eased quarantine requirements for visitors from the UK, allowing non-vaccinated travellers to show a negative PCR test Edited by Alex Therrien We're now closing our coronavirus live page, but will be back tomorrow. Thanks for joining us. Thursday's coronavirus live coverage was written by Joseph Lee, Hazel Shearing and George Bowden, and edited by Alex Therrien and Rob Corp. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for today. But before we do, here's a look at the main coronavirus developments this Thursday: More news from Scotland, where thousands of long Covid patients are feared to have not been referred to a support service. Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland launched the service in February - but now says it cannot get in touch with patients because of ""NHS bureaucracy"". The Scottish government said it was working with the NHS, but ""no one approach"" would fit all circumstances. The latest figures from the ONS estimate 74,000 people in Scotland are living with ""self-reported"" long Covid. About 60,000 had experienced long Covid symptoms for more than 12 weeks and 28,000 for a year. Read morehere. Case rates are falling in all parts of England apart from the North East, according to Public Health England's latest weekly surveillance report. The highest rate is in the South West. There were 362.9 cases per 100,000 people in the week ending 29 August - down week-on-week from 491.1. London has the lowest rate, down from 256.3 to 226.8. In the North East, the rate has risen slightly from 306.5 to 314.9. In terms of age, the highest rate is among 10 to 19-year-olds (46.8) and the lowest is among those aged over 80 (110.3). Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at PHE, says: ""Cases remain high although fairly stable across the country. In the coming days and weeks, testing to return to school will detect cases of Covid-19 infection acquired during the summer holidays."" More than 32,000 pupils in Scotland were absent due to Covid this week, school attendance figures show. The figure includes those who had the virus, and those who are self-isolating as a close contact. School pupils in Scotland returned to classrooms two weeks ago - ahead of other UK nations. Pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland began their return to school on Thursday. Read morehere. A further 38,154 coronavirus cases have been reported across the UK, alongside another 178 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.  Vaccination for 16 and 17-year-olds began less than a month ago Vaccine uptake among 16 and 17-year-olds has been ""strong"", England's top GP said, as figures showed almost two-thirds of this age group in Wales (63%) and half in England have had one jab. In Scotland, the figure is 51% and in Northern Ireland it is 40%. Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and deputy lead for NHS Englandâs vaccination programme, said it was important for eligible young people to be get vaccinated as schools, colleges and universities begin term. Some nightclubs, places of worship and university campuses would be offering the jab this weekend in an effort to make it as convenient as possible, she said. They include London's G-A-Y club, the Hindu Temple in Crawley and the University of Kentâs Canterbury Campus. NHS England said 620,000 people aged 16 and 17 had now received the first dose of the vaccine. The UK vaccine advisory group the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has yet to say when people in this age group will be offered a second dose. Prof Calum Semple said he was targeted by anti-vaccination groups but abuse has come from all sides Scientists on the government's advisory committee Sage have been sent suspicious packages by members of the public who feel they are ""making bad decisions"", one of them has revealed. Prof Calum Semple from the University of Liverpool, who has frequently appeared in the media to offer expert views on the Covid-19 pandemic, was asked at a Royal Society of Medicine webinar about the abuse science advisers had received. Society president Prof Roger Kirby asked him about being ""targeted by the anti-vax group"" and suggested someone had posted messages saying ""Calum kills wildlife for fun"" and mentioned where the scientist lives. Prof Semple confirmed that and added: ""We are fortunate that the police are open to hearing from us and thereâs good liaison support for us when these threats are made. That was one particularly nasty event. âThere have been others since then and suspicious packages sent to Sage members and myself. âThis comes from both extremes â people that feel that weâre making bad decisions and they donât appreciate that Sage is not a decision-making body.â Sage - the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies - provides technical advice to ministers during a crisis but decisions are taken by ministers. Covid-19 vaccines in England are estimated to have directly averted more than 143,600 hospital admissions in those over 65, according to new figures from Public Health England. PHE said it was likely to be an underestimate due to the way the figure is calculated. Approximately 36,100 admissions were prevented in those aged 65
to 74, 58,800 in those aged 75 to 84, and 48,700 in those aged 85 and over. Estimates for the number of deaths in England directly averted by the vaccine rollout are unchanged at between 102,500 and 109,500. The first jab outside of a trial was administered in England in December 2020. Since then, more than 48 million first doses have been recorded across the UK. It is ""too early to predict"" whether supermarkets will have supply issues at Christmastime, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) says. Andrew Opie, the BRC's head of food and sustainability, says it is ""not anticipating major problems for Christmas at the moment"", but adds the festive period would be ""incredibly challenging in some areas"". ""If we do see problems then that is going to have an impact on products on the shelf,"" he tells the UK Trade and Business Commission, a group of MPs and business representatives. Alex Veitch from Logistics UK says there has been a shortage of lorry drivers for several years, but this is now an ""acute shortage"". There is a shortage of more than 100,000 drivers in the UK, according to the Road Haulage Association. ""It's really to do with Covid to a very large extent, and Brexit to a lesser extent, added to the long-term chronic problem of not enough people joining the sector,"" Veitch says . The BRC and others want the government to grant a 12-month Covid-19 recovery visa to allow workers from Europe to make up for skills shortages - not only as HGV drivers, but also in roles in food manufacturing and processing. This video can not be played BBC reporter Lucy Adams investigated long Covid after she and her daughter developed the illness As we've been reporting today, a new study suggestsbeing fully vaccinated can cut your chance of getting long Covideven if you get a rare breakthrough infection. But what is long Covid? Guidance for health workers defines long Covid as symptoms lasting for more than 12 weeks which can't be explained by another cause. They can follow a severe or a mild infection. The NHS says symptoms can include:  One large study found 200 symptoms affecting 10 organ systems in people with long Covid. They included hallucinations, insomnia, hearing and vision changes, short-term memory loss and speech and language issues. Others have reported gastro-intestinal and bladder problems, changes to periods and skin conditions. The severity of symptoms varies, but many have been left unable to perform tasks like showering, grocery shopping and remembering words. There is currently no test. Instead, doctors diagnose it in people who have had a Covid infection by ruling out other causes. Read more about long Covid Ministers should do more to prepare the public for the fact there will be waves of higher levels of infection this winter, according to the new director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Prof Liam Smeeth says he does not think there will be a return to severe lockdown restrictions as weâve seen before and that for most doubled-jabbed adults Covid will now be a ""fairly benign disease"". But he adds that the government cannot take its foot off all controls because of the numbers of people still unvaccinated who are vulnerable to severe disease. Rather than see strict lockdowns, he says there might be periods when the public need to be encouraged not to mix so much, to wear masks in indoor spaces and not to go to hospital unless really necessary. Mum Clare is relieved schools are opening with fewer restrictions Parents have been sharing their contrasting emotionsas schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland welcome back pupils for the new academic year. Clare Smyth, from Cambridgeshire, has two young sons in primary school - Seb, 10, and Joshua, who is seven. She is ""overjoyed"" that the start of term will see restrictions eased in schools. ""I'm really relieved that our school has decided to stop all social distancing restrictions - bubbles, zones in the playground. But I'm apprehensive for the winter as the season progresses, as to whether the restrictions will return,"" she says. Lisa will not be sending her children back to school Lisa Diaz's children Alex, 11, and eight-year-old Helena have not been into their Wigan primary school for more than a year after she pulled them out 10 days before the first lockdown. She says she is so angry and worried about the lack of safety measures in place this term that they won't be returning, even though she has been threatened with fines or even prison. Lisa has a genetic blood disorder which makes her particularly concerned that when schools reopen ""there will be nothing between our children and Covid-19"". Lisa says she was ""devastated"" by the choice and would like to see many more safety measures in schools, such as masks and social distancing. ""I'm not saying it's an easy decision. I fully empathise with parents up and down the country,"" she says. Read more parents' stories here. The shadow education secretary criticised the decision to end mask requirements in schools More on the return to school, as Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green accuses the government of ""sitting on its hands"" instead of preparing for the reopening. She tells the BBC News Channel that Labour had been ""pleading for months"" for a range of measures to be implemented in schools, including robust ventilation systems rather than simply monitoring levels of CO2 as the government has proposed. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson should put his ""foot on the accelerator"" to improve ventilation, she said. Asked if Labour wanted to see masks in schools, Green says she's ""at a loss"" to explain why they were made voluntary while infection rates are rising. She says many head teachers will make sensible decisions for their own schools, however. Asked if she wants the vaccine expert group the JCVI to recommend offering jabs to everyone aged 12 to 15, Green says there are ""finely balanced considerations"" but she wants to see a decision made quickly. The majority of adults (83%) arriving in England between 12 July and 17 August from an amber list country fully adhered to coronavirus quarantine requirements, according to a survey by the Office for National Statistics. During this period, people arrivals from an amber tier location were required to quarantine for 10 days unless they were exempt due to their job, or they took part in the test-to-release scheme. Some 91% of respondents said they took both of the required day-two and day-eight coronavirus tests. A change in the rules now means those who are fully vaccinated can avoid quarantine when arriving from an amber list nation, but still must take a pre-arrival and day-two Covid test.

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"".

Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"".

The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"". This video can not be played Former member of Afghan parliament: 'The Taliban would've killed me if they found me' Former member of the Afghan parliament, Naheed Farid, left Afghanistan because she feared the Taliban could kill her, and she worried about the safety of her children. Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here.

"Ben John was given a 24-month sentence, suspended for two years, at Leicester Crown Court The Attorney General has been asked to review a sentence given to a right-wing extremist for a terrorism offence. Ben John was handed the 24-month sentence, suspended for two years, at Leicester Crown Court on Tuesday. According to media reports, the 21-year-old was also ordered by a judge to read classic novels such as Pride and Prejudice and to return to court in January. In a letter, campaign group Hope Not Hate asked for a review of the case. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands John, of Addison Drive, Lincoln, was found guilty of possessing a record of information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism on 12 August. The offence under Section 58 of the Terrorism Act, which has a maximum sentence of 15 years' imprisonment, was brought following the discovery on a computer of a publication containing diagrams and instructions on how to construct various explosive devices. Lincolnshire Policesaid John had also amassed 67,788 documentsin bulk downloads on to hard drives, which contained ""a wealth"" of white supremacist and anti-Semitic material. During the sentencing hearing, Judge Timothy Spencer QC is reported to have asked John: ""Have you read Dickens? Austen? ""Start with Pride And Prejudice and Dickens's A Tale Of Two Cities. Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. Think about Hardy. Think about Trollope. ""On January 4 you will tell me what you have read and I will test you on it."" According to media reports, John was instructed to read classic novels, including Pride and Prejudice, as he was given a five-year serious crime prevention order The open letter, written by Hope Not Hate's chief executive Nick Lowles, stated: ""A suspended sentence and a suggested reading list of English classics for a terror conviction is unduly lenient for a crime of this nature. ""This sentence is sending a message that violent right-wing extremists may be treated leniently by the courts. ""That is a dangerous message to send when the far-right poses the fastest growing terror threat today. These sorts of lenient sentences risk encouraging other young people to access and share terrorist and extremist content because they will not fear the repercussions of their actions."" A spokesman for the Attorney General's Office said: ""We have received a request for the sentence of Ben John to be considered under the unduly lenient sentence (ULS) scheme. ""The Law Officers have 28 days from sentencing to consider the case and make a decision."" The unduly lenient sentence scheme covers a variety of serious offences including certain types of hate crime and some terrorism-related offences.

"Schools are not ""drivers"" or ""hubs"" of Covid infection, Public Health England's medical director has said. Dr Yvonne Doyle said she understood parents' nervousness about schools returning after the summer in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. She stressed that lots of measures to cut Covid spread remained in place. But Prof Calum Semple, a government scientific adviser, said with most adults vaccinated, schools were likely to be a ""greater part of the problem"". Some have suggesteda surge in cases in Scotland, where pupils returned in August, could be linked to schools. Fewer measures are in place in schools than during last term, with bubbles and masks no longer in use in England and Wales, while Northern Ireland has also scrapped social distancing requirements. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told BBC Breakfast it was right for children to have a ""much more normal education experience"", with adults being able to go back to the pub, music festivals and theatres. He said there needed to be a ""sensible balance"" and that was why mass testing of secondary school pupils was taking place. How are schools being kept Covid-safe this term? When do school pupils have to self-isolate? Mixed emotions as pupils return to English schools Dr Doyle said there were lots of regimes in place already to prevent the spread, including extra cleaning, advice on ventilation and testing. She said: ""We understand, and I understand fully, that parents may be nervous but I would stress again that schools are not the drivers and not the hubs of infection."" She added that PHE attributed some of the school-related coronavirus figures to the testing regime. This video can not be played Education Secretary Gavin Williamson says pupils deserve to have a normal education experience Prof Semple, professor of child health and outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool, said he believed schools should stay open ""nearly at all costs"" because the damage caused by a lack of education could be lifelong. He said while pupils were unlikely to get sick themselves they could transmit the disease to others, and that this should be considered when discussing vaccines for 12 to 15-year-olds. A paper,published by the Royal Society,external, suggests the reopening of schools, and particularly secondary schools, is associated with an increased risk of transmission both among school-aged pupils and in the wider community. But it said the scale of that increase depended on control measures in the classroom and community as well as compliance with mass testing. Prof Semple said his biggest worry was closing schools again because education was very important but he said school building stock was poor, with ventilation an issue. Both experts agreed that school is the best place for children. But vaccinating everyone else means that they'll look more like ""hubs"" than they did last year. If your problems get smaller and mine stay the same, I start to look worse than you. Last September, older teenagers and younger adults saw the fastest rises in infections and cases in England. This year, they'll be able to get vaccinated. Their place as ""leaders"" in infection rates and rises is likely to be taken by children because everyone else will have the vaccine to slow the spread. The decision about vaccination for under-16s is finely balanced because the risks of illness for children from Covid are so low. Parents have to balance the risks of Covid with the risks of disruption to education. Health experts currently appear more worried about missing education. Scientists have already said it is""highly likely"" that high levels of coronavirus will be seen in schoolsby the end of September. And there could be consequences for parents and carers, they say - but it remains to be seen what effect it will have on cases and hospital admissions. Imperial College epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson said the UK could expect cases to surge in step with what has happened in Scotland when schools return but the big unknown was how long that surge would last. He said that in a post-vaccine world the country could cope with much higher levels of cases and what ministers might consider an ""acceptable level of hospitalisation"" but he said that daily caseloads of 100,000 to 150,000 would put ""significant demands on the healthcare system"". In Scotland more than 32,000 pupils have been off school due to Covid-19 as of Tuesday - with 6,471 having the virus, up from 3,500 the week before, while a further 25,622 were isolating. Among the measures being implemented for safety in schools in England are carbon dioxide monitors to help improve ventilation,with 300,000 being made available, but when asked on BBC Breakfast Mr Williamson was unable to say how many were already in place. While CO2 monitors do not affect the transmission risk in schools, they can help to indicate how well ventilated a classroom is. Humans breathe out a higher concentration of carbon dioxide than is present in the atmosphere, so the monitors help to detect how much of the surrounding air has been breathed out, and how much is fresh air from outside. Asked about vaccinations for 12 to 15-year-olds the education secretary said parents would find it ""deeply reassuring to have a choice of whether their children should have a vaccination or not"" and that he was ""very keen"" to hear the decision from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). He said that government was ""ready to go"" if it did decide to extend the eligibility to children that age. Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the JCVI, said there were many arguments for and against vaccinating the age group but said whatever decision the committee reached would be in children's best interests. Prof Semple, who sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said it was a ""really difficult judgement"" with a fine balancing act between a ""rare side effect"", in myocarditis, and the low risk from Covid to children themselves and the impact of transmission on wider society.

The FM is asked about current issues with staff and stock shortages in retail in the run-up to Christmas and says a meeting has been asked for with the UK government this week on the problem. She says she has warned the UK government of such issues since July and that seeing staff shortages putting pressure on food and drink supplies and images of rotting food in fields means ""the Tories should be hanging their heads in shame"". She says that if children are having to be told there will be no toys at Christmas because of disruption to supply chains, the Conservatives should accept responsibility for ""their obsession with Brexit"". She says it was ""utterly reckless"" to plough ahead with Brexit in a global pandemic. Jackie Baillie brings upa new action plan from Chest, Heart and Stroke Scotland on long Covid. She asks if the first minister will agree with its recommendations, in particular the creation of a long Covid fund for health boards to access. Ms Sturgeon says the organisation has made a number of very important points. She wants to discuss the four recommendations with the charity in detail. She says she will give the capacity fund serious consideration in budget discussions. Alex Cole-Hamilton says his party is ""fundamentally opposed to vaccine passports, as a matter of principle"". The Scottish Lib Dem leader argues hospitality sees this as a threat. He asks if he will need a vaccine passport to join a mass-protest against- vaccine passports.

Ross Greer turns to St Ninian's High School in Kirkintillochwhere 405 pupils were absent from school this week. The Scottish Green MSP asks about ventilation in schools and what support can be given. The first minister points out ventilation across the school estate has been looked at. Ms Sturgeon highlights the changes to contact tracing that have been introduced.  Mr Sarwar says that in 2003, Nicola Sturgeon told Scottish labour that 84,000 people on a waiting list was a humiliation. He says that the stats before the pandemic showed 450,000 people on lists. He highlights waits of more than 12 hours at A&E departments and asks the first minister what she would say to them if she looked them in the eye. Ms Sturgeon says her responsibility is to support the health service in recovery from the pandemic. She says the difference between 2003 and now is the changing demographics in the country. She again highlights record spending and investment. She adds: ""What I would say to patients is that yes, I know in opposition it is easy to come up with slogans, but in government my responsibility is to deliver the investment to support the staff and make changes for patients and that is what we are going to continue to do."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar enters the debate ands also highlights the plight of the NHS. He asks if it is a humiliation for the SNP that the number of people on waiting lists has risen to more than 600,000. The first minister says it is the responsibility of the government to support the NHS and says most people recognise that the global pandemic has had a massive impact. She says the recovery plan is looking to build the capacity in the NHS in the immediate and longer term. She says she will not stand there and underplay the challenge but says support is there for the NHS via record funding and pay rises for staff which will deliver for patients.  Allow Twitter content?

She says the NHS will get Â£1bn of extra cash. The Scottish Conservative leader argues this is another example of the ""shambolic"" government. Mr Ross calls on Nicola Sturgeon to explain what infrastructure will be put in place for vaccine passports. The first minister hits back, saying the public is very wary of politicians taking a dogmatic approach. Ms Sturgeon points out she told parliament first about the government's intentions and insists sectors across the economy are being engaged. ""This is a really serious situation again,"" adds Ms Sturgeon. Ms Sturgeon accuses Mr Ross of being ""infantile"". The first minister reiterates the point that Holyrood will debate and vote on vaccination certification next week. ""Nobody wants any form of restrictions,"" adds Ms Sturgeon. She argues there is pragmatism from the frontline, citing the FSB response. Some clubs may require their fans to show proof they have had the Covid-19 vaccine The first minister insists it will be for parliament to decide next week on vaccine certification. Nicola Sturgeon points out that all 29 ministers are bound by collective responsibility. Mr Ross says the deal is a ""leap into the dark"" for the Greens.

Douglas Ross wastes no time in attacking the co-operation agreement between the Greens and SNP. The Scottish Conservative leader asks if all 29 ministers in the Scottish government agreed to introduce vaccine passports. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf says the benefits of vaccine passports for entry to nightclubs and other large events outweigh the concerns and are preferable to another lockdown. In July, Mr Yousaf told the BBC he was sceptical about the passports due to fears of increasing the inequality gap. However, he now says circumstances have changed and steps have been taken to resolve the issues. The passports are due to be brought in at the end of the month. The plans will apply to indoor and outdoor events but will need to be approved by MSPs next week. Read more Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent The first FMQs of the new Holyrood term, and significantly
of the new era of SNP-Green co-operation. The fact the government now has a comfortable majority
behind most of its policies makes life more complicated for opposition leaders. Frankly, they may find themselves struggling for relevance
in a parliament where the principle question on any given topic is how closely
aligned the two parties of government are. Thus they may well spend these early days of the partnership
seeking out contentious issues which might drive a wedge between them - like
vaccine passports, or the Cambo oil field. Douglas Ross, Anas Sarwar and in particular Alex
Cole-Hamilton are going to need to pick their battles carefully if they are
going to break into the news agenda â and avoid sliding into obscurity. The move means people will need to show they have had both doses of the vaccine before being allowed into nightclubs and many other events Vaccine passports are to be required for entry to nightclubs and many large events in Scotland from later this month, Nicola Sturgeon has said. The plans will apply to indoor and outdoor events, and will need to be signed off by MSPs next week. Ms Sturgeon said the move was needed to help stem the recent surge in the number of cases. A further 6,107 people have tested positive, with the number of people in hospital doubling in the past 10 days. And several areas of Scotland are among the regions with the highest rates of the virus in Europe. Greens co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater join Nicola Sturgeon in government. Good morning and welcome to BBC Scotland's live coverage of First Minister's Questions. This will be the first time Nicola Sturgeon has faced questions since appointing Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater as junior ministers.

"Young people strapped for space at home have helped to drive a ""rapid recovery"" in membership numbers at Gym Group. The gym operator said membership had jumped by a third since February as its sites reopened. Over two-thirds of its members are under the age of 34, and the company said many younger people lacked space to do home workouts. The chain, which operates 190 sites, aims to open 40 new gyms by the end of 2022 by converting former shops. ""The physical gym will always be really important for people and I think that's coming through in our numbers,"" chief executive Richard Darwin told the BBC's Today programme. While many people worked out at home during lockdown, Mr Darwin said that many younger people ""just don't have the space...  to be able to do home workouts"". UK loses 83% of department stores over five years People working out longer and later at night Gym Group is a low-cost gym operator, where customers do not have to have an annual contract. It said membership numbers had hit 730,000 by the end of June this year, compared with 547,000 at the end of February 2021 - during the lockdown. This compares with a peak membership of 891,000 in February 2020 before the first coronavirus lockdown measures were introduced. Gyms only reopened in England on 12 April this year, and later in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Gym Group reported a pre-tax loss of Â£28.5m for the six months to the end of June whiles sales tumbled by 21.4% to Â£29.3m. However, despite the losses, the company is looking to expand. It said it planned to repurpose vacant retail spaces on the High Street, which has seen the closures of chains such as Debenhams and Topshop accelerate during Covid. Gym Group has already opened seven new sites this year and plans to open an additional 40 by the end of 2022. ""We're seeing a lot of properties become available, particularly in retail parks which are very good for gyms as they have accessible parking and clear signage,"" Mr Darwin said. However, Dan Lane, senior analyst at investment platform Freetrade, said Gym Group's site rollout needed to be done ""efficiently"" and not end up ""diluting overall profits just for the sake of willing itself back to normality"". ""Rushing to snap up more properties while the current ones aren't at capacity and fewer of us are back in the office is a sign of how much the group needs footfall,"" he said. ""If we aren't going or coming from work, will we be bothered to leave our homes (many of which are now in the country, after the London exodus) to get to the gym?"" But with lockdown restrictions now lifted there have been signs that people are exercising less at home.

"People who do not turn up to reservations they have made at pubs and restaurants are costing the hospitality sector Â£17.6bn a year, a report says. Data from hospitality technology firm Zonal said one in seven customers have not turned up for a reservation without telling the venue since April. It said 18-34-year-olds were the ""worst offenders"" for no-shows, with more than a quarter not honouring bookings. Industry group UK Hospitality said no-shows were ""deeply damaging to venues"". Jacob Georgallis, general manager at Toast Bar in Leeds, said punters not turning up and not cancelling bookings had ""massively"" affected the business during times when some coronavirus restrictions remained. ""We'd be fully booked but then no-shows would happen and you've turned away three or four groups who could have taken the space,"" he said. ""It was a really gutting feeling for us, and a nightmare for staffing and forecasting."" Restaurant no-shows 'putting jobs at risk' 'We had 100 people not turn up to their tables' During Euro 2020, the bar took pre-orders on food and drinks and did not experience any no-shows, apart from customers unable to attend due to Covid-related reasons. Mr Georgallis said he hoped there was a ""big push"" towards solving the problem and ""finding ways to take money up front"". The research, conducted by Zonal and consultancy firm CGA, surveyed 5,000 people nationwide. A large percentage of respondents said they would fail to turn up for bookings if someone in their party had to cancel the appointment Although younger people were found to be the most likely out of the sample to fail to turn up to bookings, compared to just 1% of those aged 55 and over, younger adults were more frequent bookers and ate out more often. In its report, researchers said Londoners were found to be the worst no-show offenders in the UK, with 24% of consumers in the capital admitting to not notifying a venue that they weren't planning to turn up. The figure was higher than the national average of 14%. The report said customers in Scotland, the South West and the South East were most likely to honour their reservations, with just 10% failing to show up. UK Hospitality said the Â£17.6bn loss from no-shows equated to 13.3% of the sector's Â£132bn in pre-pandemic revenue. I had a change of plans (19%) Someone else in the group cancelled (19%) Someone fell ill with Covid-related symptoms (18%) The venue was unable to reassure me (17%) I forgot about my booking (16%) I decided it was too expensive (15%) The weather put me off (14%) The venue didn't contact me to remind me (13%) I booked a few venues for the same time (13%) I arrived at the venue and didn't feel comfortable (12%) Source: Zonal and CGA's Technology survey Vicky Liner, marketing director at West Midlands-based Suburban Inns, said no-shows had ""calmed down a little bit"" after the venue started asking patrons to hand over card details and put down deposits when making a booking. ""Taking deposits wasn't something we really wanted to do, but we've had to - and they're no bad thing if they help to change the culture,"" she said. ""We still want spontaneity in hospitality and give people the option to just walk in."" In response to the survey findings, Zonal and UK Hospitality have launched a campaign aimed at encouraging people to honour the bookings they make, or at least inform venues if they have to cancel a booking. UK Hospitality's chief executive Kate Nicholls said no-shows had been a blight on the industry for ""many, many years"". Added to the difficulties businesses were experiencing due to the pandemic, they were ""currently deeply damaging."" ""Our pubs, bars and restaurants deserve our support and it's encouraging that this research shows there is a growing realisation among customers of the need to honour their booking or let the venue know they can't make it,"" she said. ""But it also highlights the fact that no shows still happen far too often, with younger customers particularly responsible, and that really can't go on.""

"There are ""shocking failings"" and ""blatant hypocrisy"" in the way major UK religious groups handle child sex abuse allegations, an inquiry has found. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) said some religious organisations in England and Wales were ""morally failing"" children. It examined evidence from 38 groups, including those from Christianity, Orthodox Judaism and Islam. Leaders discouraged reporting abuse to protect reputations, the report found. It said the religious leaders also blamed victims for their abuse, and relied on religious dogma when responding to allegations. How the child sexual abuse inquiry works Church of England 'allowed child abusers to hide' Cardinal 'protected Church ahead of victims' The report,,externalwhich follows on from inquiries into the Catholic and Anglican Churches, comes after several weeks of public hearings held last year in which victims of abuse gave evidence. It covers a series of religious groups including Jehovah's Witnesses, Baptists, Methodists, Islam, Judaism, Sikhism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and non-conformist Christian denominations. The report said that many religious groups were putting children at risk by: Victim blaming Not openly discussing matters of sexuality Abuse of power by religious leaders Men dominating the leadership Mistrust of non-religious agencies Misusing the concept of ""forgiveness"" The inquiry found that in some communities ""the relationship between ideas of sexual 'purity' and social and familial standing are likely to make abuse markedly harder to report"". ""The imperative not to speak is bound up with notions of honour, with consequences for an individual's ability to marry, for their family and for the 'honour' of their community. In extreme cases, being seen as dishonourable can lead to violence against that individual or their family,"" it said. While the inquiry's press release was strongly worded, the report itself was more measured and Lloyd Evans, who campaigns against abuse in the Jehovah's Witnesses, told BBC News it was ""wishy washy"". Mr Evans, a former elder of the Jehovah's Witnesses, suggested that IICSA did not look at as much data as it could have - and that part of the problem was that the inquiry was ""under-funded"". Today's report from the inquiry is the 16th in three and a half years. With each one, the colossal scale and destructive force of child sexual abuse within British society is revealed. There is barely a corner of this country's institutional, cultural or spiritual life untarnished by the activities of abusers. Wherever the inquiry has looked, it has found. Religious organisations exist with an explicit purpose to teach right from wrong, but the authors of today's report suggest that only heightens the ""moral turpitude"" of their ""egregious"" failure in protecting children from harm. Time and again, they note how cries for help were ignored while perpetrators were protected. The inquiry suggests several reasons. Top of the list: victim-blaming, shame and honour, a sense that the abuse is somehow the child's own fault. Some faith leaders use theological texts to justify abuse and their elevated status to prevent disclosure. Smaller religious communities may be distrustful of external authorities and fearful of reputational damage. The report also suggests that in some religious settings, the concept of ""forgiveness"" is misused, to silence the abused and to justify not reporting abusers' terrible crimes. In about a year's time, the inquiry will publish its final overarching report. We already know it will be a very sobering read. The inquiry took more evidence about the Jehovah's Witnesses, which has 131,700 members in England and Wales, than any other group. The organisation has repeatedly been accused of covering up child abuse and told the inquiry allegations concerning 67 individuals had been reported to its branch office within 10 years. A particular concern in the report was that, while some organisations did have ""effective"" child protection policies, in some settings ""not even basic child protection procedures"" were in place. ""Religious believers can find it difficult to accept that members of their congregation or religious leaders could perpetrate abuse. As a result, some consider that it is not necessary to have specific child protection procedures or to adhere strictly to them,"" the inquiry concluded. In the case of the Jehovah's Witnesses, IICSA was particularly critical of a biblical rule applied by the group requiring two witnesses before an allegation of abuse is considered by elders. The Jehovah's Witnesses gave evidence that it also has policies requiring allegations to be reported to the police when there is a legal duty do so. However, the UK has no such ""mandatory reporting law"". IICSA strongly criticised the ""two witness rule"", saying it was likely to increase the suffering of victims, and failed to reflect the reality that ""child sexual abuse is most often perpetrated in the absence of witnesses"". A statement from the Jehovah's Witnesses said the protection of children was ""of utmost concern and importance to all Jehovah's Witnesses"" and they ""fully agree"" that all religious organisations should have a child protection policy. ""We will carefully and respectfully consider all the observations and recommendations contained in IICSA's investigation report,"" it added. The Union of Orthodox Hebrew Congregations, representing over 100 synagogues claimed its child protection hotline had only received four calls which ""raised concerns of a serious nature"". The Union provided no details of allegations of child sexual abuse within the previous 10 years to the inquiry. It told IICSA the ""prevailing environment and culture"" within the community led to a reduction in abuse compared with the population as a whole, according to the report. However, the inquiry said that while the figures it was given by religious organisations may reflect the ""known prevalence of child sexual abuse"", it was ""extremely unlikely that they reflect the full extent"". ""As a result of this investigation, a number of religious organisations have told us that they have altered, improved or recognised the need for policies and procedures in respect of child sexual abuse,"" the inquiry added. The inquiry in England and Wales was set up in July 2014 after hundreds of people came forward to say Jimmy Savile had abused them as children It is investigating claims against local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces and public and private institutions - as well as people in the public eye The inquiry is divided into public hearings into specific areas of concern, with witnesses giving evidence under oath; research into institutional failures in child protection, andthe Truth Project,,externalin which victims share their experiences with the inquiry either in private interviews or written form It heard evidence from 648 witnesses over four years, withthe final public hearingcoming in December 2020 The hearings have led to 16 reports so far, with another three to come this year. A final report will be published in 2022 Read morehere. The report gave the example of a girl who was sexually assaulted by a church volunteer when she was 12 years old. She disclosed the abuse to her mother, who reported it to the police. After being made aware of the allegations, a church minister told her mother that the abuser was ""valued"" and must be considered ""innocent until proven guilty"". Prof Alexis Jay, chairwoman of the inquiry, said: ""Religious organisations are defined by their moral purpose of teaching right from wrong and protection of the innocent and the vulnerable. ""However, when we heard about shocking failures to prevent and respond to child sexual abuse across almost all major religions, it became clear many are operating in direct conflict with this mission."" IICSA highlighted concerns that the law currently does not define religious leaders as holding a ""position of trust"" within child protection law. However, the inquiry did not make a finding requiring this to change. A final report following more than a dozen investigations is due next year. A key decision for the inquiry is whether to back ""mandatory reporting"" - a law making it a criminal offence for professionals not to report evidence of child abuse. Richard Scorer, a specialist abuse lawyer who acts for seven victim and survivor groups in the IICSA, said the latest report confirmed religious groups had ""catastrophically"" failed to protect children and the findings made the arguments for mandatory reporting ""overwhelming"". The Rev Dr Jonathan Hustler, secretary of the Conference of the Methodist Church, said the early indications from the report were that organisations were ""still failing their members"" and he said he was ""truly sorry"" when this happened in Methodist churches. The Muslim Council of Britain said the report made for ""difficult reading"" and said the protection of children should be at the centre of all Muslim institutions. Additional reporting by Katie Wright. Update 9 September 2021: This story has been amended after the IICSA issued a correction to its report ""to say allegations concerning 67 individuals and not 67 allegations"" had been reported to the Jehovah's Witnesses' branch office within 10 years.

She says it was ""utterly reckless"" to plough ahead with Brexit in a global pandemic. Jackie Baillie brings upa new action plan from Chest, Heart and Stroke Scotland on long Covid. She asks if the first minister will agree with its recommendations, in particular the creation of a long Covid fund for health boards to access. Ms Sturgeon says the organisation has made a number of very important points. She wants to discuss the four recommendations with the charity in detail. She says she will give the capacity fund serious consideration in budget discussions. Alex Cole-Hamilton says his party is ""fundamentally opposed to vaccine passports, as a matter of principle"". The Scottish Lib Dem leader argues hospitality sees this as a threat. He asks if he will need a vaccine passport to join a mass-protest against- vaccine passports. The first minister defends her policy and says doing nothing is not an option. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ross Greer turns to St Ninian's High School in Kirkintillochwhere 405 pupils were absent from school this week. The Scottish Green MSP asks about ventilation in schools and what support can be given. The first minister points out ventilation across the school estate has been looked at. Ms Sturgeon highlights the changes to contact tracing that have been introduced.  Mr Sarwar says that in 2003, Nicola Sturgeon told Scottish labour that 84,000 people on a waiting list was a humiliation. He says that the stats before the pandemic showed 450,000 people on lists. He highlights waits of more than 12 hours at A&E departments and asks the first minister what she would say to them if she looked them in the eye. Ms Sturgeon says her responsibility is to support the health service in recovery from the pandemic. She says the difference between 2003 and now is the changing demographics in the country. She again highlights record spending and investment. She adds: ""What I would say to patients is that yes, I know in opposition it is easy to come up with slogans, but in government my responsibility is to deliver the investment to support the staff and make changes for patients and that is what we are going to continue to do."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar enters the debate ands also highlights the plight of the NHS. He asks if it is a humiliation for the SNP that the number of people on waiting lists has risen to more than 600,000. The first minister says it is the responsibility of the government to support the NHS and says most people recognise that the global pandemic has had a massive impact. She says the recovery plan is looking to build the capacity in the NHS in the immediate and longer term. She says she will not stand there and underplay the challenge but says support is there for the NHS via record funding and pay rises for staff which will deliver for patients.  Allow Twitter content?

Mr Ross argues the first minister is ""losing her grip of Covid"" and calls for a ""real plan"" for the NHS. The first minister says an NHS recovery plan has been published. She says the NHS will get Â£1bn of extra cash. The Scottish Conservative leader argues this is another example of the ""shambolic"" government. Mr Ross calls on Nicola Sturgeon to explain what infrastructure will be put in place for vaccine passports. The first minister hits back, saying the public is very wary of politicians taking a dogmatic approach. Ms Sturgeon points out she told parliament first about the government's intentions and insists sectors across the economy are being engaged. ""This is a really serious situation again,"" adds Ms Sturgeon. Ms Sturgeon accuses Mr Ross of being ""infantile"". The first minister reiterates the point that Holyrood will debate and vote on vaccination certification next week. ""Nobody wants any form of restrictions,"" adds Ms Sturgeon. She argues there is pragmatism from the frontline, citing the FSB response. Some clubs may require their fans to show proof they have had the Covid-19 vaccine The first minister insists it will be for parliament to decide next week on vaccine certification. Nicola Sturgeon points out that all 29 ministers are bound by collective responsibility. Mr Ross says the deal is a ""leap into the dark"" for the Greens.

Douglas Ross wastes no time in attacking the co-operation agreement between the Greens and SNP. The Scottish Conservative leader asks if all 29 ministers in the Scottish government agreed to introduce vaccine passports. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf says the benefits of vaccine passports for entry to nightclubs and other large events outweigh the concerns and are preferable to another lockdown. In July, Mr Yousaf told the BBC he was sceptical about the passports due to fears of increasing the inequality gap. However, he now says circumstances have changed and steps have been taken to resolve the issues. The passports are due to be brought in at the end of the month. The plans will apply to indoor and outdoor events but will need to be approved by MSPs next week. Read more Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent The first FMQs of the new Holyrood term, and significantly
of the new era of SNP-Green co-operation. The fact the government now has a comfortable majority
behind most of its policies makes life more complicated for opposition leaders. Frankly, they may find themselves struggling for relevance
in a parliament where the principle question on any given topic is how closely
aligned the two parties of government are. Thus they may well spend these early days of the partnership
seeking out contentious issues which might drive a wedge between them - like
vaccine passports, or the Cambo oil field. Douglas Ross, Anas Sarwar and in particular Alex
Cole-Hamilton are going to need to pick their battles carefully if they are
going to break into the news agenda â and avoid sliding into obscurity. The move means people will need to show they have had both doses of the vaccine before being allowed into nightclubs and many other events Vaccine passports are to be required for entry to nightclubs and many large events in Scotland from later this month, Nicola Sturgeon has said. The plans will apply to indoor and outdoor events, and will need to be signed off by MSPs next week. Ms Sturgeon said the move was needed to help stem the recent surge in the number of cases. A further 6,107 people have tested positive, with the number of people in hospital doubling in the past 10 days. And several areas of Scotland are among the regions with the highest rates of the virus in Europe. Greens co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater join Nicola Sturgeon in government. Good morning and welcome to BBC Scotland's live coverage of First Minister's Questions. This will be the first time Nicola Sturgeon has faced questions since appointing Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater as junior ministers. One topic is expected to dominate today's proceedings: Vaccine passports. Join us to watch or listen to the entirety of FMQs, with all the analysis and reaction on social media. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"". This video can not be played Former member of Afghan parliament: 'The Taliban would've killed me if they found me' Former member of the Afghan parliament, Naheed Farid, left Afghanistan because she feared the Taliban could kill her, and she worried about the safety of her children. Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"". Click here to read more about what the Taliban takeover means for Africa's jihadists Guterres also warned of extremists feeling emboldened Welcome to our live coverage of the latest developments in Afghanistan. The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

"Long Covid has two dozen common symptoms including fatigue, a cough and breathlessness Thousands of long Covid patients in Scotland are not being referred to a support service, a charity has claimed. Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland (CHSS) launched the service in February - but say they cannot get in touch with patients because of ""NHS bureaucracy"". The Scottish government said it was working with the NHS, but ""no one approach"" would fit all circumstances. The latest figures from the ONS,externalestimate 74,000 people in Scotland are living with ""self-reported"" long Covid. About 60,000 had experienced long Covid symptoms for more than 12 weeks and 28,000 for a year. However, CHSS said they are only managing between 55-60 patients per month. The condition has more than two dozen common symptoms - though experts have said they are often unpredictable and affect patients in different ways - and can last months. New research suggests that being fully vaccinated against Covidcuts the risk of an infection turning into long Covid. Will I ever get better from long Covid? Fund announced to ease 'constant battle' of long Covid The long Covid support service, funded by CHSS and the Scottish government, was described in February asa first step towards a comprehensive national service. Its aim was to work with GPs and develop a support plan for people early on in their experience with long Covid as they awaited further NHS treatment. It came after repeated calls for specialist long Covid clinics, which were introduced in England last year. At the time Scotland was devoting resources to research. However CHSS chief executive, Jane-Claire Judson, said the service has not made the progress she expected, and instead was meeting patients at the ""sharp end"" of long Covid. CHSS chief executive Jane-Claire Judson said the current system of support is not reaching enough people She said: ""They come to us as a self-referral, so we're supporting people at the worst points in their long Covid journey - but that's not what the service was for. ""It was to receive referrals from people going to primary care so that we could start working with them early on. That means that thousands of people are not getting the support they need from us or the NHS. ""It means the data sharing is not in place and bureaucracy is preventing us and the NHS from working together and having a massive impact on people with long Covid. That's not acceptable."" Mairead Johnson said long Covid has limited every aspect of her life Nine months after contracting Covid-19, Mairead Johnson, 58, and her husband Henry, 62, are reluctant to leave their house in Greenock as they are suffering the effects of long Covid. ""We only go to the shops once a week at night because we don't want to catch Covid again,"" she said. ""I was really frightened of getting the vaccine because again you didn't know is it going to make the long Covid worse."" Mairead said she and Henry have experienced the symptoms commonly associated with long Covid - breathlessness and fatigue - but that other effects are often unnerving. She said she has received some support, but often feels nothing can be done for new symptoms as medical professionals know little about the condition. ""My husband would smell burning when there was nothing burning,"" she said. ""My hair has stopped growing, my yawning reflex has gone, I get a racing heart and breathless just from standing up. I have joint pain in my foot, as if one toe is permanently broken. ""You get to that stage where something happens and you go that's long Covid. A doctor said to me that's quite a scary thing because there could be something else wrong that might be serious. ""We need research, but to do the research properly they've got to speak to us and it's got to be collated from every GP practice. It's a brilliant opportunity for them to find out what's happening because it's happening to so many people at the same time."" CHSS have nowpublished a long Covid action plan,externalwhich calls on the Scottish government to make a number of changes. Crucially it wants a fund to be set up for health boards to establish local long Covid services - although a figure has not yet been established. It also wants bureaucratic barriers in the NHS to be removed and data sharing to be improved so that it can speak to patients more quickly. Additionally the document calls for patient care plans to be developed and for medical staff to be trained on long Covid - as the charity said some do not recognise it as a real condition. During FMQs on Thursday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the organisation had made a number of very important points. She said she wanted to discuss the recommendations with the charity in detail and will give the capacity fund serious consideration in budget discussions. 'I don't feel 23 anymore, I feel so much older' Ministers put long Covid burden on GPs, says MSP No clinics for thousands of 'long Covid' patients The Scottish government says it recognises the impact long Covid is having and has responded by strengthening existing NHS services and investing Â£2.5m in long Covid Research. A government spokesperson added: ""NHS Scotland continues to deliver its full range of services to support the needs of people with long Covid, and we are engaging with NHS boards as they co-ordinate pathways across primary, community and secondary care services to support a coherent patient journey. ""While long Covid clinics are one model that NHS boards may explore, we know no one single approach is likely to fit all areas and circumstances. ""We are keeping all aspects under review, including specialist services and funding to ensure people suffering from long Covid receive the best possible care and support.""

"There are ""shocking failings"" and ""blatant hypocrisy"" in the way major UK religious groups handle child sex abuse allegations, an inquiry has found. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) said some religious organisations in England and Wales were ""morally failing"" children. It examined evidence from 38 groups, including those from Christianity, Orthodox Judaism and Islam. Leaders discouraged reporting abuse to protect reputations, the report found. It said the religious leaders also blamed victims for their abuse, and relied on religious dogma when responding to allegations. How the child sexual abuse inquiry works Church of England 'allowed child abusers to hide' Cardinal 'protected Church ahead of victims' The report,,externalwhich follows on from inquiries into the Catholic and Anglican Churches, comes after several weeks of public hearings held last year in which victims of abuse gave evidence. It covers a series of religious groups including Jehovah's Witnesses, Baptists, Methodists, Islam, Judaism, Sikhism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and non-conformist Christian denominations. The report said that many religious groups were putting children at risk by: Victim blaming Not openly discussing matters of sexuality Abuse of power by religious leaders Men dominating the leadership Mistrust of non-religious agencies Misusing the concept of ""forgiveness"" The inquiry found that in some communities ""the relationship between ideas of sexual 'purity' and social and familial standing are likely to make abuse markedly harder to report"". ""The imperative not to speak is bound up with notions of honour, with consequences for an individual's ability to marry, for their family and for the 'honour' of their community. In extreme cases, being seen as dishonourable can lead to violence against that individual or their family,"" it said. While the inquiry's press release was strongly worded, the report itself was more measured and Lloyd Evans, who campaigns against abuse in the Jehovah's Witnesses, told BBC News it was ""wishy washy"". Mr Evans, a former elder of the Jehovah's Witnesses, suggested that IICSA did not look at as much data as it could have - and that part of the problem was that the inquiry was ""under-funded"". Today's report from the inquiry is the 16th in three and a half years. With each one, the colossal scale and destructive force of child sexual abuse within British society is revealed. There is barely a corner of this country's institutional, cultural or spiritual life untarnished by the activities of abusers. Wherever the inquiry has looked, it has found. Religious organisations exist with an explicit purpose to teach right from wrong, but the authors of today's report suggest that only heightens the ""moral turpitude"" of their ""egregious"" failure in protecting children from harm. Time and again, they note how cries for help were ignored while perpetrators were protected. The inquiry suggests several reasons. Top of the list: victim-blaming, shame and honour, a sense that the abuse is somehow the child's own fault. Some faith leaders use theological texts to justify abuse and their elevated status to prevent disclosure. Smaller religious communities may be distrustful of external authorities and fearful of reputational damage. The report also suggests that in some religious settings, the concept of ""forgiveness"" is misused, to silence the abused and to justify not reporting abusers' terrible crimes. In about a year's time, the inquiry will publish its final overarching report. We already know it will be a very sobering read. The inquiry took more evidence about the Jehovah's Witnesses, which has 131,700 members in England and Wales, than any other group. The organisation has repeatedly been accused of covering up child abuse and told the inquiry allegations concerning 67 individuals had been reported to its branch office within 10 years. A particular concern in the report was that, while some organisations did have ""effective"" child protection policies, in some settings ""not even basic child protection procedures"" were in place. ""Religious believers can find it difficult to accept that members of their congregation or religious leaders could perpetrate abuse. As a result, some consider that it is not necessary to have specific child protection procedures or to adhere strictly to them,"" the inquiry concluded. In the case of the Jehovah's Witnesses, IICSA was particularly critical of a biblical rule applied by the group requiring two witnesses before an allegation of abuse is considered by elders. The Jehovah's Witnesses gave evidence that it also has policies requiring allegations to be reported to the police when there is a legal duty do so. However, the UK has no such ""mandatory reporting law"". IICSA strongly criticised the ""two witness rule"", saying it was likely to increase the suffering of victims, and failed to reflect the reality that ""child sexual abuse is most often perpetrated in the absence of witnesses"". A statement from the Jehovah's Witnesses said the protection of children was ""of utmost concern and importance to all Jehovah's Witnesses"" and they ""fully agree"" that all religious organisations should have a child protection policy. ""We will carefully and respectfully consider all the observations and recommendations contained in IICSA's investigation report,"" it added. The Union of Orthodox Hebrew Congregations, representing over 100 synagogues claimed its child protection hotline had only received four calls which ""raised concerns of a serious nature"". The Union provided no details of allegations of child sexual abuse within the previous 10 years to the inquiry. It told IICSA the ""prevailing environment and culture"" within the community led to a reduction in abuse compared with the population as a whole, according to the report. However, the inquiry said that while the figures it was given by religious organisations may reflect the ""known prevalence of child sexual abuse"", it was ""extremely unlikely that they reflect the full extent"". ""As a result of this investigation, a number of religious organisations have told us that they have altered, improved or recognised the need for policies and procedures in respect of child sexual abuse,"" the inquiry added. The inquiry in England and Wales was set up in July 2014 after hundreds of people came forward to say Jimmy Savile had abused them as children It is investigating claims against local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces and public and private institutions - as well as people in the public eye The inquiry is divided into public hearings into specific areas of concern, with witnesses giving evidence under oath; research into institutional failures in child protection, andthe Truth Project,,externalin which victims share their experiences with the inquiry either in private interviews or written form It heard evidence from 648 witnesses over four years, withthe final public hearingcoming in December 2020 The hearings have led to 16 reports so far, with another three to come this year. A final report will be published in 2022 Read morehere. The report gave the example of a girl who was sexually assaulted by a church volunteer when she was 12 years old. She disclosed the abuse to her mother, who reported it to the police. After being made aware of the allegations, a church minister told her mother that the abuser was ""valued"" and must be considered ""innocent until proven guilty"". Prof Alexis Jay, chairwoman of the inquiry, said: ""Religious organisations are defined by their moral purpose of teaching right from wrong and protection of the innocent and the vulnerable. ""However, when we heard about shocking failures to prevent and respond to child sexual abuse across almost all major religions, it became clear many are operating in direct conflict with this mission."" IICSA highlighted concerns that the law currently does not define religious leaders as holding a ""position of trust"" within child protection law. However, the inquiry did not make a finding requiring this to change. A final report following more than a dozen investigations is due next year. A key decision for the inquiry is whether to back ""mandatory reporting"" - a law making it a criminal offence for professionals not to report evidence of child abuse. Richard Scorer, a specialist abuse lawyer who acts for seven victim and survivor groups in the IICSA, said the latest report confirmed religious groups had ""catastrophically"" failed to protect children and the findings made the arguments for mandatory reporting ""overwhelming"". The Rev Dr Jonathan Hustler, secretary of the Conference of the Methodist Church, said the early indications from the report were that organisations were ""still failing their members"" and he said he was ""truly sorry"" when this happened in Methodist churches. The Muslim Council of Britain said the report made for ""difficult reading"" and said the protection of children should be at the centre of all Muslim institutions.

"Long Covid has two dozen common symptoms including fatigue, a cough and breathlessness Thousands of long Covid patients in Scotland are not being referred to a support service, a charity has claimed. Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland (CHSS) launched the service in February - but say they cannot get in touch with patients because of ""NHS bureaucracy"". The Scottish government said it was working with the NHS, but ""no one approach"" would fit all circumstances. The latest figures from the ONS,externalestimate 74,000 people in Scotland are living with ""self-reported"" long Covid. About 60,000 had experienced long Covid symptoms for more than 12 weeks and 28,000 for a year. However, CHSS said they are only managing between 55-60 patients per month. The condition has more than two dozen common symptoms - though experts have said they are often unpredictable and affect patients in different ways - and can last months. New research suggests that being fully vaccinated against Covidcuts the risk of an infection turning into long Covid. Will I ever get better from long Covid? Fund announced to ease 'constant battle' of long Covid The long Covid support service, funded by CHSS and the Scottish government, was described in February asa first step towards a comprehensive national service. Its aim was to work with GPs and develop a support plan for people early on in their experience with long Covid as they awaited further NHS treatment. It came after repeated calls for specialist long Covid clinics, which were introduced in England last year. At the time Scotland was devoting resources to research. However CHSS chief executive, Jane-Claire Judson, said the service has not made the progress she expected, and instead was meeting patients at the ""sharp end"" of long Covid. CHSS chief executive Jane-Claire Judson said the current system of support is not reaching enough people She said: ""They come to us as a self-referral, so we're supporting people at the worst points in their long Covid journey - but that's not what the service was for. ""It was to receive referrals from people going to primary care so that we could start working with them early on. That means that thousands of people are not getting the support they need from us or the NHS. ""It means the data sharing is not in place and bureaucracy is preventing us and the NHS from working together and having a massive impact on people with long Covid. That's not acceptable."" Mairead Johnson said long Covid has limited every aspect of her life Nine months after contracting Covid-19, Mairead Johnson, 58, and her husband Henry, 62, are reluctant to leave their house in Greenock as they are suffering the effects of long Covid. ""We only go to the shops once a week at night because we don't want to catch Covid again,"" she said. ""I was really frightened of getting the vaccine because again you didn't know is it going to make the long Covid worse."" Mairead said she and Henry have experienced the symptoms commonly associated with long Covid - breathlessness and fatigue - but that other effects are often unnerving. She said she has received some support, but often feels nothing can be done for new symptoms as medical professionals know little about the condition. ""My husband would smell burning when there was nothing burning,"" she said. ""My hair has stopped growing, my yawning reflex has gone, I get a racing heart and breathless just from standing up. I have joint pain in my foot, as if one toe is permanently broken. ""You get to that stage where something happens and you go that's long Covid. A doctor said to me that's quite a scary thing because there could be something else wrong that might be serious. ""We need research, but to do the research properly they've got to speak to us and it's got to be collated from every GP practice. It's a brilliant opportunity for them to find out what's happening because it's happening to so many people at the same time."" CHSS have nowpublished a long Covid action plan,externalwhich calls on the Scottish government to make a number of changes. Crucially it wants a fund to be set up for health boards to establish local long Covid services - although a figure has not yet been established. It also wants bureaucratic barriers in the NHS to be removed and data sharing to be improved so that it can speak to patients more quickly. Additionally the document calls for patient care plans to be developed and for medical staff to be trained on long Covid - as the charity said some do not recognise it as a real condition. During FMQs on Thursday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the organisation had made a number of very important points. She said she wanted to discuss the recommendations with the charity in detail and will give the capacity fund serious consideration in budget discussions. 'I don't feel 23 anymore, I feel so much older' Ministers put long Covid burden on GPs, says MSP No clinics for thousands of 'long Covid' patients The Scottish government says it recognises the impact long Covid is having and has responded by strengthening existing NHS services and investing Â£2.5m in long Covid Research. A government spokesperson added: ""NHS Scotland continues to deliver its full range of services to support the needs of people with long Covid, and we are engaging with NHS boards as they co-ordinate pathways across primary, community and secondary care services to support a coherent patient journey. ""While long Covid clinics are one model that NHS boards may explore, we know no one single approach is likely to fit all areas and circumstances. ""We are keeping all aspects under review, including specialist services and funding to ensure people suffering from long Covid receive the best possible care and support.""

"Young people strapped for space at home have helped to drive a ""rapid recovery"" in membership numbers at Gym Group. The gym operator said membership had jumped by a third since February as its sites reopened. Over two-thirds of its members are under the age of 34, and the company said many younger people lacked space to do home workouts. The chain, which operates 190 sites, aims to open 40 new gyms by the end of 2022 by converting former shops. ""The physical gym will always be really important for people and I think that's coming through in our numbers,"" chief executive Richard Darwin told the BBC's Today programme. While many people worked out at home during lockdown, Mr Darwin said that many younger people ""just don't have the space...  to be able to do home workouts"". UK loses 83% of department stores over five years People working out longer and later at night Gym Group is a low-cost gym operator, where customers do not have to have an annual contract. It said membership numbers had hit 730,000 by the end of June this year, compared with 547,000 at the end of February 2021 - during the lockdown. This compares with a peak membership of 891,000 in February 2020 before the first coronavirus lockdown measures were introduced. Gyms only reopened in England on 12 April this year, and later in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Gym Group reported a pre-tax loss of Â£28.5m for the six months to the end of June whiles sales tumbled by 21.4% to Â£29.3m. However, despite the losses, the company is looking to expand. It said it planned to repurpose vacant retail spaces on the High Street, which has seen the closures of chains such as Debenhams and Topshop accelerate during Covid. Gym Group has already opened seven new sites this year and plans to open an additional 40 by the end of 2022. ""We're seeing a lot of properties become available, particularly in retail parks which are very good for gyms as they have accessible parking and clear signage,"" Mr Darwin said. However, Dan Lane, senior analyst at investment platform Freetrade, said Gym Group's site rollout needed to be done ""efficiently"" and not end up ""diluting overall profits just for the sake of willing itself back to normality"". ""Rushing to snap up more properties while the current ones aren't at capacity and fewer of us are back in the office is a sign of how much the group needs footfall,"" he said. ""If we aren't going or coming from work, will we be bothered to leave our homes (many of which are now in the country, after the London exodus) to get to the gym?"" But with lockdown restrictions now lifted there have been signs that people are exercising less at home.

"Paralympic Games on the BBC Venue:Tokyo, JapanDates:24 August-5 SeptemberTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Follow on Radio 5 Live and on the BBC Sport website Baroness Grey-Thompson, who won 11 Paralympic gold medals for Great Britain and competed at every summer Games from 1988 to 2004, is part of the BBC Radio 5 Live team in Japan. Here, she talks about meeting Sarah Storey - who hasbroken the record for most Paralympic gold medals by a British athlete- for the first time nearly 30 years ago. I first met the then Sarah Bailey back in September 1992, sitting outside our accommodation block in the Paralympic village in Barcelona. I think we were going to be doing something for Blue Peter. At the age of 23 to her 14 I remember thinking that she looked really young. I now look back at the photos of that time and realise just how young she was. She was about halfway through her debut Paralympics, where she won six medals, including two golds. I remember thinking back to my first Games at 19 and not feeling half as prepared as she looked. She just seemed content with herself and very composed. After Atlanta four years later, where she won another three golds, we spent some time together visiting schools in the North West and it felt the world was her oyster. Sarah Bailey - as she then was - pictured with members of the Great Britain squad at the 1996 Paralympics in Atlanta, where, aged 18, she won three gold medals in swimming Fast forward another few cycles and it appears that her swimming career was just about prepping her for her cycling career, which started in 2005. There is part of me that wishes she had found cycling four years earlier, but sometimes you have to let things flow naturally. Meeting Barney, a pilot on the cycling team who later became her husband, meant that when she made the decision to switch she had immediate access to someone who knew the sport at the highest level. The main thing that I admire about her is that she works really hard. It is not enough to win gold and there are many ways that she could win a race, and sometimes with less energy expended, but every time she competes she wants to be the best she can be. That focus and determination I saw in her at 14 is still there. Racing is the nice part to an extent, but making yourself go out and do all the really hard miles in the winter is what makes a champion. You never know how long you might have in elite sport so she makes the most of what she has. I have always seen her be respectful of fellow athletes but it feels at times that she also competes against herself and she is a tough person to live up to. She is one of the British athletes of whom we hang gold medals around the neck before they compete, but she still has to put in good performances. The lack of crowds in Tokyo has been tough for all competitors, but for someone like Sarah, who has given so much to the sport, it does seem somewhat unfair that she cannot share this historic moment with those closest to her who have supported her since her earliest days in sport. I am used to seeing her family in a big group at track events. Her parents have been to every Games up to this one and I know she misses them - I do too. I miss the 'Go Bails' flag that they used to have - 'Go Storey' doesn't have the same ring to it! I also remember first seeing the knitted dolls that her parents had of her and Barney a long time ago and they have now added to it with their children - Louisa and Charlie - and their cat. Apparently they are sitting on Sarah's bed so she can have her family close. There is so much made of elite athletes becoming mums, but so many people do not know the choices and plans that need to be made so this can happen. I remember talking to Sarah about my own chaotic experience of motherhood. It is a tough decision and all the skills you have learned in sport about negotiating, planning and logistics just get honed when it happens. Sarah Storey and Lee Pearson both added three gold medals to their tallies in Tokyo It makes you realise that you are privileged and if you are going to be both an athlete and a mum, then you just have to make both work. I was privileged to be at the velodrome in Riowhen she won her 12th gold,which beat my record. There wasn't much that needed to be said. I was really proud that she had done it. Records are a moment in time and you are lucky if you hold them. To pass it on to someone I respect is a bonus. It was never a case of 'if' but 'when'. Although Sarah and I obviously prefer individual sports, it would have been fun to do something with her where our careers overlapped. There were many people who wanted her to try athletics but I think it had the same lack of appeal as me doing swimming. Most of us are only good at one sport - I was only good at wheelchair racing - but there are probably three or four sports she could have transferred into and been good at them. I imagine Louisa and Charlie are fairly swift on their bikes so they might give me a run for my money if I was to race them. If I were to sum up her career I think she has been an amazing cyclist who happened to do swimming for a bit. More power to her just staying in love with the sport and her carrying on being the best she can.

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"".

A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul.

Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"".

The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

A stellar day of golds and glory for Great Britain from Sarah Story in the small hours of Thursday morning to Dan Pembroke in the early afternoon. Between those two high points, there were plenty of other highlights with Ed Watson and Bethany Firth bagging golds on the road and in the pool and Sammi Kinghorn, Crystal Lane-Wright and Fin Graham mining a rich vein of silver. You can read the full roll-call of British success over herein our round-up. Andy StevensonParalympic presenter on BBC Radio 5 Live in Tokyo It's crazy to think Sarah Storey's first Paralympic Games was 29 years ago, 1992, when she was a young swimmer. Ellie Simmonds has been to four Games and is one of the most recognisable and most successful Paralympians of all time, in her own right. And yet she's done half the Paralympics that Sarah Storey has. It does put it into some context. Javelin F13 Dan Pembroke is thrown a Union Jack from the stands. He is the Paralympic champion via a massive Paralympic record throw. He used to compete as an able-bodied athlete, finishing 11th at the under-20 world championshipships in 2011, before a degenerative eye condition made him eligible for para-athletics. Javelin F13 Great Britainâs Dan Pembroke still leads thanks to his 69.52m Paralympic record-breaking throw. There has been a change behind him where Iran Ali Pirouj has moved on up to second with a 63.41m effort. Women's C4-5 road race Crystal Lane-Wright, who claimed silver in the women's C4-5 road race, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live breakfast:""I'm over the moon. It's been a tough race; it's been a tough couple of weeks, really. So successful for us and I'm really pleased with the medals. ""It's not sunk in yet. The rain that we had... the conditions were quite extreme today."" ""We have had an incredible day racing. We have had one and two, me and Sarah [Storey] in our race, then we have Ben Watson and Finlay Graham in the other race at the same time. ""I think one of the special things about this team is that we really are a team. I think it'll feel real when we can all get back together and talk about it."" Dan Greaves spoke to Channel 4 after his bronze medal win in the Discus - F64: ""Had you have told me in Sydney in 2000, when I was 18 years-old that I'd go to a further five games, I probably would have laughed in your face and not believed you. To still be here and winning medals is a dream come true. ""I'm slightly frustrated with the performance but under the conditions I'm proud of how I handled the situation. I tried to capitalize on the conditions and I'm so chuffed to walk away with a medal. You have to adapt and it's like a rainy day in Manchester right? ""55m is something I can do with my eyes closed so I'm frustrated about that but it's another medal at my sixth games and it's a lifelong ambition to walk away with a medal each time. ""I've really missed my family, I haven't really spoken to them since I've been here because I didn't want them to miss me that much. Henry has just started school and Matilda is still at pre-school. I can't wait to walk through that front door and show them how daddy's won a medal. It will mean the world to them. ""My training now isn't about my personal gain, it's to show them that if you're dedicated, hard working and committed, you can achieve anything."" Javelin F13 Has that put him over the horizon and into the winners enclosure? Dan Pembroke launches the javelin out to 69.52m - a new Paralympic record. Spainâs Hector Cabrera Llacer is second on 61.13m. Javelin - F13 Britainâs Dan Pembroke leads the javelin standings with a punchy effort of 63.65m. That is going to take some beating. Sammi Kinghorn is going to be a star at Paris 2024 and far beyond. The Scot added 400m silver to 100m bronze in a superb couple of days work. 800m T53 Shock and awe. Absolutely vaporised the field. That is the Swissâ third medal of the Games. Dai Yunqiang was second after finishing fast for China. Daniel Romanchuk was fourth. 800m - T53 Swiss Marcel Hug up against American Daniel Romanchuk? Epic wheelchair racing. Titans of the carbon fibre racing machines. Here we go. 4x100m women's relay Great Britain's 4x100m women's relay team spoke to Channel 4 after finishing in fourth: Maisie Summers-Newton said:""I think we all tried our best, it would have been nice to come away with a medal for all of us but to come fourth in a Paralympic Games final, with all these girls, I think it was a really good race. Zara Mullooly said:"" It's kind of been a week of lows and it would have been nice to have finished it on a high but everyone pulled their weight and tried their hardest so we couldn't really have asked for more to be honest."" Toni Shaw said:""Relays are my absolute favourite race, especially when it's with these guys! Stephanie Millward said: ""This will probably be my last Games, I've done four and had my fair share. I've enjoyed each and every one of them and to finish it on a high in fourth is incredible. We're fourth in the whole wide world and it's with this amazing group of people. It's wonderful. We were so close to a medal but these will go on and do more medals and win more and more. They're an inspiration to everybody and we should just be proud of coming fourth."" F13 Javelin Great Britainâs Dan Pembroke set a new European record of 66.75m in Poland in June and is a hot prospect to add some Paralympic gold to his continental gong. The 29-year-old was previously an able-bodied thrower, competing at the under-20 world championship in 2011, before a condition causing deteriorating eyesight made him eligible for para events. Discus - F64 Dan Greaves becomes the first Briton to win track and field medals at six different Paralympic Games after his throw of 53.56m earns bronze in a wet, windy, slippy discus final. Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson managed medals at four different Games. If you missed it earlierâ¦. 4x100m relay The judgesâ gavel has fallen on the Canadian and Chinese quartet. They are wiped out of the standings.  But that doesnât change the top three. Britain remain fourth and just outside the podium velvet rope. 4x100m relay Zara Mullooly cannot quite reel in the distance separating her from a podium finish. Britain finish fourth as the United States edge Russia for gold and Australia stay out of reach in third. The judges are still checking the changeoversâ¦. 4x100m relay Zara Mullooly and Toni Shaw have it all to doâ¦ But they are two of the strongest swimmers in the raceâ¦ Â© 2025 BBC.

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought.

""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said.

""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

"Schools are not ""drivers"" or ""hubs"" of Covid infection, Public Health England's medical director has said. Dr Yvonne Doyle said she understood parents' nervousness about schools returning after the summer in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. She stressed that lots of measures to cut Covid spread remained in place. But Prof Calum Semple, a government scientific adviser, said with most adults vaccinated, schools were likely to be a ""greater part of the problem"". Some have suggesteda surge in cases in Scotland, where pupils returned in August, could be linked to schools. Fewer measures are in place in schools than during last term, with bubbles and masks no longer in use in England and Wales, while Northern Ireland has also scrapped social distancing requirements. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told BBC Breakfast it was right for children to have a ""much more normal education experience"", with adults being able to go back to the pub, music festivals and theatres. He said there needed to be a ""sensible balance"" and that was why mass testing of secondary school pupils was taking place. How are schools being kept Covid-safe this term? When do school pupils have to self-isolate? Mixed emotions as pupils return to English schools Dr Doyle said there were lots of regimes in place already to prevent the spread, including extra cleaning, advice on ventilation and testing. She said: ""We understand, and I understand fully, that parents may be nervous but I would stress again that schools are not the drivers and not the hubs of infection."" She added that PHE attributed some of the school-related coronavirus figures to the testing regime. This video can not be played Education Secretary Gavin Williamson says pupils deserve to have a normal education experience Prof Semple, professor of child health and outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool, said he believed schools should stay open ""nearly at all costs"" because the damage caused by a lack of education could be lifelong. He said while pupils were unlikely to get sick themselves they could transmit the disease to others, and that this should be considered when discussing vaccines for 12 to 15-year-olds. A paper,published by the Royal Society,external, suggests the reopening of schools, and particularly secondary schools, is associated with an increased risk of transmission both among school-aged pupils and in the wider community. But it said the scale of that increase depended on control measures in the classroom and community as well as compliance with mass testing. Prof Semple said his biggest worry was closing schools again because education was very important but he said school building stock was poor, with ventilation an issue. Both experts agreed that school is the best place for children. But vaccinating everyone else means that they'll look more like ""hubs"" than they did last year. If your problems get smaller and mine stay the same, I start to look worse than you. Last September, older teenagers and younger adults saw the fastest rises in infections and cases in England. This year, they'll be able to get vaccinated. Their place as ""leaders"" in infection rates and rises is likely to be taken by children because everyone else will have the vaccine to slow the spread. The decision about vaccination for under-16s is finely balanced because the risks of illness for children from Covid are so low. Parents have to balance the risks of Covid with the risks of disruption to education. Health experts currently appear more worried about missing education. Scientists have already said it is""highly likely"" that high levels of coronavirus will be seen in schoolsby the end of September. And there could be consequences for parents and carers, they say - but it remains to be seen what effect it will have on cases and hospital admissions. Imperial College epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson said the UK could expect cases to surge in step with what has happened in Scotland when schools return but the big unknown was how long that surge would last. He said that in a post-vaccine world the country could cope with much higher levels of cases and what ministers might consider an ""acceptable level of hospitalisation"" but he said that daily caseloads of 100,000 to 150,000 would put ""significant demands on the healthcare system"". In Scotland more than 32,000 pupils have been off school due to Covid-19 as of Tuesday - with 6,471 having the virus, up from 3,500 the week before, while a further 25,622 were isolating. Among the measures being implemented for safety in schools in England are carbon dioxide monitors to help improve ventilation,with 300,000 being made available, but when asked on BBC Breakfast Mr Williamson was unable to say how many were already in place. While CO2 monitors do not affect the transmission risk in schools, they can help to indicate how well ventilated a classroom is. Humans breathe out a higher concentration of carbon dioxide than is present in the atmosphere, so the monitors help to detect how much of the surrounding air has been breathed out, and how much is fresh air from outside. Asked about vaccinations for 12 to 15-year-olds the education secretary said parents would find it ""deeply reassuring to have a choice of whether their children should have a vaccination or not"" and that he was ""very keen"" to hear the decision from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). He said that government was ""ready to go"" if it did decide to extend the eligibility to children that age. Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the JCVI, said there were many arguments for and against vaccinating the age group but said whatever decision the committee reached would be in children's best interests. Prof Semple, who sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said it was a ""really difficult judgement"" with a fine balancing act between a ""rare side effect"", in myocarditis, and the low risk from Covid to children themselves and the impact of transmission on wider society.

"Paralympic Games on the BBC Venue:Tokyo, JapanDates:24 August-5 SeptemberTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Follow on Radio 5 Live and on the BBC Sport website Baroness Grey-Thompson, who won 11 Paralympic gold medals for Great Britain and competed at every summer Games from 1988 to 2004, is part of the BBC Radio 5 Live team in Japan. Here, she talks about meeting Sarah Storey - who hasbroken the record for most Paralympic gold medals by a British athlete- for the first time nearly 30 years ago. I first met the then Sarah Bailey back in September 1992, sitting outside our accommodation block in the Paralympic village in Barcelona. I think we were going to be doing something for Blue Peter. At the age of 23 to her 14 I remember thinking that she looked really young. I now look back at the photos of that time and realise just how young she was. She was about halfway through her debut Paralympics, where she won six medals, including two golds. I remember thinking back to my first Games at 19 and not feeling half as prepared as she looked. She just seemed content with herself and very composed. After Atlanta four years later, where she won another three golds, we spent some time together visiting schools in the North West and it felt the world was her oyster. Sarah Bailey - as she then was - pictured with members of the Great Britain squad at the 1996 Paralympics in Atlanta, where, aged 18, she won three gold medals in swimming Fast forward another few cycles and it appears that her swimming career was just about prepping her for her cycling career, which started in 2005. There is part of me that wishes she had found cycling four years earlier, but sometimes you have to let things flow naturally. Meeting Barney, a pilot on the cycling team who later became her husband, meant that when she made the decision to switch she had immediate access to someone who knew the sport at the highest level. The main thing that I admire about her is that she works really hard. It is not enough to win gold and there are many ways that she could win a race, and sometimes with less energy expended, but every time she competes she wants to be the best she can be. That focus and determination I saw in her at 14 is still there. Racing is the nice part to an extent, but making yourself go out and do all the really hard miles in the winter is what makes a champion. You never know how long you might have in elite sport so she makes the most of what she has. I have always seen her be respectful of fellow athletes but it feels at times that she also competes against herself and she is a tough person to live up to. She is one of the British athletes of whom we hang gold medals around the neck before they compete, but she still has to put in good performances. The lack of crowds in Tokyo has been tough for all competitors, but for someone like Sarah, who has given so much to the sport, it does seem somewhat unfair that she cannot share this historic moment with those closest to her who have supported her since her earliest days in sport. I am used to seeing her family in a big group at track events. Her parents have been to every Games up to this one and I know she misses them - I do too. I miss the 'Go Bails' flag that they used to have - 'Go Storey' doesn't have the same ring to it! I also remember first seeing the knitted dolls that her parents had of her and Barney a long time ago and they have now added to it with their children - Louisa and Charlie - and their cat. Apparently they are sitting on Sarah's bed so she can have her family close. There is so much made of elite athletes becoming mums, but so many people do not know the choices and plans that need to be made so this can happen. I remember talking to Sarah about my own chaotic experience of motherhood. It is a tough decision and all the skills you have learned in sport about negotiating, planning and logistics just get honed when it happens. Sarah Storey and Lee Pearson both added three gold medals to their tallies in Tokyo It makes you realise that you are privileged and if you are going to be both an athlete and a mum, then you just have to make both work. I was privileged to be at the velodrome in Riowhen she won her 12th gold,which beat my record. There wasn't much that needed to be said. I was really proud that she had done it. Records are a moment in time and you are lucky if you hold them. To pass it on to someone I respect is a bonus. It was never a case of 'if' but 'when'. Although Sarah and I obviously prefer individual sports, it would have been fun to do something with her where our careers overlapped. There were many people who wanted her to try athletics but I think it had the same lack of appeal as me doing swimming. Most of us are only good at one sport - I was only good at wheelchair racing - but there are probably three or four sports she could have transferred into and been good at them. I imagine Louisa and Charlie are fairly swift on their bikes so they might give me a run for my money if I was to race them. If I were to sum up her career I think she has been an amazing cyclist who happened to do swimming for a bit. More power to her just staying in love with the sport and her carrying on being the best she can.

"Jermaine (left) and Kofi Reid (right) pulled Frankie, 7, out of the lake when he fell off a jetty A mother whose young son fell into a lake has used social media to track down the two men who rescued him. Natasha Creek and Frankie, 7, were at Caldecotte Lake in Milton Keynes when he fell off a jetty last month. Brothers Kofi and Jermaine Reid were nearby and pulled him from the water but she said she was too shaken at the time to properly thank them. She found the pair after a Facebook appeal and was ""blown away"" to meet them again with the whole family. The family arranged to meet the brothers at a local pub after tracking them down using social media Mrs Creek said the incident, on 23 August, happened quickly and her son was not a strong swimmer. ""I was facing away for just a second and didn't hear him fall into the water as my dogs were making so much noise,"" she said. ""The two lads were sitting nearby, heard the splash and ran to drag him out. We still have our son because of their quick actions. They saved his life."" Determined to track them down, she wrotea Facebook post,externalwith a grainy picture taken just seconds before Frankie fell into the water. It was shared more than 400 times in 24 hours and a friend of one of the brothers came forward to put them in touch. Mrs Creek said: ""I am amazed at how quickly this all escalated - so many friends and complete strangers helping to find these two amazing lads."" Natasha Creek shared a grainy picture of her son and the then-strangers who rescued him at Caldecotte Lake in Milton Keynes The family - Natasha Creek, husband Phil, son Frankie and daughter Arabella - arranged to meet Kofi, 23, and Jermaine, 29, at a local pub. Mrs Creek said: ""We were blown away. They were the nicest guys and so humble about what they did."" Kofi described the reunion as ""the best thing"". ""They are such a loving family and it was a pleasure meeting and spending time together,"" he said. ""I'm just happy me and my brother were at the right place at the right time.""

"This video can not be played Watch: Top US general admits 'anger and pain' over Afghanistan The top US general has described the Taliban as a ""ruthless group"" and says it is unclear whether they will change. Gen Mark Milley said, however, it was ""possible"" that the US would co-ordinate with the Islamist militants on future counter-terrorism operations. US forces withdrew from Afghanistan on Tuesday, ending America's longest war 20 years after launching an invasion to oust the Taliban. The Islamists are now in control and expected to announce a new government. Gen Milley was speaking alongside US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, in their first public remarks since the last troops left Afghanistan. US President Joe Biden has been widely criticised over the abrupt manner of the withdrawal, which led to the unexpected collapse of the Afghan security forces the US had trained and funded for years. The Taliban's lightning advance sparked off a frenetic effort to evacuate thousands of foreign nationals and local Afghans who had been working for them. In the news conference on Wednesday, both Gen Milley and Secretary Austin praised the troops who had served in Afghanistan and the massive evacuation mission. Asked about their co-ordination with the Taliban in getting evacuees to the airport, Mr Austin said: ""We were working with the Taliban on a very narrow set of issues, and that was just that - to get as many people out as we possibly could."" ""In war you do what you must in order to reduce risk to mission and force, not what you necessarily want to do,"" Gen Milley added. He said it was possible that the US would co-ordinate with the Taliban on future action againstIslamic State affiliate IS-K, the group which claimed an attack outside Kabul airport last week that killed as many as 170 people, including 13 US service personnel. IS-K is the most extreme and violent of all the jihadist militant groups in Afghanistan. It has major differences with the Taliban, accusing them of abandoning jihad and the battlefield. Mr Austin, meanwhile, said he would ""not want to make any predictions"" on future co-operation. But he added that officials would ""do everything that we can to make sure we remain focused on [IS-K], understand that network, and at the time of our choosing in the future, hold them accountable for what they've done"". In total, the evacuation operation saw more than 123,000 people wishing to flee the Taliban airlifted out of the country. The US estimates that there are between 100 and 200 Americans still in Afghanistan. FACT-CHECK:Biden on Afghanistan withdrawal fact-checked FEATURE:Passport delay blamed for baby stranded in Kabul ANALYSIS:How can the West stop Afghan terror bases? US Under-Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said ""all possible options"" were being looked at to get remaining US citizens and people who had worked with the US out of the country. Meanwhile, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab saidhe was not certain how many UK nationals remained in the country,but that it was believed to be in the ""low hundreds"". The Taliban have celebrated the final withdrawal of foreign forces, and are now focusing on forming a government. The deputy head of the Taliban's political office in Qatar, Sher Abbas Stanekza, told BBC Pashto that a new government could be announced in the next two days. This video can not be played The Taliban are asked if there will be a place for women in its new government He said there would be a role for women at lower levels but not in top positions. He also said that those who served in government in the past two decades would not be included. This magical word ""inclusive"" is being used by Afghanistan's neighbours to try to put pressure on the Taliban to share some of the power so they don't have absolute control. But look at it in pure political terms. The Taliban have come to power much more quickly than even they expected. And they feel they have an overwhelming mandate to pursue their overriding objective to establish an Islamic system. In this new emerging Islamic emirate, women will be playing secondary roles to men. This is already very different from what we heard even two years ago, when the Taliban started discussing with representatives of the Afghan government and civil society. They said then that women could have any roles in our new Islamic government except the president or prime minister. They could be ministers or CEOs. Now they seem to be rolling back from that because what happened in the past is now history. It's a new day for them and it's a day when the Taliban are in charge.

Thanks for joining us. Thursday's coronavirus live coverage was written by Joseph Lee, Hazel Shearing and George Bowden, and edited by Alex Therrien and Rob Corp. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for today. But before we do, here's a look at the main coronavirus developments this Thursday: More news from Scotland, where thousands of long Covid patients are feared to have not been referred to a support service. Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland launched the service in February - but now says it cannot get in touch with patients because of ""NHS bureaucracy"". The Scottish government said it was working with the NHS, but ""no one approach"" would fit all circumstances. The latest figures from the ONS estimate 74,000 people in Scotland are living with ""self-reported"" long Covid. About 60,000 had experienced long Covid symptoms for more than 12 weeks and 28,000 for a year. Read morehere. Case rates are falling in all parts of England apart from the North East, according to Public Health England's latest weekly surveillance report. The highest rate is in the South West. There were 362.9 cases per 100,000 people in the week ending 29 August - down week-on-week from 491.1. London has the lowest rate, down from 256.3 to 226.8. In the North East, the rate has risen slightly from 306.5 to 314.9. In terms of age, the highest rate is among 10 to 19-year-olds (46.8) and the lowest is among those aged over 80 (110.3). Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at PHE, says: ""Cases remain high although fairly stable across the country. In the coming days and weeks, testing to return to school will detect cases of Covid-19 infection acquired during the summer holidays."" More than 32,000 pupils in Scotland were absent due to Covid this week, school attendance figures show. The figure includes those who had the virus, and those who are self-isolating as a close contact. School pupils in Scotland returned to classrooms two weeks ago - ahead of other UK nations. Pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland began their return to school on Thursday. Read morehere. A further 38,154 coronavirus cases have been reported across the UK, alongside another 178 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.  Vaccination for 16 and 17-year-olds began less than a month ago Vaccine uptake among 16 and 17-year-olds has been ""strong"", England's top GP said, as figures showed almost two-thirds of this age group in Wales (63%) and half in England have had one jab. In Scotland, the figure is 51% and in Northern Ireland it is 40%. Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and deputy lead for NHS Englandâs vaccination programme, said it was important for eligible young people to be get vaccinated as schools, colleges and universities begin term. Some nightclubs, places of worship and university campuses would be offering the jab this weekend in an effort to make it as convenient as possible, she said. They include London's G-A-Y club, the Hindu Temple in Crawley and the University of Kentâs Canterbury Campus. NHS England said 620,000 people aged 16 and 17 had now received the first dose of the vaccine. The UK vaccine advisory group the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has yet to say when people in this age group will be offered a second dose. Prof Calum Semple said he was targeted by anti-vaccination groups but abuse has come from all sides Scientists on the government's advisory committee Sage have been sent suspicious packages by members of the public who feel they are ""making bad decisions"", one of them has revealed. Prof Calum Semple from the University of Liverpool, who has frequently appeared in the media to offer expert views on the Covid-19 pandemic, was asked at a Royal Society of Medicine webinar about the abuse science advisers had received. Society president Prof Roger Kirby asked him about being ""targeted by the anti-vax group"" and suggested someone had posted messages saying ""Calum kills wildlife for fun"" and mentioned where the scientist lives. Prof Semple confirmed that and added: ""We are fortunate that the police are open to hearing from us and thereâs good liaison support for us when these threats are made. That was one particularly nasty event. âThere have been others since then and suspicious packages sent to Sage members and myself. âThis comes from both extremes â people that feel that weâre making bad decisions and they donât appreciate that Sage is not a decision-making body.â Sage - the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies - provides technical advice to ministers during a crisis but decisions are taken by ministers. Covid-19 vaccines in England are estimated to have directly averted more than 143,600 hospital admissions in those over 65, according to new figures from Public Health England. PHE said it was likely to be an underestimate due to the way the figure is calculated. Approximately 36,100 admissions were prevented in those aged 65
to 74, 58,800 in those aged 75 to 84, and 48,700 in those aged 85 and over. Estimates for the number of deaths in England directly averted by the vaccine rollout are unchanged at between 102,500 and 109,500. The first jab outside of a trial was administered in England in December 2020. Since then, more than 48 million first doses have been recorded across the UK. It is ""too early to predict"" whether supermarkets will have supply issues at Christmastime, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) says. Andrew Opie, the BRC's head of food and sustainability, says it is ""not anticipating major problems for Christmas at the moment"", but adds the festive period would be ""incredibly challenging in some areas"". ""If we do see problems then that is going to have an impact on products on the shelf,"" he tells the UK Trade and Business Commission, a group of MPs and business representatives. Alex Veitch from Logistics UK says there has been a shortage of lorry drivers for several years, but this is now an ""acute shortage"". There is a shortage of more than 100,000 drivers in the UK, according to the Road Haulage Association. ""It's really to do with Covid to a very large extent, and Brexit to a lesser extent, added to the long-term chronic problem of not enough people joining the sector,"" Veitch says . The BRC and others want the government to grant a 12-month Covid-19 recovery visa to allow workers from Europe to make up for skills shortages - not only as HGV drivers, but also in roles in food manufacturing and processing. This video can not be played BBC reporter Lucy Adams investigated long Covid after she and her daughter developed the illness As we've been reporting today, a new study suggestsbeing fully vaccinated can cut your chance of getting long Covideven if you get a rare breakthrough infection. But what is long Covid? Guidance for health workers defines long Covid as symptoms lasting for more than 12 weeks which can't be explained by another cause. They can follow a severe or a mild infection. The NHS says symptoms can include:  One large study found 200 symptoms affecting 10 organ systems in people with long Covid. They included hallucinations, insomnia, hearing and vision changes, short-term memory loss and speech and language issues. Others have reported gastro-intestinal and bladder problems, changes to periods and skin conditions. The severity of symptoms varies, but many have been left unable to perform tasks like showering, grocery shopping and remembering words. There is currently no test. Instead, doctors diagnose it in people who have had a Covid infection by ruling out other causes. Read more about long Covid Ministers should do more to prepare the public for the fact there will be waves of higher levels of infection this winter, according to the new director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Prof Liam Smeeth says he does not think there will be a return to severe lockdown restrictions as weâve seen before and that for most doubled-jabbed adults Covid will now be a ""fairly benign disease"". But he adds that the government cannot take its foot off all controls because of the numbers of people still unvaccinated who are vulnerable to severe disease. Rather than see strict lockdowns, he says there might be periods when the public need to be encouraged not to mix so much, to wear masks in indoor spaces and not to go to hospital unless really necessary. Mum Clare is relieved schools are opening with fewer restrictions Parents have been sharing their contrasting emotionsas schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland welcome back pupils for the new academic year. Clare Smyth, from Cambridgeshire, has two young sons in primary school - Seb, 10, and Joshua, who is seven. She is ""overjoyed"" that the start of term will see restrictions eased in schools. ""I'm really relieved that our school has decided to stop all social distancing restrictions - bubbles, zones in the playground. But I'm apprehensive for the winter as the season progresses, as to whether the restrictions will return,"" she says. Lisa will not be sending her children back to school Lisa Diaz's children Alex, 11, and eight-year-old Helena have not been into their Wigan primary school for more than a year after she pulled them out 10 days before the first lockdown. She says she is so angry and worried about the lack of safety measures in place this term that they won't be returning, even though she has been threatened with fines or even prison. Lisa has a genetic blood disorder which makes her particularly concerned that when schools reopen ""there will be nothing between our children and Covid-19"". Lisa says she was ""devastated"" by the choice and would like to see many more safety measures in schools, such as masks and social distancing. ""I'm not saying it's an easy decision. I fully empathise with parents up and down the country,"" she says. Read more parents' stories here. The shadow education secretary criticised the decision to end mask requirements in schools More on the return to school, as Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green accuses the government of ""sitting on its hands"" instead of preparing for the reopening. She tells the BBC News Channel that Labour had been ""pleading for months"" for a range of measures to be implemented in schools, including robust ventilation systems rather than simply monitoring levels of CO2 as the government has proposed. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson should put his ""foot on the accelerator"" to improve ventilation, she said. Asked if Labour wanted to see masks in schools, Green says she's ""at a loss"" to explain why they were made voluntary while infection rates are rising. She says many head teachers will make sensible decisions for their own schools, however. Asked if she wants the vaccine expert group the JCVI to recommend offering jabs to everyone aged 12 to 15, Green says there are ""finely balanced considerations"" but she wants to see a decision made quickly. The majority of adults (83%) arriving in England between 12 July and 17 August from an amber list country fully adhered to coronavirus quarantine requirements, according to a survey by the Office for National Statistics. During this period, people arrivals from an amber tier location were required to quarantine for 10 days unless they were exempt due to their job, or they took part in the test-to-release scheme. Some 91% of respondents said they took both of the required day-two and day-eight coronavirus tests. A change in the rules now means those who are fully vaccinated can avoid quarantine when arriving from an amber list nation, but still must take a pre-arrival and day-two Covid test. Read more about the ruleshere. Plans for nightclubs and other venues in Scotland to require proof of vaccination upon entry outweigh concerns and are preferable to another Covid lockdown, says the nation's health secretary. Humza Yousaf said: ""The benefits of a certification scheme, in terms of a public health intervention, in terms of incentivising vaccination, those benefits outweigh the concerns that still remain."" Mr Yousaf had previously voiced his scepticism about passports, including fears they could widen inequality. The passports are due to be brought in at the end of the month andwill apply to indoor and outdoor events- but the proposal will need to be approved by MSPs next week. Ministers in England want ""high-risk"" settings such as nightclubs to begin requiring valid Covid passes - which prove vaccination - by the end of September. Read morehere. Tom Cruise's films Top Gun: Maverick and Mission: Impossible 7 have been delayed due to a surge in US Covid-19 cases caused by the Delta variant. Paramount pushed the Top Gun sequel back six months to May next year, while the seventh installment of the Mission: Impossible franchise - largely filmed in the UK - has been moved from May to September next year. The studio has also delayed the release of comedy Jackass Forever. Read morehere. Some teenagers got their jab on site at music festivals As we have been reporting, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said earlier today (see post at 09:05) that he wants to see a decision on offering the jab to all 12 to 15-year-olds made very soon. Currently, all 16 and 17 year-olds are being offered a first dose. No second dose is planned as yet. Vaccinations are also recommended for those aged 12 to 15 if they are at higher risk due to:  Children of the same age who live with people who have a suppressed immune system can also be vaccinated, to protect family members. NHS organisations in England have been told to make preparations to jab all 12 to 15-year-olds, but they are waiting on a recommendation from experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. Read more about children and the vaccines Eleanor LawrieBBC News As we have been reporting, pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have been returning to schools today. The UK government has pledged about 300,000 CO2 monitors to schools in England this term to help detect poor ventilation. Covid is a respiratory virus, so it is expelled into the air
when people breathe and talk. This allows very small particles carrying the virus to
spread around a room, where they can last a couple of hours. Ventilation cuts the risk of catching the virus by reducing
the level of particles in the air that someone is exposed to. While CO2 monitors do not affect transmission risk in
schools, they can help to indicate how well ventilated a classroom is. We breathe out a higher concentration of
carbon dioxide than is present in the atmosphere, so the monitors help to
detect how much of the surrounding air has been breathed out, and how much is
fresh air from outside. Catherine Noakes, professor of environmental engineering
for buildings at the University of Leeds, and a specialist in airborne
infections, says ventilation could reduce airborne risk of
coronavirus by up to 70%, although it wonât stop close contact transmission. âIn a classroom, ventilation wonât have much effect on
transmission from the person sat next to you, but it will from the person other
side of the room,â she says. âThe monitors will help schools to realise which areas are
better or poorly ventilated. In some classrooms they will be able to open
windows, while others may need different solutions such as putting air cleaners in that room.â How are pupils being kept Covid-safe this term?

Read more about children and the vaccines Eleanor LawrieBBC News As we have been reporting, pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have been returning to schools today. The UK government has pledged about 300,000 CO2 monitors to schools in England this term to help detect poor ventilation. Covid is a respiratory virus, so it is expelled into the air
when people breathe and talk. This allows very small particles carrying the virus to
spread around a room, where they can last a couple of hours. Ventilation cuts the risk of catching the virus by reducing
the level of particles in the air that someone is exposed to. While CO2 monitors do not affect transmission risk in
schools, they can help to indicate how well ventilated a classroom is. We breathe out a higher concentration of
carbon dioxide than is present in the atmosphere, so the monitors help to
detect how much of the surrounding air has been breathed out, and how much is
fresh air from outside. Catherine Noakes, professor of environmental engineering
for buildings at the University of Leeds, and a specialist in airborne
infections, says ventilation could reduce airborne risk of
coronavirus by up to 70%, although it wonât stop close contact transmission. âIn a classroom, ventilation wonât have much effect on
transmission from the person sat next to you, but it will from the person other
side of the room,â she says. âThe monitors will help schools to realise which areas are
better or poorly ventilated. In some classrooms they will be able to open
windows, while others may need different solutions such as putting air cleaners in that room.â How are pupils being kept Covid-safe this term?

Thanks for joining us. Thursday's coronavirus live coverage was written by Joseph Lee, Hazel Shearing and George Bowden, and edited by Alex Therrien and Rob Corp. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for today. But before we do, here's a look at the main coronavirus developments this Thursday: More news from Scotland, where thousands of long Covid patients are feared to have not been referred to a support service. Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland launched the service in February - but now says it cannot get in touch with patients because of ""NHS bureaucracy"". The Scottish government said it was working with the NHS, but ""no one approach"" would fit all circumstances. The latest figures from the ONS estimate 74,000 people in Scotland are living with ""self-reported"" long Covid. About 60,000 had experienced long Covid symptoms for more than 12 weeks and 28,000 for a year. Read morehere. Case rates are falling in all parts of England apart from the North East, according to Public Health England's latest weekly surveillance report. The highest rate is in the South West. There were 362.9 cases per 100,000 people in the week ending 29 August - down week-on-week from 491.1. London has the lowest rate, down from 256.3 to 226.8. In the North East, the rate has risen slightly from 306.5 to 314.9. In terms of age, the highest rate is among 10 to 19-year-olds (46.8) and the lowest is among those aged over 80 (110.3). Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at PHE, says: ""Cases remain high although fairly stable across the country. In the coming days and weeks, testing to return to school will detect cases of Covid-19 infection acquired during the summer holidays."" More than 32,000 pupils in Scotland were absent due to Covid this week, school attendance figures show. The figure includes those who had the virus, and those who are self-isolating as a close contact. School pupils in Scotland returned to classrooms two weeks ago - ahead of other UK nations. Pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland began their return to school on Thursday. Read morehere. A further 38,154 coronavirus cases have been reported across the UK, alongside another 178 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.  Vaccination for 16 and 17-year-olds began less than a month ago Vaccine uptake among 16 and 17-year-olds has been ""strong"", England's top GP said, as figures showed almost two-thirds of this age group in Wales (63%) and half in England have had one jab. In Scotland, the figure is 51% and in Northern Ireland it is 40%. Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and deputy lead for NHS Englandâs vaccination programme, said it was important for eligible young people to be get vaccinated as schools, colleges and universities begin term. Some nightclubs, places of worship and university campuses would be offering the jab this weekend in an effort to make it as convenient as possible, she said. They include London's G-A-Y club, the Hindu Temple in Crawley and the University of Kentâs Canterbury Campus. NHS England said 620,000 people aged 16 and 17 had now received the first dose of the vaccine. The UK vaccine advisory group the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has yet to say when people in this age group will be offered a second dose. Prof Calum Semple said he was targeted by anti-vaccination groups but abuse has come from all sides Scientists on the government's advisory committee Sage have been sent suspicious packages by members of the public who feel they are ""making bad decisions"", one of them has revealed. Prof Calum Semple from the University of Liverpool, who has frequently appeared in the media to offer expert views on the Covid-19 pandemic, was asked at a Royal Society of Medicine webinar about the abuse science advisers had received. Society president Prof Roger Kirby asked him about being ""targeted by the anti-vax group"" and suggested someone had posted messages saying ""Calum kills wildlife for fun"" and mentioned where the scientist lives. Prof Semple confirmed that and added: ""We are fortunate that the police are open to hearing from us and thereâs good liaison support for us when these threats are made. That was one particularly nasty event. âThere have been others since then and suspicious packages sent to Sage members and myself. âThis comes from both extremes â people that feel that weâre making bad decisions and they donât appreciate that Sage is not a decision-making body.â Sage - the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies - provides technical advice to ministers during a crisis but decisions are taken by ministers. Covid-19 vaccines in England are estimated to have directly averted more than 143,600 hospital admissions in those over 65, according to new figures from Public Health England. PHE said it was likely to be an underestimate due to the way the figure is calculated. Approximately 36,100 admissions were prevented in those aged 65
to 74, 58,800 in those aged 75 to 84, and 48,700 in those aged 85 and over. Estimates for the number of deaths in England directly averted by the vaccine rollout are unchanged at between 102,500 and 109,500. The first jab outside of a trial was administered in England in December 2020. Since then, more than 48 million first doses have been recorded across the UK. It is ""too early to predict"" whether supermarkets will have supply issues at Christmastime, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) says. Andrew Opie, the BRC's head of food and sustainability, says it is ""not anticipating major problems for Christmas at the moment"", but adds the festive period would be ""incredibly challenging in some areas"". ""If we do see problems then that is going to have an impact on products on the shelf,"" he tells the UK Trade and Business Commission, a group of MPs and business representatives. Alex Veitch from Logistics UK says there has been a shortage of lorry drivers for several years, but this is now an ""acute shortage"". There is a shortage of more than 100,000 drivers in the UK, according to the Road Haulage Association. ""It's really to do with Covid to a very large extent, and Brexit to a lesser extent, added to the long-term chronic problem of not enough people joining the sector,"" Veitch says . The BRC and others want the government to grant a 12-month Covid-19 recovery visa to allow workers from Europe to make up for skills shortages - not only as HGV drivers, but also in roles in food manufacturing and processing. This video can not be played BBC reporter Lucy Adams investigated long Covid after she and her daughter developed the illness As we've been reporting today, a new study suggestsbeing fully vaccinated can cut your chance of getting long Covideven if you get a rare breakthrough infection. But what is long Covid? Guidance for health workers defines long Covid as symptoms lasting for more than 12 weeks which can't be explained by another cause. They can follow a severe or a mild infection. The NHS says symptoms can include:  One large study found 200 symptoms affecting 10 organ systems in people with long Covid. They included hallucinations, insomnia, hearing and vision changes, short-term memory loss and speech and language issues. Others have reported gastro-intestinal and bladder problems, changes to periods and skin conditions. The severity of symptoms varies, but many have been left unable to perform tasks like showering, grocery shopping and remembering words. There is currently no test. Instead, doctors diagnose it in people who have had a Covid infection by ruling out other causes. Read more about long Covid Ministers should do more to prepare the public for the fact there will be waves of higher levels of infection this winter, according to the new director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Prof Liam Smeeth says he does not think there will be a return to severe lockdown restrictions as weâve seen before and that for most doubled-jabbed adults Covid will now be a ""fairly benign disease"". But he adds that the government cannot take its foot off all controls because of the numbers of people still unvaccinated who are vulnerable to severe disease. Rather than see strict lockdowns, he says there might be periods when the public need to be encouraged not to mix so much, to wear masks in indoor spaces and not to go to hospital unless really necessary. Mum Clare is relieved schools are opening with fewer restrictions Parents have been sharing their contrasting emotionsas schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland welcome back pupils for the new academic year. Clare Smyth, from Cambridgeshire, has two young sons in primary school - Seb, 10, and Joshua, who is seven. She is ""overjoyed"" that the start of term will see restrictions eased in schools. ""I'm really relieved that our school has decided to stop all social distancing restrictions - bubbles, zones in the playground. But I'm apprehensive for the winter as the season progresses, as to whether the restrictions will return,"" she says. Lisa will not be sending her children back to school Lisa Diaz's children Alex, 11, and eight-year-old Helena have not been into their Wigan primary school for more than a year after she pulled them out 10 days before the first lockdown. She says she is so angry and worried about the lack of safety measures in place this term that they won't be returning, even though she has been threatened with fines or even prison. Lisa has a genetic blood disorder which makes her particularly concerned that when schools reopen ""there will be nothing between our children and Covid-19"". Lisa says she was ""devastated"" by the choice and would like to see many more safety measures in schools, such as masks and social distancing. ""I'm not saying it's an easy decision. I fully empathise with parents up and down the country,"" she says. Read more parents' stories here. The shadow education secretary criticised the decision to end mask requirements in schools More on the return to school, as Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green accuses the government of ""sitting on its hands"" instead of preparing for the reopening. She tells the BBC News Channel that Labour had been ""pleading for months"" for a range of measures to be implemented in schools, including robust ventilation systems rather than simply monitoring levels of CO2 as the government has proposed. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson should put his ""foot on the accelerator"" to improve ventilation, she said. Asked if Labour wanted to see masks in schools, Green says she's ""at a loss"" to explain why they were made voluntary while infection rates are rising. She says many head teachers will make sensible decisions for their own schools, however. Asked if she wants the vaccine expert group the JCVI to recommend offering jabs to everyone aged 12 to 15, Green says there are ""finely balanced considerations"" but she wants to see a decision made quickly. The majority of adults (83%) arriving in England between 12 July and 17 August from an amber list country fully adhered to coronavirus quarantine requirements, according to a survey by the Office for National Statistics. During this period, people arrivals from an amber tier location were required to quarantine for 10 days unless they were exempt due to their job, or they took part in the test-to-release scheme. Some 91% of respondents said they took both of the required day-two and day-eight coronavirus tests. A change in the rules now means those who are fully vaccinated can avoid quarantine when arriving from an amber list nation, but still must take a pre-arrival and day-two Covid test. Read more about the ruleshere. Plans for nightclubs and other venues in Scotland to require proof of vaccination upon entry outweigh concerns and are preferable to another Covid lockdown, says the nation's health secretary. Humza Yousaf said: ""The benefits of a certification scheme, in terms of a public health intervention, in terms of incentivising vaccination, those benefits outweigh the concerns that still remain."" Mr Yousaf had previously voiced his scepticism about passports, including fears they could widen inequality. The passports are due to be brought in at the end of the month andwill apply to indoor and outdoor events- but the proposal will need to be approved by MSPs next week. Ministers in England want ""high-risk"" settings such as nightclubs to begin requiring valid Covid passes - which prove vaccination - by the end of September. Read morehere.

carbon dioxide than is present in the atmosphere, so the monitors help to
detect how much of the surrounding air has been breathed out, and how much is
fresh air from outside. Catherine Noakes, professor of environmental engineering
for buildings at the University of Leeds, and a specialist in airborne
infections, says ventilation could reduce airborne risk of

better or poorly ventilated. In some classrooms they will be able to open

Thanks for joining us. Thursday's coronavirus live coverage was written by Joseph Lee, Hazel Shearing and George Bowden, and edited by Alex Therrien and Rob Corp. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for today. But before we do, here's a look at the main coronavirus developments this Thursday: More news from Scotland, where thousands of long Covid patients are feared to have not been referred to a support service. Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland launched the service in February - but now says it cannot get in touch with patients because of ""NHS bureaucracy"". The Scottish government said it was working with the NHS, but ""no one approach"" would fit all circumstances. The latest figures from the ONS estimate 74,000 people in Scotland are living with ""self-reported"" long Covid. About 60,000 had experienced long Covid symptoms for more than 12 weeks and 28,000 for a year. Read morehere. Case rates are falling in all parts of England apart from the North East, according to Public Health England's latest weekly surveillance report. The highest rate is in the South West. There were 362.9 cases per 100,000 people in the week ending 29 August - down week-on-week from 491.1. London has the lowest rate, down from 256.3 to 226.8. In the North East, the rate has risen slightly from 306.5 to 314.9. In terms of age, the highest rate is among 10 to 19-year-olds (46.8) and the lowest is among those aged over 80 (110.3). Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at PHE, says: ""Cases remain high although fairly stable across the country. In the coming days and weeks, testing to return to school will detect cases of Covid-19 infection acquired during the summer holidays."" More than 32,000 pupils in Scotland were absent due to Covid this week, school attendance figures show. The figure includes those who had the virus, and those who are self-isolating as a close contact. School pupils in Scotland returned to classrooms two weeks ago - ahead of other UK nations. Pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland began their return to school on Thursday. Read morehere. A further 38,154 coronavirus cases have been reported across the UK, alongside another 178 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.  Vaccination for 16 and 17-year-olds began less than a month ago Vaccine uptake among 16 and 17-year-olds has been ""strong"", England's top GP said, as figures showed almost two-thirds of this age group in Wales (63%) and half in England have had one jab. In Scotland, the figure is 51% and in Northern Ireland it is 40%. Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and deputy lead for NHS Englandâs vaccination programme, said it was important for eligible young people to be get vaccinated as schools, colleges and universities begin term. Some nightclubs, places of worship and university campuses would be offering the jab this weekend in an effort to make it as convenient as possible, she said. They include London's G-A-Y club, the Hindu Temple in Crawley and the University of Kentâs Canterbury Campus. NHS England said 620,000 people aged 16 and 17 had now received the first dose of the vaccine. The UK vaccine advisory group the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has yet to say when people in this age group will be offered a second dose. Prof Calum Semple said he was targeted by anti-vaccination groups but abuse has come from all sides Scientists on the government's advisory committee Sage have been sent suspicious packages by members of the public who feel they are ""making bad decisions"", one of them has revealed. Prof Calum Semple from the University of Liverpool, who has frequently appeared in the media to offer expert views on the Covid-19 pandemic, was asked at a Royal Society of Medicine webinar about the abuse science advisers had received. Society president Prof Roger Kirby asked him about being ""targeted by the anti-vax group"" and suggested someone had posted messages saying ""Calum kills wildlife for fun"" and mentioned where the scientist lives. Prof Semple confirmed that and added: ""We are fortunate that the police are open to hearing from us and thereâs good liaison support for us when these threats are made. That was one particularly nasty event. âThere have been others since then and suspicious packages sent to Sage members and myself. âThis comes from both extremes â people that feel that weâre making bad decisions and they donât appreciate that Sage is not a decision-making body.â Sage - the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies - provides technical advice to ministers during a crisis but decisions are taken by ministers. Covid-19 vaccines in England are estimated to have directly averted more than 143,600 hospital admissions in those over 65, according to new figures from Public Health England. PHE said it was likely to be an underestimate due to the way the figure is calculated. Approximately 36,100 admissions were prevented in those aged 65
to 74, 58,800 in those aged 75 to 84, and 48,700 in those aged 85 and over. Estimates for the number of deaths in England directly averted by the vaccine rollout are unchanged at between 102,500 and 109,500. The first jab outside of a trial was administered in England in December 2020. Since then, more than 48 million first doses have been recorded across the UK. It is ""too early to predict"" whether supermarkets will have supply issues at Christmastime, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) says. Andrew Opie, the BRC's head of food and sustainability, says it is ""not anticipating major problems for Christmas at the moment"", but adds the festive period would be ""incredibly challenging in some areas"". ""If we do see problems then that is going to have an impact on products on the shelf,"" he tells the UK Trade and Business Commission, a group of MPs and business representatives. Alex Veitch from Logistics UK says there has been a shortage of lorry drivers for several years, but this is now an ""acute shortage"". There is a shortage of more than 100,000 drivers in the UK, according to the Road Haulage Association. ""It's really to do with Covid to a very large extent, and Brexit to a lesser extent, added to the long-term chronic problem of not enough people joining the sector,"" Veitch says . The BRC and others want the government to grant a 12-month Covid-19 recovery visa to allow workers from Europe to make up for skills shortages - not only as HGV drivers, but also in roles in food manufacturing and processing. This video can not be played BBC reporter Lucy Adams investigated long Covid after she and her daughter developed the illness As we've been reporting today, a new study suggestsbeing fully vaccinated can cut your chance of getting long Covideven if you get a rare breakthrough infection. But what is long Covid? Guidance for health workers defines long Covid as symptoms lasting for more than 12 weeks which can't be explained by another cause. They can follow a severe or a mild infection. The NHS says symptoms can include:  One large study found 200 symptoms affecting 10 organ systems in people with long Covid. They included hallucinations, insomnia, hearing and vision changes, short-term memory loss and speech and language issues. Others have reported gastro-intestinal and bladder problems, changes to periods and skin conditions. The severity of symptoms varies, but many have been left unable to perform tasks like showering, grocery shopping and remembering words. There is currently no test. Instead, doctors diagnose it in people who have had a Covid infection by ruling out other causes. Read more about long Covid Ministers should do more to prepare the public for the fact there will be waves of higher levels of infection this winter, according to the new director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Prof Liam Smeeth says he does not think there will be a return to severe lockdown restrictions as weâve seen before and that for most doubled-jabbed adults Covid will now be a ""fairly benign disease"". But he adds that the government cannot take its foot off all controls because of the numbers of people still unvaccinated who are vulnerable to severe disease. Rather than see strict lockdowns, he says there might be periods when the public need to be encouraged not to mix so much, to wear masks in indoor spaces and not to go to hospital unless really necessary. Mum Clare is relieved schools are opening with fewer restrictions Parents have been sharing their contrasting emotionsas schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland welcome back pupils for the new academic year. Clare Smyth, from Cambridgeshire, has two young sons in primary school - Seb, 10, and Joshua, who is seven. She is ""overjoyed"" that the start of term will see restrictions eased in schools. ""I'm really relieved that our school has decided to stop all social distancing restrictions - bubbles, zones in the playground. But I'm apprehensive for the winter as the season progresses, as to whether the restrictions will return,"" she says. Lisa will not be sending her children back to school Lisa Diaz's children Alex, 11, and eight-year-old Helena have not been into their Wigan primary school for more than a year after she pulled them out 10 days before the first lockdown. She says she is so angry and worried about the lack of safety measures in place this term that they won't be returning, even though she has been threatened with fines or even prison. Lisa has a genetic blood disorder which makes her particularly concerned that when schools reopen ""there will be nothing between our children and Covid-19"". Lisa says she was ""devastated"" by the choice and would like to see many more safety measures in schools, such as masks and social distancing. ""I'm not saying it's an easy decision. I fully empathise with parents up and down the country,"" she says. Read more parents' stories here. The shadow education secretary criticised the decision to end mask requirements in schools More on the return to school, as Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green accuses the government of ""sitting on its hands"" instead of preparing for the reopening. She tells the BBC News Channel that Labour had been ""pleading for months"" for a range of measures to be implemented in schools, including robust ventilation systems rather than simply monitoring levels of CO2 as the government has proposed. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson should put his ""foot on the accelerator"" to improve ventilation, she said. Asked if Labour wanted to see masks in schools, Green says she's ""at a loss"" to explain why they were made voluntary while infection rates are rising. She says many head teachers will make sensible decisions for their own schools, however. Asked if she wants the vaccine expert group the JCVI to recommend offering jabs to everyone aged 12 to 15, Green says there are ""finely balanced considerations"" but she wants to see a decision made quickly. The majority of adults (83%) arriving in England between 12 July and 17 August from an amber list country fully adhered to coronavirus quarantine requirements, according to a survey by the Office for National Statistics. During this period, people arrivals from an amber tier location were required to quarantine for 10 days unless they were exempt due to their job, or they took part in the test-to-release scheme. Some 91% of respondents said they took both of the required day-two and day-eight coronavirus tests. A change in the rules now means those who are fully vaccinated can avoid quarantine when arriving from an amber list nation, but still must take a pre-arrival and day-two Covid test. Read more about the ruleshere. Plans for nightclubs and other venues in Scotland to require proof of vaccination upon entry outweigh concerns and are preferable to another Covid lockdown, says the nation's health secretary. Humza Yousaf said: ""The benefits of a certification scheme, in terms of a public health intervention, in terms of incentivising vaccination, those benefits outweigh the concerns that still remain."" Mr Yousaf had previously voiced his scepticism about passports, including fears they could widen inequality. The passports are due to be brought in at the end of the month andwill apply to indoor and outdoor events- but the proposal will need to be approved by MSPs next week. Ministers in England want ""high-risk"" settings such as nightclubs to begin requiring valid Covid passes - which prove vaccination - by the end of September. Read morehere. Tom Cruise's films Top Gun: Maverick and Mission: Impossible 7 have been delayed due to a surge in US Covid-19 cases caused by the Delta variant.

The studio has also delayed the release of comedy Jackass Forever. Read morehere. Some teenagers got their jab on site at music festivals As we have been reporting, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said earlier today (see post at 09:05) that he wants to see a decision on offering the jab to all 12 to 15-year-olds made very soon. Currently, all 16 and 17 year-olds are being offered a first dose. No second dose is planned as yet. Vaccinations are also recommended for those aged 12 to 15 if they are at higher risk due to:  Children of the same age who live with people who have a suppressed immune system can also be vaccinated, to protect family members. NHS organisations in England have been told to make preparations to jab all 12 to 15-year-olds, but they are waiting on a recommendation from experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.

The UK government has pledged about 300,000 CO2 monitors to schools in England this term to help detect poor ventilation. Covid is a respiratory virus, so it is expelled into the air
when people breathe and talk. This allows very small particles carrying the virus to
spread around a room, where they can last a couple of hours. Ventilation cuts the risk of catching the virus by reducing
the level of particles in the air that someone is exposed to. While CO2 monitors do not affect transmission risk in
schools, they can help to indicate how well ventilated a classroom is. We breathe out a higher concentration of

In a letter to the government, school leaders say at least Â£5.8bn is needed to avert ""serious long-term damage"". And the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) says by next year, spending per pupil will still be about 1-2% lower in real terms than in 2009-10. The government says it has invested billions of pounds to support pupils. The letter, sent by the heads of leading academy chains and head teachers, says children are months behind academically and facing mental-health crises. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was looking at what more could be done to boost the attainment of children. ""I'm working with the chancellor and the prime minister, because we all have an absolute priority in terms of delivering for our children,"" he said. ""We've seen Â£3bn extra come into schools."" How are schools being kept Covid-safe this term? Media campaign to persuade pupils back to school Unions call for secondary pupils to be vaccinated Scotland schools return fuels Covid as daily cases hit 5,021 Classrooms to get Â£6m anti-Covid air technology Thousands of pupils return to NI schools The IFS funding report analyses the impact of the extra Â£7bn invested in education in England over three years from 2019 on budgets which were already 9% down on 2009 levels. The independent analysis says this government investment over three years from 2019 has filled, and will continue to fill, much of the budget black hole, but not all of it. This leaves per pupil funding down on 2009. It also finds that because of recent changes to school funding calculations nationally, secondary schools in more deprived areas lost more like 14% compared to the national average of 9%. A Department for Education spokesman said the government is providing the biggest uplift to school funding in a decade - Â£14 billion in total over the three years to 2022-23. But the National Association of Head Teachers general secretary Paul Whiteman said there was no escaping the fact that the schools have had, and will continue to have, to make cuts to provision until this is properly addressed. At the start of the new term, schools in England will be able to access funds to use a national tutoring scheme or use their own teachers to offer pupils support. The government hopes its tutoring programme will support up to six million pupils over the next three years. Mr Williamson said he expected a greater sense of normality in schools this term thanks to vaccination programme. ""That extra protection helps us find that sensible balance between protecting staff and students and ensuring education is not disrupted,"" he said. ""Keeping children in the classroom helps them catch up."" But Labour is highlighting how UK schools under tighter restrictions have seen more disruption linked to Covid than all but one of their European counterparts. It quotes House of Commons Library research showing a 44% disruption rate in the UK between January 2020 and July 2021. Only Italy had a higher rate at 48%, the figures based on data from the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker said. Despite plans for regular Covid testing of staff and pupils this term, there are concerns among head teachers, school staff and scientists about high rates of virus in a largely unvaccinated population. Scientists have warned that the increased mixing related to reopening schools, combined with reduced health and safety rules, could lead to a rapid raise in cases throughout September. It is unclear how this might play out in terms of further disruption to education, with anyone testing positive still required to self-isolate for 10 days. Regular hand washing will be required The government insists its decision to lift restrictions maintains the balance between precautions, and allowing schools and young people to get back to normal. This includes the ending of social distancing, bubble groups and face mask requirements, although twice-weekly Covid testing remains. The requirement for close contacts of Covid cases to self-isolate, which saw millions of school days lost by pupils, has also been lifted. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"BBC comedy Gavin and Stacey is one of the most famous TV shows to be filmed in Wales Unprecedented demand for film and TV production in Wales has led to a skills shortage in the industry. Hollywood A-listersForest Whitaker,externalandTom Hardy,externalhave been among the acting stars in Wales this summer as they have been filming Netflix crime drama Havoc. BBC fantasy drama His Dark Materials and Disney sci-fi drama War of the Worlds are also being filmed in Wales. But Welsh government agency Creative Wales has said there are not enough people to work in behind-camera roles. In the past 12 months, 37 television dramas and feature films have received public funding from Creative Wales which has helped a ""growing sector"". Deputy director Gerwyn Evans said, while the TV and film production industry in Wales was experiencing ""probably one of the busiest times it has ever had"", it needed more off-screen staff to help with productions. Star studded cast for 'fairytale' horse movie Film production leaves Wales over lack of support Hollywood's Jurassic Park premiere in Carmarthen set for movie ""We know there are potential shortages in hair and make-up, shortages in production accountants, shortages in people working on the productions as well and shortages in supply chain,"" he said. ""It's about getting the message out to youngsters and people in Wales that this is a growing sector and there are a lot of opportunities. ""It doesn't just have to be on camera, it could be hair and make-up, electricians, set design."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

From Richard Burton and Sir Anthony Hopkins to Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Sheen, Wales has a history of producing superstar on-screen talent. Now it has become used to seeing production crews on the streets and countryside, shooting TV dramas such as Doctor Who,The CrownandSex Education. Mark Wahlberg's film Infinite was shot in Wales, which meantclosing part of Cardiff city centrefor a stunt, while Wonder Woman was also filmed in Wales a few years ago. Allow Facebook content?

Now, Creative Wales is concerned there is not enough off-screen talent to support the big productions when they get here. The organisation has spent Â£8m supporting screen projects in 2021, including 55 apprenticeships as it is trying to encourage more younger people into the business. ""The production sector in Wales is extremely busy at the moment - probably one of the busiest times it has ever had, which is fantastic coming out of Covid,"" added Mr Evans. Since its revival in 2005, the production of Doctor Who has been based in Wales ""But it does cause us concerns around skills and the demand for skills and the number of youngsters coming through."" The industry has expanded due to the rise in productions wanting to film in Wales but Creative Wales wants the film sector to operate all year-round. Arwen Teagle is working as an apprentice on Disney blockbuster War of the Worlds. The 19-year-old, from Gilfach, in Caerphilly county, is a trainee camera operator at Urban Myth studios in Newport and has worked as an extra. Camera trainee Arwen Teagle is working on War of the Worlds series three in Newport ""It's really fun and everyone I work with on set is really nice,"" said Arwen, whose Creative Wales-funded apprenticeship involves setting up monitors, charging batteries and supporting other camera operators. ""It's just amazing. If I'd told myself I'd be working with Urban Myth on War of the Worlds, I wouldn't have believed myself. ""I watched the first season when it came out and it was amazing - and now I'm working on season three and it's quite a shock."" Chey Lewis is a production assistant on Havoc - the film starring Hardy and Oscar-winner Whitaker - written by Welsh director Gareth Evans, which will be streamed on Netflix from 2022. Chey Lewis is working on the upcoming Netflix production Havoc and said her job was ""intense"" ""A usual day could involve anything the production needs, whether that's ordering equipment for different departments, doing some shopping or booking accommodation for cast and crew members,"" said the 21-year-old from Pontyclun in Rhondda Cynon Taf. ""It's definitely intense, and with 12-hour days sometimes, it's still not enough to get everything done. I've learnt a lot of accounting skills, purchase order and admin skills."" Chey is considering becoming a production coordinator and is being helped by producer Ed Talfan. The Welsh visual wizard in Hollywood Freedom of the city for Swansea's Hollywood star Luke Evans eyes film back on home turf ""We've got trainees across the whole project, whether it's in the art department, hair and make-up, costume or the office,"" he said, ""People tend to follow their nose. They have an idea about what they want to do in their career. ""We try to make sure they're in the right department for them and then they learn from those teams. Then the next time there's a new project, they're a fully-trained professional."" Despite Wales' popularity as a big production destination there has been criticism of a lack of support for smaller, home-grown productions. Filmmaker Matt Hookings claimed in July hehad to shift production of ""Prizefighter: The Life of Jem Belcher"" to Lithuania, blaming a lack of financial backing in Wales. Wales popularity with filmmakers means more people are needed to work behind the scenes Creative Wales said it was ""unfortunately"" not able to accommodate that production because of time factors. ""We have invested significantly in productions and it's not just big productions,"" Mr Evans said. ""We have supported a number of our indigenous, smaller production companies as well. It's about a balanced portfolio.""

"This video can not be played Watch: Top US general admits 'anger and pain' over Afghanistan The top US general has described the Taliban as a ""ruthless group"" and says it is unclear whether they will change. Gen Mark Milley said, however, it was ""possible"" that the US would co-ordinate with the Islamist militants on future counter-terrorism operations. US forces withdrew from Afghanistan on Tuesday, ending America's longest war 20 years after launching an invasion to oust the Taliban. The Islamists are now in control and expected to announce a new government. Gen Milley was speaking alongside US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, in their first public remarks since the last troops left Afghanistan. US President Joe Biden has been widely criticised over the abrupt manner of the withdrawal, which led to the unexpected collapse of the Afghan security forces the US had trained and funded for years. The Taliban's lightning advance sparked off a frenetic effort to evacuate thousands of foreign nationals and local Afghans who had been working for them. In the news conference on Wednesday, both Gen Milley and Secretary Austin praised the troops who had served in Afghanistan and the massive evacuation mission. Asked about their co-ordination with the Taliban in getting evacuees to the airport, Mr Austin said: ""We were working with the Taliban on a very narrow set of issues, and that was just that - to get as many people out as we possibly could."" ""In war you do what you must in order to reduce risk to mission and force, not what you necessarily want to do,"" Gen Milley added. He said it was possible that the US would co-ordinate with the Taliban on future action againstIslamic State affiliate IS-K, the group which claimed an attack outside Kabul airport last week that killed as many as 170 people, including 13 US service personnel. IS-K is the most extreme and violent of all the jihadist militant groups in Afghanistan. It has major differences with the Taliban, accusing them of abandoning jihad and the battlefield. Mr Austin, meanwhile, said he would ""not want to make any predictions"" on future co-operation. But he added that officials would ""do everything that we can to make sure we remain focused on [IS-K], understand that network, and at the time of our choosing in the future, hold them accountable for what they've done"". In total, the evacuation operation saw more than 123,000 people wishing to flee the Taliban airlifted out of the country. The US estimates that there are between 100 and 200 Americans still in Afghanistan. FACT-CHECK:Biden on Afghanistan withdrawal fact-checked FEATURE:Passport delay blamed for baby stranded in Kabul ANALYSIS:How can the West stop Afghan terror bases? US Under-Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said ""all possible options"" were being looked at to get remaining US citizens and people who had worked with the US out of the country. Meanwhile, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab saidhe was not certain how many UK nationals remained in the country,but that it was believed to be in the ""low hundreds"". The Taliban have celebrated the final withdrawal of foreign forces, and are now focusing on forming a government. The deputy head of the Taliban's political office in Qatar, Sher Abbas Stanekza, told BBC Pashto that a new government could be announced in the next two days. This video can not be played The Taliban are asked if there will be a place for women in its new government He said there would be a role for women at lower levels but not in top positions. He also said that those who served in government in the past two decades would not be included. This magical word ""inclusive"" is being used by Afghanistan's neighbours to try to put pressure on the Taliban to share some of the power so they don't have absolute control. But look at it in pure political terms. The Taliban have come to power much more quickly than even they expected. And they feel they have an overwhelming mandate to pursue their overriding objective to establish an Islamic system. In this new emerging Islamic emirate, women will be playing secondary roles to men. This is already very different from what we heard even two years ago, when the Taliban started discussing with representatives of the Afghan government and civil society. They said then that women could have any roles in our new Islamic government except the president or prime minister. They could be ministers or CEOs. Now they seem to be rolling back from that because what happened in the past is now history. It's a new day for them and it's a day when the Taliban are in charge.

"People who do not turn up to reservations they have made at pubs and restaurants are costing the hospitality sector Â£17.6bn a year, a report says. Data from hospitality technology firm Zonal said one in seven customers have not turned up for a reservation without telling the venue since April. It said 18-34-year-olds were the ""worst offenders"" for no-shows, with more than a quarter not honouring bookings. Industry group UK Hospitality said no-shows were ""deeply damaging to venues"". Jacob Georgallis, general manager at Toast Bar in Leeds, said punters not turning up and not cancelling bookings had ""massively"" affected the business during times when some coronavirus restrictions remained. ""We'd be fully booked but then no-shows would happen and you've turned away three or four groups who could have taken the space,"" he said. ""It was a really gutting feeling for us, and a nightmare for staffing and forecasting."" Restaurant no-shows 'putting jobs at risk' 'We had 100 people not turn up to their tables' During Euro 2020, the bar took pre-orders on food and drinks and did not experience any no-shows, apart from customers unable to attend due to Covid-related reasons. Mr Georgallis said he hoped there was a ""big push"" towards solving the problem and ""finding ways to take money up front"". The research, conducted by Zonal and consultancy firm CGA, surveyed 5,000 people nationwide. A large percentage of respondents said they would fail to turn up for bookings if someone in their party had to cancel the appointment Although younger people were found to be the most likely out of the sample to fail to turn up to bookings, compared to just 1% of those aged 55 and over, younger adults were more frequent bookers and ate out more often. In its report, researchers said Londoners were found to be the worst no-show offenders in the UK, with 24% of consumers in the capital admitting to not notifying a venue that they weren't planning to turn up. The figure was higher than the national average of 14%. The report said customers in Scotland, the South West and the South East were most likely to honour their reservations, with just 10% failing to show up. UK Hospitality said the Â£17.6bn loss from no-shows equated to 13.3% of the sector's Â£132bn in pre-pandemic revenue. I had a change of plans (19%) Someone else in the group cancelled (19%) Someone fell ill with Covid-related symptoms (18%) The venue was unable to reassure me (17%) I forgot about my booking (16%) I decided it was too expensive (15%) The weather put me off (14%) The venue didn't contact me to remind me (13%) I booked a few venues for the same time (13%) I arrived at the venue and didn't feel comfortable (12%) Source: Zonal and CGA's Technology survey Vicky Liner, marketing director at West Midlands-based Suburban Inns, said no-shows had ""calmed down a little bit"" after the venue started asking patrons to hand over card details and put down deposits when making a booking. ""Taking deposits wasn't something we really wanted to do, but we've had to - and they're no bad thing if they help to change the culture,"" she said. ""We still want spontaneity in hospitality and give people the option to just walk in."" In response to the survey findings, Zonal and UK Hospitality have launched a campaign aimed at encouraging people to honour the bookings they make, or at least inform venues if they have to cancel a booking. UK Hospitality's chief executive Kate Nicholls said no-shows had been a blight on the industry for ""many, many years"". Added to the difficulties businesses were experiencing due to the pandemic, they were ""currently deeply damaging."" ""Our pubs, bars and restaurants deserve our support and it's encouraging that this research shows there is a growing realisation among customers of the need to honour their booking or let the venue know they can't make it,"" she said. ""But it also highlights the fact that no shows still happen far too often, with younger customers particularly responsible, and that really can't go on.""

"The Wetherspoons chain has said some of its pubs have run out of some beer brands because of supply chain issues. The group said Heineken, Carling and Coors were among the brands affected. Heineken and brewer Molson Coors said that like many in the industry, they had been hit by a shortage of HGV drivers. Meanwhile, a Coca-Cola bottling giant also said Diet Coke was unavailable in some supermarkets owing to the driver shortage. The UK is facing a shortage of lorry drivers that hauliers have blamed on Covid and Brexit, and have called for immigration rules to be changed to allow EU drivers to return. But the government has consistently said that the haulage industry and retailers need to be training new UK drivers. The logistical problems have led to empty shelves at some supermarkets, while the retail industry has flagged concerns about Christmas supplies. Fast-food chains have also been hit, with Nando's running short of chicken and McDonald's having to stop serving milkshakes. McDonald's runs out of milkshakes in England, Scotland and Wales There are also shortages of Diet Coke in some supermarkets due to the lack of HGV drivers, as well as problems sourcing aluminium cans, bottling giant Coca Cola Europacific Partners said. It said its supply chain was working ""flat out"" to meet demand. Wetherspoons also said on Wednesday that some of its pubs had seen some supply shortages. The pub chain said there had been problems with Heineken and Molson Coors deliveries. ""We are experiencing some supply problems with both Carling and Coors, which means that some pubs do not have the products available,"" a Wetherspoons spokesman said. ""We apologise to our customers for any inconvenience caused. We know that the brewers are trying to resolve the issue."" Molson Coors, which owns Carling and Coors, said: ""Like many in our great British brewing and pub sector, we have been hit by the HGV driver shortage. ""While overall our availability is good, there are intermittent pockets of pressure in our supply network that are unfortunately affecting a number of Wetherspoons pubs. ""After such a difficult period for our industry, it's heart breaking to be letting any customer down and we will continue to do everything in our power to get our much-loved brands back on every Wetherspoons bar,"" it said. How serious is the shortage of lorry drivers? Wetherspoons boss denies facing shortage of EU workers Wetherspoons said its problems had been caused by planned industrial action by Heineken drivers working for GXO Logistics. The Unite union said no industrial action had taken place. Heineken said: ""We're working tirelessly to find solutions to delivery issues caused by considerable disruption in the haulage and logistics market. ""Pubs won't run dry - if your favourite pint isn't immediately available, there will be a tasty alternative to try."" The logistics industry has said that driver shortages across the UK are due to a combination of Covid and Brexit. On Wednesday Wetherspoons boss Tim Martin, a prominent supporter of Brexit, was taken to task by some critics on Twitter. Singer Billy Bragg wrote,external: ""Here's a lament for Tim Martin, whose Wetherspoons chain is struggling with the realities of the Brexit for which he campaigned so loudly."" Twitter userPearl Noir wrote,external: ""So how's Brexit working out for you so far Tim?"" The UK is short of about 100,000 drivers, according to the Road Haulage Association, with new recruits to the industry facing problems getting driving tests due a Covid-related backlog. In addition, when the pandemic struck last year, many European drivers went home, with few returning, according to hauliers. HGV driver says 40% pay rise shows industry's desperate situation Now the UK has left the EU, it is no longer part of the single market, so it is easier for European drivers to find work in the EU. Foreign drivers also now need visas and the Home Office is not keen on allowing lorry drivers on to a list of shortage occupations. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng this week rejected calls to loosen immigration rules, saying it would be a ""short-term temporary solution"" and that firms should employ UK workers, especially those facing an ""uncertain future"" when the furlough scheme ends next month. A government spokesperson said: ""We're working closely with industry to address sector challenges, which are similarly being faced by other countries around the world. ""This includes plans to streamline the process for new drivers to gain their HGV licence and to increase the number of driving tests able to be conducted. ""We want to see employers make long-term investments in the UK domestic workforce and make employment more attractive through offering training, careers options and wage increases."" The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said that retailers were doing all they could to avoid any possible disruption to supplies before Christmas. ""Government must address the HGV driver shortage by rapidly increasing the number of HGV driving tests taking place, providing visas for EU drivers, and looking for a longer-term solution,"" said Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the BRC.
