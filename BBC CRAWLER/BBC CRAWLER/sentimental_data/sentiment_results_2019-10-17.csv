"Canadians go to the polls on 21 October, four years after Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party swept to power. But things aren't as clear-cut this time around, with several other parties rising in the polls. Here's a visual look at some key issues and themes which could shape the outcome on election night. The focus of campaigning tends to be on the party leaders and who will be prime minister. But in reality, under Canada's system of government, it's 338 separate races, with candidates in each of the country's federal ridings (constituencies) from coast to coast to coast. They are all fighting for their chance to sit in Canada's House of Commons - which loosely resembles its British namesake. There are two scenarios - a majority and a minority government (or hung parliament). If one party wins 170 seats or more, Canada will have a majority government. In 2015, Justin Trudeau and his Liberal candidates won 184 seats - a solid majority. Minority governments are formed when no party wins more than half the seats. A minority government is typically, but not necessarily, formed by the party that has the most seats - but it needs the support of other parties to pass legislation. Election 43 will also see the largest number of female candidates running ever, with 651 female candidates across all parties. That represents a 9% increase from 2015, according to Equal Voice Canada. Equal Voice says it's a ""great stride"", although there remains work to do. ""If every single woman elected in the history of Canada were to sit together in the House today, they would not fill the Chamber's 338 seats,"" the group said in a statement. ""Following this election, we expect that will finally change."" Health care is a perennial concern for Canadian voters. But amid a push for governments around the world do to more the tackle the issue, climate change has been dominating as one of the issues that matters most to voters. Mr Trudeau made meeting the Paris Accord targets a cornerstone of his campaign in 2015, and his record will be judged at the ballot box. The decision by his Liberal government to buy the Trans Mountain Pipeline, which would carry crude oil from Alberta to British Columbia, in order to ensure a project to triple its capacity goes ahead, has also faced criticism. Despite low unemployment and modest economic growth, Canadians are feeling anxious about their economic future. The cost of living has been identified as a priority in this campaign and all the federal parties are rolling out policies aimed at making life more affordable for Canadian families, from tax relief to making it easier for first-time homebuyers to get into the housing market - especially in booming cities like Toronto and Vancouver. The results of Monday's election will be largely decided in three key, vote-rich regions: Quebec, the Greater Toronto Area, and in Lower Mainland British Columbia. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Here we look at one - the province of Quebec - where the vote has been volatile in recent years. This election is no different. Going into the campaign's final days, the Bloc Quebecois - a federal party focused on Quebec sovereignty - is in a strong second place and nipping at the Liberals' heels. Quebec voters are taking another look at a party - which only runs candidates in that province - they had relegated to the sidelines in the past two elections. The Conservatives, who are tied with the Liberals in national polls, are trailing in third. And while the left-leaning NDPs have momentum in other parts of the country, they haven't gained much traction in Quebec and could lose most of the 14 seats they hold there. Canada is a vast nation, with large swathes of wilderness. This can be a challenge for traditional door-to-door campaigning. Canada's largest federal riding in geographical terms, Nunavut, is the size of seven United Kingdoms. In comparison, a candidate could easily walk Canada's smallest riding - Toronto-Centre - in a matter of hours. By Jessica Murphy, Robin Levinson-King, Tom Housden, Sumi Senthinathan and Mark Bryson.

"The UK and EU have agreed what Boris Johnson says is a ""great new deal"" for Brexit European Commission President says the deal is ""a fair and balanced agreement"" UK PM says the agreement ""represents a very good deal for the EU and the UK"" It now needs the approval of the UK and European parliaments Johnson 'very confident' MPs will back deal The support of the DUP is seen as crucial if the PM is to win Parliament's approval However, the DUP says it will not vote for it A pivotal day in Brussels then - here's a recap of what happened. The EU and UK reached a new withdrawal agreement, which has been hailed by European leaders as a significant step. But the deal still has to get past Parliament. The deal ditches former PM Theresa May's backstop, the measure designed to prevent a return to physical checks on the Irish border. Instead it will, in effect, draw a new customs border down the Irish Sea. Boris Johnson is insisting he is confident that MPs will back the deal when MPs sit on Saturday, even though his key allies, Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, plan to vote against it. Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP also say they are opposed. We are going to bring our live coverage to an end here - but ournews storywill continue to be updated with the latest developments. And you canread about the revised dealin this piece from the BBC Reality check team.   Katya AdlerEurope Editor If you have a look at Boris Johnson with the EU leaders there was a lot of back slapping, there was a lot of bonhomie. And it completely belies the fact that, underneath, those EU leaders are very sceptical when the prime minister said to them ""I've got the numbers in Parliament to pass this deal""... Up their sleeve, of course, is the possibility of another Brexit extension. EU leaders today were very coy about that - they are not enthusiastic about the idea and they want to keep the pressure on MPs to really focus their minds. But if this deal, like Theresa May's deal agreed with EU leaders, fails to get through the House of Commons, and if there were a request from the UK for another Brexit extension, then these EU leaders, after three years of Brexit process -  two Brexit deals - are not going to turn around and say no to the UK if this extension would be for a general election, a second referendum or a referendum on this deal. Newsnight Veteran Labour MP Ronnie Campbell, who voted against Theresa May's deal three times and is standing down at the next election, says he is minded to back the PM's deal. Asked whether he will back it at the vote on Saturday, he replies: ""Yes, I think so"". ""I think this country's just fed up the way Parliament's run this for the last three years,"" he says. ""It's time we got round the table, and got a deal, and got it through"". BBC political editor tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Daily Telegraph The i Mark Field, the Tory MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, has announced he will not be standing in the next general election - citing disagreements over Brexit. Mr Field says his beliefs ""stand at odds with the current administration's impatient approach to getting Brexit done"". Mr Field, who was sacked as a minister for grabbing a Greenpeace activist in June, adds he would prefer the UK to remain ""in or very closely aligned to the EU"". Read more here  Metro The pound is trading up on the day - but a surge in the currency triggered by news of the Brexit agreement failed to last, amid concerns that the deal could still be scuppered. Sterling rose to a five-month high against the dollar, coming close to $1.30, soon after the UK and EU's negotiating teams agreed a deal. It then began to lose ground after the DUP said it would not vote for the deal and by early afternoon, sterling had fallen back below $1.28. It later regained momentum to trade at $1.2863, up 0.26% on the day. There was a similar pattern against the euro. At first the pound jumped above â¬1.16, before falling back to â¬1.1576.

"The man is believed to be Kenyan and in his 30s Police are looking for help to identify a man who fell out of a plane from Kenya into a garden in London. Officers were called to an address in Offerton Road, Clapham, in June, where the body of the man, believed to be in his 30s, was found. He is thought to have fallen from the landing gear compartment of the aircraft headed for Heathrow Airport. Scotland Yard has released an e-fit image of the man. The force said it believed the man was Kenyan but was ""keeping an open mind"". This rucksack was found in the landing gear compartment of the aircraft the man fell from Officers also released images of a bag which was found in the landing gear compartment when the plane landed.

"This video can not be played One eyewitness captured the moment a climate protester was dragged from top of Tube train Commuters have dragged climate change protesters from the roof of a London Underground train. Extinction Rebellion activists climbed on to trains at Stratford, Canning Town and Shadwell in Thursday's rush hour. Eight protesters have been arrested, British Transport Police (BTP) said. The Jubilee Line and Docklands Light Railway were temporarily suspended. Extinction Rebellion later said it would ""take stock"" of the reaction to the latest action for future protests. Spokesman Howard Rees said: ""Was it the right thing to do? I am not sure. ""I think we will have to have a period of reflection. It is too early to say."" Extinction Rebellion previously said the disruption was ""necessary to highlight the emergency"". Protesters climbed to the top of a train carriage at Shadwell station Hayden Green, a commuter at Canning Town, said he saw the protester ""dragged to the floor and kicked repeatedly"". ""Police have struggled to deal with the protest in London so the public stepped in and in the heat of the moment it was taken too far,"" he told the BBC. ""I support their cause but I think how the protests have been carried out has led to more divisions."" Hayden Green said violence broke out after a protester tried to ""kick a commuter"" In footage shared on social media, a passenger waiting for a train is seen climbing on the carriage to get to one of the protesters. The activist is grabbed by the knees and dragged down, falling to the platform where he appears to then be kicked and hit by angry commuters on the platform. Others can be heard shouting and swearing at the protesters. One shouts: ""I have to get to work too - I have to feed my kids."" Extinction Rebellion protesters climb on to a Jubilee line train at Canning Town station A second protester was chased along the top of the train carriage by a commuter before being dragged off. A third Extinction Rebellion activist, who was broadcasting the protest on the group's social media accounts, said he was also attacked and ""kicked in the head"". BTP said it was investigating what happened at Canning Town station, adding it was ""concerning to see that a number of commuters took matters into their own hands, displaying violent behaviour to detain a protester"". Ithas appealed for anyone with information,external, pictures or mobile phone footage of any of the incidents to upload them to its website. Assistant Chief Constable Sean O'Callaghan said: ""It is important that commuters and other rail users allow the police, who are specially trained, to manage these incidents.Â Â ""Unfortunately, there is still a risk that Extinction Rebellion will target the rail network during this evening's peak. We will continue to have extra officers on patrol and will work to disrupt any potential criminal action before it happens."" By Justin Rowlatt, BBC chief environment correspondent Today's Extinction Rebellion action against London's public transport network represents a significant escalation of its strategy of ""disruption"". It is one thing to stage a colourful protest in a few roads in Whitehall, quite another to target the Tubes and trains that so many Londoners rely on to get them to work on time. Many commuters were left scratching their heads this morning, bewildered by an environmental protest that targeted one of the most environmentally-friendly ways to travel. The tactic has been the subject of much discussion within Extinction Rebellion - a loose affiliation of interested groups and individuals. A poll among members taken yesterday suggests the vast majority were against any action targeting the London Underground. Out of 3,800 votes, 72% said they were opposed to any action against Tube trains and 14% were against the idea if people could get blocked underground. Perhaps not surprisingly, the decision to go ahead has upset many members - as well as commuters - and for good reason. Tackling climate change will be easier if there is a consensus that action is necessary. The Extinction Rebellion activists behind this action will want to consider whether gluing yourself to a train is really the best way to build that consensus. At Shadwell station several activists glued themselves to trains, including 83-year-old Phil Kingston. In April, Extinction Rebellion protesters also glued themselves to a DLR train at Canary Wharf, causing minor delays. ""If XR wants to make an inclusive movement, these tactics on public transport at rush hour won't get them far,"" Ana Zarraga told the BBC. The 35-year-old, who was prevented from catching her train at Shadwell, said: ""The bankers and the CEOs of the most polluting industries are certainly not travelling on the DLR at 07.00 BST."" Protesters clashed with commuters at Shadwell, Docklands Light Railway station Earlier Extinction Rebellion co-founder Clare Farrell defended the Tube action, saying ""the public, I don't think, realise quite how serious this situation is"". What is Extinction Rebellion and what does it want? She added: ""Someone has been hurt today. We understand that putting ourselves in these positions is potentially dangerous for us. ""But what else can we do?"" The protester who appeared to try to kick a commuter acted ""in self defence in a moment of panic when confronted by a threatening situation,"" Extinction Rebellion said. ""He acknowledges his accountability for this action,"" it said. The group has invited the commuters involved in today's protest ""to have a conversation"" about what happened. At Shadwell station, one of the protesters who had glued themselves to trains was 83-year-old Phil Kingston Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said in a statement: ""I strongly condemn the Extinction Rebellion protesters who have targeted the London Underground and DLR this morning. ""This illegal action is extremely dangerous, counterproductive and is causing unacceptable disruption to Londoners who use public transport to get to work."" Train drivers' union Aslef said the Tube and other public transport services were ""part of the solution to climate change, not the problem"". Extinction Rebellion should ""stick to protesting against those who create the problem - not our industry, members and hard-working commuters"", the union added. A public order ban,externalhas been put in place on Extinction Rebellion activities in London since Monday. At the High Court a judge has refused the request to hear Extinction Rebellion's appeal against the ban early. The group wanted a hearing before the scheduled end of the protest on 19 October.

"A photo of US House Speaker Nancy Pelosiconfronting the President Donald Trumpat areportedlyexplosive White House meeting has become a symbol of the deep divisions in Washington. In the image, leading Democrat Ms Pelosi is standing up at a large table, surrounded by male congressional leaders and top military officials, pointing her finger towards the president, who is seated opposite her and appears stunned. Afterwards, Mr Trump took to his preferred social media platform, Twitter, to share the photo along with the caption: ""Nervous Nancy's unhinged meltdown"". Ms Pelosi - who has said it was Mr Trump that had the ""meltdown"" - hit back by proudly making the image her cover photo on both Twitter and Facebook. The original tweet by Mr Trump has now been shared more than 24,000 times on Twitter, with scores of people weighing in on what it says about the two top US politicians. It has spurred debates on everything from gender inequality in politics, to who would be the better president, but at its core are the disagreements over one of the most divisive political issues of the moment. Viewpoint: Syria could be beginning of end for Trump Disastrous moment for US policy in Mid-East The Wednesday meeting was held to discuss the situation in northern Syria, where Turkey launched an offensive last week against Kurdish-led forces after the US suddenly withdrew its troops. Just before the meeting, the US House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to condemn the troop withdrawal. A Democratic source told the Associated Press news agency that the meeting began with Mr Trump bragging about a ""nasty"" letter he had sent to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Turkish president 'threw Trump letter in bin' Ms Pelosi is then said to have mentioned the House vote and Democratic leader Chuck Schumer began to read the president a quote from former Defence Secretary James Mattis on the need to keep US troops in Syria to prevent a resurgence of the so-called Islamic State group, known as IS or Isis. According to US media, Mr Trump cut Mr Schumer off, complaining that Mr Mattis was ""the world's most overrated general"". As the meeting went on, the president is said to have told Ms Pelosi: ""I hate Isis more than you do."" When asked by Mr Schumer if his plan was to rely on the Syrians and the Turks, the president said the plan was ""to keep the American people safe"". Ms Pelosi reportedly told him that this was a goal, not a plan. Mr Schumer has said the president then called Ms Pelosi a ""third-rate"" politician. (She later said it was ""third-grade"".) At that point, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer reportedly interjected, telling the president that such insults were ""not useful"". The Democratic leaders then left the meeting early. Speaking to reporters following the meeting, Ms Pelosi described it as ""most unsatisfactory"". ""Two-to-one, the Republicans voted to oppose what he was doing in Syria.  He just couldn't handle it so he just kind of engaged in a meltdown,"" she said. Mr Schumer said the president had been ""insulting, particularly to the speaker"". Allow Twitter content?

""She had a total meltdown in the White House today. It was very sad to watch. Pray for her, she is a very sick person,"" he wrote.

"Ian Blackford has tabled an amendment to Saturday's motion. The SNP is to call for a three-month extension to Brexit to allow time to hold a general election. Ian Blackford, the party's Westminster leader, has tabled an amendment to Saturday's motion in the Commons, rejecting the new Brexit deal. He also calls for an extension until at least 31 January 2020, allowing for an early election. Boris Johnson has said he is ""very confident"" MPs will back the Brexit deal he has struck with the EU. They are due to debate the withdrawal deal at a special sitting of Parliament on Saturday. New Brexit deal agreed, says Boris Johnson Live: Brexit deal latest as PM heads to EU summit Brian Taylor: A great deal (or not) to think about Earlier, first minister Nicola Sturgeon warned that the prime minister's deal would lead to a ""much harder Brexit"" than earlier plans. Mr Blackford said Mr Johnson's Brexit deal would be ""devastating for Scotland"". He told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""We will have all 35 SNP MPs in Westminster and will certainly be voting against this deal. ""This is a disaster for Scotland. It weakens our economy, takes us out of the European Union, takes us out of the single market and the customs union."" Mr Blackford also called on opposition parties to ""quit dithering, back our amendment, and finally act to bring this appalling Tory government down and stop Brexit"". He said: ""I would simply say to those on the Labour benches, don't be the midwife of a Tory Brexit. ""I hope it is the case that we defeat this tomorrow. It won't be the end of the road if it goes through, because the government has to bring a bill forward. ""But it would be very significantâ¦and pretty devastating if the government were to get this through on a small number of Labour votes."" This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: 'It's hard to imagine a worse Brexit deal' Earlier, the first minister said it was ""clear that Scotland is being treated unfairly"", and confirmed that SNP MPs ""will not vote for Brexit in any form"". After an agreement between the UK and EU was announced on Thursday morning, Ms Sturgeon said a ""much harder Brexit beckons if this deal passes"". It is unclear if the new deal will pass a vote of MPs, withthe DUP saying they still cannot support it. Mr Johnson said the ""great new deal"" would see the UK ""take back control of our laws, borders, money and trade without disruption"". The deal was announced by Mr Johnson and European leaders via Twitter on Thursday morning, ahead of a summit in Brussels. It removes the much-disputed ""backstop""proposals for the Irish border post-Brexit, and would instead see Northern Ireland remain in the UK's customs territory,external- while adhering to a limited set of EU rules on goods. Representatives in Northern Ireland would be able to decide whether to continue this arrangement every four years. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said it was a ""fair and balanced agreement"" - and suggested that it was the final deal on offer, saying there would be ""no other prolongation"". How did MPs vote on the previous Brexit deal? Mr Johnson said the ""great"" new deal ""allows us to get Brexit done and leave the EU in two weeks' time, so we can then focus on the people's priorities and bring the country back together again"". However, opposition parties in the UK have been critical, with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn saying the deal sounded ""even worse"" than what was negotiated by the previous prime minister, Theresa May"". Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson do not see eye to eye on Brexit And Ms Sturgeon said Mr Johnson's plan would lead to a ""much harder Brexit"", highlighting that people in Scotland voted for Remain by 62% to 38% in the 2016 poll. The SNP leader had always been clear that her 35 MPs would reject any deal brought back by Mr Johnson which takes the UK out of the EU's single market and customs union. Reiterating this on Thursday, she said: ""We support efforts to ensure peace and stability on the island of Ireland, in line with the Good Friday Agreement, which must be respected. ""At the same time, it cannot be right that Scotland alone is facing an outcome it did not vote for - that is democratically unacceptable and makes a mockery of claims that the UK is in any way a partnership of equals. ""The Brexit envisaged by Boris Johnson is one which sees a much looser relationship with the EU when it comes to issues like food standards, environmental protections and workers' rights. That is not the future that I or my government envisage for Scotland."" The Scottish Conservatives said the ""onus"" was on Ms Sturgeon and her MPs to back the deal, saying it would be ""unforgivable"" if opposition parties ""put their narrow party interests, grievances and ambitions over the best interests of the country"". Ms Sturgeon also repeated her call for a secondindependence referendum to take place in 2020, saying it was ""clearer than ever that the best future for Scotland is one as an equal, independent European nation"". She told her party conference on Tuesday that she would submit an official request to the UK government for an agreement to hold such a referendum by the end of this year. However, the UK government has repeatedly said it will not do such a deal, saying the 2014 ballot was a ""once in a generation decision"".

"TV presenter Kevin McCloud founded the two companies, which have called in the liquidators People who put money into two businesses started by Grand Designs star Kevin McCloud face the prospect of losing almost their entire investment. HAB Land Finance, named after Mr McCloud's Happiness Architecture Beauty brand, raised Â£2.4m from 280 people. But investors could be almost wiped out after the company and its owner, HAB Land - which was set up to buy sites for housing estates in Oxford and Winchester - called in liquidators. Mr McCloud had advertised 8% returns. However, according to KPMG, which has been appointed to liquidate the two companies, the firms were hurt by a period of ""difficult trading"". In 2017, Mr McCloud had told potential investors his company was delivering ""triple bottom line returns with progress on energy positivity"". Those potential investors were pitched so-called ""mini-bonds"" with 8% returns to crowdfund the projects in Oxford and Winchester. Almost 300 people put their money in to lend HAB Land Finance Â£2.4m to build the estates. But they have not seen a return on that investment. Architect's drawing of a HAB home in Winchester In August, the firm wrote to bondholders to inform them that they could lose up to 97% of their investment. A letter,published by the Guardian,external, said: ""After final completion of the projects at both Kings Worthy and Cumnor Hill [in Oxford], the net return available to bondholders would be expected to range from Â£606,000 (best case) to Â£69,000 (worse case) which, in each case, is equivalent to 26 pence and 3 pence for every Â£1 of bond monies invested."" Mr McCloud resigned from both firms in March last year. Since then directors of HAB Land have reviewed the firm's finances and reached the conclusion that ""they may not be in a position to repay"" bondholders, according to KPMG. It said the directors wrote to the bondholders ""putting forward proposals in order to repay them"" but those plans were rejected. As a result, the firm's board decided to put the company into liquidation. In a statement, one of the liquidators James Bennett said: ""The directors have reported that higher than anticipated design and project management costs, coupled with delays to the delivery of the sites, resulted in the companies experiencing significant liquidity issues."" He said the directors decided to liquidate the firm after they were unable to raise further finance or renegotiate existing debts. A promised orchard and play area at HAB Housing's Lovedon Fields site in Hampshire is currently a building site ""This has resulted in a considerable loss to mini-bond holders who largely financed the project,"" he said. HAB Land director, Simon Bullock, said in a statement: ""With only 22% of the mini-bond holders voting for the resolution and having exhausted all other options we were left with no alternative but to commence proceedings to put these companies into liquidation. ""With respect to the current HAB development sites in Oxfordshire and Winchester, none  of the homeowners are directly impacted by this change although the situation remains fluid and under review,"" he said. ""This has meant that there is, what we hope to be, a temporary pause on the remaining works on the sites."" Prices for Lovedon Fields homes started at Â£467,500 The site in Winchesterhas been criticisedbecause a road was left unsurfaced and promised facilities have still not been built. Winchester City Council said HAB Housing had not built allotments, an orchard or play area at Lovedon Fields, Kings Worthy, Hampshire. The BBC has contacted a spokesperson for Mr McCloud for comment.

"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

"Both sides have had to make concessions to reach this agreement. But the biggest single concession has probably been made by Boris Johnson, who has had to accept the European Union's (EU) demand that there can be no border checks of any kind for customs or regulations on the island of Ireland. That means that there will - under this plan - be checks within the United Kingdom between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It is something that the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) continues to oppose, and something Mr Johnson himself had said previously would be unacceptable. ""We would be damaging the fabric of the Union with regulatory checks and even customs controls between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, on top of those extra regulatory checks down the Irish Sea that are already envisaged in the withdrawal agreement,"" he told the DUP party conference in November 2018. ""Now I have to tell you, no British Conservative government could or should sign up to any such arrangement."" EU and UK reach deal but DUP refuses support Five reasons EU is happy with revised deal A simple guide to Brexit So why has he done it? Partly because he needed a dramatic gesture to get this deal over the line. But also because there is compromise on the other side too. The EU said the text of the withdrawal agreement it concluded with Theresa May could never be reopened. But it has been.  It said anything that replaced the backstop plan for the Irish border would have to meet the same standard of ruling out the return of a hard border ""under all circumstance"". But this new deal does not quite do that. There is a mechanism that would allow a simple majority in the Northern Ireland Assembly to vote against these proposed new economic arrangements in the future. If it did so, there would be a two-year notice period to find a new solution. That makes it, if you like, a form of time-limited backstop - although the EU would argue that it is highly unlikely that the Assembly would ever vote to trigger such uncertainty. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button The other big difference though - which is an important point of principle for Mr Johnson - is that Northern Ireland will leave the EU's customs union with the rest of the UK. Yes, it will continue to apply EU rules on customs, tariffs and regulations under the auspices of the European Court of Justice. But - through diplomatic manoeuvring - it will remain part of the UK's customs territory. That means it will be able to take a full part in any future trade deals the UK government negotiates around the world. But there is no denying that this is not the most elegant of solutions. It is not only the DUP in Northern Ireland that is unhappy. Such is the nature of a negotiated compromise. One other issue is worth highlighting - promises by the UK to stick close to the EU's regulatory system after Brexit have been removed from the legally binding withdrawal agreement text. They still appear in broad form in the political declaration on future relations - but the EU is well aware that Mr Johnson is looking for a looser economic relationship with the EU than his predecessor was. That may well cause problems in the future, as several EU countries are concerned that the UK - a major economy on their doorstep - could seek to gain a competitive advantage by undercutting the EU's system of regulation. The revised text of the political declaration says the aim is to complete a free trade agreement between the EU and the UK in the future. A high-level meeting will be convened in June 2020 to assess progress towards such a deal, before the end of the post-Brexit transition period. During trade negotiations, the UK will be treated as a potential competitor as well as a partner. In that sense - as has been said before - even if this deal passes in the next few weeks (still a big if) it will not ""get Brexit done"". Much of the hard work, including negotiating that future trade deal, is still to come, and it will last for many years.

"DUP leader Arlene Foster has insisted her party will not vote for the Brexit deal on Saturday On Thursday, the UK and EU announced news of a new Brexit deal - but Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) almost immediately rejected it. It insists its 10 MPs will not vote for it in Parliament, meaning the government faces a massive challenge in getting enough other MPs on board. Here's how the new Brexit deal differs from Theresa May's plan, why the DUP won't vote for it - and why that matters. Live: Brexit latest as PM heads to EU summit New Brexit deal agreed but DUP refuses support The problem that could undo the fragile deal When the first deal was agreed, it included the backstop - the insurance policy to maintain a seamless border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit happens. The backstop would have seen the whole of the UK retaining a very close relationship with the EU - staying in the customs union - for an indefinite period. It would also have meant Northern Ireland staying even more closely tied to some rules of the EU single market. The arrangements would have applied unless and until both the EU and UK agreed a different solution. But it was rejected on three separate occasions by MPs voting in the Commons. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. It contains several elements, which together, the EU believes can replace the backstop - but crucially, they would operate on a permanent basis. The whole of the UK would leave the customs union - but EU customs procedures would still apply on goods coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain in order to avoid checks at the Irish border. Northern Ireland would also be able to participate in any trade deals the UK strikes with countries in the future. But the newest proposal - and the one that has divided opinion - relates to the Northern Ireland Assembly getting a say on how the rules on customs arrangements would work. The revised protocol states Stormont would get a vote four years after the end of the transition period - so in 2024. A straight - or simple - majority vote by the 90 MLAs would keep the arrangements in place for another four years. Alternatively, if the arrangements got cross-community consent, passed by most nationalists and most unionists, they would remain in place for eight years. If the assembly voted to end the arrangements, there would be a two-year notice period, during which the UK and the EU would have to agree ways to protect the peace process and avoid a hard border. During the Brexit negotiations, the DUP argued that any role for Stormont needed to be on a cross-community basis - in line with how many votes in the Stormont assembly normally take place. But other political parties had argued that it would have amounted to a unionist veto, which could allow the DUP to stop Northern Ireland from following EU rules. What is now on the table means the DUP would not have control over the process because pro-EU parties have a narrow majority at Stormont. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds and leader Arlene Foster Thelast assembly election in March 2017also saw unionism lose its overall majority for the first time, coming eight seats short of the 46 required.

On Thursday, the party argued the consent mechanism in the deal ""drove a coach and horses"" through the Good Friday Agreement, which established rules for how the Stormont institutions should work. The DUP also said it could not back the proposals on customs or VAT, and that the deal posed a risk to the integrity of the union. It had previously conceded to supporting regulatory checks in the Irish Sea - but has refused to budge any further. Since 2017, the DUP has held the balance of power at Westminster. Its 10 votes were crucial for Theresa May to get laws passed in Parliament - and if Boris Johnson is to get his Brexit deal through the Commons, he needs the votes of as many MPs as possible. He currently does not have a majority and had been hoping the DUP would support the deal in order to make the parliamentary arithmetic smoother. The government knows that some staunch Brexiteers in the Conservative (and Unionist) Party are likely to listen carefully to the DUP's verdict on the deal, before deciding how to vote. In short, without the DUP's backing it seems almost impossible for Boris Johnson to get a deal through Parliament, without relying heavily on Labour MPs. And even some Brexit supporters in their ranks have expressed concerns, with NI-born Labour MP Kate Hoey tweeting that the government had ""not thought through"" the implications of what it had signed up to.

Sinn FÃ©in and the SDLP - the nationalist parties at Stormont - have cautiously welcomed the plan, suggesting that if the alternative is no deal - and a hard border - then it should receive support. The Ulster Unionist Party criticised it, with the party's Brexit spokesperson Steve Aiken saying that it would be ""better to remain in the EU"" than back Mr Johnson's plan. Several talks processes to restore Stormont have not worked The Alliance Party said the new deal seemed more ""clunky and complex"" than Theresa May's proposals - and that continuous votes in the assembly meant more uncertainty for businesses in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland's government collapsed in January 2017, after a row between the power-sharing parties. There have been several attempts to get Stormont restored, and the UK and EU say the first vote on Brexit would not happen until 2024, in the hope the assembly will have returned by then. UK and EU negotiators said it was important to ensure there was ""democratic consent"" from Northern Ireland on EU arrangements applying in the future. In the event, however, that Stormont is not sitting by the time a vote is due to take place, the UKhas committed to finding an ""alternative process"",external. It has not yet specified how that would work, but it is thought the government would still try to facilitate some kind of vote in the assembly. What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal?

"This video can not be played Johnson: This is a very good deal Boris Johnson and EU leaders have hailed the deal they have struck to take the UK out of the bloc on 31 October in an ""orderly"" fashion. The prime minister now faces a battle to get the deal through Parliament on Saturday, with the DUP opposing it. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds accused Mr Johnson of being ""too eager by far to get a deal at any cost"". European Council President Donald Tusk did not rule out an extension to the Brexit deadline if MPs rejected it. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker earlier said: ""We have a deal so why should we have a prolongation."" LIVE: Brexit deal latest What is in the new Brexit deal? DUP 'unable to vote' for PM's new Brexit deal Brexit deal: Your questions answered Kuennsberg: Johnson still facing an almighty gamble But his Brussels colleagues have been more cautious, with Mr Tusk saying he would ""consult"" the leaders of EU member states about a possible extension if one was requested by the UK. He said Boris Johnson's acceptance of customs checks at the point of entry into Northern Ireland, which the DUP objects to, had made a deal possible. Mr Johnson has repeatedly insisted the UK will leave the EU on 31 October and he urged MPs to ""come together"" and ""get this excellent deal over the line"". He added: ""Now is the moment for us to get Brexit done and then together work on building our future partnership, which I think can be incredibly positive both for the UK and for the EU."" The EU and UK negotiating teams worked round-the-clock on the legal text of the deal, but it will still need the approval of both the UK and European parliaments. In a statement, the Democratic Unionist Party, which the government relies on for support in key votes, said: ""These proposals are not, in our view, beneficial to the economic well-being of Northern Ireland and they undermine the integrity of the Union."" The DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds criticised Mr Johnson, telling BBC News: ""If he'd held his nerve - and held out - he would, of course, have got better concessions which kept the integrity, both economic and constitutional, of the UK."" He said he expected a ""massive vote"" against Mr Johnson's deal on Saturday in the House of Commons - and the DUP expected to ""play a crucial role"" in amending the legislation. The winning post for votes in the House of Commons is 320 if everyone turns up - seven Sinn Fein MPs don't sit and the Speaker and three deputies don't vote. There are currently 287 voting Conservative MPs. The prime minister needs to limit any rebellion among them. Then, if the DUP won't support his deal, he'll need the backing of 23 former Conservative MPs who are currently independents. Most will probably support the deal, but not all. That's still not quite enough, though, so the PM will also need the backing of some Labour MPs and ex-Labour independents. In March, when MPs voted on Theresa May's deal for the third time, five Labour MPs backed it, plus two ex-Labour independents. This time it's likely to be a bit higher than that because several MPs have said they would now back a deal. All this still leaves the vote very close. And it's possible some MPs could abstain, making it even harder to predict the outcome. Most of the deal is the same as the one agreed by Theresa May last year - the main change is the Northern Ireland proposal. The UK will continue to abide by EU rules until the end of 2020, and possibly longer, to allow businesses to adjust The UK will still pay an estimated Â£33bn ""divorce bill"" The rights of EU citizens living in the UK, and UK citizens in the EU, will be guaranteed What's changed? Northern Ireland will be aligned to the EU single market Thecontroversial ""backstop""- that critics feared could have kept the UK in a customs union with the EU indefinitely - has been removed Northern Ireland will instead remain a part of the UK's customs territory, so it will be included in any future trade deals struck by the government after Brexit But Northern Ireland will also remain an entry point into the EU's customs zone. The UK will not apply tariffs to products entering Northern Ireland as long as they are not destined for onward transportation across the border A joint EU/UK committee will decide which goods are at risk of entering the single market and the UK will collect EU tariffs on them on behalf of the EU The Northern Ireland Assembly - which has been suspended since January 2017 - will get a vote every four years on whether to continue with the new trading arrangements The decision would be based on a simple majority, rather than requiring a majority of both unionists and nationalists to support the rules in order for them to pass This video can not be played Barnier: This text should provide certainty In a statement, the Democratic Unionists said Northern Ireland's main East-West trade route would still be subject to EU customs rules, ""notwithstanding that Northern Ireland will remain part of the UK customs territory"". ""All goods would be subject to a customs check regime regardless of their final destination,"" the statement added, and the plan for a joint EU/UK committee would give the EU a ""veto"" on which goods would be exempt from tariffs or not. Consent issue at heart of DUP Brexit deal concern Brexit deal would make Wales poorer - Drakeford Sturgeon says PM's deal means 'much harder Brexit' ""This is not acceptable within the internal borders of the United Kingdom,"" the DUP said. They expressed concerns Northern Ireland consumers would face increased costs and less choice, and Northern Ireland would also be subject to different VAT arrangements to the rest of the UK. ""Some progress"" had been made on democratic consent for the deal, it went on, but the idea of giving the Assembly a vote on the new arrangements that could be won by a ""simple majority"" violated the Good Friday Agreement, which demands the backing of both unionists and nationalists. While Boris Johnson may have a deal in Brussels, he absolutely does not have a deal in Westminster. The DUP isn't prepared to back this package because it does not give it a veto over the new customs arrangement, which it fears could threaten Northern Ireland's position in the United Kingdom. Team Johnson hopes that, by presenting this as a choice between Mr Johnson's deal and no-deal, the DUP will buckle. But the DUP doesn't blink easily, and if it doesn't, the signs are Mr Johnson could be defeated on Saturday, when the party's 10 votes could be critical. That could trigger the Benn Act, forcing a lengthy delay, and could encourage some opposition MP to trigger a motion of no confidence, paving the way for a general election. It's going to be a titanic tussle on Saturday. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the deal sounded ""even worse"" than the one negotiated by the PM's predecessor, Theresa May, and ""should be rejected"" by MPs. MPs have voted to hold an extra sitting in the Commons on Saturday to discuss the next steps. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the government would hold a vote on the deal and was not ""not contemplating defeat"". But, he added, if the plan did not get the backing of MPs, the alternative was leaving without a deal. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said he and Mr Juncker had been told by the PM that ""he has faith in his ability to convince the majority he needs in the House of Commons"". Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage called for the deal to be rejected by Parliament, saying it would mean ""we will not be making our own laws in our own country"". Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said: ""The next few days will set the direction of our country for generations, and I am more determined than ever to stop Brexit."" MPs passed a law in September that requires the PM to request an extension on 19 October if Parliament has not agreed a deal or backed leaving without a deal by that date.

Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Labour would oppose the deal, citing concerns it would allow the UK to move further away from EU regulations in the future.

Mr Dodds earlier said he expected a ""massive vote"" against Mr Johnson's deal on Saturday in the House of Commons - and the DUP expected to ""play a crucial role"" in amending the legislation. The new deal is largely the same as the one agreed by Theresa May last year - but it removes the controversial backstop clause, which critics say could have kept the UK tied indefinitely to EU customs rules. Northern Ireland would now remain in the UK's customs union, but there would also be customs checks on some goods passing through en route to Ireland and the EU single market. This video can not be played DUP: PM 'too eager for deal at any cost' The DUP said: ""This is not acceptable within the internal borders of the United Kingdom."" The party also objects to Northern Ireland potentially being part of a different VAT regime to the rest of the UK and is concerned about the deal violating the Good Friday Agreement's principle of consulting the nationalist and unionist communities on important issues. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker caused a flurry earlier when he said there was no need for a Brexit extension as ""we have a deal"". This was seen as a major boost for Mr Johnson, who has always insisted he would not go beyond 31 October - even if he was forced to ask for an extension under the terms of the so-called Benn Act, which kicks in on Saturday if MPs vote his deal down. But Mr Juncker's EU colleagues were more cautious, with European Council President Donald Tusk saying he would ""consult"" member states about an extension if necessary. At a joint press conference, Mr Tusk, Mr Juncker, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar all expressed regret that the UK was leaving the EU. Mr Tusk said: ""On a more personal note, what I feel today, frankly speaking, is sadness, because in my heart I will always be a Remainer, and I hope that our British friends decide to return one day, our door will always be open."" The winning post for votes in the House of Commons is 320 if everyone turns up - seven Sinn Fein MPs don't sit and the Speaker and three deputies don't vote. There are currently 287 voting Conservative MPs. The prime minister needs to limit any rebellion among them. Then, if the DUP won't support his deal, he'll need the backing of 23 former Conservative MPs who are currently independents. Most will probably support the deal, but not all. That's still not quite enough, though, so the PM will also need the backing of some Labour MPs and ex-Labour independents. In March, when MPs voted on Theresa May's deal for the third time, five Labour MPs backed it, plus two ex-Labour independents. This time it's likely to be a bit higher than that because several MPs have said they would now back a deal. All this still leaves the vote very close. And it's possible some MPs could abstain, making it even harder to predict the outcome. Do you have any questions about the proposed Brexit deal?

"Jo Maugham expects the legal challenge to be heard on Friday Anti-Brexit campaigners have launched a legal bid to stop the UK government from passing its proposed EU withdrawal agreement. They believe it contravenes legislation preventing Northern Ireland forming part of a separate customs territory to Great Britain. MPs are due to debate the agreement at a special Commons sitting on Saturday. Campaigner Jo Maugham QC confirmed the petition had been lodged at Scotland's highest civil court. He expects the legal challenge to be heard on Friday. New Brexit deal agreed, says Boris Johnson Live: Brexit deal latest as PM heads to EU summit Brexit: What happens now? The move followed the earlier announcement by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker that the two sides had come to an agreement on a ""great new deal"" for Brexit, ahead of a crucial EU summit in Brussels. Mr Johnson tweeted that the new withdrawal agreement ""takes back control"" and removes the ""anti-democratic"" Irish backstop, although the Tories' Northern Irish allies in the DUP have indicated they cannot support the deal. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier revealed the deal means Northern Ireland will remain in the UK's customs territory but that the island of Ireland will be aligned to some EU rules, meaning goods must be checked on entry to the island rather than border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Mr Barnier said: ""We are fully committed to protecting peace, to protect stability on the island of Ireland,"" adding that a hard border would be avoided while protecting the integrity of the single market.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Explaining his legal objections to the agreement, Mr Maugham said it contravenes legislation stating it is ""unlawful for Her Majesty's Government to enter into arrangements under which Northern Ireland forms part of a separate customs territory to Great Britain"". Mr Maugham claims that if the court finds the proposed agreement is unlawful the government would be obliged to request an extension to Brexit negotiations, under the terms of the Benn Act. That legislation stipulates the prime minister must ask the EU for a delay if Parliament does not agree a deal by Saturday. Mr Maugham, right, and Joanna Cherry, left, were part of a group who took the prime minister to court over his decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks Under the current law, Section 55 of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018 prevents Northern Ireland from having different customs rules than the rest of the UK. This is purportedly to ""uphold the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom and safeguard the Union for the future"", according to a government briefing on the Bill. After details emerged of the Brexit deal, Mr Maugham said: ""We do not understand how the government might have come to negotiate a withdrawal agreement in terms that breach amendments tabled by its own European Research Group. ""Unless and until Section 55 is repealed by the UK Parliament, it is simply not open, as a matter of law, for the United Kingdom to enter into such an agreement. ""If the proposed withdrawal agreement is unlawful, the government will be obliged to request an extension as mandated by the Benn Act and in accordance with undertakings given to the Court of Session in Vince, Maugham, Cherry v Boris Johnson."" Mr Maugham was involved in the legal fight against Boris Johnson's decision to suspend parliament for five weeks - a move that was ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court. He was also part of the team that wants the Court of Session to rule on whether it could use aspecial power called nobile officiumto sign letter requesting an extension to the Brexit process on behalf of the government.

"A revised Brexit deal has been agreed by the UK and EU. What is in it? Most of the changes - to the deal agreed by Theresa May with EU in November 2018 - are to do with the status of the Irish border after Brexit. This issue has dominated talks for months. All sides want to avoid the return of a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit - with checks and infrastructure that could be targeted by paramilitary groups. Coming up with solutions to this - acceptable to all sides - has been very challenging. The new protocol,externalreplaces the controversial Irish backstop plan in Theresa May's deal. Much of the rest of that deal will remain. Here are some of the key new parts: The whole of the UK will leave the EU customs union. The customs union is an agreement between EU countries not to charge taxes called tariffs on things coming from other EU countries, and to charge the same tariffs as each other on things coming from outside the EU. Leaving the customs union means the UK will be able to strike trade deals with other countries in the future. Legally there will be a customs border between Northern Ireland (which stays in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (which stays in the EU), but in practice things won't be checked on that border. The actual checks will be on what is effectively a customs border between Great Britain and the island of Ireland, with goods being checked at ""points of entry"" into Northern Ireland. Taxes will only have to be paid on goods being moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland if those products are considered ""at risk"" of then being transported into the Republic of Ireland. A joint committee made up of UK and EU representatives will decide at a later date what goods are considered ""at risk"". If taxes are paid on ""at risk"" goods that do not end up being sent on from Northern Ireland into the EU, the UK would be responsible for whether to refund the money. Individual travellers won't have their baggage checked and taxes will not have to be paid by individuals sending goods to other people. Separately, there will be limits agreed by the joint committee on the amount of help the government can give to Northern Irish farmers. The figure will be based on the amount they currently receive from the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. Where have the UK and EU compromised? Brexit deal: What does it mean? Brexit: What happens now? Have UK voters changed their minds on Brexit? When it comes to the regulation of goods (that's the rules they have to follow on things like labelling and manufacturing processes) Northern Ireland would keep to EU rules rather than UK rules. That removes the need for checks on goods including food and agricultural produce at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, because both will be part of an ""all-island regulatory zone"". But it adds to the checks between the rest of the UK - which will not necessarily be sticking to EU single market rules - and Northern Ireland. This will be done by UK officials at ""points of entry"" into Northern Ireland, but the EU will have the right to have its own officials present. It seems those EU officials may be able to overrule UK officials. The agreement states that EU representatives will be able to ask UK authorities to take certain steps in individual cases and they will have to do so. Because Northern Ireland will be set apart from the rest of the UK when it comes to customs and other EU rules, the deal gives its Assembly a vote on these new arrangements. But this vote would not happen until four years after the end of the transition period (the time after Brexit when everything stays the same to allow everyone to prepare for the changes while the UK's future relationship with the EU is discussed). The transition period is due to run until at least the end of 2020. So the four-year period would run until the end of 2024. If the Northern Ireland Assembly votes against the new arrangements, they would stop applying two years later, during which time the ""joint committee"" would make recommendations to the UK and EU on what to do about this. If there were to be no agreement during this two year period, some form of hard border could re-emerge in Ireland, but it's unlikely that would be allowed to happen. If the Assembly accepts the continuing provisions by a simple majority, they will then apply for another four years. If the deal has ""cross-community support"" then they will apply for eight years. The deal defines cross-community support as more than 50% of unionist and nationalist Assembly members voting in favour, or at least 40% of members from each designation if in total at least 60% of members have voted in favour. The UK government has said that if the Northern Ireland Assembly is still not sitting at that point,it will make alternative arrangements to make sure a vote can take place.,external The new agreement says thatEU law on value added tax,external(VAT - a tax added when you make purchases) will apply in Northern Ireland, but only on goods, not services. But it also allows Northern Ireland to have different VAT rates to the rest of the UK, which would not normally be allowed under EU law. For example, if the UK decided to reduce the VAT on household fuel to zero, Northern Ireland would still have to keep it at 5%, which is the EU minimum. It also means that Northern Ireland may get the same VAT rates on certain goods as the Republic of Ireland, to stop there being an unfair advantage on either side of the border. Much of Mrs May's original Brexit deal will remain as part of the overall agreement. Some of the key areas are: The transition - a period of time during which all of the current rules stay the same allowing the UK and the EU to negotiate their future relationship - is due to last until the end of December 2020. The UK will need to abide by EU rules and pay into the EU budget, but will lose membership of its institutions. The transition can be extended, but only for a period of one or two years. Both the UK and EU must agree to any extension. UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, will retain their residency and social security rights after Brexit. Freedom of movement rules will continue to apply during transition. This means that UK nationals will be able to live and work in EU countries (and EU nationals will be able to live and work in UK) during this period. Anyone who remains in the same EU country for five years will be allowed to apply for permanent residence. (UPDATE: 13 December 2019 - This piece has been updated and reflects the delay of the Brexit date to the end of January 2020.) The UK will have to settle its financial obligations to the EU. There is no precise figure but the biggest part of this ""divorce bill"" will be the UK contributions to the EU budget until the end of the transition period at the end of 2020. When Brexit was delayed it meant that some of that money was paid as the UK's normal membership contributions, so less of it was part of the divorce bill. When the Brexit date was 31 October 2019, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)estimated,externalthat the bill was about Â£32.8bn (down from Â£39bn). To reach an estimate of what the bill would be for departure on 31 January 2020, you could subtract the Â£1.62bn thatthe OBR said,externalwas left to pay in membership fees in 2019 and 14% of the Â£10.69bn for the whole of 2020 (it's more than one twelfth because the EU usually requests a higher proportion of the contributions earlier in the year). That gives a total of just under Â£30bn. The OBR expects that most of the money - about three-quarters of the total - would be paid by 2022, with some relatively small payments still being made in the 2060s. This is addressed in the political declaration.This text, which is not legally binding, has also been revised by UK/EU negotiators.,external It says that both sides will work towards a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and a high-level meeting will happen in June 2020 to see how that work is going. The text also contains a new paragraph on the so-called ""level playing field"" - the degree to which the UK will agree to stick closely to EU regulations in the future. The references to a ""level playing field"" were removed from the legally-binding withdrawal agreement and put in the political declaration, which is not binding. It says that both sides will keep the same high standards on state aid, competition, social and employment standards, the environment, climate change, and ""relevant tax matters"".

"Ian Blackford has tabled an amendment to Saturday's motion. The SNP is to call for a three-month extension to Brexit to allow time to hold a general election. Ian Blackford, the party's Westminster leader, has tabled an amendment to Saturday's motion in the Commons, rejecting the new Brexit deal. He also calls for an extension until at least 31 January 2020, allowing for an early election. Boris Johnson has said he is ""very confident"" MPs will back the Brexit deal he has struck with the EU. They are due to debate the withdrawal deal at a special sitting of Parliament on Saturday. New Brexit deal agreed, says Boris Johnson Live: Brexit deal latest as PM heads to EU summit Brian Taylor: A great deal (or not) to think about Earlier, first minister Nicola Sturgeon warned that the prime minister's deal would lead to a ""much harder Brexit"" than earlier plans. Mr Blackford said Mr Johnson's Brexit deal would be ""devastating for Scotland"". He told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""We will have all 35 SNP MPs in Westminster and will certainly be voting against this deal. ""This is a disaster for Scotland. It weakens our economy, takes us out of the European Union, takes us out of the single market and the customs union."" Mr Blackford also called on opposition parties to ""quit dithering, back our amendment, and finally act to bring this appalling Tory government down and stop Brexit"". He said: ""I would simply say to those on the Labour benches, don't be the midwife of a Tory Brexit. ""I hope it is the case that we defeat this tomorrow. It won't be the end of the road if it goes through, because the government has to bring a bill forward. ""But it would be very significantâ¦and pretty devastating if the government were to get this through on a small number of Labour votes."" This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: 'It's hard to imagine a worse Brexit deal' Earlier, the first minister said it was ""clear that Scotland is being treated unfairly"", and confirmed that SNP MPs ""will not vote for Brexit in any form"". After an agreement between the UK and EU was announced on Thursday morning, Ms Sturgeon said a ""much harder Brexit beckons if this deal passes"". It is unclear if the new deal will pass a vote of MPs, withthe DUP saying they still cannot support it. Mr Johnson said the ""great new deal"" would see the UK ""take back control of our laws, borders, money and trade without disruption"". The deal was announced by Mr Johnson and European leaders via Twitter on Thursday morning, ahead of a summit in Brussels. It removes the much-disputed ""backstop""proposals for the Irish border post-Brexit, and would instead see Northern Ireland remain in the UK's customs territory,external- while adhering to a limited set of EU rules on goods. Representatives in Northern Ireland would be able to decide whether to continue this arrangement every four years. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said it was a ""fair and balanced agreement"" - and suggested that it was the final deal on offer, saying there would be ""no other prolongation"". How did MPs vote on the previous Brexit deal? Mr Johnson said the ""great"" new deal ""allows us to get Brexit done and leave the EU in two weeks' time, so we can then focus on the people's priorities and bring the country back together again"". However, opposition parties in the UK have been critical, with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn saying the deal sounded ""even worse"" than what was negotiated by the previous prime minister, Theresa May"". Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson do not see eye to eye on Brexit And Ms Sturgeon said Mr Johnson's plan would lead to a ""much harder Brexit"", highlighting that people in Scotland voted for Remain by 62% to 38% in the 2016 poll. The SNP leader had always been clear that her 35 MPs would reject any deal brought back by Mr Johnson which takes the UK out of the EU's single market and customs union. Reiterating this on Thursday, she said: ""We support efforts to ensure peace and stability on the island of Ireland, in line with the Good Friday Agreement, which must be respected. ""At the same time, it cannot be right that Scotland alone is facing an outcome it did not vote for - that is democratically unacceptable and makes a mockery of claims that the UK is in any way a partnership of equals. ""The Brexit envisaged by Boris Johnson is one which sees a much looser relationship with the EU when it comes to issues like food standards, environmental protections and workers' rights. That is not the future that I or my government envisage for Scotland."" The Scottish Conservatives said the ""onus"" was on Ms Sturgeon and her MPs to back the deal, saying it would be ""unforgivable"" if opposition parties ""put their narrow party interests, grievances and ambitions over the best interests of the country"". Ms Sturgeon also repeated her call for a secondindependence referendum to take place in 2020, saying it was ""clearer than ever that the best future for Scotland is one as an equal, independent European nation"". She told her party conference on Tuesday that she would submit an official request to the UK government for an agreement to hold such a referendum by the end of this year. However, the UK government has repeatedly said it will not do such a deal, saying the 2014 ballot was a ""once in a generation decision"".

"This video can not be played One eyewitness captured the moment a climate protester was dragged from top of Tube train Commuters have dragged climate change protesters from the roof of a London Underground train. Extinction Rebellion activists climbed on to trains at Stratford, Canning Town and Shadwell in Thursday's rush hour. Eight protesters have been arrested, British Transport Police (BTP) said. The Jubilee Line and Docklands Light Railway were temporarily suspended. Extinction Rebellion later said it would ""take stock"" of the reaction to the latest action for future protests. Spokesman Howard Rees said: ""Was it the right thing to do? I am not sure. ""I think we will have to have a period of reflection. It is too early to say."" Extinction Rebellion previously said the disruption was ""necessary to highlight the emergency"". Protesters climbed to the top of a train carriage at Shadwell station Hayden Green, a commuter at Canning Town, said he saw the protester ""dragged to the floor and kicked repeatedly"". ""Police have struggled to deal with the protest in London so the public stepped in and in the heat of the moment it was taken too far,"" he told the BBC. ""I support their cause but I think how the protests have been carried out has led to more divisions."" Hayden Green said violence broke out after a protester tried to ""kick a commuter"" In footage shared on social media, a passenger waiting for a train is seen climbing on the carriage to get to one of the protesters. The activist is grabbed by the knees and dragged down, falling to the platform where he appears to then be kicked and hit by angry commuters on the platform. Others can be heard shouting and swearing at the protesters. One shouts: ""I have to get to work too - I have to feed my kids."" Extinction Rebellion protesters climb on to a Jubilee line train at Canning Town station A second protester was chased along the top of the train carriage by a commuter before being dragged off. A third Extinction Rebellion activist, who was broadcasting the protest on the group's social media accounts, said he was also attacked and ""kicked in the head"". BTP said it was investigating what happened at Canning Town station, adding it was ""concerning to see that a number of commuters took matters into their own hands, displaying violent behaviour to detain a protester"". Ithas appealed for anyone with information,external, pictures or mobile phone footage of any of the incidents to upload them to its website. Assistant Chief Constable Sean O'Callaghan said: ""It is important that commuters and other rail users allow the police, who are specially trained, to manage these incidents.Â Â ""Unfortunately, there is still a risk that Extinction Rebellion will target the rail network during this evening's peak. We will continue to have extra officers on patrol and will work to disrupt any potential criminal action before it happens."" By Justin Rowlatt, BBC chief environment correspondent Today's Extinction Rebellion action against London's public transport network represents a significant escalation of its strategy of ""disruption"". It is one thing to stage a colourful protest in a few roads in Whitehall, quite another to target the Tubes and trains that so many Londoners rely on to get them to work on time. Many commuters were left scratching their heads this morning, bewildered by an environmental protest that targeted one of the most environmentally-friendly ways to travel. The tactic has been the subject of much discussion within Extinction Rebellion - a loose affiliation of interested groups and individuals. A poll among members taken yesterday suggests the vast majority were against any action targeting the London Underground. Out of 3,800 votes, 72% said they were opposed to any action against Tube trains and 14% were against the idea if people could get blocked underground. Perhaps not surprisingly, the decision to go ahead has upset many members - as well as commuters - and for good reason. Tackling climate change will be easier if there is a consensus that action is necessary. The Extinction Rebellion activists behind this action will want to consider whether gluing yourself to a train is really the best way to build that consensus. At Shadwell station several activists glued themselves to trains, including 83-year-old Phil Kingston. In April, Extinction Rebellion protesters also glued themselves to a DLR train at Canary Wharf, causing minor delays. ""If XR wants to make an inclusive movement, these tactics on public transport at rush hour won't get them far,"" Ana Zarraga told the BBC. The 35-year-old, who was prevented from catching her train at Shadwell, said: ""The bankers and the CEOs of the most polluting industries are certainly not travelling on the DLR at 07.00 BST."" Protesters clashed with commuters at Shadwell, Docklands Light Railway station Earlier Extinction Rebellion co-founder Clare Farrell defended the Tube action, saying ""the public, I don't think, realise quite how serious this situation is"". What is Extinction Rebellion and what does it want? She added: ""Someone has been hurt today. We understand that putting ourselves in these positions is potentially dangerous for us. ""But what else can we do?"" The protester who appeared to try to kick a commuter acted ""in self defence in a moment of panic when confronted by a threatening situation,"" Extinction Rebellion said. ""He acknowledges his accountability for this action,"" it said. The group has invited the commuters involved in today's protest ""to have a conversation"" about what happened. At Shadwell station, one of the protesters who had glued themselves to trains was 83-year-old Phil Kingston Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said in a statement: ""I strongly condemn the Extinction Rebellion protesters who have targeted the London Underground and DLR this morning. ""This illegal action is extremely dangerous, counterproductive and is causing unacceptable disruption to Londoners who use public transport to get to work."" Train drivers' union Aslef said the Tube and other public transport services were ""part of the solution to climate change, not the problem"". Extinction Rebellion should ""stick to protesting against those who create the problem - not our industry, members and hard-working commuters"", the union added. A public order ban,externalhas been put in place on Extinction Rebellion activities in London since Monday. At the High Court a judge has refused the request to hear Extinction Rebellion's appeal against the ban early. The group wanted a hearing before the scheduled end of the protest on 19 October.

"A photo of US House Speaker Nancy Pelosiconfronting the President Donald Trumpat areportedlyexplosive White House meeting has become a symbol of the deep divisions in Washington. In the image, leading Democrat Ms Pelosi is standing up at a large table, surrounded by male congressional leaders and top military officials, pointing her finger towards the president, who is seated opposite her and appears stunned. Afterwards, Mr Trump took to his preferred social media platform, Twitter, to share the photo along with the caption: ""Nervous Nancy's unhinged meltdown"". Ms Pelosi - who has said it was Mr Trump that had the ""meltdown"" - hit back by proudly making the image her cover photo on both Twitter and Facebook. The original tweet by Mr Trump has now been shared more than 24,000 times on Twitter, with scores of people weighing in on what it says about the two top US politicians. It has spurred debates on everything from gender inequality in politics, to who would be the better president, but at its core are the disagreements over one of the most divisive political issues of the moment. Viewpoint: Syria could be beginning of end for Trump Disastrous moment for US policy in Mid-East The Wednesday meeting was held to discuss the situation in northern Syria, where Turkey launched an offensive last week against Kurdish-led forces after the US suddenly withdrew its troops. Just before the meeting, the US House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to condemn the troop withdrawal. A Democratic source told the Associated Press news agency that the meeting began with Mr Trump bragging about a ""nasty"" letter he had sent to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Turkish president 'threw Trump letter in bin' Ms Pelosi is then said to have mentioned the House vote and Democratic leader Chuck Schumer began to read the president a quote from former Defence Secretary James Mattis on the need to keep US troops in Syria to prevent a resurgence of the so-called Islamic State group, known as IS or Isis. According to US media, Mr Trump cut Mr Schumer off, complaining that Mr Mattis was ""the world's most overrated general"". As the meeting went on, the president is said to have told Ms Pelosi: ""I hate Isis more than you do."" When asked by Mr Schumer if his plan was to rely on the Syrians and the Turks, the president said the plan was ""to keep the American people safe"". Ms Pelosi reportedly told him that this was a goal, not a plan. Mr Schumer has said the president then called Ms Pelosi a ""third-rate"" politician. (She later said it was ""third-grade"".) At that point, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer reportedly interjected, telling the president that such insults were ""not useful"". The Democratic leaders then left the meeting early. Speaking to reporters following the meeting, Ms Pelosi described it as ""most unsatisfactory"". ""Two-to-one, the Republicans voted to oppose what he was doing in Syria.  He just couldn't handle it so he just kind of engaged in a meltdown,"" she said. Mr Schumer said the president had been ""insulting, particularly to the speaker"". Allow Twitter content?

In a final photo, showing three empty seats following the walk-out, he labelled Ms Pelosi and Mr Schumer the ""Do Nothing Democrats"". He then said Ms Pelosi ""needs help fast"". ""She had a total meltdown in the White House today. It was very sad to watch. Pray for her, she is a very sick person,"" he wrote. As the photo went viral, some used the hashtag #BeNancy, urging people to take inspiration from the House speaker, while others siding with the president tweeted #PelosiMeltdown.

"Boris Johnson was surrounded by EU leaders after the deal was announced at the Brussels summit The EU and UK have reached an agreement widely hailed by European leaders as a significant step. But the deal still has to get past the UK Parliament, so why does Europe appear so keen? Ninety-five per cent of this revised deal is the deal agreed with Prime Minister Boris Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, during two years of painstaking negotiations. Citizens' rights. Money. Ongoing cases at the European Court of Justice. The data of EU citizens stored in the UK. Under this deal, they would all be secured. This video can not be played EU President Jean-Claude Juncker says the deal provides ""certainty"" Unveiling the deal, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said: ""This textâ¦ provides legal certainty and certainty where Brexit creates uncertainty."" With some creative thinking, clever drafting and some give-and-take, the EU and UK have revived the original Northern Ireland-only backstop but with some key differences. ""We shifted our positions but within our principles,"" a member of Team Barnier told me soon after the deal was agreed. In black and white, Northern Ireland is in the UK's customs territory but in reality the EU's customs processes will apply, although it might not always feel that way because of exemptions, rebates and other tweaks. What is in the new Brexit deal? The long-term future of the Irish border will be in the hands of the people of Northern Ireland through a vote in the Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont after four years, and then a further four or eight years later. This video can not be played ""It creates a unique solution for Northern Ireland"" - Leo Varadkar If Stormont decides it's happy to change the status quo and accept a harder border then it's Stormont's choice - not Dublin's, not London's, not Brussels'. Northern Ireland will follow pages and pages of EU rules on agriculture and goods. Items entering Northern Ireland will be checked for compliance with those regulations. That reduces the risk of dodgy goods ending up in France, Belgium, Finland or the rest of the member states. The single market will be physically protected. Breaches of those rules can be sent to the European Court of Justice, which means the EU's highest court still administers EU law. The single market will be legally protected. As the French President Emmanuel Macron said when he arrived at the summit, Boris Johnson assured him he had the votes to get this agreement through the House of Commons. If there's a hiccup then there's always the safety valve of an extension to the Brexit deadline, despite what leaders are currently saying. Juncker: This is a fair and balanced agreement.

"Knife crime in England and Wales has increased again, according to the latest figures from police forces. In the 12 months to the end of June 2019, knife crime offences rose by 7%, reaching a record high. But the picture on knife crime is mixed - with a fall in the number of homicides related to knife crime. The data, from the Office for National Statistics, also found a 11% rise in the number of recorded robberies, while fraud offences went up by 15%. According to the ONS, which publishedits latest figures,externalon Thursday, the number of offences involving a knife or sharp instrument increased from just over 41,000 in the year to June 2018 to just over 44,000 in the last 12 months. The knife crime figures do not include Greater Manchester Police, because of a previous problem with their recording methods. It marks a new record level since 2011, the year that knife crime statistics started to be gathered in a unified way. Why are fewer crimes being solved? What is knife crime like in your area? But the ONS added: ""The number of homicides where a knife or sharp instrument was involved decreased by 14%. ""This decrease was mainly driven by falls in London. ""There is a mixed picture in the total number of offences involving knifes or sharp instruments across different police force areas, with the Metropolitan Police recording little change in the last year."" The total number of homicides recorded by the police also fell by 5% in the last year, from 719 to 681 offences. Meanwhile, a separate Crime Survey for England and Wales, which includes offences that are not reported to police, indicated a continuing rise in fraud. The survey's latest estimates show a 15% increase in fraud offences, driven by a 17% rise in ""bank and credit account fraud"". It said there were 3,863,000 fraud offences in the year to June. Almost 2.7m of those were bank and credit account fraud offences, up from 2.3m the previous year. But the survey, which measures people's experience of crime, found fewer than one in six incidents of fraud were reported by the victim to the police or Action Fraud in the last 12 months ending March 2019. Click here to take part,externalin a short study about this article run by the University of Cambridge. On the positive side, there are signs the surge in knife crime may be slowing. The rate of increase is half what it was a year ago; the Metropolitan Police, which accounts for a third of the total, recorded only 17 more offences; and there were were 39 fewer fatal stabbings than in the previous 12 months. However, there is still a long way to go - as shown by a continuing rise in the number of knifepoint rapes, robberies and assaults logged by forces. Arguably of greater significance are figures which show a steep downward trend in crimes that are solved. The way the data was compiled changed in 2015. Then, 15.5% of cases resulted in a suspect being charged or brought to court. Now, it's 7.4%. The key reason for the slump in detections appears to be that victims are increasingly unwilling to support prosecutions: it means more offenders escape justice, free to commit more crimes. The ONS figures include two sources of data: Home Office statistics about crimes recorded by police; and also the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which asks people about their experiences of crime. On its own, police recorded crime is not seen as a complete picture of crime in England and Wales. The crime survey provides an estimate of crimes that may either have not been recorded by police or may never have been reported to them in the first place. The crime survey selects about 50,000 households at random from the Royal Mail's list of addresses. Read more:How accurate are police crime figures? Meanwhile, separately,other Home Office data,externalshows the number of crimes solved across England and Wales has fallen to another record low. Figures show just 7.4% of crimes in the 12 months to the end of June resulted in a suspect being charged or ordered to appear in court. The previous year the figure was 8.7%, and the figure in the 12 months to March 2019 was 7.8%. Responding to Thursday's statistics, Merseyside Police Chief Constable Andy Cooke, of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said the figures were a ""symptom of the strain on policing as we try to manage growing crime, and demand that is ever more complex"". Meanwhile, the government's crime, policing and fire minister Kit Malthouse said he was ""deeply concerned"" at the rise of certain crimes, particularly knife crime. ""All of us involved, from the police to local and national government, must confront this challenge head on,"" he said, adding that the government was ""making progress...but there is a lot more to do"". ""It's also vital that we divert young people away from committing crime in the first place, which is why we are investing over Â£220 million into early intervention projects and placing a duty on public bodies to work together to tackle youth violence,"" he said.

"The man is believed to be Kenyan and in his 30s Police are looking for help to identify a man who fell out of a plane from Kenya into a garden in London. Officers were called to an address in Offerton Road, Clapham, in June, where the body of the man, believed to be in his 30s, was found. He is thought to have fallen from the landing gear compartment of the aircraft headed for Heathrow Airport. Scotland Yard has released an e-fit image of the man. The force said it believed the man was Kenyan but was ""keeping an open mind"".

"Christian Dior has become the latest foreign brand to apologise to China after it used a map that Beijing sees as misrepresenting its territory. The French luxury brand was criticised on Chinese social media after an employee reportedly used a China map in a presentation that excluded Taiwan. Taiwan has been self-ruled since the 1950s, but Beijing's official policy is that the island is a Chinese province. Dior apologised for the ""mistake in representation"" made by an employee. Brand 'witch hunt' takes over Chinese internet Vietnam pulls film over South China Sea map The row broke out after a video was posted online anonymously claiming to show a Dior employee giving a talk at a university in China and showing the map. It sparked a huge reaction on social media, as people complained that Dior was not respecting Chinese territorial claims. ""Dior statement"" was one of the top 10 most searched items on Weibo on Thursday. ""The company firstly deeply apologises for the incident on 16 October 2019 where a member of the Dior HR team was... giving a presentation when [the employee] made a mistake in representation and gave an incorrect explanation,"" the company said in its statement. Christian Dior said it had done a ""diligent investigation"", adding it would ""seriously handle"" the matter. ""Dior has always respected and upheld the principle of one China, strictly upholding China's rights and complete sovereignty, treasuring the feelings of Chinese citizens,"" it added. Versace apologises after T-shirt angers China Swarovski apologises to China over Hong Kong error In recent years, Chinese social media users have aggressively been pursuing companies which they believe are challenging China's territorial claims. China is a huge market for luxury brands, so they are keen not to risk negative PR or a boycott by offending Chinese consumers. Versace apologised in Augustafter an image on one of its T-shirts appeared to imply Hong Kong and Macau were independent territories. Coach and Givenchy have also faced a backlash recently over the representation of Chinese territories on some of their garments. Airlines and hotel chains have also had to apologise after listing Taiwan as a separate country on their booking menus, not as part of China. Earlier this week, Vietnam banned the animated movie Abominable over another map row. The film, the first tie-in between Dreamworks and China's Pearl Studio, briefly displayed a map that showed areas of the South China Sea claimed by Vietnam as being Chinese territory.

"A Brexit deal has been agreed by the UK and EU, but what does it all mean? We answer a sample of the questions we have received from readers. Under law, yes he does. The Benn Act, passed by MPs last month,says that Mr Johnson would be required to request a three-month Brexit delay - unless he can pass a deal, or get MPs to approve a no-deal exit by 19 October. That's Saturday. Parliamentwill be sitting that day, which is when MPs are likely to hold a vote on Mr Johnson's new deal. The UK will still pay a ""divorce bill"" under Mr Johnson's deal. However, because the UK has had an extended stay in the EU,the actual bill would now be about Â£33bn,external. The new proposals are much the same as Theresa May's deal. The main difference is on the crucial issue of the Irish border and whether the UK will leave the customs union entirely after the transition period. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button The UK does not plan to introduce visas for tourists from the EU. So, for short-term trips, things should be more or less the same. Since the UK voted to leave the EU, the value of the pound has fallen. This is despitea small rise after the deal was announced. This is because of all the uncertainty around what Brexit might look like. It's hard to predict how the value of the pound will change. One common suggestion to get the most out of your holiday money is to change half a few weeks before, and the other half a couple of days before, to hedge your bets. The Labour leader said the deal is worse than Mrs May's because the proposals ""risk triggering a race to the bottom on rights and protections"". He said the deal would be ""putting food safety at risk, cutting environmental standards and workers' rights, and opening up our NHS to a takeover by US private corporations"". Mr Corbyn said the deal should be rejected. No, not as the law currently stands. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 says that in order to make a withdrawal agreement valid, it has to be approved by Parliament. You are hearing about Northern Ireland because the removal of the old backstop is probably the biggest single change. Other parts of the withdrawal agreement, such as the transition period, citizens' rights, and the money the UK has to pay, will stay the same. The UK will still follow EU rules and regulations until the end of 2020. But under the new deal the whole of the UK will definitely leave the EU customs union at that point. The UK will also leave the single market, but Northern Ireland will continue to follow all its regulations for agrifood and industrial goods. There have also been changes to the political declaration which sets out plans for the long-term relationship between the UK and the EU. It says the future relationship will be based on a Free Trade Agreement, but there's no guarantee one can be agreed by the end of 2020. Mr Johnson's deal mainly focuses on solving the problem of the Irish border. When it comes to citizens' rights, he has kept the agreements made by Mrs May. UK nationals living legally in an EU country at the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020 will be able to stay and enjoy the same rights. Anyone arriving after that will be subject to each country's immigration rules. Up until the end of transition, UK nationals will still be able to move freely to the EU. No, there would not be a hard border as long as the provisions of the deal stay in place. Under the deal there would be no customs checks or regulatory checks on goods going between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The solution - in this deal - is to effectively have the customs and regulatory border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK (you will hear people talk about ""a border in the Irish Sea""). The EU has said - in practice - this will mean all checks on goods will be done by UK officials ""at points of entry"" in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Assembly would get a chance to vote on these arrangements four years after the end of the transition period (which finishes at the end of 2020 but could be extended by a year or two years). And even if they were voted down - which is considered unlikely - there would then be a two-year cooling off period for other arrangements to be made to try to avoid a hard border. Yes, the UK would leave the EU's customs union, through which matters of trade are negotiated for all of its members as a bloc. That means the whole of the UK will be able to strike its own trade deals with non-EU countries as well as with the EU - although this could take some time. What is in the new Brexit deal? What are the backstop options? Can a no-deal Brexit still happen? The deal states that at the end of the transition period is in December 2020, while the rest of the UK will leave all of the EU's institutions, Northern Ireland will have to keep to some of the EU's rules. In some cases it will have to charge EU taxes on certain types of goods. This situation will continue until a new agreement on the future relationship is reached, or Northern Ireland votes down the deal. Its government will have the opportunity to vote on the provisions of this deal after four years, and then at least every eight years after that.

"Demonstrators protest at the Carrickcarnon border crossing on the road between Dundalk in the Republic of Ireland and Newry in Northern Ireland The Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) bottom line has always been that any new Brexit arrangements should not separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, economically or constitutionally. Under the Stormont assembly's cross-community voting rules, contentious measures require a majority of both unionists and nationalists in order to pass. That means that the biggest parties - the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in - in effect have a veto. The DUP had hoped to secure an upfront Stormont vote to approve the new arrangements. Live: Brexit latest as PM heads to EU summit The problem that could undo the fragile deal Anti-Brexit protests held along Irish border But it's understood that the current proposals would give Stormont a say four years after the end of the transition period - that would mean 2024. A straightforward numerical majority would keep the special arrangements in place for another four years. Alternatively, if the arrangements get cross-community consent - in other words, if they're passed by most nationalists and most unionists - they would remain in place for eight years. But a vote couldn't happen if the assembly wasn't operating. The DUP's bottom line has always been that any new Brexit arrangements shouldn't separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK Presently, it hasn't sat for more than two and a half years, since Sinn FÃ©in resigned from the power-sharing devolved government. Shortly afterwards, an election left unionism without a numerical majority in the Stormont chamber for the first time in the history of Northern Ireland. Allow Twitter content?

So for the DUP, the issue of consent - and a fear that Dublin and Brussels would have too big an influence on trading rules - goes to the heart of the party's concerns that Northern Ireland's place in the UK would be weakened. Several rounds of talks to restore the Stormont Executive haven't succeeded - and few, if any, hold out hope that devolution is returning in the coming weeks. Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP continue to essentially blame each other for the ongoing deadlock. Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill - who would be in line to jointly lead the Northern Ireland Executive with Arlene Foster if devolved government came back - has re-emphasised her party's opposition to any mechanism which would allow the DUP to block Brexit plans designed to keep the border open and prevent any disruption to trade across the island of Ireland. Her tweet - ""No border and no veto"" - shows how the complexities of Stormont politics have become increasingly bound up with the UK-EU negotiations. The technical talk about Brexit and the border focuses on trade, goods regulations, and potential tariffs. But for politicians in Belfast and Dublin, the significance of those issues is generated by deeper issues - such as identity, nationality, and peacebuilding.

"The rally in the pound triggered by news of a Brexit agreement has failed to last following concerns that the deal could still be scuppered. Sterling had surged to a five-month high against the dollar, coming close to $1.30, after the UK and EU's negotiating teams agreed a deal. However, the pound began to lose ground after Northern Irish party the DUP said it would not vote for the deal. Sterling fell back below $1.28 in early afternoon before steadying again. There was a similar pattern against the euro. At first the pound jumped above â¬1.16, before falling back to stand at â¬1.1582. Worries about the possibility of the UK leaving the EU without a deal have been weighing on the value of the pound, as markets view a no-deal Brexit scenario as damaging for the UK's economy. Sterling has risen in value whenever there have been signs that a deal could be reached. Announcing news of the breakthrough in the Brexit talks, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted: ""We've got a great new deal that takes back control."" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the deal was ""a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment to find solutions"". ""I recommend that [EU summit] endorses this deal."" Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""If the Brexit deal agreed by the EU and UK earlier today passes through Parliament, then there is scope for economic growth, interest rates, gilt yields and the pound to all rise further than is widely expected."" What is in the new Brexit deal? New Brexit deal agreed, says Boris Johnson LIVE: Brexit deal latest as PM heads to EU summit How does Brexit affect the pound? The agreed deal will still need the approval of both the UK and European parliaments, but the opposition from the DUP has cast doubts on its sign-off. In a statement, the DUP, which the government relies on for support in key votes, said: ""These proposals are not, in our view, beneficial to the economic well-being of Northern Ireland and they undermine the integrity of the Union."" Analysts warned that this opposition from the DUP could scupper the deal. Michael Brown, senior analyst at Caxton, noted that ""some of the wind has been taken out of the pound's sails after reports that the DUP are not yet on board to back a deal"". ""The Parliamentary arithmetic for passing a deal looks challenging,"" he said. ""Attention will continue to focus on whether the new agreement will pass in the Commons on Saturday."" Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, said: ""Sterling is giving us the clearest indication of market sentiment on Boris Johnson's Brexit deal. ""Immediately after the deal was announced this morning, sterling rose to within a whisker of $1.30, before weakening back to around $1.28 as concerns about the DUP's lack of support took its toll. ""Negative positioning suggests that, if the deal passes on Saturday, you could see another climb in the pound to around $1.35-$1.40. ""If the deal fails on Saturday, you could see sterling re-testing lows of $1.20. Looking beyond that, if a 'no-deal Brexit' once again rears its ugly head, a level of $1.10 or below would be likely."" News of the agreement initially lifted the stock market too, but by the close, the FTSE 100 index had fallen back and closed just 0.4% higher. The prime minister wrote an open letter to British businesses following the deal's announcement, recognising business leaders' need for certainty and their preference for leaving the EU with a deal. He said his deal would provide ""the basis of a new relationship with the EU based on free trade and friendly co-operation"". ""We can now get Brexit done and leave the EU in two weeks' time, without disruption and in a friendly way,"" the letter said. Adam Marshall of the British Chambers of Commerce said many businesses would ""reserve judgement until they see the detail"", adding that firms ""need a chance to analyse precisely what the terms of this agreement would mean for all aspects of their operations"". ""Let's not forget, we've been here before,"" he added. ""There is still a long way to go before businesses can confidently plan for the future. ""For business, this deal may be the end of the beginning - but it is far from the beginning of the end of the Brexit process."" For business, pretty much anything is better than no deal so there was a ripple of cautious applause from the business audience today. Some groups, including the manufacturing lobby in Northern Ireland, specifically urged MPs to accept the deal while others, like the CBI said privately they did not want to take a political position. For most businesses, the withdrawal agreement is less important than the vision of the future sketched out be the accompanying political declaration and here there were some specific concerns. First there are huge misgivings that the 14 months left until the end of the transition period is anywhere near long enough to thrash out a future relationship, second that the services sector which makes up 80% of the UK economy is barely mentioned, and third, that the commitment to maintain close regulatory alignment between the UK and the EU has been watered down.

"A revised Brexit deal has been agreed by the UK and EU. What is in it? Most of the changes - to the deal agreed by Theresa May with EU in November 2018 - are to do with the status of the Irish border after Brexit. This issue has dominated talks for months. All sides want to avoid the return of a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit - with checks and infrastructure that could be targeted by paramilitary groups. Coming up with solutions to this - acceptable to all sides - has been very challenging. The new protocol,externalreplaces the controversial Irish backstop plan in Theresa May's deal. Much of the rest of that deal will remain. Here are some of the key new parts: The whole of the UK will leave the EU customs union. The customs union is an agreement between EU countries not to charge taxes called tariffs on things coming from other EU countries, and to charge the same tariffs as each other on things coming from outside the EU. Leaving the customs union means the UK will be able to strike trade deals with other countries in the future. Legally there will be a customs border between Northern Ireland (which stays in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (which stays in the EU), but in practice things won't be checked on that border. The actual checks will be on what is effectively a customs border between Great Britain and the island of Ireland, with goods being checked at ""points of entry"" into Northern Ireland. Taxes will only have to be paid on goods being moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland if those products are considered ""at risk"" of then being transported into the Republic of Ireland. A joint committee made up of UK and EU representatives will decide at a later date what goods are considered ""at risk"". If taxes are paid on ""at risk"" goods that do not end up being sent on from Northern Ireland into the EU, the UK would be responsible for whether to refund the money. Individual travellers won't have their baggage checked and taxes will not have to be paid by individuals sending goods to other people. Separately, there will be limits agreed by the joint committee on the amount of help the government can give to Northern Irish farmers. The figure will be based on the amount they currently receive from the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. Where have the UK and EU compromised? Brexit deal: What does it mean? Brexit: What happens now? Have UK voters changed their minds on Brexit? When it comes to the regulation of goods (that's the rules they have to follow on things like labelling and manufacturing processes) Northern Ireland would keep to EU rules rather than UK rules. That removes the need for checks on goods including food and agricultural produce at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, because both will be part of an ""all-island regulatory zone"". But it adds to the checks between the rest of the UK - which will not necessarily be sticking to EU single market rules - and Northern Ireland. This will be done by UK officials at ""points of entry"" into Northern Ireland, but the EU will have the right to have its own officials present. It seems those EU officials may be able to overrule UK officials. The agreement states that EU representatives will be able to ask UK authorities to take certain steps in individual cases and they will have to do so. Because Northern Ireland will be set apart from the rest of the UK when it comes to customs and other EU rules, the deal gives its Assembly a vote on these new arrangements. But this vote would not happen until four years after the end of the transition period (the time after Brexit when everything stays the same to allow everyone to prepare for the changes while the UK's future relationship with the EU is discussed). The transition period is due to run until at least the end of 2020. So the four-year period would run until the end of 2024. If the Northern Ireland Assembly votes against the new arrangements, they would stop applying two years later, during which time the ""joint committee"" would make recommendations to the UK and EU on what to do about this. If there were to be no agreement during this two year period, some form of hard border could re-emerge in Ireland, but it's unlikely that would be allowed to happen. If the Assembly accepts the continuing provisions by a simple majority, they will then apply for another four years. If the deal has ""cross-community support"" then they will apply for eight years. The deal defines cross-community support as more than 50% of unionist and nationalist Assembly members voting in favour, or at least 40% of members from each designation if in total at least 60% of members have voted in favour. The UK government has said that if the Northern Ireland Assembly is still not sitting at that point,it will make alternative arrangements to make sure a vote can take place.,external The new agreement says thatEU law on value added tax,external(VAT - a tax added when you make purchases) will apply in Northern Ireland, but only on goods, not services. But it also allows Northern Ireland to have different VAT rates to the rest of the UK, which would not normally be allowed under EU law. For example, if the UK decided to reduce the VAT on household fuel to zero, Northern Ireland would still have to keep it at 5%, which is the EU minimum. It also means that Northern Ireland may get the same VAT rates on certain goods as the Republic of Ireland, to stop there being an unfair advantage on either side of the border. Much of Mrs May's original Brexit deal will remain as part of the overall agreement. Some of the key areas are: The transition - a period of time during which all of the current rules stay the same allowing the UK and the EU to negotiate their future relationship - is due to last until the end of December 2020. The UK will need to abide by EU rules and pay into the EU budget, but will lose membership of its institutions. The transition can be extended, but only for a period of one or two years. Both the UK and EU must agree to any extension. UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, will retain their residency and social security rights after Brexit. Freedom of movement rules will continue to apply during transition. This means that UK nationals will be able to live and work in EU countries (and EU nationals will be able to live and work in UK) during this period. Anyone who remains in the same EU country for five years will be allowed to apply for permanent residence. (UPDATE: 13 December 2019 - This piece has been updated and reflects the delay of the Brexit date to the end of January 2020.) The UK will have to settle its financial obligations to the EU. There is no precise figure but the biggest part of this ""divorce bill"" will be the UK contributions to the EU budget until the end of the transition period at the end of 2020. When Brexit was delayed it meant that some of that money was paid as the UK's normal membership contributions, so less of it was part of the divorce bill. When the Brexit date was 31 October 2019, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)estimated,externalthat the bill was about Â£32.8bn (down from Â£39bn). To reach an estimate of what the bill would be for departure on 31 January 2020, you could subtract the Â£1.62bn thatthe OBR said,externalwas left to pay in membership fees in 2019 and 14% of the Â£10.69bn for the whole of 2020 (it's more than one twelfth because the EU usually requests a higher proportion of the contributions earlier in the year). That gives a total of just under Â£30bn. The OBR expects that most of the money - about three-quarters of the total - would be paid by 2022, with some relatively small payments still being made in the 2060s. This is addressed in the political declaration.This text, which is not legally binding, has also been revised by UK/EU negotiators.,external It says that both sides will work towards a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and a high-level meeting will happen in June 2020 to see how that work is going. The text also contains a new paragraph on the so-called ""level playing field"" - the degree to which the UK will agree to stick closely to EU regulations in the future. The references to a ""level playing field"" were removed from the legally-binding withdrawal agreement and put in the political declaration, which is not binding. It says that both sides will keep the same high standards on state aid, competition, social and employment standards, the environment, climate change, and ""relevant tax matters"".

"The value of the pound has fallen to a record low against the dollar. It has also fallen against the euro. It comes after the UK government announced large tax cuts, to be paid for by borrowing billions of pounds. The pound's value affects everyone - from shoppers to business owners and investors. This is because when the pound is worth less, the cost of goods imported from overseas goes up. For example: Gas - the price is largely based on the dollar Petrol - oil is priced in dollars, so a weak pound can make filling up your car more expensive Food prices - the UK imports46% of the food,externalit consumes Technology, like mobile phones, or cars made abroad, could get more expensive Even things made in the UK can cost more if parts are bought from other countries. And the pound's value has an impact when you travel abroad. If it buys less of the local currency, then things will be more expensive. Overall, the falling pound could increase thecost of livingby 0.5 percentage points next year, according to Samuel Tombs of research firm Pantheon Economics. What is inflation and why are living costs rising? A weak pound can, however, boost businesses which export to other countries as their goods become cheaper and more attractive to foreign buyers. Investors around the world buy and sell huge amounts of foreign currency. The aim is to profit by buying a currency that goes up in value more than the one sold. The pound plummeted on Friday after the government announced huge tax cuts in its mini-budget. It then plunged again inon Monday, reaching $1.04- the lowest level the pound has ever been against the dollar. The cause is investors selling the pound because they have doubts about the government's plans, said Jane Foley, of Rabobank. ""They're worried that some of these tax cuts that have been announced aren't going to be fully funded,"" she said. These same concerns have also pushed up the cost of government borrowing. The interest on 10-year bonds - which governments sell to investors - has risen from just over 1% in January, to more than 4% now. Some investors believe the government's tax cuts will lead to people spending more, which will push up prices. So in an effort to limit price rises, the Bank would raise interest rates sooner and faster. However, raising rates could leave people with less money, as mortgages and loans become more expensive. ""The markets have decided that [Mr] Kwarteng's tax cuts will lead to higher interest rates and that a deterioration in the public finances will undermine the UK's long-term growth prospects"", said Paul Dales from Capital Economics. The Bank of England isn't set to hold its next interest rate meeting until November, but there is speculation it could act sooner. Ina statement on Twitter,external, the Bank said it was monitoring developments and would ""not hesitate to change interest rates by as much as needed to return inflation to the 2% target"". What the rise in interest rates means for you Where does the government borrow billions from? People travelling to the US at the moment will find their pounds buy fewer dollars The dollar has also performed well against other countries' currencies. Only 24 have outperformed it since the start of the year. However, the pound has fallen more than 20% against the dollar this year, putting it among the 20 worst performing currencies. Among the currencies that have performed worse are the Argentine peso (-27%) and the Turkish lira (-29%). The euro has also fallen against the dollar, by 15% over the same period - the two currencies had the same value this year for the first time in over two decades. The pound is down against the euro over the same period. Compared with India's rupee, the pound is down by 13% since the start of the year. The fall in the pound comes after a surge in the US dollar's value; Part of the reason is down to the US being less exposed to high energy prices caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. As such, the US is considered more of a safe haven for investors. Why is the US dollar so strong? Exchange rates -the rates at which currencies are bought and sold - change constantly. They are affected by lots of things, including: Economy:Successful economies have strong currencies because other countries want to invest there. They need the local currency to do so, pushing up demand and its value Savings:If the Bank of England raises interest rates, holding savings or investments in pounds usually becomes more attractive and increases demand for sterling Prices:If UK goods are cheaper than those abroad, they are attractive to foreign businesses who need sterling to purchase them. This will tend to push up the exchange rate Public finances: The state of a government's bank balance, or how much debt it has, can also affect the exchange rate Speculation:The exchange rate is highly vulnerable to currency speculators, who buy and sell sterling based on expectations of future events What is GDP and how does it affect me?

"Jo Maugham expects the legal challenge to be heard on Friday Anti-Brexit campaigners have launched a legal bid to stop the UK government from passing its proposed EU withdrawal agreement. They believe it contravenes legislation preventing Northern Ireland forming part of a separate customs territory to Great Britain. MPs are due to debate the agreement at a special Commons sitting on Saturday. Campaigner Jo Maugham QC confirmed the petition had been lodged at Scotland's highest civil court. He expects the legal challenge to be heard on Friday. New Brexit deal agreed, says Boris Johnson Live: Brexit deal latest as PM heads to EU summit Brexit: What happens now? The move followed the earlier announcement by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker that the two sides had come to an agreement on a ""great new deal"" for Brexit, ahead of a crucial EU summit in Brussels. Mr Johnson tweeted that the new withdrawal agreement ""takes back control"" and removes the ""anti-democratic"" Irish backstop, although the Tories' Northern Irish allies in the DUP have indicated they cannot support the deal. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier revealed the deal means Northern Ireland will remain in the UK's customs territory but that the island of Ireland will be aligned to some EU rules, meaning goods must be checked on entry to the island rather than border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Mr Barnier said: ""We are fully committed to protecting peace, to protect stability on the island of Ireland,"" adding that a hard border would be avoided while protecting the integrity of the single market.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Explaining his legal objections to the agreement, Mr Maugham said it contravenes legislation stating it is ""unlawful for Her Majesty's Government to enter into arrangements under which Northern Ireland forms part of a separate customs territory to Great Britain"". Mr Maugham claims that if the court finds the proposed agreement is unlawful the government would be obliged to request an extension to Brexit negotiations, under the terms of the Benn Act. That legislation stipulates the prime minister must ask the EU for a delay if Parliament does not agree a deal by Saturday. Mr Maugham, right, and Joanna Cherry, left, were part of a group who took the prime minister to court over his decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks Under the current law, Section 55 of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018 prevents Northern Ireland from having different customs rules than the rest of the UK. This is purportedly to ""uphold the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom and safeguard the Union for the future"", according to a government briefing on the Bill. After details emerged of the Brexit deal, Mr Maugham said: ""We do not understand how the government might have come to negotiate a withdrawal agreement in terms that breach amendments tabled by its own European Research Group. ""Unless and until Section 55 is repealed by the UK Parliament, it is simply not open, as a matter of law, for the United Kingdom to enter into such an agreement. ""If the proposed withdrawal agreement is unlawful, the government will be obliged to request an extension as mandated by the Benn Act and in accordance with undertakings given to the Court of Session in Vince, Maugham, Cherry v Boris Johnson."" Mr Maugham was involved in the legal fight against Boris Johnson's decision to suspend parliament for five weeks - a move that was ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court. He was also part of the team that wants the Court of Session to rule on whether it could use aspecial power called nobile officiumto sign letter requesting an extension to the Brexit process on behalf of the government.

He said his deal would provide ""the basis of a new relationship with the EU based on free trade and friendly co-operation"". ""We can now get Brexit done and leave the EU in two weeks' time, without disruption and in a friendly way,"" the letter said. Adam Marshall of the British Chambers of Commerce said many businesses would ""reserve judgement until they see the detail"", adding that firms ""need a chance to analyse precisely what the terms of this agreement would mean for all aspects of their operations"". ""Let's not forget, we've been here before,"" he added. ""There is still a long way to go before businesses can confidently plan for the future. ""For business, this deal may be the end of the beginning - but it is far from the beginning of the end of the Brexit process."" For business, pretty much anything is better than no deal so there was a ripple of cautious applause from the business audience today. Some groups, including the manufacturing lobby in Northern Ireland, specifically urged MPs to accept the deal while others, like the CBI said privately they did not want to take a political position. For most businesses, the withdrawal agreement is less important than the vision of the future sketched out be the accompanying political declaration and here there were some specific concerns. First there are huge misgivings that the 14 months left until the end of the transition period is anywhere near long enough to thrash out a future relationship, second that the services sector which makes up 80% of the UK economy is barely mentioned, and third, that the commitment to maintain close regulatory alignment between the UK and the EU has been watered down.

"This video can not be played Johnson: This is a very good deal Boris Johnson and EU leaders have hailed the deal they have struck to take the UK out of the bloc on 31 October in an ""orderly"" fashion. The prime minister now faces a battle to get the deal through Parliament on Saturday, with the DUP opposing it. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds accused Mr Johnson of being ""too eager by far to get a deal at any cost"". European Council President Donald Tusk did not rule out an extension to the Brexit deadline if MPs rejected it. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker earlier said: ""We have a deal so why should we have a prolongation."" LIVE: Brexit deal latest What is in the new Brexit deal? DUP 'unable to vote' for PM's new Brexit deal Brexit deal: Your questions answered Kuennsberg: Johnson still facing an almighty gamble But his Brussels colleagues have been more cautious, with Mr Tusk saying he would ""consult"" the leaders of EU member states about a possible extension if one was requested by the UK. He said Boris Johnson's acceptance of customs checks at the point of entry into Northern Ireland, which the DUP objects to, had made a deal possible. Mr Johnson has repeatedly insisted the UK will leave the EU on 31 October and he urged MPs to ""come together"" and ""get this excellent deal over the line"". He added: ""Now is the moment for us to get Brexit done and then together work on building our future partnership, which I think can be incredibly positive both for the UK and for the EU."" The EU and UK negotiating teams worked round-the-clock on the legal text of the deal, but it will still need the approval of both the UK and European parliaments. In a statement, the Democratic Unionist Party, which the government relies on for support in key votes, said: ""These proposals are not, in our view, beneficial to the economic well-being of Northern Ireland and they undermine the integrity of the Union."" The DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds criticised Mr Johnson, telling BBC News: ""If he'd held his nerve - and held out - he would, of course, have got better concessions which kept the integrity, both economic and constitutional, of the UK."" He said he expected a ""massive vote"" against Mr Johnson's deal on Saturday in the House of Commons - and the DUP expected to ""play a crucial role"" in amending the legislation. The winning post for votes in the House of Commons is 320 if everyone turns up - seven Sinn Fein MPs don't sit and the Speaker and three deputies don't vote. There are currently 287 voting Conservative MPs. The prime minister needs to limit any rebellion among them. Then, if the DUP won't support his deal, he'll need the backing of 23 former Conservative MPs who are currently independents. Most will probably support the deal, but not all. That's still not quite enough, though, so the PM will also need the backing of some Labour MPs and ex-Labour independents. In March, when MPs voted on Theresa May's deal for the third time, five Labour MPs backed it, plus two ex-Labour independents. This time it's likely to be a bit higher than that because several MPs have said they would now back a deal. All this still leaves the vote very close. And it's possible some MPs could abstain, making it even harder to predict the outcome. Most of the deal is the same as the one agreed by Theresa May last year - the main change is the Northern Ireland proposal. The UK will continue to abide by EU rules until the end of 2020, and possibly longer, to allow businesses to adjust The UK will still pay an estimated Â£33bn ""divorce bill"" The rights of EU citizens living in the UK, and UK citizens in the EU, will be guaranteed What's changed? Northern Ireland will be aligned to the EU single market Thecontroversial ""backstop""- that critics feared could have kept the UK in a customs union with the EU indefinitely - has been removed Northern Ireland will instead remain a part of the UK's customs territory, so it will be included in any future trade deals struck by the government after Brexit But Northern Ireland will also remain an entry point into the EU's customs zone. The UK will not apply tariffs to products entering Northern Ireland as long as they are not destined for onward transportation across the border A joint EU/UK committee will decide which goods are at risk of entering the single market and the UK will collect EU tariffs on them on behalf of the EU The Northern Ireland Assembly - which has been suspended since January 2017 - will get a vote every four years on whether to continue with the new trading arrangements The decision would be based on a simple majority, rather than requiring a majority of both unionists and nationalists to support the rules in order for them to pass This video can not be played Barnier: This text should provide certainty In a statement, the Democratic Unionists said Northern Ireland's main East-West trade route would still be subject to EU customs rules, ""notwithstanding that Northern Ireland will remain part of the UK customs territory"". ""All goods would be subject to a customs check regime regardless of their final destination,"" the statement added, and the plan for a joint EU/UK committee would give the EU a ""veto"" on which goods would be exempt from tariffs or not. Consent issue at heart of DUP Brexit deal concern Brexit deal would make Wales poorer - Drakeford Sturgeon says PM's deal means 'much harder Brexit' ""This is not acceptable within the internal borders of the United Kingdom,"" the DUP said. They expressed concerns Northern Ireland consumers would face increased costs and less choice, and Northern Ireland would also be subject to different VAT arrangements to the rest of the UK. ""Some progress"" had been made on democratic consent for the deal, it went on, but the idea of giving the Assembly a vote on the new arrangements that could be won by a ""simple majority"" violated the Good Friday Agreement, which demands the backing of both unionists and nationalists. While Boris Johnson may have a deal in Brussels, he absolutely does not have a deal in Westminster. The DUP isn't prepared to back this package because it does not give it a veto over the new customs arrangement, which it fears could threaten Northern Ireland's position in the United Kingdom. Team Johnson hopes that, by presenting this as a choice between Mr Johnson's deal and no-deal, the DUP will buckle. But the DUP doesn't blink easily, and if it doesn't, the signs are Mr Johnson could be defeated on Saturday, when the party's 10 votes could be critical. That could trigger the Benn Act, forcing a lengthy delay, and could encourage some opposition MP to trigger a motion of no confidence, paving the way for a general election. It's going to be a titanic tussle on Saturday. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the deal sounded ""even worse"" than the one negotiated by the PM's predecessor, Theresa May, and ""should be rejected"" by MPs. MPs have voted to hold an extra sitting in the Commons on Saturday to discuss the next steps. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the government would hold a vote on the deal and was not ""not contemplating defeat"". But, he added, if the plan did not get the backing of MPs, the alternative was leaving without a deal. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said he and Mr Juncker had been told by the PM that ""he has faith in his ability to convince the majority he needs in the House of Commons"". Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage called for the deal to be rejected by Parliament, saying it would mean ""we will not be making our own laws in our own country"". Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said: ""The next few days will set the direction of our country for generations, and I am more determined than ever to stop Brexit."" MPs passed a law in September that requires the PM to request an extension on 19 October if Parliament has not agreed a deal or backed leaving without a deal by that date.

The EU and UK reached a new withdrawal agreement, which has been hailed by European leaders as a significant step. But the deal still has to get past Parliament. The deal ditches former PM Theresa May's backstop, the measure designed to prevent a return to physical checks on the Irish border.

Up their sleeve, of course, is the possibility of another Brexit extension. EU leaders today were very coy about that - they are not enthusiastic about the idea and they want to keep the pressure on MPs to really focus their minds. But if this deal, like Theresa May's deal agreed with EU leaders, fails to get through the House of Commons, and if there were a request from the UK for another Brexit extension, then these EU leaders, after three years of Brexit process -  two Brexit deals - are not going to turn around and say no to the UK if this extension would be for a general election, a second referendum or a referendum on this deal. Newsnight Veteran Labour MP Ronnie Campbell, who voted against Theresa May's deal three times and is standing down at the next election, says he is minded to back the PM's deal. Asked whether he will back it at the vote on Saturday, he replies: ""Yes, I think so"". ""I think this country's just fed up the way Parliament's run this for the last three years,"" he says.

"Christian Dior has become the latest foreign brand to apologise to China after it used a map that Beijing sees as misrepresenting its territory. The French luxury brand was criticised on Chinese social media after an employee reportedly used a China map in a presentation that excluded Taiwan. Taiwan has been self-ruled since the 1950s, but Beijing's official policy is that the island is a Chinese province. Dior apologised for the ""mistake in representation"" made by an employee. Brand 'witch hunt' takes over Chinese internet Vietnam pulls film over South China Sea map The row broke out after a video was posted online anonymously claiming to show a Dior employee giving a talk at a university in China and showing the map. It sparked a huge reaction on social media, as people complained that Dior was not respecting Chinese territorial claims. ""Dior statement"" was one of the top 10 most searched items on Weibo on Thursday. ""The company firstly deeply apologises for the incident on 16 October 2019 where a member of the Dior HR team was... giving a presentation when [the employee] made a mistake in representation and gave an incorrect explanation,"" the company said in its statement. Christian Dior said it had done a ""diligent investigation"", adding it would ""seriously handle"" the matter. ""Dior has always respected and upheld the principle of one China, strictly upholding China's rights and complete sovereignty, treasuring the feelings of Chinese citizens,"" it added. Versace apologises after T-shirt angers China Swarovski apologises to China over Hong Kong error In recent years, Chinese social media users have aggressively been pursuing companies which they believe are challenging China's territorial claims. China is a huge market for luxury brands, so they are keen not to risk negative PR or a boycott by offending Chinese consumers. Versace apologised in Augustafter an image on one of its T-shirts appeared to imply Hong Kong and Macau were independent territories. Coach and Givenchy have also faced a backlash recently over the representation of Chinese territories on some of their garments. Airlines and hotel chains have also had to apologise after listing Taiwan as a separate country on their booking menus, not as part of China. Earlier this week, Vietnam banned the animated movie Abominable over another map row. The film, the first tie-in between Dreamworks and China's Pearl Studio, briefly displayed a map that showed areas of the South China Sea claimed by Vietnam as being Chinese territory.

"The rally in the pound triggered by news of a Brexit agreement has failed to last following concerns that the deal could still be scuppered. Sterling had surged to a five-month high against the dollar, coming close to $1.30, after the UK and EU's negotiating teams agreed a deal. However, the pound began to lose ground after Northern Irish party the DUP said it would not vote for the deal. Sterling fell back below $1.28 in early afternoon before steadying again. There was a similar pattern against the euro. At first the pound jumped above â¬1.16, before falling back to stand at â¬1.1582. Worries about the possibility of the UK leaving the EU without a deal have been weighing on the value of the pound, as markets view a no-deal Brexit scenario as damaging for the UK's economy. Sterling has risen in value whenever there have been signs that a deal could be reached. Announcing news of the breakthrough in the Brexit talks, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted: ""We've got a great new deal that takes back control."" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the deal was ""a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment to find solutions"". ""I recommend that [EU summit] endorses this deal."" Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""If the Brexit deal agreed by the EU and UK earlier today passes through Parliament, then there is scope for economic growth, interest rates, gilt yields and the pound to all rise further than is widely expected."" What is in the new Brexit deal? New Brexit deal agreed, says Boris Johnson LIVE: Brexit deal latest as PM heads to EU summit How does Brexit affect the pound? The agreed deal will still need the approval of both the UK and European parliaments, but the opposition from the DUP has cast doubts on its sign-off. In a statement, the DUP, which the government relies on for support in key votes, said: ""These proposals are not, in our view, beneficial to the economic well-being of Northern Ireland and they undermine the integrity of the Union."" Analysts warned that this opposition from the DUP could scupper the deal. Michael Brown, senior analyst at Caxton, noted that ""some of the wind has been taken out of the pound's sails after reports that the DUP are not yet on board to back a deal"". ""The Parliamentary arithmetic for passing a deal looks challenging,"" he said. ""Attention will continue to focus on whether the new agreement will pass in the Commons on Saturday."" Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, said: ""Sterling is giving us the clearest indication of market sentiment on Boris Johnson's Brexit deal. ""Immediately after the deal was announced this morning, sterling rose to within a whisker of $1.30, before weakening back to around $1.28 as concerns about the DUP's lack of support took its toll. ""Negative positioning suggests that, if the deal passes on Saturday, you could see another climb in the pound to around $1.35-$1.40. ""If the deal fails on Saturday, you could see sterling re-testing lows of $1.20. Looking beyond that, if a 'no-deal Brexit' once again rears its ugly head, a level of $1.10 or below would be likely."" News of the agreement initially lifted the stock market too, but by the close, the FTSE 100 index had fallen back and closed just 0.4% higher. The prime minister wrote an open letter to British businesses following the deal's announcement, recognising business leaders' need for certainty and their preference for leaving the EU with a deal. He said his deal would provide ""the basis of a new relationship with the EU based on free trade and friendly co-operation"".

"The UK and EU have agreed what Boris Johnson says is a ""great new deal"" for Brexit European Commission President says the deal is ""a fair and balanced agreement"" UK PM says the agreement ""represents a very good deal for the EU and the UK"" It now needs the approval of the UK and European parliaments Johnson 'very confident' MPs will back deal The support of the DUP is seen as crucial if the PM is to win Parliament's approval However, the DUP says it will not vote for it A pivotal day in Brussels then - here's a recap of what happened. The EU and UK reached a new withdrawal agreement, which has been hailed by European leaders as a significant step. But the deal still has to get past Parliament. The deal ditches former PM Theresa May's backstop, the measure designed to prevent a return to physical checks on the Irish border. Instead it will, in effect, draw a new customs border down the Irish Sea. Boris Johnson is insisting he is confident that MPs will back the deal when MPs sit on Saturday, even though his key allies, Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, plan to vote against it. Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP also say they are opposed. We are going to bring our live coverage to an end here - but ournews storywill continue to be updated with the latest developments. And you canread about the revised dealin this piece from the BBC Reality check team.   Katya AdlerEurope Editor If you have a look at Boris Johnson with the EU leaders there was a lot of back slapping, there was a lot of bonhomie. And it completely belies the fact that, underneath, those EU leaders are very sceptical when the prime minister said to them ""I've got the numbers in Parliament to pass this deal""... Up their sleeve, of course, is the possibility of another Brexit extension. EU leaders today were very coy about that - they are not enthusiastic about the idea and they want to keep the pressure on MPs to really focus their minds. But if this deal, like Theresa May's deal agreed with EU leaders, fails to get through the House of Commons, and if there were a request from the UK for another Brexit extension, then these EU leaders, after three years of Brexit process -  two Brexit deals - are not going to turn around and say no to the UK if this extension would be for a general election, a second referendum or a referendum on this deal. Newsnight Veteran Labour MP Ronnie Campbell, who voted against Theresa May's deal three times and is standing down at the next election, says he is minded to back the PM's deal. Asked whether he will back it at the vote on Saturday, he replies: ""Yes, I think so"". ""I think this country's just fed up the way Parliament's run this for the last three years,"" he says. ""It's time we got round the table, and got a deal, and got it through"". BBC political editor tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Daily Telegraph The i Mark Field, the Tory MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, has announced he will not be standing in the next general election - citing disagreements over Brexit. Mr Field says his beliefs ""stand at odds with the current administration's impatient approach to getting Brexit done"". Mr Field, who was sacked as a minister for grabbing a Greenpeace activist in June, adds he would prefer the UK to remain ""in or very closely aligned to the EU"". Read more here  Metro The pound is trading up on the day - but a surge in the currency triggered by news of the Brexit agreement failed to last, amid concerns that the deal could still be scuppered. Sterling rose to a five-month high against the dollar, coming close to $1.30, soon after the UK and EU's negotiating teams agreed a deal. It then began to lose ground after the DUP said it would not vote for the deal and by early afternoon, sterling had fallen back below $1.28. It later regained momentum to trade at $1.2863, up 0.26% on the day. There was a similar pattern against the euro. At first the pound jumped above â¬1.16, before falling back to â¬1.1576.

"Knife crime in England and Wales has increased again, according to the latest figures from police forces. In the 12 months to the end of June 2019, knife crime offences rose by 7%, reaching a record high. But the picture on knife crime is mixed - with a fall in the number of homicides related to knife crime. The data, from the Office for National Statistics, also found a 11% rise in the number of recorded robberies, while fraud offences went up by 15%. According to the ONS, which publishedits latest figures,externalon Thursday, the number of offences involving a knife or sharp instrument increased from just over 41,000 in the year to June 2018 to just over 44,000 in the last 12 months. The knife crime figures do not include Greater Manchester Police, because of a previous problem with their recording methods. It marks a new record level since 2011, the year that knife crime statistics started to be gathered in a unified way. Why are fewer crimes being solved? What is knife crime like in your area? But the ONS added: ""The number of homicides where a knife or sharp instrument was involved decreased by 14%. ""This decrease was mainly driven by falls in London. ""There is a mixed picture in the total number of offences involving knifes or sharp instruments across different police force areas, with the Metropolitan Police recording little change in the last year."" The total number of homicides recorded by the police also fell by 5% in the last year, from 719 to 681 offences. Meanwhile, a separate Crime Survey for England and Wales, which includes offences that are not reported to police, indicated a continuing rise in fraud. The survey's latest estimates show a 15% increase in fraud offences, driven by a 17% rise in ""bank and credit account fraud"". It said there were 3,863,000 fraud offences in the year to June. Almost 2.7m of those were bank and credit account fraud offences, up from 2.3m the previous year. But the survey, which measures people's experience of crime, found fewer than one in six incidents of fraud were reported by the victim to the police or Action Fraud in the last 12 months ending March 2019. Click here to take part,externalin a short study about this article run by the University of Cambridge. On the positive side, there are signs the surge in knife crime may be slowing. The rate of increase is half what it was a year ago; the Metropolitan Police, which accounts for a third of the total, recorded only 17 more offences; and there were were 39 fewer fatal stabbings than in the previous 12 months. However, there is still a long way to go - as shown by a continuing rise in the number of knifepoint rapes, robberies and assaults logged by forces. Arguably of greater significance are figures which show a steep downward trend in crimes that are solved. The way the data was compiled changed in 2015. Then, 15.5% of cases resulted in a suspect being charged or brought to court. Now, it's 7.4%. The key reason for the slump in detections appears to be that victims are increasingly unwilling to support prosecutions: it means more offenders escape justice, free to commit more crimes. The ONS figures include two sources of data: Home Office statistics about crimes recorded by police; and also the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which asks people about their experiences of crime. On its own, police recorded crime is not seen as a complete picture of crime in England and Wales. The crime survey provides an estimate of crimes that may either have not been recorded by police or may never have been reported to them in the first place. The crime survey selects about 50,000 households at random from the Royal Mail's list of addresses. Read more:How accurate are police crime figures? Meanwhile, separately,other Home Office data,externalshows the number of crimes solved across England and Wales has fallen to another record low. Figures show just 7.4% of crimes in the 12 months to the end of June resulted in a suspect being charged or ordered to appear in court. The previous year the figure was 8.7%, and the figure in the 12 months to March 2019 was 7.8%. Responding to Thursday's statistics, Merseyside Police Chief Constable Andy Cooke, of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said the figures were a ""symptom of the strain on policing as we try to manage growing crime, and demand that is ever more complex"". Meanwhile, the government's crime, policing and fire minister Kit Malthouse said he was ""deeply concerned"" at the rise of certain crimes, particularly knife crime. ""All of us involved, from the police to local and national government, must confront this challenge head on,"" he said, adding that the government was ""making progress...but there is a lot more to do"". ""It's also vital that we divert young people away from committing crime in the first place, which is why we are investing over Â£220 million into early intervention projects and placing a duty on public bodies to work together to tackle youth violence,"" he said.

"Christian Dior has become the latest foreign brand to apologise to China after it used a map that Beijing sees as misrepresenting its territory. The French luxury brand was criticised on Chinese social media after an employee reportedly used a China map in a presentation that excluded Taiwan. Taiwan has been self-ruled since the 1950s, but Beijing's official policy is that the island is a Chinese province. Dior apologised for the ""mistake in representation"" made by an employee. Brand 'witch hunt' takes over Chinese internet Vietnam pulls film over South China Sea map The row broke out after a video was posted online anonymously claiming to show a Dior employee giving a talk at a university in China and showing the map. It sparked a huge reaction on social media, as people complained that Dior was not respecting Chinese territorial claims. ""Dior statement"" was one of the top 10 most searched items on Weibo on Thursday. ""The company firstly deeply apologises for the incident on 16 October 2019 where a member of the Dior HR team was... giving a presentation when [the employee] made a mistake in representation and gave an incorrect explanation,"" the company said in its statement. Christian Dior said it had done a ""diligent investigation"", adding it would ""seriously handle"" the matter. ""Dior has always respected and upheld the principle of one China, strictly upholding China's rights and complete sovereignty, treasuring the feelings of Chinese citizens,"" it added. Versace apologises after T-shirt angers China Swarovski apologises to China over Hong Kong error In recent years, Chinese social media users have aggressively been pursuing companies which they believe are challenging China's territorial claims. China is a huge market for luxury brands, so they are keen not to risk negative PR or a boycott by offending Chinese consumers. Versace apologised in Augustafter an image on one of its T-shirts appeared to imply Hong Kong and Macau were independent territories. Coach and Givenchy have also faced a backlash recently over the representation of Chinese territories on some of their garments. Airlines and hotel chains have also had to apologise after listing Taiwan as a separate country on their booking menus, not as part of China. Earlier this week, Vietnam banned the animated movie Abominable over another map row. The film, the first tie-in between Dreamworks and China's Pearl Studio, briefly displayed a map that showed areas of the South China Sea claimed by Vietnam as being Chinese territory.

"This video can not be played One eyewitness captured the moment a climate protester was dragged from top of Tube train Commuters have dragged climate change protesters from the roof of a London Underground train. Extinction Rebellion activists climbed on to trains at Stratford, Canning Town and Shadwell in Thursday's rush hour. Eight protesters have been arrested, British Transport Police (BTP) said. The Jubilee Line and Docklands Light Railway were temporarily suspended. Extinction Rebellion later said it would ""take stock"" of the reaction to the latest action for future protests. Spokesman Howard Rees said: ""Was it the right thing to do? I am not sure. ""I think we will have to have a period of reflection. It is too early to say."" Extinction Rebellion previously said the disruption was ""necessary to highlight the emergency"". Protesters climbed to the top of a train carriage at Shadwell station Hayden Green, a commuter at Canning Town, said he saw the protester ""dragged to the floor and kicked repeatedly"". ""Police have struggled to deal with the protest in London so the public stepped in and in the heat of the moment it was taken too far,"" he told the BBC. ""I support their cause but I think how the protests have been carried out has led to more divisions."" Hayden Green said violence broke out after a protester tried to ""kick a commuter"" In footage shared on social media, a passenger waiting for a train is seen climbing on the carriage to get to one of the protesters. The activist is grabbed by the knees and dragged down, falling to the platform where he appears to then be kicked and hit by angry commuters on the platform. Others can be heard shouting and swearing at the protesters. One shouts: ""I have to get to work too - I have to feed my kids."" Extinction Rebellion protesters climb on to a Jubilee line train at Canning Town station A second protester was chased along the top of the train carriage by a commuter before being dragged off. A third Extinction Rebellion activist, who was broadcasting the protest on the group's social media accounts, said he was also attacked and ""kicked in the head"". BTP said it was investigating what happened at Canning Town station, adding it was ""concerning to see that a number of commuters took matters into their own hands, displaying violent behaviour to detain a protester"". Ithas appealed for anyone with information,external, pictures or mobile phone footage of any of the incidents to upload them to its website. Assistant Chief Constable Sean O'Callaghan said: ""It is important that commuters and other rail users allow the police, who are specially trained, to manage these incidents.Â Â ""Unfortunately, there is still a risk that Extinction Rebellion will target the rail network during this evening's peak. We will continue to have extra officers on patrol and will work to disrupt any potential criminal action before it happens."" By Justin Rowlatt, BBC chief environment correspondent Today's Extinction Rebellion action against London's public transport network represents a significant escalation of its strategy of ""disruption"". It is one thing to stage a colourful protest in a few roads in Whitehall, quite another to target the Tubes and trains that so many Londoners rely on to get them to work on time. Many commuters were left scratching their heads this morning, bewildered by an environmental protest that targeted one of the most environmentally-friendly ways to travel. The tactic has been the subject of much discussion within Extinction Rebellion - a loose affiliation of interested groups and individuals. A poll among members taken yesterday suggests the vast majority were against any action targeting the London Underground. Out of 3,800 votes, 72% said they were opposed to any action against Tube trains and 14% were against the idea if people could get blocked underground. Perhaps not surprisingly, the decision to go ahead has upset many members - as well as commuters - and for good reason. Tackling climate change will be easier if there is a consensus that action is necessary. The Extinction Rebellion activists behind this action will want to consider whether gluing yourself to a train is really the best way to build that consensus. At Shadwell station several activists glued themselves to trains, including 83-year-old Phil Kingston. In April, Extinction Rebellion protesters also glued themselves to a DLR train at Canary Wharf, causing minor delays. ""If XR wants to make an inclusive movement, these tactics on public transport at rush hour won't get them far,"" Ana Zarraga told the BBC. The 35-year-old, who was prevented from catching her train at Shadwell, said: ""The bankers and the CEOs of the most polluting industries are certainly not travelling on the DLR at 07.00 BST."" Protesters clashed with commuters at Shadwell, Docklands Light Railway station Earlier Extinction Rebellion co-founder Clare Farrell defended the Tube action, saying ""the public, I don't think, realise quite how serious this situation is"". What is Extinction Rebellion and what does it want? She added: ""Someone has been hurt today. We understand that putting ourselves in these positions is potentially dangerous for us. ""But what else can we do?"" The protester who appeared to try to kick a commuter acted ""in self defence in a moment of panic when confronted by a threatening situation,"" Extinction Rebellion said. ""He acknowledges his accountability for this action,"" it said. The group has invited the commuters involved in today's protest ""to have a conversation"" about what happened. At Shadwell station, one of the protesters who had glued themselves to trains was 83-year-old Phil Kingston Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said in a statement: ""I strongly condemn the Extinction Rebellion protesters who have targeted the London Underground and DLR this morning. ""This illegal action is extremely dangerous, counterproductive and is causing unacceptable disruption to Londoners who use public transport to get to work."" Train drivers' union Aslef said the Tube and other public transport services were ""part of the solution to climate change, not the problem"". Extinction Rebellion should ""stick to protesting against those who create the problem - not our industry, members and hard-working commuters"", the union added. A public order ban,externalhas been put in place on Extinction Rebellion activities in London since Monday. At the High Court a judge has refused the request to hear Extinction Rebellion's appeal against the ban early. The group wanted a hearing before the scheduled end of the protest on 19 October.

"The two economic giants have been fighting a trade war over the past year Chinese diplomats in the US will have to notify American authorities before holding any meetings with US officials. Official visits to ""educational and research institutions"", such as schools and universities, must also be pre-registered, the state department said. China said the US was breaking international rules - but the US said American diplomats in China faced similar restrictions. The move comes amid heightened tensions between both countries. The rules would apply to ""official meetings with [US] state officials, official meetings with local and municipal officials, official visits to educational institutions, and official visits to research institutions"", the state department said. An official said the US was merely ""levelling the playing field"" with China, and that it was a response to Chinese restrictions on American diplomats. ""In China, US diplomats do not have unfettered access to a range of folks that are important for us to do our job here. ""In contrast, [Chinese] diplomats in the US are of course,able to take full advantage of our open society,"",externalsaid a senior state department official. US officials said Chinese diplomats did not need permission for the meetings, but were required to notify the state department in advance. The eventual goal, said the official, would be for ""these requirements and the requirements on US diplomats in China [to] both be disbanded."" In a statement on Thursday, the Chinese Embassy in US called the new rules a ""violation of the Vienna Convention"". ""The Chinese side does not have similar requirements on American diplomats and consular officers in China,"" it insisted. It added: ""As for reciprocity, the US has a far greater number of diplomatic personnel in China than China has in the US."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The UK and EU have agreed what Boris Johnson says is a ""great new deal"" for Brexit European Commission President says the deal is ""a fair and balanced agreement"" UK PM says the agreement ""represents a very good deal for the EU and the UK"" It now needs the approval of the UK and European parliaments Johnson 'very confident' MPs will back deal The support of the DUP is seen as crucial if the PM is to win Parliament's approval However, the DUP says it will not vote for it A pivotal day in Brussels then - here's a recap of what happened. The EU and UK reached a new withdrawal agreement, which has been hailed by European leaders as a significant step. But the deal still has to get past Parliament. The deal ditches former PM Theresa May's backstop, the measure designed to prevent a return to physical checks on the Irish border. Instead it will, in effect, draw a new customs border down the Irish Sea. Boris Johnson is insisting he is confident that MPs will back the deal when MPs sit on Saturday, even though his key allies, Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, plan to vote against it. Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP also say they are opposed. We are going to bring our live coverage to an end here - but ournews storywill continue to be updated with the latest developments. And you canread about the revised dealin this piece from the BBC Reality check team.   Katya AdlerEurope Editor If you have a look at Boris Johnson with the EU leaders there was a lot of back slapping, there was a lot of bonhomie. And it completely belies the fact that, underneath, those EU leaders are very sceptical when the prime minister said to them ""I've got the numbers in Parliament to pass this deal""... Up their sleeve, of course, is the possibility of another Brexit extension. EU leaders today were very coy about that - they are not enthusiastic about the idea and they want to keep the pressure on MPs to really focus their minds. But if this deal, like Theresa May's deal agreed with EU leaders, fails to get through the House of Commons, and if there were a request from the UK for another Brexit extension, then these EU leaders, after three years of Brexit process -  two Brexit deals - are not going to turn around and say no to the UK if this extension would be for a general election, a second referendum or a referendum on this deal. Newsnight Veteran Labour MP Ronnie Campbell, who voted against Theresa May's deal three times and is standing down at the next election, says he is minded to back the PM's deal. Asked whether he will back it at the vote on Saturday, he replies: ""Yes, I think so"". ""I think this country's just fed up the way Parliament's run this for the last three years,"" he says. ""It's time we got round the table, and got a deal, and got it through"". BBC political editor tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Daily Telegraph The i Mark Field, the Tory MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, has announced he will not be standing in the next general election - citing disagreements over Brexit. Mr Field says his beliefs ""stand at odds with the current administration's impatient approach to getting Brexit done"". Mr Field, who was sacked as a minister for grabbing a Greenpeace activist in June, adds he would prefer the UK to remain ""in or very closely aligned to the EU"". Read more here  Metro The pound is trading up on the day - but a surge in the currency triggered by news of the Brexit agreement failed to last, amid concerns that the deal could still be scuppered. Sterling rose to a five-month high against the dollar, coming close to $1.30, soon after the UK and EU's negotiating teams agreed a deal. It then began to lose ground after the DUP said it would not vote for the deal and by early afternoon, sterling had fallen back below $1.28. It later regained momentum to trade at $1.2863, up 0.26% on the day. There was a similar pattern against the euro. At first the pound jumped above â¬1.16, before falling back to â¬1.1576.

"The two economic giants have been fighting a trade war over the past year Chinese diplomats in the US will have to notify American authorities before holding any meetings with US officials. Official visits to ""educational and research institutions"", such as schools and universities, must also be pre-registered, the state department said. China said the US was breaking international rules - but the US said American diplomats in China faced similar restrictions. The move comes amid heightened tensions between both countries. The rules would apply to ""official meetings with [US] state officials, official meetings with local and municipal officials, official visits to educational institutions, and official visits to research institutions"", the state department said. An official said the US was merely ""levelling the playing field"" with China, and that it was a response to Chinese restrictions on American diplomats. ""In China, US diplomats do not have unfettered access to a range of folks that are important for us to do our job here. ""In contrast, [Chinese] diplomats in the US are of course,able to take full advantage of our open society,"",externalsaid a senior state department official. US officials said Chinese diplomats did not need permission for the meetings, but were required to notify the state department in advance. The eventual goal, said the official, would be for ""these requirements and the requirements on US diplomats in China [to] both be disbanded."" In a statement on Thursday, the Chinese Embassy in US called the new rules a ""violation of the Vienna Convention"". ""The Chinese side does not have similar requirements on American diplomats and consular officers in China,"" it insisted. It added: ""As for reciprocity, the US has a far greater number of diplomatic personnel in China than China has in the US."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"There are two lighthouses at Dovercourt at risk of being lost, according to Historic England A cliff lift, a railway viaduct and a pair of lighthouses have been added to a list of sites at risk of being lost. Historic England has added 247 sites to its At Risk Register but 310 have been removed as they were regarded as saved. The 134-year-old Leas Lift in Folkestone, England's oldest surviving timber trestle railway bridge in Maldon and both Dovercourt Lighthouses in Harwich are on the list. A well in London, a lead mine and a Georgian warship have been removed. St Andrew's Church in Sunderland has been removed from the At Risk Register Historic England praised those who had ""lovingly cared for"" and ""brought back to life"" empty buildings and ""valued historic places"". Chief executive Duncan Wilson said: ""The message is clear - our heritage needs to be saved and investing in heritage pays. ""There are buildings still on the register that can be rescued and can be brought back to beneficial use and generate an income, contributing to the local community and economy."" Sites considered saved in the past year included: Congregational Chapel in Roxton, Bedfordshire Physic Well in Barnet, north London Church of St Bride in Fleet Street, central London Moseley School of Artin Birmingham Potternewton Mansion in Leeds HMS Invincible, the wreck of an 18th Century navy ship, off Horse and Dean Sand in The Solent Former Providence Chapel in Charlwood, Surrey Carrshield lead mines and ore works, North Pennines St Andrew's Church in Sunderland Hooton Hangars, RAF hangars in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire  5,073English sites on 2019 register 2,375Grade I and II* listed buildings and places of worship 2,089Archaeological sites 501Conservation areas 102Parks and gardens 6Battlefields and wreck sites New sites at risk included: Believed to be unique examples of 19th century prefabricated lighthouses, the two towers off the Essex coast are a ""well-regarded"" feature of the deep water harbour but they are deteriorating. A survey was carried out in 2018 with a view to repair work commencing over the next two years. The oldest surviving timber trestle railway bridge in England, the structure at Wickham Bishops, also in Essex, comprises two adjoining viaducts and was part of the Braintree to Maldon branch line between 1848 and 1966. Despite extensive repairs in the 1990s, many timbers are suffering from rot and decay caused by damp, lack of maintenance and heavy tree growth. The Grade II* listed funicular railway in Kent was built in 1885 and is one of only three remaining water-balanced lifts in the UK. It closed in January 2017 because of safety issues with the braking system, since when the building, tracks and machinery have degraded further. A trust has been formed to manage the building with the hope of reopening the lift in 2023. The military complex was constructed as a major depot for arms and ammunition during the Napoleonic Wars and included barracks and a military prison. It would have served as a refuge for the king and government if Napoleon had invaded and remained a main supplier of arms and clothing to the British Army until the 1960s. Part of the site in Northamptonshire has been refurbished and Historic England has funded a survey to see what can be done with the rest. This ""much-loved landmark"" was built in 1827 for writer William Beckford to house his collection of art, books and furniture. He was buried at the tower and the surrounding Lansdown Cemetery has also been put on the register because of the poor condition of some of its main features. The Bath Preservation Trust acquired the tower in 1993 and carried out extensive repairs, opening the building to the public in 2001. It is now preparing for another phase of major repairs, which is dependent on fundraising. This area was the first to be developed beyond Leeds' medieval boundaries in the 1600s and was transformed by cloth merchant John Harrison, who also funded the construction of St John's Church, the oldest church in the city centre, in 1630. Buildings from each following century remain today, including the Victorian Grand Theatre, but heavy traffic, empty shops and loss of architectural details have left it looking ""down at heel"", Historic England said. The Grand Quarter has recently been chosen as a High Street Heritage Action Zone with Historic England funding due to help revive and improve the area's ""special character"".
