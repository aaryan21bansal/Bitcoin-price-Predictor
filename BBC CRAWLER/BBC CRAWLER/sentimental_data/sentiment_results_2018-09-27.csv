"Ford supporters in Washington As the female professor who has accused US Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault gives her testimony, women across the US have been reacting on social media. Many who support Christine Blasey Ford, speaking publicly for the first time, drew attention to what they see as a historic moment for women's rights. But those who back Mr Kavanaugh wrote that Ms Ford was acting throughout her testimony, and suggested her accusation was part of a Democratic plot to derail the judge's confirmation to the Senate. Law students tweeted pictures of empty classrooms as they gathering around television screens, while #KavanaughHearings trended globally. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Christine Blasey Ford said she was ""100%"" sure Brett Kavanaugh assaulted her With a seat on the Supreme Court hanging in the balance, Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh appeared in front of senators to state their case and share their stories. Here are four key takeaways from a day of seldom-matched drama at the US Capitol. Everyone knew what Christine Blasey Ford was going to say before the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday morning. Knowing what she was going to say and hearing her speak it, in a quiet, sometimes faltering voice, are two very different things, however. For a taut 20 minutes, Dr Ford held the stage with searing emotion. She spoke of traumatic memories and decades of shame; of a civic duty to come forward; and recent months of hounding media and death threats. During questioning from Democratic senators, Dr Ford went on to provide more memorable lines. She said she was 100% certain that Brett - referring to Mr Kavanaugh repeatedly by his first name - was the teenager who assaulted her. This video can not be played 'Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me yelling' She recounted how the enduring recollection she has from the incident, burned into her brain, was of Mr Kavanaugh and his friend, Mark Judge, laughing as they stumbled down the stairs after the alleged attack. The images of her speaking - the first glimpse the public at large has had of her besides a few grainy photos - will linger well beyond Thursday's hearing or even Brett Kavanaugh's ultimate professional fate. Her name, like that of Anita Hill 27 years before her, will be a part of American history, held up by her advocates as a talisman for a troubled time. Thanks in large part to a disjointed format that featured five-minute segments alternating between veteran sex-crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell, a surrogate questioner for the Republicans, and Democratic senators, there was little flow to proceedings after Dr Ford's powerful opening. It was as if viewers were flipping back and forth between a CourtTV criminal cross-examination and a public-access television congressional hearing. Ms Mitchell's goal - pursued in a methodical prosecutorial fashion - was to pull at a number of threads in Dr Ford's story. Rachel Mitchell asks questions on behalf of the Republican senators Who drove her to and from the house on the night of the party? Why did she tell Senate investigators that she couldn't meet them in Washington because she was afraid of flying if she frequently travelled by air for pleasure? Did she or did she not share her 2012 therapist records with a reporter from the Washington Post? The questions seemed more geared toward undermining Dr Ford's credibility - the kind of strategy useful during depositions or trials to undermine a jury's trust in a witness or, perhaps, force them to crack under the accumulated pressure of the interrogation. Every five minutes, however, Democrats threw Dr Ford a lifeline - and by the end of the first half of the hearing, Republicans were largely left decrying the process and not questioning the sincerity of Dr Ford's testimony. In the end, Ms Mitchell herself seemed slightly exasperated by the format she was working under. When it comes to trying to arrive at the accurate recollection of trauma, she said, ""there's no study that shows that this setting, in five-minute increments, is the best way to do that"". Brett Kavanaugh, when his turn to testify arrived, had his work cut out for him. He was fighting for his professional life. He had to show it. More than that, as he fought to preserve his personal reputation - as a father, as a son and as a husband - he had to feel it. This video can not be played Brett Kavanaugh: 'I am innocent of this charge' These emotions played themselves out on his face and in his voice throughout his opening statement. He lashed out at Democrats and what he called a ""grotesque and co-ordinated character assassination"", warning darkly, ""what goes around comes around"". When talking about his family - his parents and his children - his voice cracked and he choked back tears, pausing to take long gulps of water. His supporters will see a man bowed but not broken, refusing to give in to those who wish to drag him down. But his critics may see his performance as the product of wealthy private school privilege finally facing consequences for his actions. ""Is this how people get to talk if they don't spend their entire lives being scrutinised for tone?"" asked Washington Post columnist Alexandra Petri in a tweet. Whether Mr Kavanaugh struck the proper tone for his testimony will be the big question hanging over his performance. He is, after all, auditioning for a seat on the Supreme Court, where a deliberative temperament is viewed as a necessity of the job. His testimony on Thursday was something different. Donald Trump reportedly criticised Mr Kavanaugh's demure performance in his Fox News interview earlier in the week. According to the Washington Post, he was riveted and pleased by the judge's Thursday testimony. The Republican political base also will probably enjoy his more combative demeanour. His opponents, on the other hand, are already pointing out that an angry and aggressive response to adversity isn't exactly exculpatory given the charges against him. This video can not be played Senator Lindsey Graham criticises treatment of Brett Kavanaugh Mr Kavanaugh's testimony will almost certainly deepen the partisan divides already tearing the nation apart. In the short term, it probably helps the judge steady a ship that very recently seemed poised to capsize. But will it win over on-the-fence Republican senators who may have been swayed by Christine Blasey Ford's testimony in the morning? Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, in afternoon questioning, decried the nominee's treatment at the hands of Democrats and dared Republican senators to vote against him. If Republicans close ranks, Judge Kavanaugh will be Justice Kavanaugh by next week. It won't be long until we know his fate.

"A California professor and President Donald Trump's pick to become the next Supreme Court justice will appear before senators to tell conflicting stories about a high school party 36 years ago. The accuser and the accused, in the glare of the spotlight, with a lifetime seat to the most powerful court in the US at stake. While the drama will be intensely personal, as she alleges he assaulted her and he strongly rejects the accusation, this is more than a clash of two individuals and their recollection of past events. It also represents the confluence of two movements - one decades in the making, the other a recent, powerful groundswell. ""These are unwitting combatants in an undeclared war, these people are not props for us to make our political points, nor are they to be demolished,"" Arizona Senator Jeff Flake said on Wednesday afternoon. The futures - and the reputations - of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford hang in the balance. Whether they like it or not, however, the forces at motion overshadow everything. The Brett Kavanaugh story in 300 words Accuser says 'assault altered my life' Forty-five years ago, a sharply divided US Supreme Court ruled in Roe v Wade that first-trimester abortion must be legal throughout the nation. The decision came as a shock to the anti-abortion activists, who have been fighting to reverse the decision since. They've supported federal and state-level laws that would chip away at abortion rights. And they have organised what amounts to a pipeline of young conservative jurists, groomed by organisations like the Federalist Society, in order to assure anti-abortion voices in the federal judiciary. Both Donald Trump's Supreme Court picks, Neil Gorsuch and now Mr Kavanaugh, were on that approved list. Crucially, this nominee would alter the ideological composition of the court. Anti-abortion activists believe they at last will have five votes - a majority - on the court to return the question of abortion legality to the states, where some legislatures could decide to outlaw the procedure entirely. This fight, then, marks the culmination of a decades-long struggle. Victory, at last, is within grasp. It is a victory that Christine Blasey Ford threatens. The #MeToo movement has a history measured in months, not years, but the struggle it represents is at least as powerful and enduring. It represented a drive to rethink what was previously tolerated by women and what society has long swept under the rug. In Dr Ford, they found a new champion and, after Mr Trump questioned why she didn't come forward sooner, a new hashtag, #WhyIDidntReport. This video can not be played Why it can take sexual assault allegations years to come out That the latest fight should come during a Supreme Court confirmation hearing has a certain poetic symmetry, given the spectacle of the Clarence Thomas nomination - during which he faced allegations of serial sexual harassment - fuelled the rise of a new generation of female politicians in the 1992 national elections, termed the ""year of the woman"". The woman who made those accusations, Anita Hill, herself became a hero for the feminist movement - and a villain to conservatives who at the time painted her allegations as an overtly political attempt to derail a Supreme Court nomination. Last week Ms Hill weighed in on the importance of the current moment for the women's rights movement. Anita Hill testified at a 1991 Senate hearing about sexual harassment allegations against then Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas ""In 1991, the phrase 'they just don't get it' became a popular way of describing senators' reaction to sexual violence,""she wrote,externalin The New York Times. ""With years of hindsight, mounds of evidence of the prevalence and harm that sexual violence causes individuals and our institutions, as well as a Senate with more women than ever, 'not getting it' isn't an option for our elected representatives. In 2018, our senators must get it right."" This ability to ""get it right"" this time would be a sign that the #MeToo movement has made real progress in changing American perceptions toward female victims. It is a victory that Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation threatens. It's impossible to consider the #MeToo movement without also acknowledging the man who in all likelihood contributed to the emergence of this national mood. The president largely stayed above the fray in the days after Dr Ford's allegations, but his tone has sharpened as new accusers have come forward. It sets up what can only be an uncomfortable situation for some conservatives, where a man who has boasted about making unwanted sexual advances on women is vouching for someone accused of making unwanted sexual advances on women - and worse. In fact,in a tweet the president drew a direct line,externalbetween allegations of his own sexual misdeeds with those of Mr Kavanaugh, calling them both ""false accusations"". According to a White House source talking to CNN, Mr Trump now believes he must ""personally take charge of defending"" Mr Kavanaugh. The president later said he was open to withdrawing his backing of the judge if the testimony was damning but he has given himself little room to back down. This video can not be played Washington may have had a bad past - Trump Perhaps because of the stakes involved, it was inevitable that the Kavanaugh fight would descend into total political war. Long-respected political norms and traditions have been cast aside en masse over the course of recent years. No weapon is left unused and no attack untried. The debate about Kavanaugh and the issues raised by the allegations haven't merely been the province of the key players - the parties involved, the senators considering the judge's professional fate and the administration that put him forward for consideration. On social media and television commentary, conspiracy theories swirl and unsubstantiated or outright fabricated allegations fly. In comments made from the floor of the Senate on Wednesday, Mr Flake spoke of the toll the confirmation fight was having on the fabric of American society. ""The toxic political culture that we have created has infected everything, and we have done little to stop it,"" he said. ""In fact, we have only indulged it, and fanned the flames, taken partisan advantage at every turn, and deepened the ugly divisions that exist in our country."" As the moment of reckoning for Mr Kavanaugh approaches, both sides warn of the dangers to come. This video can not be played Republican Senator calls Trump 'uninformed and uncaring' Conservatives caution that there is more at stake than just the fate of one judge seeking higher office. ""If somebody can be brought down by accusations like this, then you, me, every man certainly should be worried,"" a lawyer close to the White Housetold Politico,external. ""We can all be accused of something."" ""The reason Republicans are standing with Kavanaugh is because we know he is innocent and we know the Dems would falsely accuse Jesus himself if the GOP had nominated him,""writes,externalconservative commentator Erick Erickson. Progressives counter with their own warnings - that brave women are finally speaking up and the men in power ignore this at their peril. ""Oh man - the male lawmakers in this country have no idea what's coming, do they?""tweeted,externalgrass-roots anti-gun activist Shannon Watts. ""Women are realising we're more powerful - and maligned - than we ever imagined. We're taking back what's ours: our voices, our rights and our seats at the table."" Both sides view this as a defining moment - their chance to draw a line in the sand. And with mid-term elections just over a month away, voters will have a chance to weigh in while the conflict is still fresh in their minds. The results, whether it's a Democratic wave or a Republican consolidation of power, will be interpreted in the context of the outcome of the court battle in the coming days and weeks. But the shadow cast will endure well beyond the immediate political future. ""These past two years, we have tested the limits of how low we can go,"" Mr Flake said. ""I say to you that winning at all costs is too high a cost. If we cannot have a human - rather than a political - response to these witnesses, if we are heedless to the capacity that we have to do real and lasting damage, then maybe we shouldn't be here."" Maybe so, but here we are.

"Long term plans for the site of Grenfell Tower have yet to be finalised The head of London Fire Brigade says she would not have changed anything about the way her crews responded to the Grenfell Tower fire. Dany Cotton told an inquiry into the blaze that they were put in an ""untenable situation"" and nothing could have stopped the spread of the fire. But survivors' group Grenfell United called her comments ""heartbreaking"" and ""disrespectful"" to those who died. The fire in west London on 14 June last year led to the deaths of 72 residents. Ms Cotton, who was appointed in January 2017, was asked at the inquiry in central London if there was one aspect of the fire brigade's response which she would go back and change. Survivors shook their heads as she said she ""would not change anything we did on the night"". She said: ""I think without exception my firefighters, my officers, and my control staff performed in a fantastic way given the incredible circumstances they were faced with. ""They were pulled into an untenable situation, a building that behaved in a way it should never have done, that put the residents' lives at risk. ""Without a shadow of a doubt, I personally was responsible for committing my firefighters to their potential death in the pursuit of rescuing as many people in that building as possible."" What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Grenfell Tower was 'unsafe to live in' Ms Cotton said that even specific training in dealing with blazes involving cladding wouldn't have helped the firefighters. She said she had never received any training on the spread of fire on cladding, but said the fire would have been deemed an ""unrealistic scenario"". This video can not be played Dany Cotton says she wanted firefighters to know she was there for them as they went into the tower ""I wouldn't develop a training package for a space shuttle to land in front of the Shard"", she said. ""I wouldn't expect us to be developing training or a response to something that simply shouldn't happen."" But steps had been taken since, with full evacuation plans made and local authorities removing cladding, she said. ""We can no longer think that another fire like Grenfell Tower wouldn't happen, because we've seen it happen, and now we have to be able to deal with it"", she added. But Natasha Elcock, of Grenfell United, said the brigade should have learnt lessons from a previous tower block fire in Camberwell in 2009 in which six people were killed. ""To not prepare for a repeat of Lakanal House and say chances are like a space ship on the Shard is flippant and disrespectful. ""If anything, her answers suggests a culture of complacency and focus on damage limitation,"" she added. ""People are going to bed tonight in towers with cladding on and change needs to come fast to keep them safe."" In a witness statement, Ms Cotton described how she first saw the blaze through her car windscreen as she arrived at Grenfell Tower at 02:49 BST. ""It just looked like something from a disaster movie. Like a hideous mixture of 'Towering Inferno' and a video I was shown in training school of a high rise fire in Sao Paulo where people jumped to escape."" The commissioner also revealed that she had wanted crews to know someone cared as they went into the tower. She said: ""I recall I actually physically went and touched some firefighters when I spoke to them, because I was not 100% convinced in my mind that everybody was going to come out of there alive. ""I wanted those firefighters to have a positive reinforced memory before they went into the building of somebody saying nice things to them, being supportive and demonstrating to them that somebody really cared."" She said she was hit by an ""overwhelming anxiety"" about committing firefighters to the blaze when she could not guarantee their safety. Ms Cotton added: ""People will quite rightly have questions, but for me I could not be more proud of the absolute commitment and dedication of the firefighters. ""They were clearly terrified of going into Grenfell Tower."" Ms Cotton said she had memory blanks from the night because of the ""traumatic nature and sheer scale"" of the incident. She said she had undergone counselling after the fire to help improve her memory, but it had not been ""terribly successful"". She also told the inquiry how she had blocked out a memory where a 6ft piece of debris almost hit her and could have killed her.

"This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk? The Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a lawsuit accusing Tesla boss Elon Musk of securities fraud. The US financial regulator says Mr Musk's claims that he had secured funding to take the electric carmaker private were ""false and misleading"". It is seeking to bar Mr Musk from acting as an officer or director of a publicly traded company. Mr Musk called the action ""unjustified"" saying he acted in the ""best interests of truth, transparency and investors"". ""Integrity is the most important value in my life and the facts will show I never compromised this in any way,"" he said in a statement. Tesla's board of directors said in a statement that they were ""fully confident in Elon, his integrity and his leadership of the company"". Will Elon Musk be forced to leave Tesla? Read the SEC's claims against Elon Musk here,external The weird and wonderful life of Elon Musk Mr Musk startled the business world last month when he took to Twitter to announce that he was considering a plan that would de-list the company from the stock exchange. He wrote he had ""funding secured"" for the proposal, which would value Tesla at $420 per share. Elon Musk with Grimes, the girlfriend he thought the number $420 - noted in marijuana culture - would amuse The statements ""created the misleading impression that taking Tesla private was subject only to Mr Musk choosing to do so and a shareholder vote"", according to the SEC complaint, which was filed on Thursday in federal court in New York. ""In truth and in fact Musk had not even discussed, much less confirmed, key deal terms, including price, with any potential funding source,"" it said. The SEC statement said that, according to Mr Musk, he calculated the $420 price per share based on a 20% premium over that day's closing share price because he thought 20% was a ""standard premium"" when taking companies private transactions. This calculation resulted in a price of $419, and Mr Musk stated that he rounded the price up to $420 because he had recently learned about the number's significance in marijuana culture and thought his girlfriend, the Canadian indie singer Grimes, ""would find it funny, which admittedly is not a great reason to pick a price"". The 7 August tweets took even people within the company by surprise. ""Was this text legit?"" the firm's head of investor relations wrote to Mr Musk's chief of staff, the complaint says. Tesla shares soared after Mr Musk's announcement, before retreating amid questions and doubts. Weeks later, Mr Musk backed away from the plan, citing investor feedback. The SEC, which is also seeking financial penalties, said his claims created ""significant confusion"" in the stock market and harmed investors. This video can not be played Tesla's Elon Musk 'mislead investors' SEC alleges ""Taking care to provide truthful and accurate information is among a CEO's most critical obligations,"" said Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC's enforcement division. ""That standard applies with equal force when the communications are made via social media or another non-traditional form."" The SEC complaint sent shares of the firm down by more than 10% in after-hours trade. Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, San Francisco: Whatever the state of mind Elon Musk was in when he announced he had ""funding secured"", it could end up costing almost everything he holds dear. It would be nobody's fault but his own. Wall Street veterans - and indeed, anyone with a modicum of knowledge of how the financial markets work - predicted this very scenario the moment those tweets were posted. Mr Musk is famously an unconventional chief executive, but when it comes to the financial markets, you can't flout the rules without serious consequences. It's clear, from emails contained in the SEC's filing, that staff at Tesla were caught completely off guard. His head of investor relations asked if the tweets were ""legit"". The Nasdaq, confused, halted trading. It all makes Mr Musk unfit to run a public company, the SEC says. All this because of a tweet sent because Mr Musk thought his girlfriend ""would find it funny"". Mr Musk is credited with pushing the car industry toward electric vehicles Mr Musk, who co-founded Tesla and has served as chief executive since 2008, is a divisive figure in the business world, who has inspired passionate fans and critics. Supporters credit Mr Musk, also the head of the rocket company SpaceX, with pushing the car industry to produce electric cars. Elon Musk unveils first tourist for SpaceX 'Moon loop' Elon Musk sued for libel by British Thai cave rescuer But his critics - including many who have made investments predicting the firm's stock will fall - argue that Tesla has consistently lost money and struggled to increase its output, repeatedly missing its own targets. The financial pressure facing Tesla has mounted this year, as it boosts spending to increase production of its newest car. In recent months, Mr Musk's own behaviour has also been in the spotlight. In July, he drew widespread criticism after accusing a British cave diver involved in the rescue of Thai teenagers from a flooded cave of being a child abuser. The diver later filed a defamation suit. He also drew attention after an emotional interview with the New York Times, in which he said he worked ""120-hour weeks"" and took sedatives. And earlier this month, he smoked marijuana live on the web during a podcast with comedian Joe Rogan.

"David Beckham was accused of driving a Bentley at 59mph in a 40mph zone in Paddington David Beckham will not be prosecuted over a speeding charge, a district judge has ruled. Celebrity lawyer Nick Freeman, known as Mr Loophole, successfully fought the allegation for him on a technicality. The former England football captain, 43, was accused of driving a loaned Bentley at 59mph in a 40mph zone on the A40 in Paddington on 23 January. However, Mr Freeman had argued a speeding notice arrived one day too late. Beckham, who did not attend the hearing at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court on Thursday, had previously entered a not guilty plea. Mr Freeman said Beckham was ""very relieved with the verdict"". The lawyer previously helped Beckham overturn an eight-month driving ban in 1999, after successfully arguing he was trying to escape a paparazzi photographer. Nick Freeman - known as Mr Loophole - said the case against Beckham was ""defective"" Mr Freeman suggested the more recent matter could have been a case of poor postal service, citing a subsequent letter sent first class by Bentley to Scotland Yard which took eight days to arrive. He said: ""Unfortunately and sadly some post attracts problems. There might be nobody at fault here."" District judge Barbara Barnes said a Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) was sent on 2 February and should have arrived at Bentley Motors Ltd, the registered keepers of the vehicle, by 6 February. However, she was satisfied on the evidence heard it did not in fact arrive until 7 February - one day outside the statutory 14-day window. Summing up, she said the law allowed for the ""vagaries"" of the postal system to be taken into account. She said: ""What I find is the fact it did not arrive in the post room of Bentley Motors Ltd until 7 February and therefore was one day outside the legal limit. ""The defendant in this case cannot be convicted."" Solicitor Nick Freeman has been dubbed Mr Loophole for his success at using legal technicalities to get celebrity clients acquitted of driving offences. His clients have in the past included cricketer Andrew Flintoff, explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes and golfer Colin Montgomerie. In 1999 Mr Freeman successfully defended former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who had been accused of driving down the hard shoulder of a motorway. His defence? Sir Alex was simply looking for a toilet because he had an upset stomach. More recently, last October, Manchester magistrates threw out a speeding offence against TV personality Paddy McGuinness after accepting Mr Freeman's argument the prosecution had failed in its legal duties by not providing any documents or evidence to the defence.

"The introduction of three pets to the Fortnite game are not an attempt to squeeze more cash out of players, says one expert. Instead IHS analyst Piers Harding-Rolls believes the goal is to attract more female youngsters to the title. The three pets - a dog, chameleon and dragon - were unveiled as part of Season 6 of the massively popular game. Players who buy a Battle Pass for 950 Fortnite's V-Bucks (Â£8) get the pets as part of the bundle. PlayStation backs down in Fortnite cross-play row Fortnite is now even being blamed for divorce Orkney Library's Fortnite joke tweet is internet hit ""I don't see this as a money grab as it's a cosmetic upgrade and optional, the same as all upgrades offered in Fortnite,"" Mr Harding-Rolls told the BBC. ""Pets are a natural fit with the younger audience of the game and may entice more girls to play,"" he said, adding that most players of the survival title are male. Epic Games, which created Fortnite, may be looking to the pets to diversify that audience as it looks to keep the game relevant, he said. ""The way Epic has implemented pets - sitting in the backpack - offers another route to engage the user through an emotional connection without complicating the experience,"" said Mr Harding-Rolls. However, some gamers have challenged the idea that the pets would have any more appeal to young women than young men. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Elena Fedina, associate director of research at analyst firm SuperData there was no doubt that the pets would prompt players to buy the Battle Pass. In the past, she said, popular cosmetic items had caused a significant spike in revenues adding that one of the ""memorable"" was the $20 (Â£15) Raven skin. That proved so compelling that Epic had to apologise for the issues it had processing payments for it. ""There was a 25% increase in players after the skins were introduced and a 33% month over month increase in revenue,"" said Ms Fedina. Pets have proved hugely popular in games such as World of Warcraft Season 6 of Fortnite, subtitled Darkness Rises, started on 27 September and introduced several other changes which include new ""skins"" for players, invisibility power-ups and alterations to the main game map. Much of the attention in Fortnite's new season was grabbed by the introduction of the pets, with many on social media pledging to buy a pass so they could get one of the digital creatures. The pets stay with players even if they are eliminated and ""rezzed"" out of a match. Everything did not go smoothly on launch day for Epic, which had to apologise for a brief problem with the processing of V-Bucks payments. The game also attracted comment on social media, with the York Regional Police in Ontario urging people to be careful on the roads. It said the launch had meant many people left late for school and it asked them to avoid speeding to reach their destination. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The two suspects told Russia's RT they were tourists who wanted to see the cathedral spire The UK has warned Russia that it will pay a ""high price"" if it continues to use chemical weapons following the Salisbury nerve agent attack. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov that it was not acceptable ""to instruct military intelligence officers to use chemical weapons on British soil"". Mr Hunt told the BBC that, after nuclear weapons, there was ""nothing more horrible than chemical ones"". Russia denies the poisoning in March. In the nerve agent attack, ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal - who sold secrets to MI6 - and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with Novichok in the Wiltshire city of Salisbury. Both Mr Skripal and his daughter survived, but Dawn Sturgess - a local woman not connected to the original attack -died in July after being exposed to the same substance. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt: ""There is nothing more horrible, more lethal, more deadly"" Speaking on a visit to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, the foreign secretary said: ""We've had chemical weapons used on the streets of Salisbury and chemical weapons used in Syria under Russian patronage and, for the sake of humanity, we need to make sure that we do not turn the clock back on this. ""That is why it is very important that Russia understands the international community is totally resolved on this and anyone who uses chemical weapons needs to know the price will always be too high."" Last month, UK investigators identified two suspects who had links to Russian's military intelligence service, known as the GRU. The two men appeared on Russia's state-run international broadcaster RT and insisted they were simply tourists visiting Salisbury to see its ""famous cathedral and its 123m spire"". Bellingcat released a photo of the man it says is Anatoliy Chepiga (left), while Russia Today named him as Ruslan Boshirov (right) On Wednesday,investigative website Bellingcat,externalreported that one of them was a military officer who served in Chechnya and Ukraine and was made a ""Hero of the Russian Federation"" in 2014. The honour, bestowed on Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga in a secret ceremony, is typically handed out by Russia's president Vladimir Putin. In his interview with the BBC, Mr Hunt said counter-action was being taken against Russian military intelligence. He said it was always going to be possible for a large state like Russia to find a way of issuing fake passports to get such people into Britain but everything possible was being done to prevent abuse of the visa system and visa checks. Addressing world leaders at the UN on Wednesday, Theresa May criticised Russia for its ""desperate fabrication"" over the poisoning. The prime minister accused Russia of ""flagrantly breach[ing] international norms"" citing ""the reckless use of chemical weapons on the streets of Britain by agents of the Russian GRU"". What is the GRU? What happened to the Skripals? The website behind the Skripal revelation Russia continues to dismiss and ridicule all suggestions it was involved in the attack and says no investigation in which it is not actively involved will ever be credible or fair. Writing on Facebook, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova described the Colonel Chepiga allegations as groundless. Komsomolskaya Pravda,external, a pro-Kremlin tabloid, published an online article listing ""three reasons"" why Chepiga was not involved in the Skripal poisoning, adding that he was not a Russian secret services operative.

"William Hardy was better known to his friends and family as Harry Britain's oldest football referee, who officiated matches until he was 88, has died. William ""Harry"" Hardy started overseeing matches in 1959 but only retired in the 2015-16 season after a fall. He refereed more than 3,000 football matches. The Erewash Valley Referee Society said he died on Wednesday - two days before his 92nd birthday. Mr Hardy's son, Chris, said he was ""very proud of him"". Prince William, president of the Football Association,gave Mr Hardy a medalfor services to football in 2013. Mr Hardy, from Ilkeston in Derbyshire,received a British Empire Medalin the Queen's Birthday Honours the following year. His son said the father-of-two suffered a heart attack on Saturday and had deteriorated in the days that followed. He added: ""I'm very proud of him and so are all his six grandchildren. ""I used to get took [to matches] with him. [Before one game] there was two inches of snow and he'd say 'we're playing!' ""He encouraged loads of people [to take up refereeing] and brought a lot through who have gone on to referee across the world."" Mr Hardy joined Erewash Valley Referee Society in 1959 and from 1963 served in office as secretary for more than 55 years Pete Carter, chairman of the Erewash Valley Referee Society, said: ""In a nutshell he was a true gentleman and he couldn't do enough for anyone, especially young referees. ""He just loved football. The majority of his time was taken up with football and refereeing. ""A lot of people don't know this about him but Harry was a very good footballer in his day. Unfortunately he packed it in after he broke his leg. ""When I first took over the role 20 years ago Harry helped me an enormous amount."" Mr Hardy, who also had six great-grandchildren, joined Erewash Valley Referee Society in 1959 and from 1963 served in office as secretary for more than 55 years.

"Bellingcat released a photo of the man it says is Anatoliy Chepiga (left), while Russia Today named him as Ruslan Boshirov (right) A Russian man accused of the Salisbury poisoning is a military officer who received an honour from Vladimir Putin, an investigative website says. Following the attempted poisoning in March, UK investigators identified one of the two suspects as Ruslan Boshirov. President Putin claimed Boshirov was a civilian, and on Russian TV, he himself said he visited Salisbury as a tourist. Butthe website Bellingcat,externalsays he is actually an intelligence officer by the name of Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga. He has served in Chechnya and Ukraine and was made a ""Hero of the Russian Federation"" in 2014. British officials have not commented, but the BBC understands there is no dispute over the identification. Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for the Kremlin, insisted that the suspect is a civilian. He said: ""Many people look alike."" What is the GRU? What happened to the Skripals? The website behind the Skripal revelation Ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal - who sold secrets to MI6 - and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with Novichok on 4 March. Both Mr Skripal and his daughter survived, but Dawn Sturgess - a local woman not connected to the original attack -died in July after being exposed to the same substance. It is thought Chepiga travelled to the UK on a false passport, along with another Russian national who used the name Alexander Petrov. Colonel Chepiga is the last name on the Gold Star honour list on the memorial wall of the Far Eastern Military Command School The 39-year-old trained at one of Russia's elite academies and served with a special forces unit under the command of the GRU - Russia's military intelligence service. He earned more than 20 military awards for his service. He is believed to have transferred to Moscow in about 2009, where he was given a false identity as Ruslan Boshirov. He has been working undercover for the past nine years. In December 2014, he was made a Hero of the Russian Federation. The medal, awarded in a secret ceremony, is typically handed out by the Russian president. It is only given to a handful of people each year. The timing suggests it was for operations in Ukraine. He and Petrov flew in to Gatwick Airport from Moscow on 2 March 2018 and visited Salisbury on two consecutive days, including 4 March, the day of the poisoning. Both men returned to Moscow on the same day. European arrest warrants and Interpol red notices have subsequently been issued for the pair. Russia does not extradite its own nationals. Sergei Skripal, 67, and his daughter Yulia were poisoned by a nerve agent in Salisbury, where he lived. The attack was approved by the Russian state, according to the UK government. The Skripals spent several weeks in hospital, but recovered. The event sparked a series of accusations and denials between the UK and Russian governments,culminating in diplomatic expulsions and international sanctions. Police linked the attack to another poisoning in nearby Amesbury in June, in which Dawn Sturgess and her partner Charlie Rowley were exposed to Novichok after handling a contaminated perfume dispenser. Ms Sturgess later died. When UK police identified Boshirov and Petrov, Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted the pair were innocent civilians. A day later, on 13 September,the pair appeared on Russian TVand claimed they were simply tourists, visiting Salisbury to see its ""famous cathedral and its 123m spire"". Boshirov - or Colonel Chepiga - said he and Mr Petrov were in the sports nutrition business, but were travelling for pleasure. They emphatically denied carrying any Novichok, or the modified Nina Ricci perfume bottle which UK investigators say contained the substance. The two men told Russia's state-run broadcaster that their lives had been ""turned upside down"" by the allegations. ""We're afraid to go out, we fear for ourselves, our lives and lives of our loved ones,"" Boshirov said.

""It was pretty tough because it is not acceptable for Russia to instruct two GRU agents to use chemical weapons on British soil,"" he said. ""Our message to Russia is very straightforward: 'If you do this the price will be too high."" Addressing world leaders at the United Nations on Wednesday, Theresa May criticised Russia for its ""desperate fabrication"" over the Salisbury spy poisoning. The prime minister accused Russia of ""flagrantly breach[ing] international norms"" citing ""the reckless use of chemical weapons on the streets of Britain by agents of the Russian GRU"". The claims about Chepiga were made following an investigation by a firm called Bellingcat. Describing itself as ""the home of online investigations"", Bellingcat says it uses open-source computer software and social media as part of its work.

"This video can not be played Pollution threatens future of killer whales Killer whales are in deep trouble because of persistent chemical pollution in the environment, researchers say. A new study suggests the long-term viability of more than half of the different orca groups around the globe is now in question. Some populations, such as those around the UK, the Strait of Gibraltar, off Brazil, Japan and California, are almost certainly doomed. The assessment is in Science magazine,external. The issue is polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. These chemical compounds were once manufactured in vast quantities, and used in everything from plastics and paints to electrical equipment and sealants. But they are highly toxic and although banned decades ago have amassed in the environment, leaching into the ocean. Killer whales, or orcas, are top predators so they absorb all the PCB pollution taken in by the different prey in their food chain - from fish, right up to seals and sharks. The PCBs stunt the ovaries of female orcas, limiting their ability to produce calves. The chemicals also suppress the immune system. A last refuge for European orcas 'Shocking' pollutant levels in UK whale Banned chemicals persist in deep ocean The new study models the future of the killer whales' reproductive success and survivability against the chemical challenge. For those populations living in clean waters, it is positive. Orcas in places like the Antarctic and the Arctic should increase their numbers. But for those living in the most polluted seas, the next 30-50 years will be grim. The killer whales that live on the west coast of Scotland, for example, are now down to just eight individuals and they have not produced a calf in more than 20 years. Paul Jepson, from the Zoological Society of London, says this group will ""disappear in my lifetime"". ""Over 50% of the populations that we've got data for will actually collapse in our model,"" he told theBBC's Science In Action programme. ""PCBs are such highly toxic chemicals, and they persist in the environment. And it's the killer whales that have by a long way the highest exposures now of any species on Earth; certainly any mammalian species."" The Scottish orcas have been found to be heavily contaminated Polychlorinated biphenyls were manufactured from the 1920s Banned in the US in 1979, the UK in 1981 and the rest of the EU Europe produced some 300,000 tonnes from 1954 to 1984 The majority has yet to be destroyed or safely stored away PCBs were popular in coolant fluids in electrical apparatus They were used in building construction, especially in sealants Also in cutting fluids for machining, and carbonless copy paper Today, only North Korea still manufactures polychlorinated biphenyls Everything in this story works against the killer whales. Not only do they accumulate contaminants because of their position as top predators, but the toxic effects hit them where they are particularly vulnerable - in their ability to reproduce. These are animals that take a long time to reach sexual maturity and even then have perhaps one calf every few years. This puts very precise pressure on a population. In addition, PCBs are soluble in fat - and killer whales are extremely fat-rich animals. A mother's milk will be loaded with PCBs which she will pass on to her offspring during lactation. Most PCBs have yet to be destroyed or safely stored away. Some countries have done better than others. In the US, where federal ""superfunds"" have been used to clean up the most heavily contaminated sites, PCB levels entering the ocean have come down. But there needs to be much more urgency in places such as Europe. ""Improper disposal of PCB-containing equipment in landfills may lead to leakage and leaching of PCBs into nearby streams, river, estuaries, and ocean,"" said lead author on the new report, Jean-Pierre Desforges from Aarhus University, Denmark. ""We know that PCBs were used in paints and sealants in old buildings and for outer coating on ships, so if contaminated building materials are improperly disposed of they could also reach the environment, and demolition of buildings may cause PCBs to enter the air."" This video can not be played Paul Jepson: ""The killer whale is the most PCB-contaminated species on Earth"" There is very little that can be done to recover the PCBs once they have reached the ocean. And the robustness of the chemicals means they will hang around in the environment for a very long time. But there are parallel problems we could conceivably fix, said co-author Ailsa Hall from the Sea Mammal Research Unit at St Andrews University, UK. ""We should recognise that this is just one of many stresses on the animals,"" she told BBC News. ""There are things such as noise, changes in habitat, changes in the availability of prey - that we do have influence over. And if we do something about these factors, maybe we can reduce the overall burden of stress, and perhaps then our predictions won't be so dire."" Paul Jepson added: ""I don't think there'll ever be another PCB story. ""I think the chemical industries have learnt the lesson - we know that being fat-soluble is a big risk factor, because that allows things to bioaccumulate. ""So, nowadays, no chemical with those properties would be allowed. But PCBs are so difficult to get rid of that we'll be dealing with the legacy for a long time.""

"Police in the Netherlands have arrested seven men over an alleged plot to carry out what they describe as a major terrorist attack involving guns and explosives. Police say the men were trying to source AK47s, hand grenades and bomb materials to carry out their attack. The men, aged between 21 and 34, were arrested on Thursday. Three had been arrested previously for trying to travel abroad to join foreign militants. Prosecutors say the man at the centre of the group is a 34-year-old of Iraqi origin, who was convicted in 2017 for trying to travel to fight for the Islamic State group. They say they were tipped off about the plot in April 2018,externalby intelligence services, who said the main suspect wanted to target ""a large event in the Netherlands where there would be a lot of victims"". The seven men were arrested in the central city of Arnhem and southern municipality of Weert on Thursday afternoon by anti-terrorism teams from the country's Special Interventions Service (DSI). Prosecutors believe the suspects wanted to carry out twin attacks involving a bomb and gun attack at an event and a car bomb detonated elsewhere. ""The suspects were in search of AK47s, hand guns, hand grenades, explosive vests and raw materials for several [car] bombs,"" prosecutors said in a statement. Prosecutors say they were allegedly seeking firearms training and were arrested in possession of five small handguns. The National Coordinator for Counterterrorism and Security (NCTV) told local media in a statement that the arrests reflect the ""realistic"" risk of attacks in the country. The threat level in the Netherlands is currently set at four out of a maximum five. Earlier this month a jihadist was shot after stabbing two American tourists in Amsterdam.

FedEx Cup winner Justin Rose and Jon Rahm face Brooks Koepka and Tony Finau in the first of 28 matches. Rory McIlroy and Thorbjorn Olesen play Dustin Johnson and Rickie Fowler before Paul Casey and Tyrrell Hatton take on Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas. The US are the defending champions but have not won in Europe for 25 years. How do the teams compare? Will underdogs Europe defy logic and tame US superstars? Donaldson's hole-by-hole guide to Le Golf National Led by captain and former US Open champion Jim Furyk, the US team has 31 major victories between them compared to Europe's eight and boasts three of this year's major champions - US Open and US PGA Championship winner Koepka, plus Masters champion Reed. Europe, meanwhile, have Open champion Molinari among their 12-man team as France hosts the tournament for the first time. The Italian held off Woods' challenge en route to victory at Carnoustie in July and has been paired with Fleetwood, who is one of four rookies placed with more experienced partners by European captain Thomas Bjorn. Rahm, Olesen and Hatton are also debutants, while Sweden's Alex Noren is the only European rookie to sit out. Tiger Woods was at the Ryder Cup opening ceremony with girlfriend Erica Herman Woods, 42, has returned to form after several back surgeries, winning his first tournament in five years at the Tour Championship last Sunday. The 14-time major champion is part of a US team which also has the edge in terms of world rankings; their average ranking per player is 11, eight places higher than Europe's 19. But Europe's home advantage is helped by the fact that only three of the American team have played competitive rounds at Le Golf National - Koepka, Bubba Watson and Thomas. Tyrrell Hatton is the only member of the European Tour not to record a top-10 finish at the Versailles course on the outskirts of Paris, which hosts the French Open - Noren and Fleetwood have won that tournament in the past two years. Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari share a joke with team-mates as their fourballs partnership is announced Europe captain Thomas Bjorn:""This continent can be a fragmented place. When it comes to the Ryder Cup, we stand as one. Together we have achieved many great things. More than anything we will play for that flag.""

If matches finish tied, each team scores half a point. Should the competition finish 14-14, the USA will retain the trophy after winning on home soil at Hazeltine in 2016. Fourball and foursome matches take place over the first two days. In the fourball matches, teams of two play each other and the player that shoots the lowest score on each hole wins it for their team - if the scores are tied then the hole is halved. The foursome matches also involve two-man teams. However, only one ball per team is in play with players taking alternate shots. Again, the lowest score wins the hole. The 12 singles matches take place on Sunday and also follow the match-play format. The opening ceremony was hosted by former footballer David Ginola and featured the players' partners in a glitzy spectacle The USA boast 26 victories in the 41 Ryder Cups played since 1927, though only eight of those have come since the addition of European players in 1979. Europe have won 10 in that time, with the 1989 contest at the Belfry finishing as a tie, and have dominated since the turn of the century with victories in six of the eight matches played. The visitors are looking for a first victory on European soil since 1993, but head to Le Golf National as holders having stopped a run of three successive defeats in 2016.

"This video can not be played ""I like beer"": Kavanaugh defends his high school drinking during testimony The Senate has voted to advance US Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh to a final confirmation vote on Saturday. It follows an FBI report into several sexual misconduct allegations against him. Last week, at a combative hearing in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the judge denied the allegations and pledged never to give up. It followed testimony from Doctor Christine Blasey Ford, a research psychologist, who said an assault by Mr Kavanaugh 36 years ago had ""drastically"" affected her life. Republican and Democrat senators are divided over the nomination and, with only a 51-49 party split, his confirmation hangs in the balance. If Mr Kavanaugh is confirmed, he could tilt the balance of the Supreme Court in favour of Republicans for decades. Key takeaways from a dramatic hearing Who is Brett Kavanaugh? Moment of reckoning for American women Judges hold the position for life and the nine-member court has the final say on US law, including on contentious social issues and challenges to government policy. Prof Ford says Mr Kavanaugh tried to force himself on her at a party in the 1980s when he was 17. This video can not be played Christine Blasey Ford said she was ""100%"" sure Brett Kavanaugh assaulted her Judge Kavanaugh's classmate at Yale University, Deborah Ramirez, then told the New Yorker he exposed himself to her at a party. A third woman, Julie Swetnick, alleged she was the victim of a gang rape in 1982 at a party the judge attended. He has rejected all the accusations. At his hearing he also denied drinking excessively to the point of blacking out - something some of Mr Kavanaugh's school and university classmates have contested. A confirmation vote in the full Senate is expected on Saturday. Republicans want their nominee in place before mid-term elections next month, when they could lose their control of the chamber.

"This video can not be played Tommy Robinson says people know this is a ""political trial"" Former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson has appeared in court over a contempt of court allegation. Hundreds of supporters and opponents of the right-wing activist gathered outside the Old Bailey on Thursday. Robinson, 35, is alleged to have committed contempt by filming people in a criminal trial and broadcasting footage on social media. The case was adjourned until October. Robinson claimed the authorities ""want me in prison for Christmas"". Recorder of London Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC said he would receive written submissions before making a ruling on how the substantive hearing will take place. Robinson, from Luton, was referred to by his real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon throughout the brief hearing. He was released from prison last month after three leading judges quashed a finding made at Leeds Crown Court in May, and granted him conditional bail from a 13-month jail sentence. This video can not be played Who is Tommy Robinson and why was he in jail? Robinson could face being sent back to jail if he is found to have been in contempt, with a maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment. He was sentenced in May to 10 months for contempt of court and a further three months for breaching a previous suspended sentence. In May 2017, Robinson faced contempt proceedings over footage he filmed during the trial of four men who were later convicted of gang-raping a teenage girl. A judge at Canterbury Crown Court gave him a three-month suspended sentence. About 300 Tommy Robinson supporters gathered outside the Old Bailey Robinson appealed against both contempt findings at a hearing last month overseen by Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett, Mr Justice Turner and Mrs Justice McGowan. They found the judge in Leeds should not have commenced contempt proceedings that day and ordered the case reheard so that the allegations could be fully examined. Speaking outside the Old Bailey earlier, Robinson criticised delays in the case, saying: ""I believe they want me in prison for Christmas."" Correction 2nd October 2018: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Tommy Robinson had admitted contempt of court at Leeds Crown Court in May and that sentence has been amended.

"This video can not be played Patrick Kehoe was pinned to the ground at Dublin Airport A passenger has been pinned to the ground by police at Dublin Airport after running out of the terminal towards a plane and shouting at the pilot to wait. Patrick Kehoe, 23, made it to the taxiing Ryanair aircraft before police arrested him at about 07:00 local time. He has been charged with criminal damage to a door lock and granted bail. A ground crew member said he ""just ran from the building towards the plane"", which was departing for Amsterdam. The Irish man was ""quite determined"" to make his flight, an eyewitness told Irish broadcaster RTÃ, adding that he ran towards the plane ""with his suitcase under his arm"". BBC News NI's Declan Harvey, who was at the scene, said that when police arrived there was a scuffle and Mr Kehoe was pinned to the tarmac. Patrick Kehoe shouted abuse at waiting journalists as he appeared in court Mr Kehoe, of Raheenaskeagh, Gorey in County Wexford, was brought before Dublin's district court later on Thursday morning. There were no objections to bail, and Mr Kehoe was released on his own bond of â¬200 (Â£178). He is to appear again on 8 November. Mr Kehoe covered his face with a folder and shouted abuse at waiting journalists as he left the court, before swinging his suitcase at the crowd and lowering his trousers to expose his backside. Dublin Airport police arrived on the scene shortly after Mr Kehoe approached the plane The flight departed 21 minutes behind schedule, but reportedly landed on time in Amsterdam. In a statement, an airport spokesman said: ""A male and female passenger were late for a Ryanair flight to Amsterdam this morning and arrived at the boarding gate after the flight had closed.

"The blade Kirsty Thorne says her son found in the Lego card pack A mother has told the BBC of her ""absolute disgust"" at discovering the blade of a knife in a pack of children's Lego cards from Sainsbury's. Kirsty Thorne, from Kent, was shocked when her three-year-old son showed her the blade he found when the pack was opened. Lego cards are a range of collectable cards available from the supermarket chain. Sainsbury's says it appears to be an ""isolated and unusual incident"". Ms Thorne had hoped to treat her sons by buying them a couple of Lego book albums and card packs while on her visit to her local Sainsbury's in Ashurst, Kent. ""It didn't look like it had been tampered with so when I got home I just put the card packs on the table,"" Ms Thorne told the BBC. ""They were all playing at the table going through the cards and that's when my son brought it to my attention. ""It looked like the blade had been placed in the pack before it was sealed. It was the perfect size to fit in that packet."" Ms Thorne was relieved her children had escaped without injury. ""My youngest had been opening the packs in his mouth,"" she explained. A Sainsbury's spokesperson said, ""We are aware of an issue with a pack of Lego cards. This appears to be an isolated and unusual incident which we are investigating with our supplier.""

"Princess Royal Hospital's A&E department will close between 20:00 and 08:00 A hospital accident and emergency unit will temporarily close overnight after NHS managers were told they cannot continue to rely on the ""goodwill of staff"" to keep patients safe. Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust (SaTH) Board ruled the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford would suspend services overnight. The department will shut from 20:00 to 08:00 BST in October or November for six months. MPs have branded plans ""reckless"". The trust said the closure is in response to shortages in specialist staff affecting the trust's two A&E departments in Telford and Royal Shrewsbury Hospital. Ben Reid, chairman of the trust board, told Thursday's meeting: ""I've never seen anything like the pressures on our two emergency departments over winter. Relying on the goodwill of staff to keep patients safe is not good."" It comes after the Care Quality Commission tookurgent enforcement action when an inspection highlighted safety fears. The trust was already under investigation overallegations of dozens of avoidable deaths and injuries in its maternity unit. Under plans, sick children from Telford and Wrekin would be taken via ambulance to Wolverhampton, despite the women and children's unit being based at Telford. News and live updates from the West Midlands Ambulances for the Telford hospital would be diverted to neighbouring trusts.

"The introduction of three pets to the Fortnite game are not an attempt to squeeze more cash out of players, says one expert. Instead IHS analyst Piers Harding-Rolls believes the goal is to attract more female youngsters to the title. The three pets - a dog, chameleon and dragon - were unveiled as part of Season 6 of the massively popular game. Players who buy a Battle Pass for 950 Fortnite's V-Bucks (Â£8) get the pets as part of the bundle. PlayStation backs down in Fortnite cross-play row Fortnite is now even being blamed for divorce Orkney Library's Fortnite joke tweet is internet hit ""I don't see this as a money grab as it's a cosmetic upgrade and optional, the same as all upgrades offered in Fortnite,"" Mr Harding-Rolls told the BBC. ""Pets are a natural fit with the younger audience of the game and may entice more girls to play,"" he said, adding that most players of the survival title are male. Epic Games, which created Fortnite, may be looking to the pets to diversify that audience as it looks to keep the game relevant, he said. ""The way Epic has implemented pets - sitting in the backpack - offers another route to engage the user through an emotional connection without complicating the experience,"" said Mr Harding-Rolls. However, some gamers have challenged the idea that the pets would have any more appeal to young women than young men. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Elena Fedina, associate director of research at analyst firm SuperData there was no doubt that the pets would prompt players to buy the Battle Pass. In the past, she said, popular cosmetic items had caused a significant spike in revenues adding that one of the ""memorable"" was the $20 (Â£15) Raven skin. That proved so compelling that Epic had to apologise for the issues it had processing payments for it. ""There was a 25% increase in players after the skins were introduced and a 33% month over month increase in revenue,"" said Ms Fedina. Pets have proved hugely popular in games such as World of Warcraft Season 6 of Fortnite, subtitled Darkness Rises, started on 27 September and introduced several other changes which include new ""skins"" for players, invisibility power-ups and alterations to the main game map. Much of the attention in Fortnite's new season was grabbed by the introduction of the pets, with many on social media pledging to buy a pass so they could get one of the digital creatures. The pets stay with players even if they are eliminated and ""rezzed"" out of a match. Everything did not go smoothly on launch day for Epic, which had to apologise for a brief problem with the processing of V-Bucks payments. The game also attracted comment on social media, with the York Regional Police in Ontario urging people to be careful on the roads. It said the launch had meant many people left late for school and it asked them to avoid speeding to reach their destination. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

People on the diets lost three times more weight than those given standard dietary advice by their GP, University of Oxford researchers found. And their risk of developing heart disease and type-2 diabetes reduced. But experts said it would work only if eating habits were changed for good. Prof Paul Aveyard, study author, GP and professor of behavioural medicine at the University of Oxford, said losing weight and keeping it off was hard. ""It's boring being on a normal diet and people struggle to stick to it for a year,"" he said. ""But these programmes get you when your mental strength is at its highest. ""You have to concentrate effort into 12 weeks and because they eat so little, they lose a lot of weight quickly."" Total diet replacement programmes,externalare designed for people who are obese or seriously obese, with abody mass index(BMI) of more than 30, who have been unable to lose weight despite changes to diet and lifestyle. They are currently only available privately - although NHS England has said it is considering the diets as part of a long-term plan for the NHS. BMI and obesity: Where are you on the UK fat scale? The programmes reduce daily calorie intake by replacing food with specially formulated drinks, soups and snacks. Milk, water and fibre supplements are also taken. A typical daily intake might include: a chocolate-flavour skimmed milk and soya protein shake mix (145kcal) chicken-and-mushroom-flavour skimmed milk and soya protein soup mix (138kcal) skimmed milk and multi-wholegrain porridge mix (149kcal) lemon-flavour soya and milk protein bar covered in yoghurt-flavour coating (150kcal) Inthis study,external, of 278 people from 10 GP practices in Oxfordshire, half followed the Cambridge Weight Plan programme for eight weeks - limiting intake to 810kcal per day - then re-introduced other food gradually over the next four weeks. They also saw a trained counsellor every week, for 24 weeks in total, to help them stick to the diet and keep the weight off. The other half of participants were given the usual weight management advice and support from their GP practice. At every stage of the study, people following the diet replacement programme lost more weight. After a year, they had lost on average 1st 9lb (10.7kg) compared with half a stone (3.1kg) for those in the usual weight loss group. When their blood pressure and cholesterol was measured, there were also noticeable improvements. And those with type-2 diabetes were able to radically reduce their medication, although the study found no evidence of the condition being reversed. One in four adults in the UK is obese and the number of people being diagnosed with type-2 diabetes is on the rise. Last year,a trial of patients with type-2 diabetes given a low-calorie diet of shakes and soupsfound half were able to lose enough weight to reverse the condition. It is often said that losing weight quickly on these types of programmes might lead to the weight piling back on again - but the researchers said the study showed this wasn't the case. Prof Aveyard said the programme was an ""effective intervention which GPs can confidently recommend, knowing that it leads to sustainable weight loss and lowers the risk of heart disease and diabetes"". Dr Barbara McGowan, a member of the Society for Endocrinology, consultant endocrinologist and lead for medical obesity services at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, said: ""It has the potential to be scaled up across the NHS if found to be cost-effective as a treatment for obesity."" Dr Katarina Kos, a senior lecturer in diabetes and obesity at the University of Exeter Medical School, said people should not try one of these diets on their own, without any support. ""Of course losing weight is good if you are overweight but a large body of research indicates that the only way it will work is if using the programme as a means to future change, as a stepping stone to change eating habits for good,"" she said. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said she would like to see more research in this area. ""Of course, what works for one patient might not work for another,"" she said. ""And GPs will always aim to take into account the physical, psychological and social factors potentially impacting on a patient's health when giving them advice."" Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard said weight loss programmes should not be seen as the only option for patients. ""Ultimately, the best way to stay fit and healthy is to keep active, eat a healthy and balanced diet, get enough sleep, drink moderately in accordance with guidelines, and not smoke,"" she said. The trial was funded in part by Cambridge Weight Plan UK. Jane Moore says the plans encourage yo-yo dieting Jane Moore from Northampton used the weight loss programme trialled in the study. ""This has enraged me. The first time I used it I did indeed lose weight quickly, probably a stone in a few weeks, but as soon as you return to normal eating the weight creeps back on. ""This type of 'diet' does nothing to educate overweight people long term, and simply encourages unhealthy yo-yo dieting in my opinion. ""In addition I developed gallstones and was hospitalised with jaundice and pancreatitis as a result of them fragmenting. ""When I had my gallbladder removed, my consultant believed that yo-yo dieting contributed to me developing these problems. ""I am delighted to say that through healthy eating I have now lost three-and-a-half stone and have kept this off for over two years now."" Karen (left) and her daughter Jess have lost 10 stone between them Karen Taylor, and her daughter Jess, from Aylesbury, used the same diet plan with impressive results. ""Jess has lost just over three stone and I have lost seven stone since January this year. ""I have suffered with my weight for many years and since childhood. I overate when pregnant with Jess, comfort ate when my marriage broke down and continued to sabotage myself with food for years, all the while thinking food was my friend.

"Former Germany and Bayern Munich defender Philip Lahm (left) was a bid ambassador for Germany Germany has beaten Turkey to host Euro 2024 after a vote by Uefa's executive committee on Thursday. The two countries made final bid presentations before voting took place in Nyon, Switzerland. The decision means Germany will stage the European Championship for the first time as a unified country, with West Germany having hosted the 1988 tournament. Turkey is yet to host a major international football tournament. It has seen previous attempts to host the Euros in 2008, 2012 and 2016 fail, as well as the 2020 Summer Olympics. Germany staged the 2006 World Cup. Euro 2024 will return to a single-host format after Euro 2020 is held across Europe, including Germany. Before announcing the winner, Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin said Germany and Turkey had made ""very strong bids"". After announcing the winner, he added: ""The procedure was transparent. The voting was democratic. Every democratic decision is the right decision so I can only say I am looking forward to seeing a fantastic Euro in 2024."" Euro 2024 will feature 24 teams, taking place in June and July, with 51 games scheduled for up to 32 days. Berlin will stage the final, while matches will also take place in Cologne, Dortmund, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Gelsenkirchen, Hamburg, Leipzig, Munich and Stuttgart. Former Germany captain Philipp Lahm, an ambassador for his country's bid, said: ""We have amazing stadiums, fans who love football, first and foremost we have people who love celebrating with other Europeans. ""We will organise a huge football party in Germany."" Germany and Turkey were the only countries in the running for Euro 2024 and, in the build up, an evaluation report by Uefa stated Turkey's bid had risks. The report added that Turkey's lack of an action plan in the area of human rights and limited hotel capacity in many cities were matters ""of concern"". It also labelled the scale of transport infrastructure work required ""a risk"". However, it did say the Turkish bid was ""in line with the long-term objectives of Uefa.""

"The blade Kirsty Thorne says her son found in the Lego card pack A mother has told the BBC of her ""absolute disgust"" at discovering the blade of a knife in a pack of children's Lego cards from Sainsbury's. Kirsty Thorne, from Kent, was shocked when her three-year-old son showed her the blade he found when the pack was opened. Lego cards are a range of collectable cards available from the supermarket chain. Sainsbury's says it appears to be an ""isolated and unusual incident"". Ms Thorne had hoped to treat her sons by buying them a couple of Lego book albums and card packs while on her visit to her local Sainsbury's in Ashurst, Kent. ""It didn't look like it had been tampered with so when I got home I just put the card packs on the table,"" Ms Thorne told the BBC. ""They were all playing at the table going through the cards and that's when my son brought it to my attention. ""It looked like the blade had been placed in the pack before it was sealed. It was the perfect size to fit in that packet."" Ms Thorne was relieved her children had escaped without injury. ""My youngest had been opening the packs in his mouth,"" she explained. A Sainsbury's spokesperson said, ""We are aware of an issue with a pack of Lego cards. This appears to be an isolated and unusual incident which we are investigating with our supplier.""

"David Beckham was accused of driving a Bentley at 59mph in a 40mph zone in Paddington David Beckham will not be prosecuted over a speeding charge, a district judge has ruled. Celebrity lawyer Nick Freeman, known as Mr Loophole, successfully fought the allegation for him on a technicality. The former England football captain, 43, was accused of driving a loaned Bentley at 59mph in a 40mph zone on the A40 in Paddington on 23 January. However, Mr Freeman had argued a speeding notice arrived one day too late. Beckham, who did not attend the hearing at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court on Thursday, had previously entered a not guilty plea. Mr Freeman said Beckham was ""very relieved with the verdict"". The lawyer previously helped Beckham overturn an eight-month driving ban in 1999, after successfully arguing he was trying to escape a paparazzi photographer. Nick Freeman - known as Mr Loophole - said the case against Beckham was ""defective"" Mr Freeman suggested the more recent matter could have been a case of poor postal service, citing a subsequent letter sent first class by Bentley to Scotland Yard which took eight days to arrive. He said: ""Unfortunately and sadly some post attracts problems. There might be nobody at fault here."" District judge Barbara Barnes said a Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) was sent on 2 February and should have arrived at Bentley Motors Ltd, the registered keepers of the vehicle, by 6 February. However, she was satisfied on the evidence heard it did not in fact arrive until 7 February - one day outside the statutory 14-day window. Summing up, she said the law allowed for the ""vagaries"" of the postal system to be taken into account. She said: ""What I find is the fact it did not arrive in the post room of Bentley Motors Ltd until 7 February and therefore was one day outside the legal limit. ""The defendant in this case cannot be convicted."" Solicitor Nick Freeman has been dubbed Mr Loophole for his success at using legal technicalities to get celebrity clients acquitted of driving offences. His clients have in the past included cricketer Andrew Flintoff, explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes and golfer Colin Montgomerie. In 1999 Mr Freeman successfully defended former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who had been accused of driving down the hard shoulder of a motorway. His defence? Sir Alex was simply looking for a toilet because he had an upset stomach. More recently, last October, Manchester magistrates threw out a speeding offence against TV personality Paddy McGuinness after accepting Mr Freeman's argument the prosecution had failed in its legal duties by not providing any documents or evidence to the defence.

"From dream job to reality: The most typical type of work turned out to be a sales assistant When young people were asked in 2011 about the careers they wanted, the most popular ambitions were for jobs such as doctors, vets, firefighters, police officers, nurses, teachers and actors. But the Office for National Statistics has gone back and found a reality gap with what really happened to their lives six years later. Apart from those who aimed to go into teaching, less than one in 50 were in the career they had wanted - with most working as sales assistants, carers or in sales and marketing. They were also earning less than they had expected and fewer of them had gone to university than they had hoped. The ONS study asked 16- to 21-year-olds what they wanted to do in their working lives. Their priorities were to have jobs that were ""interesting"", ""secure"" and with family friendly hours. Less than one in 50 achieved their ambition of a health service job - and by age 30, typical earnings are Â£24,000 They aimed for a mix of glamorous and creative jobs, such as actors or in film or television, and jobs where they might help the public, such as a range of health service jobs or in the police or emergency services. Teaching was also popular - and almost one in 20 of those aiming to work in education achieved their goal, much higher than any of the other popular career ambitions. Education was one of the biggest sources of employment and proved to have been the most realistic career choice. But there was a huge gap between the career dream and the reality for most, when this age group had reached their early to late-20s, in 2017. The report, Young people's career aspirations versus reality, shows how few got the top choices they had hoped for: Only 1.4% had got jobs in the media or arts, such as a producer, actor or writer Only 1.7% were in jobs such as the police or emergency services Only about 1.7% became health professionals, such as dentists or pharmacists The most typical jobs for these people in their twenties included: sales assistants and cashiers caring and personal services teaching and education-related sales and marketing administration IT childcare financial services 'other elementary services' There were rising numbers of people in this age group working in caring and IT but there had been a decline in construction jobs. The ONS study, based on its annual population survey and its understanding society survey, also found that young people were likely to face disappointments in pay. About one in 20 expected to be earning Â£80,000 by the age of 30 - but the ONS projects average earnings of less than Â£24,000. Nick Chambers, chief executive of the Education and Employers careers charity, said young people's ambitions were often defined by the limited range of jobs they knew about - such as teachers they saw in school, the jobs they saw on television or the jobs of their family and friends. And this could be a barrier to social mobility. ""You can't be it, if you can't see it,"" he said. ""There's a mismatch between the jobs that young people know about and the reality of the jobs market."" Who are the children hoping to earn Â£24 an hour?

"Long term plans for the site of Grenfell Tower have yet to be finalised The head of London Fire Brigade says she would not have changed anything about the way her crews responded to the Grenfell Tower fire. Dany Cotton told an inquiry into the blaze that they were put in an ""untenable situation"" and nothing could have stopped the spread of the fire. But survivors' group Grenfell United called her comments ""heartbreaking"" and ""disrespectful"" to those who died. The fire in west London on 14 June last year led to the deaths of 72 residents. Ms Cotton, who was appointed in January 2017, was asked at the inquiry in central London if there was one aspect of the fire brigade's response which she would go back and change. Survivors shook their heads as she said she ""would not change anything we did on the night"". She said: ""I think without exception my firefighters, my officers, and my control staff performed in a fantastic way given the incredible circumstances they were faced with. ""They were pulled into an untenable situation, a building that behaved in a way it should never have done, that put the residents' lives at risk. ""Without a shadow of a doubt, I personally was responsible for committing my firefighters to their potential death in the pursuit of rescuing as many people in that building as possible."" What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Grenfell Tower was 'unsafe to live in' Ms Cotton said that even specific training in dealing with blazes involving cladding wouldn't have helped the firefighters. She said she had never received any training on the spread of fire on cladding, but said the fire would have been deemed an ""unrealistic scenario"". This video can not be played Dany Cotton says she wanted firefighters to know she was there for them as they went into the tower ""I wouldn't develop a training package for a space shuttle to land in front of the Shard"", she said. ""I wouldn't expect us to be developing training or a response to something that simply shouldn't happen."" But steps had been taken since, with full evacuation plans made and local authorities removing cladding, she said. ""We can no longer think that another fire like Grenfell Tower wouldn't happen, because we've seen it happen, and now we have to be able to deal with it"", she added. But Natasha Elcock, of Grenfell United, said the brigade should have learnt lessons from a previous tower block fire in Camberwell in 2009 in which six people were killed. ""To not prepare for a repeat of Lakanal House and say chances are like a space ship on the Shard is flippant and disrespectful. ""If anything, her answers suggests a culture of complacency and focus on damage limitation,"" she added. ""People are going to bed tonight in towers with cladding on and change needs to come fast to keep them safe."" In a witness statement, Ms Cotton described how she first saw the blaze through her car windscreen as she arrived at Grenfell Tower at 02:49 BST. ""It just looked like something from a disaster movie. Like a hideous mixture of 'Towering Inferno' and a video I was shown in training school of a high rise fire in Sao Paulo where people jumped to escape."" The commissioner also revealed that she had wanted crews to know someone cared as they went into the tower. She said: ""I recall I actually physically went and touched some firefighters when I spoke to them, because I was not 100% convinced in my mind that everybody was going to come out of there alive. ""I wanted those firefighters to have a positive reinforced memory before they went into the building of somebody saying nice things to them, being supportive and demonstrating to them that somebody really cared."" She said she was hit by an ""overwhelming anxiety"" about committing firefighters to the blaze when she could not guarantee their safety. Ms Cotton added: ""People will quite rightly have questions, but for me I could not be more proud of the absolute commitment and dedication of the firefighters. ""They were clearly terrified of going into Grenfell Tower."" Ms Cotton said she had memory blanks from the night because of the ""traumatic nature and sheer scale"" of the incident. She said she had undergone counselling after the fire to help improve her memory, but it had not been ""terribly successful"". She also told the inquiry how she had blocked out a memory where a 6ft piece of debris almost hit her and could have killed her. ""I'm still finding it very difficult to look at visual images and have conversations about Grenfell,"" Ms Cotton added.

"More than 40 university bosses have written to the education secretary calling for so-called essay mill companies to be banned. Some students pay for bespoke, original assignments - which cannot easily be detected by anti-plagiarism software. But the letter says these essay-writing services should be targeted rather than those who pay for their services. Such services undermine the integrity of higher education and are unfair to honest, diligent students, they say. Universities minister Sam Gyimah said the government was working to ""bear down"" on the problem - and added that ""legislative options are not off the table"". Passing off a custom-made essay as your own is a form of plagiarism known as contract cheating It involves a student ordering an essay, usually through a website, for a fee But it could also be friends or family members writing an essay on a student's behalf Companies offering these sort of services are known as essay mills The fee will usually depend on the essay subject, length and deadline The letter has been signed by 46 vice-chancellors and heads of higher education bodies, some of whom represent the UK's largest and most prestigious universities. Students caught submitting work that is not their own face serious penalties, which can include being thrown off their university course. However, in the UK it is not illegal to offer a commercial essay-writing service. And many advertise widely near university campuses and on social media. 'One in seven' paying for uni essays Reality Check: Knowledge for sale? A recent survey of students around the world by Swansea University found about 15% had cheated in the past four years, up from an average of 3.5% over the past 40 years. It also suggested 31 million students globally had paid someone else to undertake their work. The vice-chancellors say making the services illegal would stop them operating out of the UK and allow them to be removed from online search engine findings. In the letter, they call on the government to commit to introducing legislation to ban the provision and advertising of essay mills before the end of this Parliament. This video can not be played The YouTubers selling cheating: ""Get an A on your paper - and you don't even need to do it"" (May 2018 video) They also want the government to support efforts by Quality and Assurance Agency (QAA), the higher education standards body, and the Office for Students (OFS) to tackle the issue. The QAA has previously proposed that a UK Centre for Academic Integrity is established with a remit to research and analyse academic misconduct. Essay mill companies are already banned in New Zealand and some parts of the United States. There is currently an online petition calling for a change to UK law. 'Misleading' essay writing ads banned Essay cheat companies face university ban One of the signatories on the letter is the vice-chancellor of the University of Nottingham, Prof Shearer West. Like many universities, it tries to deter students from contract cheating. ""We promote study skills and support students in researching and writing effectively, to ensure they don't veer into plagiarism,"" a university representative said. The university also uses ""specialist software, email filters and academic review to counter plagiarism - and the promotion of essay mills is of course banned on campus"". ""Ultimately, the best way to tackle essay mills is to ban them, which is why our vice-chancellor has signed the open letter calling on government to legislate in this area."" Universities Minister Sam Gyimah said: ""I expect universities to be educating students about these services and highlight the stiff, and possibly life-changing, penalties they face. ""I also want the sector to do more to grip the problem - for example by tackling advertising of these services in their institutions and finally blocking these services from sending an alarming number of emails to the inboxes of university students and staff. ""I have been working with organisations across the higher education sector to bear down on this problem and this has already resulted in the likes of YouTube removing adverts for these essay mills, but legislative options are not off the table."" Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students, said the rise in the use of essay mills in recent years had sought to turn cheating into an industry. ""Essay mills are deeply unethical, and their operation is unfair on the vast majority of students who hand in their own work. ""The Office for Students has a central role to play in ending essay mills; universities and colleges wishing to register with us must demonstrate that they are protecting the reliability and credibility of degree standards."" Dan Burns paid nearly Â£65 for an essay on the portrayal of women in Oliver Twist and Jane Eyre while investigating ""essay mill"" companies for the student websiteThe Tab.,external ""The service was quite professional. It wasn't some kind of dark website,"" he told BBC News. ""You could get undergraduate essays, postgraduate essays. You could get whole dissertations. [There were] different services where you could actually talk to the person who was writing your essay. ""This person told me I would be getting a high quality product written by masters students, PhD students, and he was essentially telling me no-one would know I'd used a fake essay writing website and that it would get me this 2:1, First kind of level, and I would have to put no work in. ""The essay was terrible. I took it to my lecturer and he kind of skim read it and said, 'Well, it wouldn't get any more than a 2:2'. But the more we looked into it and the more we read it and the way we looked at the grammar it would barely scrape a Third really... There were just really basic sentences"".

"A California professor and President Donald Trump's pick to become the next Supreme Court justice will appear before senators to tell conflicting stories about a high school party 36 years ago. The accuser and the accused, in the glare of the spotlight, with a lifetime seat to the most powerful court in the US at stake. While the drama will be intensely personal, as she alleges he assaulted her and he strongly rejects the accusation, this is more than a clash of two individuals and their recollection of past events. It also represents the confluence of two movements - one decades in the making, the other a recent, powerful groundswell. ""These are unwitting combatants in an undeclared war, these people are not props for us to make our political points, nor are they to be demolished,"" Arizona Senator Jeff Flake said on Wednesday afternoon. The futures - and the reputations - of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford hang in the balance. Whether they like it or not, however, the forces at motion overshadow everything. The Brett Kavanaugh story in 300 words Accuser says 'assault altered my life' Forty-five years ago, a sharply divided US Supreme Court ruled in Roe v Wade that first-trimester abortion must be legal throughout the nation. The decision came as a shock to the anti-abortion activists, who have been fighting to reverse the decision since. They've supported federal and state-level laws that would chip away at abortion rights. And they have organised what amounts to a pipeline of young conservative jurists, groomed by organisations like the Federalist Society, in order to assure anti-abortion voices in the federal judiciary. Both Donald Trump's Supreme Court picks, Neil Gorsuch and now Mr Kavanaugh, were on that approved list. Crucially, this nominee would alter the ideological composition of the court. Anti-abortion activists believe they at last will have five votes - a majority - on the court to return the question of abortion legality to the states, where some legislatures could decide to outlaw the procedure entirely. This fight, then, marks the culmination of a decades-long struggle. Victory, at last, is within grasp. It is a victory that Christine Blasey Ford threatens. The #MeToo movement has a history measured in months, not years, but the struggle it represents is at least as powerful and enduring. It represented a drive to rethink what was previously tolerated by women and what society has long swept under the rug. In Dr Ford, they found a new champion and, after Mr Trump questioned why she didn't come forward sooner, a new hashtag, #WhyIDidntReport. This video can not be played Why it can take sexual assault allegations years to come out That the latest fight should come during a Supreme Court confirmation hearing has a certain poetic symmetry, given the spectacle of the Clarence Thomas nomination - during which he faced allegations of serial sexual harassment - fuelled the rise of a new generation of female politicians in the 1992 national elections, termed the ""year of the woman"". The woman who made those accusations, Anita Hill, herself became a hero for the feminist movement - and a villain to conservatives who at the time painted her allegations as an overtly political attempt to derail a Supreme Court nomination. Last week Ms Hill weighed in on the importance of the current moment for the women's rights movement. Anita Hill testified at a 1991 Senate hearing about sexual harassment allegations against then Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas ""In 1991, the phrase 'they just don't get it' became a popular way of describing senators' reaction to sexual violence,""she wrote,externalin The New York Times. ""With years of hindsight, mounds of evidence of the prevalence and harm that sexual violence causes individuals and our institutions, as well as a Senate with more women than ever, 'not getting it' isn't an option for our elected representatives. In 2018, our senators must get it right."" This ability to ""get it right"" this time would be a sign that the #MeToo movement has made real progress in changing American perceptions toward female victims. It is a victory that Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation threatens. It's impossible to consider the #MeToo movement without also acknowledging the man who in all likelihood contributed to the emergence of this national mood. The president largely stayed above the fray in the days after Dr Ford's allegations, but his tone has sharpened as new accusers have come forward. It sets up what can only be an uncomfortable situation for some conservatives, where a man who has boasted about making unwanted sexual advances on women is vouching for someone accused of making unwanted sexual advances on women - and worse. In fact,in a tweet the president drew a direct line,externalbetween allegations of his own sexual misdeeds with those of Mr Kavanaugh, calling them both ""false accusations"". According to a White House source talking to CNN, Mr Trump now believes he must ""personally take charge of defending"" Mr Kavanaugh. The president later said he was open to withdrawing his backing of the judge if the testimony was damning but he has given himself little room to back down. This video can not be played Washington may have had a bad past - Trump Perhaps because of the stakes involved, it was inevitable that the Kavanaugh fight would descend into total political war. Long-respected political norms and traditions have been cast aside en masse over the course of recent years. No weapon is left unused and no attack untried. The debate about Kavanaugh and the issues raised by the allegations haven't merely been the province of the key players - the parties involved, the senators considering the judge's professional fate and the administration that put him forward for consideration. On social media and television commentary, conspiracy theories swirl and unsubstantiated or outright fabricated allegations fly. In comments made from the floor of the Senate on Wednesday, Mr Flake spoke of the toll the confirmation fight was having on the fabric of American society. ""The toxic political culture that we have created has infected everything, and we have done little to stop it,"" he said. ""In fact, we have only indulged it, and fanned the flames, taken partisan advantage at every turn, and deepened the ugly divisions that exist in our country."" As the moment of reckoning for Mr Kavanaugh approaches, both sides warn of the dangers to come. This video can not be played Republican Senator calls Trump 'uninformed and uncaring' Conservatives caution that there is more at stake than just the fate of one judge seeking higher office. ""If somebody can be brought down by accusations like this, then you, me, every man certainly should be worried,"" a lawyer close to the White Housetold Politico,external. ""We can all be accused of something."" ""The reason Republicans are standing with Kavanaugh is because we know he is innocent and we know the Dems would falsely accuse Jesus himself if the GOP had nominated him,""writes,externalconservative commentator Erick Erickson. Progressives counter with their own warnings - that brave women are finally speaking up and the men in power ignore this at their peril. ""Oh man - the male lawmakers in this country have no idea what's coming, do they?""tweeted,externalgrass-roots anti-gun activist Shannon Watts. ""Women are realising we're more powerful - and maligned - than we ever imagined. We're taking back what's ours: our voices, our rights and our seats at the table."" Both sides view this as a defining moment - their chance to draw a line in the sand. And with mid-term elections just over a month away, voters will have a chance to weigh in while the conflict is still fresh in their minds. The results, whether it's a Democratic wave or a Republican consolidation of power, will be interpreted in the context of the outcome of the court battle in the coming days and weeks. But the shadow cast will endure well beyond the immediate political future. ""These past two years, we have tested the limits of how low we can go,"" Mr Flake said. ""I say to you that winning at all costs is too high a cost. If we cannot have a human - rather than a political - response to these witnesses, if we are heedless to the capacity that we have to do real and lasting damage, then maybe we shouldn't be here."" Maybe so, but here we are.

"Claimants also included (clockwise from top left) Kym Marsh, Kate Ford, Alan Halsall, Lucy-Jo Hudson, Jimmi Harkishin and Samia Ghadie Six Coronation Street stars and ex-boxer Frank Bruno are among the latest celebrities to settle phone-hacking claims with News Group Newspapers. Sixteen cases were heard at London's High Court, including Kym Marsh - who plays Michelle Connor in the ITV soap - and Jimmi Harkishin, who plays Dev. Comedians Les Dennis and Bob Mortimer also received payouts. NGN paid ""substantial damages"" to 16 claimants and apologised for hacking at the now defunct News of the World. Phone-hacking trial explained The firm - formerly called News International - made no admissions in respect of alleged hacking at the Sun. NGN has settled more than 1,000 claims since the phone-hacking scandal began to emerge in 2005. Other Coronation Street stars to receive payouts included Kate Ford, known for her role as Tracy Barlow, and Samia Ghadie, who plays Maria Connor. Alan Halsall, who plays Tyrone Dobbs in the soap, and his ex-wife Lucy-Jo Hudson, who played Katy Harris from 2002-05, also settled their claims. Model Nancy Moir, comedian Les Dennis and ex-boxer Frank Bruno (from left to right) Former world heavyweight champion Bruno said no-one believed he had been hacked. ""For years I said I was being hacked, but people just said, 'Poor old Frank he's really lost it this time,'"" he said. ""No amount of money will never pay for the stress this caused, the sleepless nights, and the countless rows I had with people who I thought had leaked stories to the press. ""The people who did this are the lowest of the low. Gutter press is a good description."" He added: ""My mum used to say that we need to forgive those who have wronged us and, despite what I have been through, I will try and put this horrible episode behind me."" The other cases to be settled were: Ben Freeman, who plays Scott Windsor in ITV's Emmerdale Carole Caplin, the ex-style adviser to Cherie Blair Simon Clegg, formerly of the British Olympic Association Samuel Preston, ex-singer of band The Ordinary Boys Model Nancy Moir, wife of comedian Jim Moir, who is better known as Vic Reeves Rupert Lowe, ex-chairman of Southampton Football Club Chris Herbert, who helped to oversee the careers of the pop bands the Spice Girls, 5ive and Hear'Say Lawyer Claire Greaney of Charles Russell Speechlys, which represented the Coronation Street stars, added: ""Everyone has the right to privacy and confidentiality. ""Violating that right was simply unacceptable. While our clients have a public profile, their private life is just that - private - and should be respected as such."" Each of the stars settled their cases and received damages and an apology in open court for misuse of their private information. The News of the World was closed in 2011 after its owners, Rupert Murdoch's News International, admitted the scale of hacking that had been going on, dating back many years.

"From dream job to reality: The most typical type of work turned out to be a sales assistant When young people were asked in 2011 about the careers they wanted, the most popular ambitions were for jobs such as doctors, vets, firefighters, police officers, nurses, teachers and actors. But the Office for National Statistics has gone back and found a reality gap with what really happened to their lives six years later. Apart from those who aimed to go into teaching, less than one in 50 were in the career they had wanted - with most working as sales assistants, carers or in sales and marketing. They were also earning less than they had expected and fewer of them had gone to university than they had hoped. The ONS study asked 16- to 21-year-olds what they wanted to do in their working lives. Their priorities were to have jobs that were ""interesting"", ""secure"" and with family friendly hours. Less than one in 50 achieved their ambition of a health service job - and by age 30, typical earnings are Â£24,000 They aimed for a mix of glamorous and creative jobs, such as actors or in film or television, and jobs where they might help the public, such as a range of health service jobs or in the police or emergency services. Teaching was also popular - and almost one in 20 of those aiming to work in education achieved their goal, much higher than any of the other popular career ambitions. Education was one of the biggest sources of employment and proved to have been the most realistic career choice. But there was a huge gap between the career dream and the reality for most, when this age group had reached their early to late-20s, in 2017. The report, Young people's career aspirations versus reality, shows how few got the top choices they had hoped for: Only 1.4% had got jobs in the media or arts, such as a producer, actor or writer Only 1.7% were in jobs such as the police or emergency services Only about 1.7% became health professionals, such as dentists or pharmacists The most typical jobs for these people in their twenties included: sales assistants and cashiers caring and personal services teaching and education-related sales and marketing administration IT childcare financial services 'other elementary services' There were rising numbers of people in this age group working in caring and IT but there had been a decline in construction jobs. The ONS study, based on its annual population survey and its understanding society survey, also found that young people were likely to face disappointments in pay. About one in 20 expected to be earning Â£80,000 by the age of 30 - but the ONS projects average earnings of less than Â£24,000. Nick Chambers, chief executive of the Education and Employers careers charity, said young people's ambitions were often defined by the limited range of jobs they knew about - such as teachers they saw in school, the jobs they saw on television or the jobs of their family and friends. And this could be a barrier to social mobility. ""You can't be it, if you can't see it,"" he said. ""There's a mismatch between the jobs that young people know about and the reality of the jobs market."" Who are the children hoping to earn Â£24 an hour?

"This video can not be played Jack Burn died hours after being born at Princess Royal Hospital in Telford An NHS trust at the centre of concerns over its maternity services has been asked to hand over hundreds of records to regulators, BBC News has learned. The Shrewsbury and Telford trust will have to provide details over almost two decades of all stillbirths, maternal and neonatal deaths and significant harm in maternity services. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said ""all potential cases"" should be looked at. The trust has always said it would co-operate fully with a review. The ongoing independent review of maternity services at the Shrewsbury and Telford trustwas ordered by the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt last year. Mr Hancock said: ""The investigation that has been set up can range as wide as needed to make sure that we get to the bottom of what happened, that families can find out what happened, and that we can learn the lessons from it. ""We've got to get to the truth."" Tasha Turner and partner Jacob's baby Esmai died in 2013 at Royal Shrewsbury Hospital Two families who both lost a child through errors by the trust had written to Mr Hunt raising concerns about 23 incidents. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Since then, scores of other families have come forward to allege they too were failed. The BBC reported last week thatmore than 100 cases were now being considered by the independent review, which is being led by experienced midwife Donna Ockenden. The regulator, NHS Improvement, has now told the BBC that it has extended the review. In a statement, it said the trust would be required to provide a list of maternity incidents between 1998 and 2017. Its records will be matched up with the names of those families who have come forward. Mother and baby deaths review widened Further review into maternity care Cluster of baby deaths probe ordered For any cases that the trust has not investigated, the regulator said ""these will be referred back to trust"". It added: ""Our focus is still to do this properly and thoroughly as that will enable the greatest learning and is what those affected deserve."" It also emerged last week that another regulator, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), has identified problems with current services, particularly the way in which the trust cares for women deemed to have a high-risk pregnancy. The trust has maintained it was co-operating fully with the independent review. It said it was also working with the CQC over its ongoing concern and it insisted its maternity services were safe. The trust will hold a board meeting later at which its maternity services will be discussed. The board is also expected to confirm the closure of the Accident and Emergency unit in Telford overnight, due to to problems recruiting enough staff.

"Long term plans for the site of Grenfell Tower have yet to be finalised The head of London Fire Brigade says she would not have changed anything about the way her crews responded to the Grenfell Tower fire. Dany Cotton told an inquiry into the blaze that they were put in an ""untenable situation"" and nothing could have stopped the spread of the fire. But survivors' group Grenfell United called her comments ""heartbreaking"" and ""disrespectful"" to those who died. The fire in west London on 14 June last year led to the deaths of 72 residents.

"Long term plans for the site of Grenfell Tower have yet to be finalised The head of London Fire Brigade says she would not have changed anything about the way her crews responded to the Grenfell Tower fire. Dany Cotton told an inquiry into the blaze that they were put in an ""untenable situation"" and nothing could have stopped the spread of the fire. But survivors' group Grenfell United called her comments ""heartbreaking"" and ""disrespectful"" to those who died. The fire in west London on 14 June last year led to the deaths of 72 residents. Ms Cotton, who was appointed in January 2017, was asked at the inquiry in central London if there was one aspect of the fire brigade's response which she would go back and change.

"A woman has testified that the man nominated for a vacant post on the US Supreme Court by Donald Trump carried out a sexual assault 36 years ago that ""drastically"" affected her life. Christine Blasey Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Brett Kavanaugh's attack on her had left her ""afraid and ashamed"". Mr Kavanaugh has denied allegations by Dr Ford, along with those of a number of other women. He is now testifying to the committee. The nine-member Supreme Court plays a vital role in US political life, as it has the final say on US law. This includes highly contentious social issues, such as abortion, and challenges to government policy. President Trump has called the hearing an ""important day in the history of our country"". LIVE coverage of events Key takeaways from Ford's testimony #BelieveWomen v #BackBrett The Brett Kavanaugh story in 300 words No-one had heard from 51-year-old Dr Ford publicly since the allegations arose. After addresses by the leading Republican and Democrat members, Dr Ford delivered her opening statement, at times close to tears. In her testimony, Dr Ford said: ""I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified. I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school."" She alleged Mr Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge had locked her in a bedroom during a small gathering at a house in a Washington DC suburb in the summer of 1982. #WhyIDidntReport supports Professor Ford Why US top court is so much more political than UK's She said Mr Kavanaugh had tried to remove her clothing, pinned her to a bed and groped her, when she was 15 and he was 17. Both men were ""drunkenly laughing"", she said. This video can not be played 'Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me yelling' She added: ""Brett's assault on me drastically altered my life. For a very long time, I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone the details."" Under questioning by a Democratic senator, she said her most vivid memory was ""the laughter between the two and their having fun at my expense... they were laughing with each other - two friends having a really good time with one another"". In an answer to another Democratic senator's question about claims of mistaken identity, Dr Ford said she was ""100%"" certain it was Mr Kavanaugh who had assaulted her. The 21 senators on the committee were given five minutes each to ask her questions. The 10 Democrats posed questions themselves, many paying tribute to Dr Ford's bravery in coming forward - and supporting her call for an FBI investigation into her allegations. The 11 Republicans, all men, deferred most of their questions to a female lawyer, Phoenix prosecutor Rachel Mitchell. This video can not be played Why it can take sexual assault allegations years to come out Taking a combative approach but occasionally becoming emotional, Mr Kavanaugh, 53, said he ""categorically"" denied Dr Ford's allegation and all other accusations against him. He accused Democratic senators of destroying his family and his good name for political reasons. ""This confirmation process has become a national disgrace,"" he told the committee. ""The constitution gives the Senate an important role in the confirmation process, but you have replaced advice and consent with search and destroy. This video can not be played Brett Kavanagh: ""I am innocent of this charge"" ""Since my nomination in July there has been a frenzy on the left to come up with something, anything to block my confirmation."" He insisted he would not be ""intimidated"" into withdrawing from the process. ""You may defeat me in the final vote but you'll never get me to quit. Never."" Who is Brett Kavanaugh? Mr Kavanaugh said he did not doubt that Dr Ford had been assaulted, but insisted: ""I've never sexually assaulted Dr Ford - or anyone."" He admitted he had drunk beer while at high school and under-age, but said he had never got so drunk as to forget events. He added that his calendars for 1982 - which he had kept - showed he had not attended a party at the location Dr Ford had described. Under hostile questioning from Democratic senators, he repeatedly insisted he was innocent and said an FBI investigation would be useless as it would not reach conclusions. Julie Swetnick in an image provided by her lawyer Michael Avenatti Yes, and new ones appeared as the hearing loomed. At present they are: Deborah Ramirez. The former Yale University classmate hassaid that Mr Kavanaugh once exposed himself to her at a dormitory party in the 1980s,external. She alleges the incident occurred during a drinking game and remembers Mr Kavanaugh standing to her right and laughing, pulling up his trousers Julie Swetnick. A Washington DC resident. In a sworn affidavit she alleges Mr Kavanaugh was involved in the drugging and sexual assault of girls at house parties in the 1980s. She says she was the victim of a gang rape in 1982 at a party attended by the judge Anonymous.A woman sent a letter to a Colorado senator,externalalleging her daughter had witnessed Mr Kavanaugh pushing a woman he was dating ""very aggressively and sexually"" against a wall in 1998 Mr Kavanaugh denies these allegations. In his written testimony he says: ""Over the past few days, other false and uncorroborated accusations have been aired. There has been a frenzy to come up with something - anything, no matter how far-fetched or odious - that will block a vote on my nomination. ""These are last-minute smears, pure and simple."" He has portrayed the events in political terms, accusing the Democrats of trying to block the nomination. This video can not be played Might Donald Trump consider withdrawing Kavanaugh? Mr Trump has repeatedly defended the judge's character, saying he is ""one of the highest quality people"" he has ever met. But the president on Wednesday did say he could withdraw the nomination if accusations against the judge were proven. He said: ""I can always be convinced. If I thought he was guilty of something like this, yes, sure. It's possible I'll hear that, and I'll say, 'hey, I'm changing my mind'. I want to watch."" The Senate Judiciary Committee must vote on Mr Kavanaugh's confirmation before it goes to the full Senate for a vote there. The supreme showdown for Trump's America Meet the Supremes - the judges on the top US court The committee is scheduled to vote on Friday but its chairman, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, has left open the possibility of a further delay. All 10 Democratic senators on the committee have called on President Trump to ""immediately withdraw"" Mr Kavanaugh's nomination. Republicans want their nominee in place before mid-term elections next month, when they could lose their 51-49 control of the Senate. Any confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh could also affect female voters in November. The confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas in 1991, despite allegations of sexual harassment, fuelled the rise of a new generation of female politicians in elections the following year. By BBC North America editor Jon Sopel It is hard to overstate the passions, the conspiracy theories, the mistrust and division this Supreme Court appointment has stirred. To make sense of this you have to understand two things about the Supreme Court - justices are appointed for life, and the Supreme Court, not politicians will ultimately decide on the most contentious issues of the day - from desegregating schools in the 1950s to abortion law, to gun control and to same-sex marriage. It was the Supreme Court that decided the outcome of the 2000 presidential election in favour of George W Bush. You name it, they rule on it. In the 2016 election, many Republicans voted for Donald Trump while holding their nose - but they did so because they thought he'd deliver on their long cherished dream of delivering a Supreme Court with a clear conservative majority for a generation. Now they fear it is slipping away. And the fact that Brett Kavanaugh's accusers have come forward at the last minute is seen by many Republicans - mostly male -  as a Democrat-inspired plot, not as a legitimate complaint. The culture wars that have simmered in America for 50 years are finding an extraordinary flashpoint today - cultural conservatives versus Me Too. And in this battle, Judge Kavanaugh and the female complainants are just collateral damage. The reverberations of this hearing will echo for a long time to come.

"Model and actress Cara Delevingne has shared why she was so reluctant to report sexual abuse. ""I felt ashamed of what happened and didn't want to publicly ruin someone's life,"" says Cara. Thousands of women have been sharing their stories under the hashtag WhyIDidntReport. It's gained popularity after Donald Trump suggested people who'd been abused in the past should've gone to the authorities sooner. This is all about Brett Kavanaugh, who the president nominated for a place on the US Supreme Court - the highest court in America. But since then, Mr Kavanuagh's beenaccused of inappropriate behaviour by a number of women. Some of the offences are said to have happened when he was still a teenager. After Donald Trump questioned why it wasn't reported at the time, women have been explaining why they didn't speak up about their own experiences.

In an Instagram post Cara claims he made advances towards her in a hotel room after asking her to kiss another woman. She added: ""I was so hesitant about speaking out.

"The region includes spectacular scenery Chile has launched a huge scenic route through its Patagonian wilderness to boost tourism and highlight the need for conservation. The Route of Parks covers 2,800km (1,740 miles) from the city of Puerto Montt down to Cape Horn. The trail was the idea of Tompkins Conservation, the foundation set up by US billionaire Douglas Tompkins and his wife Kristine. Last year the foundation donated vast amounts of land to Chile's government. The land has helped create a network of 17 national parks and the new route - called the Patagonian Route of Parks - connects all of them. Douglas Tompkins: The anti-capitalist who founded North Face ""We want Chile to be internationally recognised for having the most spectacular scenic route in the world, and thus become a benchmark for economic development based on conservation,"" said Carolina Morgado, executive director at Tompkins. A website for the new route says it encompasses three existing scenic routes,external- the Southern Way, the Patagonian channels and the End of the World Route. The sparsely inhabited terrain is known for its lakes, waterways and rich habitat of flora and fauna. Chile's network of national parks is a haven for wildlife The website includes advice on transport, accommodation and more than 50 GPS-traced paths. Mr Tompkins, a keen conservationist and the founder of North Face clothing, died in a kayaking accident in Chile in 2015. The businessman had bought up huge swathes of land in southern Chile and Argentina to preserve it. North Face founder dies in kayak accident His widow, Kristine McDivitt Tompkins, signed an agreement with the national government in March 2017, donating the land with the intention of creating a network of national parks roughly the size of Switzerland. Douglas Tompkins and his wife Kristine, pictured in 2009, were keen conservationists Then Chilean President Michelle Bachelet called the signing an ""unprecedented preservation effort"".

"Officials have also warned that there is a risk of price increases and supply shortages in the event of a no-deal. A no-deal Brexit could result in electricity blackouts across Northern Ireland, government officials have warned. Officials are preparing a 'no deal' notice about the impacts on the all-island Single Electricity Market (SEM). They have suggested there are risks of price increases and supply shortages. Most experts have considered the SEM to be a relatively unproblematic part of Brexit. The reason is that it is a UK-Ireland bilateral arrangement, rather than an EU arrangement. Reality Check: What would 'no deal' look like? Pet travel warning in no-deal Brexit plan Flights 'at risk' under no-deal Brexit What do the government's Brexit ""no-deal"" papers reveal? It has been in place since 2007 and allows for a single market to operate across Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. However, it is underpinned by the UK and Ireland's membership of the Internal Energy Market (IEM). All EU members participate in the IEM along with Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein. Participation requires alignment with EU rules including industrial emissions regulations and restrictions on state aid. The work carried out by UK officials says the surest way to maintain the SEM is for continued UK participation in the IEM. They suggest that in a no-deal Brexit, the SEM would, at best, continue but be at risk. They raise an alternative possibility that it could split ""leaving an insecure, isolated NI market"". That in turn could see bills in Northern Ireland rise by up to 34%, lead to blackouts and prompt government intervention. Keeping the SEM operating ""in any way possible"" is described as a priority. The officials suggest that even if there is no withdrawal deal, the government could seek a special deal with Ireland and the EU to keep the SEM operating. But they cautioned that such an arrangement would not fully mitigate legal risks to the SEM. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Christine Blasey Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Brett Kavanaugh's attack on her had left her ""afraid and ashamed"". Mr Kavanaugh has denied allegations by Dr Ford, along with those of a number of other women. He is now testifying to the committee. The nine-member Supreme Court plays a vital role in US political life, as it has the final say on US law. This includes highly contentious social issues, such as abortion, and challenges to government policy. President Trump has called the hearing an ""important day in the history of our country"". LIVE coverage of events Key takeaways from Ford's testimony #BelieveWomen v #BackBrett The Brett Kavanaugh story in 300 words No-one had heard from 51-year-old Dr Ford publicly since the allegations arose. After addresses by the leading Republican and Democrat members, Dr Ford delivered her opening statement, at times close to tears. In her testimony, Dr Ford said: ""I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified. I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school."" She alleged Mr Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge had locked her in a bedroom during a small gathering at a house in a Washington DC suburb in the summer of 1982. #WhyIDidntReport supports Professor Ford Why US top court is so much more political than UK's She said Mr Kavanaugh had tried to remove her clothing, pinned her to a bed and groped her, when she was 15 and he was 17. Both men were ""drunkenly laughing"", she said. This video can not be played 'Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me yelling' She added: ""Brett's assault on me drastically altered my life. For a very long time, I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone the details."" Under questioning by a Democratic senator, she said her most vivid memory was ""the laughter between the two and their having fun at my expense... they were laughing with each other - two friends having a really good time with one another"". In an answer to another Democratic senator's question about claims of mistaken identity, Dr Ford said she was ""100%"" certain it was Mr Kavanaugh who had assaulted her. The 21 senators on the committee were given five minutes each to ask her questions. The 10 Democrats posed questions themselves, many paying tribute to Dr Ford's bravery in coming forward - and supporting her call for an FBI investigation into her allegations. The 11 Republicans, all men, deferred most of their questions to a female lawyer, Phoenix prosecutor Rachel Mitchell. This video can not be played Why it can take sexual assault allegations years to come out Taking a combative approach but occasionally becoming emotional, Mr Kavanaugh, 53, said he ""categorically"" denied Dr Ford's allegation and all other accusations against him. He accused Democratic senators of destroying his family and his good name for political reasons. ""This confirmation process has become a national disgrace,"" he told the committee. ""The constitution gives the Senate an important role in the confirmation process, but you have replaced advice and consent with search and destroy. This video can not be played Brett Kavanagh: ""I am innocent of this charge"" ""Since my nomination in July there has been a frenzy on the left to come up with something, anything to block my confirmation."" He insisted he would not be ""intimidated"" into withdrawing from the process. ""You may defeat me in the final vote but you'll never get me to quit. Never."" Who is Brett Kavanaugh? Mr Kavanaugh said he did not doubt that Dr Ford had been assaulted, but insisted: ""I've never sexually assaulted Dr Ford - or anyone."" He admitted he had drunk beer while at high school and under-age, but said he had never got so drunk as to forget events. He added that his calendars for 1982 - which he had kept - showed he had not attended a party at the location Dr Ford had described. Under hostile questioning from Democratic senators, he repeatedly insisted he was innocent and said an FBI investigation would be useless as it would not reach conclusions. Julie Swetnick in an image provided by her lawyer Michael Avenatti Yes, and new ones appeared as the hearing loomed. At present they are: Deborah Ramirez. The former Yale University classmate hassaid that Mr Kavanaugh once exposed himself to her at a dormitory party in the 1980s,external. She alleges the incident occurred during a drinking game and remembers Mr Kavanaugh standing to her right and laughing, pulling up his trousers Julie Swetnick. A Washington DC resident. In a sworn affidavit she alleges Mr Kavanaugh was involved in the drugging and sexual assault of girls at house parties in the 1980s. She says she was the victim of a gang rape in 1982 at a party attended by the judge Anonymous.A woman sent a letter to a Colorado senator,externalalleging her daughter had witnessed Mr Kavanaugh pushing a woman he was dating ""very aggressively and sexually"" against a wall in 1998 Mr Kavanaugh denies these allegations. In his written testimony he says: ""Over the past few days, other false and uncorroborated accusations have been aired. There has been a frenzy to come up with something - anything, no matter how far-fetched or odious - that will block a vote on my nomination. ""These are last-minute smears, pure and simple."" He has portrayed the events in political terms, accusing the Democrats of trying to block the nomination. This video can not be played Might Donald Trump consider withdrawing Kavanaugh? Mr Trump has repeatedly defended the judge's character, saying he is ""one of the highest quality people"" he has ever met. But the president on Wednesday did say he could withdraw the nomination if accusations against the judge were proven. He said: ""I can always be convinced. If I thought he was guilty of something like this, yes, sure. It's possible I'll hear that, and I'll say, 'hey, I'm changing my mind'. I want to watch."" The Senate Judiciary Committee must vote on Mr Kavanaugh's confirmation before it goes to the full Senate for a vote there. The supreme showdown for Trump's America Meet the Supremes - the judges on the top US court The committee is scheduled to vote on Friday but its chairman, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, has left open the possibility of a further delay. All 10 Democratic senators on the committee have called on President Trump to ""immediately withdraw"" Mr Kavanaugh's nomination. Republicans want their nominee in place before mid-term elections next month, when they could lose their 51-49 control of the Senate. Any confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh could also affect female voters in November. The confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas in 1991, despite allegations of sexual harassment, fuelled the rise of a new generation of female politicians in elections the following year. By BBC North America editor Jon Sopel It is hard to overstate the passions, the conspiracy theories, the mistrust and division this Supreme Court appointment has stirred. To make sense of this you have to understand two things about the Supreme Court - justices are appointed for life, and the Supreme Court, not politicians will ultimately decide on the most contentious issues of the day - from desegregating schools in the 1950s to abortion law, to gun control and to same-sex marriage. It was the Supreme Court that decided the outcome of the 2000 presidential election in favour of George W Bush. You name it, they rule on it. In the 2016 election, many Republicans voted for Donald Trump while holding their nose - but they did so because they thought he'd deliver on their long cherished dream of delivering a Supreme Court with a clear conservative majority for a generation. Now they fear it is slipping away. And the fact that Brett Kavanaugh's accusers have come forward at the last minute is seen by many Republicans - mostly male -  as a Democrat-inspired plot, not as a legitimate complaint. The culture wars that have simmered in America for 50 years are finding an extraordinary flashpoint today - cultural conservatives versus Me Too. And in this battle, Judge Kavanaugh and the female complainants are just collateral damage. The reverberations of this hearing will echo for a long time to come.

"Long term plans for the site of Grenfell Tower have yet to be finalised The head of London Fire Brigade says she would not have changed anything about the way her crews responded to the Grenfell Tower fire. Dany Cotton told an inquiry into the blaze that they were put in an ""untenable situation"" and nothing could have stopped the spread of the fire. But survivors' group Grenfell United called her comments ""heartbreaking"" and ""disrespectful"" to those who died. The fire in west London on 14 June last year led to the deaths of 72 residents. Ms Cotton, who was appointed in January 2017, was asked at the inquiry in central London if there was one aspect of the fire brigade's response which she would go back and change. Survivors shook their heads as she said she ""would not change anything we did on the night"". She said: ""I think without exception my firefighters, my officers, and my control staff performed in a fantastic way given the incredible circumstances they were faced with. ""They were pulled into an untenable situation, a building that behaved in a way it should never have done, that put the residents' lives at risk. ""Without a shadow of a doubt, I personally was responsible for committing my firefighters to their potential death in the pursuit of rescuing as many people in that building as possible."" What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Grenfell Tower was 'unsafe to live in' Ms Cotton said that even specific training in dealing with blazes involving cladding wouldn't have helped the firefighters. She said she had never received any training on the spread of fire on cladding, but said the fire would have been deemed an ""unrealistic scenario"". This video can not be played Dany Cotton says she wanted firefighters to know she was there for them as they went into the tower ""I wouldn't develop a training package for a space shuttle to land in front of the Shard"", she said. ""I wouldn't expect us to be developing training or a response to something that simply shouldn't happen."" But steps had been taken since, with full evacuation plans made and local authorities removing cladding, she said. ""We can no longer think that another fire like Grenfell Tower wouldn't happen, because we've seen it happen, and now we have to be able to deal with it"", she added. But Natasha Elcock, of Grenfell United, said the brigade should have learnt lessons from a previous tower block fire in Camberwell in 2009 in which six people were killed. ""To not prepare for a repeat of Lakanal House and say chances are like a space ship on the Shard is flippant and disrespectful. ""If anything, her answers suggests a culture of complacency and focus on damage limitation,"" she added. ""People are going to bed tonight in towers with cladding on and change needs to come fast to keep them safe."" In a witness statement, Ms Cotton described how she first saw the blaze through her car windscreen as she arrived at Grenfell Tower at 02:49 BST. ""It just looked like something from a disaster movie. Like a hideous mixture of 'Towering Inferno' and a video I was shown in training school of a high rise fire in Sao Paulo where people jumped to escape."" The commissioner also revealed that she had wanted crews to know someone cared as they went into the tower. She said: ""I recall I actually physically went and touched some firefighters when I spoke to them, because I was not 100% convinced in my mind that everybody was going to come out of there alive. ""I wanted those firefighters to have a positive reinforced memory before they went into the building of somebody saying nice things to them, being supportive and demonstrating to them that somebody really cared."" She said she was hit by an ""overwhelming anxiety"" about committing firefighters to the blaze when she could not guarantee their safety. Ms Cotton added: ""People will quite rightly have questions, but for me I could not be more proud of the absolute commitment and dedication of the firefighters. ""They were clearly terrified of going into Grenfell Tower."" Ms Cotton said she had memory blanks from the night because of the ""traumatic nature and sheer scale"" of the incident. She said she had undergone counselling after the fire to help improve her memory, but it had not been ""terribly successful"". She also told the inquiry how she had blocked out a memory where a 6ft piece of debris almost hit her and could have killed her. ""I'm still finding it very difficult to look at visual images and have conversations about Grenfell,"" Ms Cotton added.

"An ageing fleet, high sickness rates and slow uptake of technology hampers the ability of the NHS to answer 999 calls quickly, a review says. The report produced for the regulator NHS Improvement found significant inefficiencies in England. If the problems are not addressed, it will be more difficult for ambulances to hit their targets, it said. In July eight out of 10 services missed their seven-minute target for answering the most life-threatening emergencies. Lord Carter, an expert in NHS productivity who carried out the review, called for an overhaul in approach. ""An ambulance is not a taxi to A&E. Modern technology means that patients can often be treated at the scene. ""But an ageing ambulance fleet means that this is not always possible."" The review found: The ambulance service had the highest rate of sickness in the NHS - 20 days per person High levels of bullying and harassment Auto-dispatch technology to speed up responses to cardiac arrests was not yet fully implemented 12 years on Use of digital technology to access patients records is in its infancy One in four ambulances was more than seven years old - the point at which annual maintenance costs start rising quickly and reliability deteriorates A 50% difference in costs between the most economical and least economical trusts per incident attended Significant differences in the proportion of patients being treated at the scene No fewer than 32 different types of ambulances - something the report said was ""simply unacceptable"" The review said tackling the problems identified could save Â£500m a year by 2021 - money that could then be reinvested into services. Lord Carter said: ""Paramedics and other staff have worked incredibly hard as demand for ambulances has soared. ""It is now vital that improvements are made in the infrastructure of the wider NHS to help front-line staff work as efficiently as possible."" The report said demand was predicted to increase by 38% over the next 10 years. Martin Flaherty, of the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, said it was clear improvements could be made. But he also pointed out that some of the variation was down to ""local geography and patient demographics"". And he said the availability and performance of other parts of the NHS also had an impact on ambulance performance. The report echoed this too - calling for more progress in extended GP opening hours and the availability of minor injury units, as well as help from hospitals in reducing the delays at A&E when paramedics hand over patients. The government has already taken some action. Earlier this year Â£36.3m  of funding was provided to pay for 256 new ambulances. Health Minister Steve Barclay urged action on Lord Carter's recommendations, saying they set out a vision for a ""modern"" ambulance service.

"A police policy brought in this year requires officers working with breathing apparatus to ""remain clean shaven whilst on duty"" A police officer is taking an industrial tribunal case against the PSNI over a ban on facial hair. It follows a police review of the force's policies in 2017. This resulted in a change regarding officers required to wear respiratory protective equipment (RPE) at short notice as part of their duties. The updated policy - implemented this year - requires these officers to ""remain clean shaven whilst on duty"" for health and safety reasons. The policy is to be challenged at an industrial tribunal scheduled to begin in November. Solicitor Niall McMullan, who is representing the officer, said the case focuses on the issues of sex discrimination and proportionality. ""He has worked in his particular division of the PSNI for six years and he will state he is yet to wear the relevant safety mask,"" said Mr McMullan. ""To request he now remain entirely clean shaven and remove from him the personal choice of having a moustache, does not appear proportionate or capable of being justified. ""Furthermore, he is concerned how this new policy is being implemented against men, whilst other sections of the policy, which are arguably more applicable to women, are being breached without action taken. ""My client will also state the manner in which the PSNI sought his adherence to the said policy, was victimisation."" Superintendent Patricia Foy from the PSNI's Operational Policy Department said: ""Officers and staff within certain roles are required to wear respiratory protective equipment (RPE) as a means of control to prevent the inhalation of hazardous substances at work. ""When worn and correctly used, RPE can prevent serious lung conditions caused by inhaling dust and other contaminants. Supt Foy said a range of guidance had been given as part of a review of the PSNI's corporate appearance and protective equipment standard policy in 2017. ""A study by the Health and Safety Executive indicated that 'as facial hair is grown, the protection offered by a tight-fitting mask reduces'. ""As a result, a change was made in relation to officers and staff who carry out those roles. ""The updated policy requires that those officers and staff who may be required at short notice to wear RPE must remain clean shaven whilst on duty."" Supt Foy said the new policy was developed in consultation with the Police Federation ""and other key stakeholders"".

"Some private nurseries are struggling to stay afloat, campaigners say Business rates will be scrapped for day nurseries in Wales after claims the industry was struggling to survive. Campaigners had called for the exemption to help nurseries deliver the Welsh Government pledge of 30 hours of free childcare a week. One nursery owner said the tax cut, worth Â£30,000 a year to his business, would help tackle a shortage in childcare providers. The cut will be brought in from April and last for three years. Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford said the tax cut will help nurseries become more established. It will be reviewed in 2022. The childcare scheme - aimed at working parents with three to four years olds - is currently being piloted ineight local authorities and in parts of six others,external. It is planned to be fully rolled out by 2020. Free childcare 'not taken by parents' Lack of childcare places to meet pledge Childcare pledge 'could cost Â£200m' Campaigners say that nurseries, with large properties and space for children to play, often face high business rates. A cut to business rates for childcare providers came into effect in April but National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA) estimated four in 10 private nurseries were still subject to the tax. Neil Blockley, who co-owns Little Inspirations which has six nurseries across South Wales, said childcare providers have ""small profit margins"" and face ""rising costs from pensions and the living wage"". Nursery owner Neil Blockley welcomed the reduction in overheads ""We know, particularly in Rhondda Cynon Taf and other areas of Wales, there are some real hot spots of shortage of childcare providers in certain areas,"" he said. ""This significant reduction in our overheads will make expansion opportunities happen faster."" Scotland scrapped business rates for nurseries for three years in April last year. Children's Minister Huw Irranca-Davies, said: ""The childcare sector has told us that a total exemption from non-domestic rates would make a real difference to their business confidence. Campaigners say some nurseries face higher business rates because of their large size ""We've listened and taken action."" Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of NDNA Cymru, said: ""This is fantastic news for all childcare businesses in Wales, especially the private sector nurseries who are struggling to remain sustainable. ""We have been working closely with the Welsh Government and put forward the arguments about why nurseries should be made a special case. Private and voluntary nurseries, who can give working parents the quality and flexibility they need and want, have been delivering funded childcare places at a loss for years. ""As the new Childcare Offer for Wales is rolled out across the country, this approach from the Welsh Government gives a clear message to the sector that they are valued and their involvement is crucial for this ambitious scheme to be successful.""

"Officials have also warned that there is a risk of price increases and supply shortages in the event of a no-deal. A no-deal Brexit could result in electricity blackouts across Northern Ireland, government officials have warned. Officials are preparing a 'no deal' notice about the impacts on the all-island Single Electricity Market (SEM). They have suggested there are risks of price increases and supply shortages. Most experts have considered the SEM to be a relatively unproblematic part of Brexit. The reason is that it is a UK-Ireland bilateral arrangement, rather than an EU arrangement. Reality Check: What would 'no deal' look like? Pet travel warning in no-deal Brexit plan Flights 'at risk' under no-deal Brexit What do the government's Brexit ""no-deal"" papers reveal? It has been in place since 2007 and allows for a single market to operate across Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. However, it is underpinned by the UK and Ireland's membership of the Internal Energy Market (IEM). All EU members participate in the IEM along with Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein. Participation requires alignment with EU rules including industrial emissions regulations and restrictions on state aid. The work carried out by UK officials says the surest way to maintain the SEM is for continued UK participation in the IEM. They suggest that in a no-deal Brexit, the SEM would, at best, continue but be at risk. They raise an alternative possibility that it could split ""leaving an insecure, isolated NI market"". That in turn could see bills in Northern Ireland rise by up to 34%, lead to blackouts and prompt government intervention. Keeping the SEM operating ""in any way possible"" is described as a priority. The officials suggest that even if there is no withdrawal deal, the government could seek a special deal with Ireland and the EU to keep the SEM operating. But they cautioned that such an arrangement would not fully mitigate legal risks to the SEM. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"A network of hi-tech taps is to be installed across Scotland to encourage people to use refillable water bottles. Scottish Water says its ""top-up taps"" will be fitted in about 30 towns and cities over the next two years. The first water refill point will be located outside the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh during October. Other taps could be fitted in Glasgow, Ayr, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Fort William Milngavie, Oban, Inverness and Aberdeen by the end of March. It is part of a drive to persuade more people to carry refillable bottles and cut down on single-use plastic.

"Under the law the woman could not be punished as an abettor - the man was considered to be a seducer India's top court has ruled adultery is no longer a crime, striking down a 158-year-old colonial-era law which it said treated women as male property. Previously any man who had sex with a married woman, without the permission of her husband, had committed a crime. A petitioner had challenged the law saying it was arbitrary and discriminated against men and women. It is not clear how many men have been prosecuted under the law - there is no data available. This is the second colonial-era law struck down by India's Supreme Court this month -it also overturned a 157-year-old law which effectively criminalised gay sex in India. While reading out the judgement on adultery, Chief Justice Dipak Misra said that while it could be grounds for civil issues like divorce, ""it cannot be a criminal offence"". Last August, Joseph Shine, a 41-year-old Indian businessman living in Italy, petitioned the Supreme Court to strike down the law. He argued that it discriminated against men by only holding them liable for extra-marital relationships, while treating women like objects. ""Married women are not a special case for the purpose of prosecution for adultery. They are not in any way situated differently than men,"" his petition said. The law, Mr Shine said, also ""indirectly discriminates against women by holding an erroneous presumption that women are the property of men"". In his 45-page petition, Mr Shine liberally quotes from American poet Ralph Waldo Emerson, women rights activist Mary Wollstonecraft and former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on gender equality and the rights of women. Previous pleas were dismissed by the court in the interests of ""stability of marriages"" However, India's ruling BJP government had opposed the petition, insisting that adultery should remain a criminal offence. ""Diluting adultery laws will impact the sanctity of marriages. Making adultery legal will hurt marriage bonds,"" a government counsel told the court, adding that ""Indian ethos gives paramount importance to the institution and sanctity of marriage"". The law dictated that the woman could not be punished as an abettor. Instead, the man was considered to be a seducer. It also did not allow women to file a complaint against an adulterous husband. A man accused of adultery could be sent to a prison for a maximum of five years, made to pay a fine, or both. And although there is no information on actual convictions under the law, Kaleeswaram Raj, a lawyer for the petitioner, said the adultery law was ""often misused"" by husbands during matrimonial disputes such as divorce, or civil cases relating to wives receiving maintenance. ""Men would often file criminal complaints against suspected or imagined men who they would allege were having affairs with their wives. These charges could never be proved, but ended up smearing the reputations of their estranged or divorced partners,"" he told the BBC. Ten laws that India should scrap Why India needs to get rid of its sedition law Interestingly, Indian folklore and epics are full of stories about extra-marital love. Most love poems in Sanskrit, according to scholar J Moussaief Masson, are ""about illicit love"". But Manusmriti, an ancient Hindu text, says: ""If men persist in seeking intimate contact with other men's wives, the king should brand them with punishments that inspire terror and banish them"". All five Supreme Court judges hearing the case said the law was archaic, arbitrary and unconstitutional. ""Husband is not the master of wife. Women should be treated with equality along with men,"" Chief Justice Misra said. Judge Rohinton Nariman said that ""ancient notions of man being perpetrator and woman being victim no longer hold good"". Justice DY Chandrachud said the law ""perpetuates subordinate status of women, denies dignity, sexual autonomy, is based on gender stereotypes"". He said the law sought to ""control sexuality of woman (and) hits the autonomy and dignity of woman"". Critics have called the law""staggeringly sexist"",external, ""'crudely anti-woman',external"", and ""'violative of the right to equality',external"". ""The legal system should not regulate whom one sleeps with,"" wrote Rashmi Kalia, who teaches law.,external The main concern, according to the respected journal Economic and Political Weekly,external, is ""not whether the expectations of fidelity in a marriage are right or wrong, or whether adultery denotes sexual freedom."" ""It is whether the state can and should monitor a relationship between adults that is too complex, sensitive and individual for it to be capable of doing in a just manner,"" the journal wrote in a recent editorial. The latest challenge was made in view of the ""changed social conditions"" Adultery is considered illegal in 21 American states, including New York, although surveys show that while most Americans disapprove of adultery, they don't think of it as a crime. ""The criminal statutes remain in force for largely symbolic reasons, and there isn't enough enforcement risk for anyone to incur the political costs of repealing them,"" Deborah Rhode, a professor of law at Stanford University and the author of Adultery: Infidelity and the Law told the BBC. Adultery is prohibited in Sharia or Islamic Law, so it is a criminal offence in Islamic countries such as Iran, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Somalia. Taiwan punishes adultery by up to a year in prison and it is also deemed a crime in Indonesia. In fact, Indonesia is drafting laws that prohibit all consensual sex outside the institution of marriage. In 2015, South Korea's Supreme Court struck down a similar law where a man could be sent to prison for two years or less for adultery. The court said the law violated self-determination and privacy. More than 60 countries around the world had done away with laws that made adultery a crime, according to Indian lawyer Kaleeswaram Raj. In the UK, adultery is not a criminal offence and like many other countries, one of the main reasons given for divorce. Couples cannot use adultery as a ground for divorce if they lived together as a couple for six months after the infidelity was known about. In 1954, the law was first challenged by a petitioner asking why women cannot be punished for the offence, and that such ""exemption was discriminatory"". Critics have called the law ""violative of right to equality"" The Supreme Court rejected the plea. Since then, the top court has rejected similar pleas, including the constitutional validity of the law, at least twice - 1985 and 1988. ""The stability of marriage is not an ideal to be scorned,"" a judge said in 1985. A married woman had approached the court, demanding the right to file a complaint of adultery against her husband's unmarried lover. The court, rather patronisingly, described the plea as a ""crusade by a woman against a woman"". It said the law was about punishing the ""outsider"" who ""breaks into the matrimonial home"" and ""violates its sanctity"". Two different panels on law reforms in 1971 and 2003 recommended that women should also be prosecuted for the offence. ""The society abhors marital infidelity. Therefore there is no good reason for not meting out similar treatment to the wife who has sexual intercourse with a married man,"" the 2003 panel, led by a judge, said. In 2011, the top court, hearing another plea, said the law was facing criticism for ""showing a strong gender bias, it makes the position of a married woman almost as a property of her husband"". Many Indians were not even aware the law existed. However, after Thursday's ruling, people have been largely supportive of the verdict. Allow Twitter content?

"He is currently being treated at a hospital on an island in the Indian Ocean Indian solo yachtsman Abhilash Tomy who was rescued from the middle of the Indian Ocean on Monday has said that he survived because of his ""sailing skills"" and ""naval training"". Mr Tomy was stranded 3,200km (2,000 miles) off the coast of Western Australia after his boat was badly damaged during a storm on 21 September. He is reportedly undergoing treatment at a medical facility. The Indian Navy tweeted on behalf of Mr Tomy on Wednesday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""He rates his health as three on 10 as of now,"" navy spokesperson Captain D K Sharma told the Hindustan Times newspaper. He is currently being treated on Amsterdam Island, a French territory in the area where he got into trouble. It's home to temporary workers at a volcanic research facility and has a hospital. After treatment for back injuries, he is expected to be transferred to an Australian naval ship. Reality Check: The worst place to be stranded at sea? Injured Indian sailor rescued by French vessel Mr Tomy was participating in the Golden Globe round-the-world race. After his satellite phone was broken, he used a texting unit to communicate with the race organisers. He was able to send a message saying he had a severe back injury and was immobilised. Rescue teams from various nations, including India, had raced towards him, but the French fishing vessel Osiris reached him first. A doctor and a stretcher were on board the vessel. Abhilash Tomy has already sailed round the world once in 2013 Mr Tomy's boat, the Thuriya, is a replica of Robin Knox-Johnston's Suhaili, winner of the first Golden Globe Race in 1968. Friday's storm, which damaged the vessel, whipped up 70-knot winds and 14-metre (45ft) waves, and also knocked down the yacht of another competitor, Dutchman Mark Slats, twice. Fortunately for Mr Tomy, the 14m (46ft) waves and winds of up to 70 knots subsided before the French boat arrived. Loneliness is part of being a long-distance yachtsman, but the spot where he was stranded was not the most isolated in the world's oceans, in terms of distance from any land.

"Energy regulator Ofgem has ordered 11 of the UK's biggest suppliers to improve how they deal with complaints. The regulator said it had ""compliance cases"" open against four companies over customer dissatisfaction with how they handled complaints. It has also asked another seven to improve their procedures. However, the chief executive of industry body Energy UK said suppliers' overall performance in dealing with consumers' problems was improving. Lawrence Slade pointed to Ofgem's own figures which showed that the number of complaints received by suppliers had nearly halved since 2014. However, when the regulator last carried out its complaint handling survey in 2016 only two firms were singled out for their performance. Following its latest survey, Ofgem has opened compliance cases into First Utility, Ovo Energy and Utilita over their poor handling of customers' grievances. It has also expanded a customer service compliance case against ScottishPower to include how they handled complaints. During the compliance process Ofgem works with the energy suppliers to achieve improvements. If that does not work the regulator could then open an enforcement case, which could result in the supplier having to pay a fine. Ofgem has also required all the other domestic suppliers included in its survey - British Gas, Npower, Utility Warehouse, SSE, EDF Energy, E.On and Co-operative Energy - to come up with plans to improve how they deal with complaints. Dermot Nolan, chief executive of Ofgem, said: ""Although the level of satisfaction about complaint handling has increased over the past two years, it is still unacceptably low. Ofgem's customer complaints survey is carried out every two years. This year it found that of more than 3,000 domestic customers who had complained about their energy companies, 32% were satisfied with how their complaint was dealt with, up from 27% in 2016. But 57% of respondents said they were dissatisfied. The main causes of their dissatisfaction were the time taken to resolve the issue, not being kept up to date on the progress of the complaint, and suppliers not giving complainants a clear idea of how long the issue will take to be resolved. Gillian Guy, chief executive at Citizens Advice, said it was ""simply not good enough"" that only a third of customers were happy with how their complaints had been handled. ""Resolving issues in a timely manner and keeping customers informed about their complaints are just the basics. Suppliers need to also make sure that anyone who complains has access to independent advice,"" she added. Matthew Vickers, chief executive at the Energy Ombudsman, said the remit of the Ofgem survey should be widened beyond large and medium-sized suppliers. ""More than 40% of complaints that come to us are about smaller suppliers, so including customers of these companies would give a more complete picture of the energy sector's performance on complaint handling,"" he said. Energy UK's Lawrence Slade said his organisation was working with the industry and Ofgem to see if the rules governing the complaints handling process could be improved. ""Also, given that the majority of complaints arise from billing issues, the continuing roll-out of smart meters, which ensure accurate and up-to-date bills, will help reduce this number further still,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Patrick Kehoe was pinned to the ground at Dublin Airport A passenger has been pinned to the ground by police at Dublin Airport after running out of the terminal towards a plane and shouting at the pilot to wait. Patrick Kehoe, 23, made it to the taxiing Ryanair aircraft before police arrested him at about 07:00 local time. He has been charged with criminal damage to a door lock and granted bail. A ground crew member said he ""just ran from the building towards the plane"", which was departing for Amsterdam. The Irish man was ""quite determined"" to make his flight, an eyewitness told Irish broadcaster RTÃ, adding that he ran towards the plane ""with his suitcase under his arm"".

"Jo Swinson became the first MP to take her baby into a Commons debate Ten big-name businesses have agreed to publish parental leave and pay policies online. It means people will not have to ask for the information when they apply or go for a job interview. The change has been driven by MP Jo Swinson, who wants all big firms to be transparent on leave policies. She is calling for all companies employing more than 250 people to have to make this information easily available. Matt Turner says his employer Santander has a good parental leave policy Matt Turner has two young sons. Knowing that Santander would give him four weeks full paternity pay made him stay with the business. He thinks that it's important to be up-front about these policies. ""Jobs are not seen as just a source of income,"" he said. ""People are interested in what benefits are available, too."" Matt said it's not easy to feel confident to ask about parental leave when applying for a job or in an interview - and that information needs to be available to would-be mums and dads. Santander is one of ten UK firms to have signed up to publish policies on pay and leave. Jessica Chu, who heads up inclusion at the bank, wants to see other firms do the same: ""It really lets potential employees choose who they want to work with and see the benefits that are on offer for them."" Accountancy firm PwC has signed up too - and said the move marked another step towards levelling the playing field when it comes to recruitment and progression. ""We're working hard to create a culture where parents feel supported and different ways of working are celebrated,"" said Laura Hinton, PwC chief people officer, adding that the firm want dads to feel as comfortable as mums when it comes to requesting information. Ms Swinson, who is deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, thinks there's no excuse for firms not putting this information online. ""Companies all have to have a parental pay and leave policy, even if it's as simple as statutory, but there are many offering more,"" she said. ""It's an opportunity for businesses to sell themselves."" Ms Swinson is motivated by data that shows over 50,000 women have lost their job when they start a family. ""I think this would lead to more questions being asked in board rooms and in local cafes about who has the better policy and that itself will drive progress."" She believes this information should be published alongside gender pay gap data each year. Helen Bryce would not ask about a firm's parental leave policy in a job interview The idea gets the thumbs up from Helen Bryce, who runs recruitment business Guilty Mothers Club, that supports working parents. She said that parents have told her about companies that view children as an ""inconvenience."" ""You would always have in the back of your mind that this was the reason you did not get a job,"" she said. ""Would I ask about this in an interview? Absolutely not."" Helen said this caused women's careers to stagnate: ""It's easier to get back into the same job and work flexibly than it is to seek out new opportunities"" Workplace discrimination when pregnant is covered by the Equalities Act (2010) but it is tricky to prove discrimination when applying for jobs and considering starting a family. A recent Equalities and Human Rights Commission survey found it was common for companies to ask about family plans and that this kind of discrimination has increased 'significantly' over the last decade or so. Business group the CBI welcomed firms taking proactive steps. ""Companies that place inclusion at the heart of their business are more engaged, competitive and productive,"" said Matthew Fell, CBI chief UK policy director. ""Voluntary action of this kind can only be positive and we'd encourage firms to make this information publically available.""

"The Place Jo Cox sign was unveiled during a ceremony to the name the square after her A square in the centre of Brussels has been named after Jo Cox, the Labour MP who was murdered two years ago. The square is near the Ancienne Belgique concert venue that Mrs Cox attended when she lived in Belgium. The naming ceremony was led by the Mayor of Brussels and attended by members of Mrs Cox's family and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Mrs Cox, 41,was killed in 2016 by right-wing extremist Thomas Mair, in Birstall, West Yorkshire. She lived in Belgium for six years before being elected to Parliament to represent the Batley and Spen constituency in 2015. Mr Corbyn thanked the people of Brussels for the ""truly wonderful gesture"" to honour mother-of-two who was ""so cruelly killed, so young, in such a brutal way"". He told a crowd of friends and relatives in Place Jo Cox: ""She always gave this message that we have far more in common that unites us than can ever possibly divide us."" Shaking hands with Mrs Cox's sister Kim Leadbeater and parents Gordon and Jean Leadbeater, he ended his speech by saying: ""In her memory let's build that better world. We can change the world, thank you."" Latest news and updates from Yorkshire Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn took part in the ceremony along with Mrs Cox's parents and sister Mrs Leadbeater said the family was ""honoured that the city of Brussels has chosen to remember Jo in this way"" but voiced concerns that little political progress had been made since her death. ""I think a lot of people hoped that the violent assassination of a young mother of two small children on the streets where she grew up would have a profound and long-lasting effect on the political discourse in the UK and beyond. ""However, over two years after, and despite many people working extremely hard to show that Jo's murder was not in vain, I'm sadly not at all sure that this was the case. ""As well as being a celebration of Jo's life, I feel that today is also an opportune time to reflect on this."" Mrs Cox was included by the city of Brussels on a list of ""illustrious women"" who will have squares, streets and buildings named after them as part of the city's plans for female and male equality.

"Diet replacement programmes made up of low-calorie soups, shakes and regular counselling should be a recommended NHS treatment for obesity, a BMJ study says. People on the diets lost three times more weight than those given standard dietary advice by their GP, University of Oxford researchers found. And their risk of developing heart disease and type-2 diabetes reduced. But experts said it would work only if eating habits were changed for good. Prof Paul Aveyard, study author, GP and professor of behavioural medicine at the University of Oxford, said losing weight and keeping it off was hard. ""It's boring being on a normal diet and people struggle to stick to it for a year,"" he said. ""But these programmes get you when your mental strength is at its highest. ""You have to concentrate effort into 12 weeks and because they eat so little, they lose a lot of weight quickly."" Total diet replacement programmes,externalare designed for people who are obese or seriously obese, with abody mass index(BMI) of more than 30, who have been unable to lose weight despite changes to diet and lifestyle. They are currently only available privately - although NHS England has said it is considering the diets as part of a long-term plan for the NHS. BMI and obesity: Where are you on the UK fat scale? The programmes reduce daily calorie intake by replacing food with specially formulated drinks, soups and snacks. Milk, water and fibre supplements are also taken. A typical daily intake might include: a chocolate-flavour skimmed milk and soya protein shake mix (145kcal) chicken-and-mushroom-flavour skimmed milk and soya protein soup mix (138kcal) skimmed milk and multi-wholegrain porridge mix (149kcal) lemon-flavour soya and milk protein bar covered in yoghurt-flavour coating (150kcal) Inthis study,external, of 278 people from 10 GP practices in Oxfordshire, half followed the Cambridge Weight Plan programme for eight weeks - limiting intake to 810kcal per day - then re-introduced other food gradually over the next four weeks. They also saw a trained counsellor every week, for 24 weeks in total, to help them stick to the diet and keep the weight off. The other half of participants were given the usual weight management advice and support from their GP practice. At every stage of the study, people following the diet replacement programme lost more weight. After a year, they had lost on average 1st 9lb (10.7kg) compared with half a stone (3.1kg) for those in the usual weight loss group. When their blood pressure and cholesterol was measured, there were also noticeable improvements. And those with type-2 diabetes were able to radically reduce their medication, although the study found no evidence of the condition being reversed. One in four adults in the UK is obese and the number of people being diagnosed with type-2 diabetes is on the rise. Last year,a trial of patients with type-2 diabetes given a low-calorie diet of shakes and soupsfound half were able to lose enough weight to reverse the condition. It is often said that losing weight quickly on these types of programmes might lead to the weight piling back on again - but the researchers said the study showed this wasn't the case. Prof Aveyard said the programme was an ""effective intervention which GPs can confidently recommend, knowing that it leads to sustainable weight loss and lowers the risk of heart disease and diabetes"". Dr Barbara McGowan, a member of the Society for Endocrinology, consultant endocrinologist and lead for medical obesity services at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, said: ""It has the potential to be scaled up across the NHS if found to be cost-effective as a treatment for obesity."" Dr Katarina Kos, a senior lecturer in diabetes and obesity at the University of Exeter Medical School, said people should not try one of these diets on their own, without any support. ""Of course losing weight is good if you are overweight but a large body of research indicates that the only way it will work is if using the programme as a means to future change, as a stepping stone to change eating habits for good,"" she said. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said she would like to see more research in this area. ""Of course, what works for one patient might not work for another,"" she said. ""And GPs will always aim to take into account the physical, psychological and social factors potentially impacting on a patient's health when giving them advice."" Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard said weight loss programmes should not be seen as the only option for patients. ""Ultimately, the best way to stay fit and healthy is to keep active, eat a healthy and balanced diet, get enough sleep, drink moderately in accordance with guidelines, and not smoke,"" she said. The trial was funded in part by Cambridge Weight Plan UK. Jane Moore says the plans encourage yo-yo dieting Jane Moore from Northampton used the weight loss programme trialled in the study. ""This has enraged me. The first time I used it I did indeed lose weight quickly, probably a stone in a few weeks, but as soon as you return to normal eating the weight creeps back on. ""This type of 'diet' does nothing to educate overweight people long term, and simply encourages unhealthy yo-yo dieting in my opinion. ""In addition I developed gallstones and was hospitalised with jaundice and pancreatitis as a result of them fragmenting. ""When I had my gallbladder removed, my consultant believed that yo-yo dieting contributed to me developing these problems. ""I am delighted to say that through healthy eating I have now lost three-and-a-half stone and have kept this off for over two years now."" Karen (left) and her daughter Jess have lost 10 stone between them Karen Taylor, and her daughter Jess, from Aylesbury, used the same diet plan with impressive results. ""Jess has lost just over three stone and I have lost seven stone since January this year. ""I have suffered with my weight for many years and since childhood. I overate when pregnant with Jess, comfort ate when my marriage broke down and continued to sabotage myself with food for years, all the while thinking food was my friend. ""In January this year we embarked on our weight loss journey together and have never looked back since."" Where are you on the UK fat scale? Can we trust BMI to measure obesity?

"Christine Blasey Ford says Brett Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed and tried to take off her clothes; he denies it The first woman to accuse US Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct has said the assault ""drastically altered"" her life. It is part of the written testimony Prof Christine Blasey Ford has released before she appears at a crucial Senate panel hearing later on Thursday. Judge Kavanaugh, who will also testify, has strenuously denied the accusation. However fresh allegations, which the judge also denies, have appeared as the hearing looms. The supreme showdown for Trump's America The Brett Kavanaugh story in 300 words Who are Supreme Court nominee's accusers? Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation to the highest US court has been delayed in the wake of the allegations against him. The nine-member Supreme Court is the final word on US law, including highly contentious social issues and challenges to government policy. In written testimony provided ahead of Thursday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing,external, Prof Ford says: ""It is not my responsibility to determine whether Mr Kavanaugh deserves to sit on the Supreme Court. My responsibility is to tell the truth."" She alleges Mr Kavanaugh tried to drunkenly remove her clothing, pinned her to a bed and groped her at a party when she was 15 and he was 17. #WhyIDidntReport supports Professor Ford ""Brett's assault on me drastically altered my life. For a very long time, I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone the details,"" she wrote in her prepared statement. ""I tried to convince myself that because Brett did not rape me, I should be able to move on and just pretend that it had never happened."" She says Mr Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge locked her in a bedroom during a small gathering at a house in Washington DC suburbs in the summer of 1982. ""Both Brett and Mark were drunkenly laughing during the attack,"" she said. Mr Judge has disputed the allegations, saying he does not recall the incident. ""I believed [Brett Kavanaugh] was going to rape me,"" she said. The fact that he covered her mouth she says ""terrified"" her the most, and has had ""the most lasting impact"". ""It was hard for me to breathe, and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me."" When Mr Judge jumped on the bed, she says ""we toppled over and Brett was no longer on top of me."" She was then able to run from the room. Deborah Ramirez. The former Yale University classmate hassaid that Mr Kavanaugh once exposed himself to her at a dormitory party in the 1980s,external. She alleges the incident occurred during a drinking game and remembers Mr Kavanaugh standing to her right and laughing, pulling up his trousers Julie Swetnick. A Washington DC resident. In a sworn affidavit she alleges Mr Kavanaugh was involved in the drugging and sexual assault of girls at house parties in the 1980s. She says she was the victim of a gang rape in 1982 at a party attended by the judge, although he was not involved Anonymous.A woman sent a letter to a Colorado senator,externalalleging her daughter had witnessed Mr Kavanaugh pushing a woman he was dating ""very aggressively and sexually"" against a wall in 1998 This video can not be played Why it can take sexual assault allegations years to come out He has also released prepared written testimony,externalahead of the hearing. He denies Prof Ford's allegation ""immediately, unequivocally, and categorically"". Brett Kavanaugh was seen as a safe choice for Supreme Court nominee Mr Kavanaugh says: ""Over the past few days, other false and uncorroborated accusations have been aired. There has been a frenzy to come up with something - anything, no matter how far-fetched or odious - that will block a vote on my nomination. These are last-minute smears, pure and simple."" Who is Brett Kavanaugh? In a separate statement, the judge said he did not know Ms Swetnick and her ""ridiculous"" allegations ""never happened"". The written testimony suggests Mr Kavanaugh will not try to portray himself as a saint. He will say: ""I was not perfect in those days, just as I am not perfect today. I drank beer with my friends, usually on weekends. Sometimes I had too many."" But he will also say that what he has been accused of is ""far more serious than juvenile misbehaviour"". The hearing is scheduled to get under way at 10:00 local time (14:00 GMT) and could last five hours. There will be opening statements from the leading Republican and Democrat members. Prof Ford will deliver her opening statement first. The 21 senators on the committee will then have five minutes each to pose questions, but while the 10 Democrats are expected to ask questions themselves, it is believed a special counsel will act on behalf of the Republicans. Prof Ford will then leave the room and Brett Kavanaugh will enter. Prof Ford had earlier asked not to be in the same room as the judge. Mr Kavanaugh will deliver his statement and the same round of questioning will follow. He has portrayed the events in political terms, accusing the Democrats of trying to block the nomination. This video can not be played Might Donald Trump consider withdrawing Kavanaugh? He repeated this on Wednesday, calling the accusations ""a con job"" by his political opponents. Mr Trump has also repeatedly defended the judge's character, saying he is ""one of the highest quality people"" he has ever met. But the president on Wednesday did say he was open to changing his mind once he had heard Prof Ford testify. The Senate Judiciary Committee must vote on Mr Kavanaugh's confirmation before it is passed to the full Senate for a vote there. Why US top court is so much more political than UK's Meet the Supremes - the judges on the top US court The Democrats have called for the confirmation to be delayed to allow for the claims to be fully investigated. A vote is scheduled for Friday but committee chairman, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, has left open the possibility it might be delayed again. All 10 Democratic members of the committee have called on President Trump to ""immediately withdraw"" Mr Kavanaugh's nomination. Supreme Court judges are nominated by the president and hold the position for life. Mr Kavanaugh's presence on the court could give it a more conservative character for decades.

"More than 40 university bosses have written to the education secretary calling for so-called essay mill companies to be banned. Some students pay for bespoke, original assignments - which cannot easily be detected by anti-plagiarism software. But the letter says these essay-writing services should be targeted rather than those who pay for their services. Such services undermine the integrity of higher education and are unfair to honest, diligent students, they say. Universities minister Sam Gyimah said the government was working to ""bear down"" on the problem - and added that ""legislative options are not off the table"". Passing off a custom-made essay as your own is a form of plagiarism known as contract cheating It involves a student ordering an essay, usually through a website, for a fee But it could also be friends or family members writing an essay on a student's behalf Companies offering these sort of services are known as essay mills The fee will usually depend on the essay subject, length and deadline The letter has been signed by 46 vice-chancellors and heads of higher education bodies, some of whom represent the UK's largest and most prestigious universities. Students caught submitting work that is not their own face serious penalties, which can include being thrown off their university course. However, in the UK it is not illegal to offer a commercial essay-writing service. And many advertise widely near university campuses and on social media. 'One in seven' paying for uni essays Reality Check: Knowledge for sale? A recent survey of students around the world by Swansea University found about 15% had cheated in the past four years, up from an average of 3.5% over the past 40 years. It also suggested 31 million students globally had paid someone else to undertake their work. The vice-chancellors say making the services illegal would stop them operating out of the UK and allow them to be removed from online search engine findings. In the letter, they call on the government to commit to introducing legislation to ban the provision and advertising of essay mills before the end of this Parliament. This video can not be played The YouTubers selling cheating: ""Get an A on your paper - and you don't even need to do it"" (May 2018 video) They also want the government to support efforts by Quality and Assurance Agency (QAA), the higher education standards body, and the Office for Students (OFS) to tackle the issue. The QAA has previously proposed that a UK Centre for Academic Integrity is established with a remit to research and analyse academic misconduct. Essay mill companies are already banned in New Zealand and some parts of the United States. There is currently an online petition calling for a change to UK law. 'Misleading' essay writing ads banned Essay cheat companies face university ban One of the signatories on the letter is the vice-chancellor of the University of Nottingham, Prof Shearer West. Like many universities, it tries to deter students from contract cheating. ""We promote study skills and support students in researching and writing effectively, to ensure they don't veer into plagiarism,"" a university representative said. The university also uses ""specialist software, email filters and academic review to counter plagiarism - and the promotion of essay mills is of course banned on campus"". ""Ultimately, the best way to tackle essay mills is to ban them, which is why our vice-chancellor has signed the open letter calling on government to legislate in this area."" Universities Minister Sam Gyimah said: ""I expect universities to be educating students about these services and highlight the stiff, and possibly life-changing, penalties they face. ""I also want the sector to do more to grip the problem - for example by tackling advertising of these services in their institutions and finally blocking these services from sending an alarming number of emails to the inboxes of university students and staff. ""I have been working with organisations across the higher education sector to bear down on this problem and this has already resulted in the likes of YouTube removing adverts for these essay mills, but legislative options are not off the table."" Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students, said the rise in the use of essay mills in recent years had sought to turn cheating into an industry. ""Essay mills are deeply unethical, and their operation is unfair on the vast majority of students who hand in their own work. ""The Office for Students has a central role to play in ending essay mills; universities and colleges wishing to register with us must demonstrate that they are protecting the reliability and credibility of degree standards."" Dan Burns paid nearly Â£65 for an essay on the portrayal of women in Oliver Twist and Jane Eyre while investigating ""essay mill"" companies for the student websiteThe Tab.,external ""The service was quite professional. It wasn't some kind of dark website,"" he told BBC News. ""You could get undergraduate essays, postgraduate essays. You could get whole dissertations. [There were] different services where you could actually talk to the person who was writing your essay. ""This person told me I would be getting a high quality product written by masters students, PhD students, and he was essentially telling me no-one would know I'd used a fake essay writing website and that it would get me this 2:1, First kind of level, and I would have to put no work in. ""The essay was terrible. I took it to my lecturer and he kind of skim read it and said, 'Well, it wouldn't get any more than a 2:2'. But the more we looked into it and the more we read it and the way we looked at the grammar it would barely scrape a Third really... There were just really basic sentences"".
