"This video can not be played China's ambassador Liu Xiaoming: ""There is no such concentration camp in Xinjiang"" UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has accused China of ""gross and egregious"" human rights abuses against its Uighur population and said sanctions against those responsible cannot be ruled out. Reports of forced sterilisation and wider persecution of the Muslim group were ""reminiscent of something not seen for a long time"", he told the BBC. The UK would work with its allies to take appropriate action, he insisted. China's UK ambassador said talk of concentration camps was ""fake"". Liu Xiaoming told the BBC's Andrew Marr that the Uighurs received the same treatment under the law as other ethnic groups in his country. Shown drone footage that appears to show Uighurs being blindfolded and led to trains, and which has been authenticated by Australian security services, he said he ""did not know"" what the video was showing and ""sometimes you have a transfer of prisoners, in any country"". ""There is no such concentration camps in Xinjiang,"" he added. ""There's a lot of fake accusations against China."" It is believed that up to a million Uighur people have been detained over the past few years in what the Chinese state defines as ""re-education camps"". China 'using birth control' to suppress Uighurs Uighurs ask China: 'Are my family alive?' UK imposes sanctions against human rights abusers China previously denied the existence of the camps, before defending them as a necessary measure against terrorism, following separatist violence in the Xinjiang region. The authorities have recently been accused of forcing women to be sterilised or fitted with contraceptive devices in an apparent attempt to limit the population, prompting calls for the UN to investigate. Asked whether the treatment of the Uighurs met the legal definition of genocide, Mr Raab said the international community had to be ""careful"" before making such claims. But he said: ""Whatever the legal label, it is clear that gross, egregious human rights abuses are going on. According to recent research by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, the rate of population growth in the two largest Uighur prefectures in Xinjiang fell by more than 80% between 2013 and 2018. China does not accept the findings and pressed on the figures, China's ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming said that the Uighur population in Xinjiang stood at four to five million 40 years ago and had now grown to 11 million. ''People say we have ethnic cleansing, but the population has doubled,'' he added. Demographic research, which draws on Chinese official data and media reports, doesn't go back as far as 40 years. But it suggests there was a rapid rise in the growth rate of the population in Xinjiang between 2005 and 2015, followed by a sharp fall over subsequent years. ""It is deeply, deeply troubling and the reports on the human aspect of this - from forced sterilisation to the education camps - are reminiscent of something we have not seen for a very long time. ""We want a positive relationship with China but we can't see behaviour like that and not call it out."" There are growing calls for the UK to impose sanctions, such as asset freezes and travel bans, on Chinese officials responsible for the persecution of the Uighurs. A petition backing the move has amassed more than 100,000 signatures, meaning it will be considered for debate in Parliament. The long read: China's hidden camps Who are the Uighurs? Searching for truth in China's 're-education' camps China denies Muslim children separation campaign The UK recently took action against senior generals in Myanmar who orchestrated the campaign of violence against the Rohingya and against North Korean bodies behind forced labour camps. Mr Raab said this showed that the UK was prepared to take action unilaterally, as well as through bodies like the UN, but it was ""not as simple as deciding you can willy nilly sanction X or Y"". ""You have to, as we have done with the Rohingya and North Korea, build up an evidence base and that takes a long time to do because you have got to identify accurately and responsibly those involved,"" he said. Uighur women have faced a ""ruthless"" birth control programme, reports have suggested BBC News diplomatic correspondent James Landale said: ""The risk for Britain is that it gets caught in the crossfire between Washington and Beijing. ""The price for defending human rights could be less trade with China - and that could prove costly in a post-Covid economic downturn."" Conservative MPs are also pressing for action against senior officials in the Hong Kong government following the imposition of a new security law which the UK says violates international agreements protecting freedoms. The foreign secretary is due to update Parliament on Monday on the UK's response, amid speculation it will scrap the UK's existing extradition treaty with the former British colony. Speaking on The Andrew Marr Show, the Chinese ambassador said if the UK - which has also offered residency rights to three million Hong Kongers eligible for British passports - targeted its officials, his country could retaliate. ""If the UK goes that far to impose sanctions on any individuals in China, China will certainly make a resolute response to it,"" he said. He dismissed claims of ""ethnic cleansing"" of the Uighurs as baseless, saying they ""enjoy peaceful, harmonious coexistence with other ethnic groups of people"". He said figures suggesting population growth in Uighur areas had fallen by 84% between 2015 and 2018 were ""not correct"", claiming the number of Uighurs in the whole of Xinjiang had ""doubled"" over the past four decades. ""There is no so-called pervasive, massive forced sterilisation among Uighur people in China,"" he added. ""Government policy is strongly opposed to this kind of practice."" While he ""cannot rule out single cases"" of sterilisation, he insisted ""we treat every ethnic group as equal"". Who are the Uyghurs?

"This is the first time EU leaders have met face-to-face in months EU leaders trying to hammer out a huge post-coronavirus economic recovery plan are now in an unscheduled third day of a testy summit in Brussels. Some member states believe the proposed â¬750bn ($857bn; Â£680bn) package is too large and should come as loans, rather than grants. Austria said there was still a ""way to go"", while Hungary's PM lashed out at his Dutch counterpart. Germany's Angela Merkel said a deal might not be reached on Sunday. With the impasse still unbroken on Sunday evening, President of the European Council Charles Michel reminded the leaders that 600,000 people had died of the virus worldwide and he hoped that the ""headline tomorrow is that the EU has accomplished mission impossible"". The third day of talks followed a record one-day rise in new infections worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Saturday that new cases rose by almost 260,000 in 24 hours. Officials said this wasthe largest single-day increase since the pandemic began, and the first time the number of new daily infections has surpassed a quarter of a million. The previous record rise in new confirmed cases was recorded by the WHO just one day earlier. The total number of confirmed cases of coronavirus passed 14 million on Saturday, according to the tally kept by US-based Johns Hopkins University. EU leaders first met on Friday in Brussels to discuss the bloc's â¬1 trillion seven-year budget and the planned stimulus package to help countries recover the pandemic. It is the first face-to-face meeting between leaders since governments began imposing lockdowns in a bid to stop the spread of the virus in March. This video can not be played German Chancellor Angela Merkel bumps elbows with EU Council leader Charles Michel Member states are split between those hit hardest by the outbreak, and those concerned about the costs of the recovery plan. Some northern nations like the Netherlands and Sweden have balked at the package, arguing it should take the forms of loans not grants. But nations including Italy and Spain are desperate to revive their shattered economies, and have accused the EU of not doing enough to help countries hit by the pandemic. Italy in particular was one of the earliest European countries to suffer an outbreak and has recorded 35,000 deaths - one of the highest tolls in the world. Big choices face EU leaders on Covid recovery cash Are Italians losing faith in the EU? Italian PM Giuseppe Conte said Europe was ""under the blackmail of the 'frugals'"" and described negotiations as ""heated"". Hungarian PM Viktor Orban accused Dutch PM Mark Rutte of a personal vendetta and of trying to link financial help to political issues. Mr Orban, and his ally Poland, have threatened to veto the package if it adopts a policy of withholding funds from nations who do not meet certain democratic principles. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said there was ""a way to go"" but that it was possible a deal could be achieved. Mrs Merkel said: ""I still cannot say whether we will find a solution. There is a lot of goodwill but also many different positions."" European Council President Charles Michel, left, with Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, right Many European nations have ended lockdown restrictions, but the virus remains a major threat. Officials are facing localised outbreaks across the continent, with the largest appearing in Spain's north-eastern region of Catalonia. About four million people in ââBarcelona, ââLa Noguera and El SegriÃ  have been ordered to stay at home for 15 days. Among the measures imposed are a ban on public or private meetings of more than 10 people; a ban on visits to nursing homes; and the closure of gyms and nightclubs. EU budget commissionerJohannes Hahn tweeted a ""solemn reminder"" on Saturday,externalthat the pandemic was ""not over"". ""High time to reach an agreement which allows us to provide the urgently needed support for our citizens and economies,"" he wrote. WHO officials said the largest increases in cases on Saturday were in Brazil, India, South Africa and the US. Florida is currently the epicentre of the US epidemic. The state recorded more than 10,000 new infections and 90 more deaths on Saturday, bringing its total number of cases to more than 337,000 and its death toll to more than 5,000. In Brazil, where the coronavirus and measures to contain it have been highly politicised, cases continue to surge - although the WHO announced earlier this week that infections were no longer increasing exponentially. Scientists have also warned that India could still be months away from the peak of its outbreak - despite already having the third-highest number of confirmed cases. Hospitals in the worst-hit cities, including Mumbai and Bangalore, have been overwhelmed with patients. India recorded another 34,884 infections in a 24-hour period on Saturday, and another 671 deaths linked to coronavirus. And South Africa, which saw one of the largest single-day rises in cases, has the highest number of confirmed infections on the African continent.

"The officer found the Nazi symbol etched on their belongings A police officer's belongings have been vandalised with a swastika by a colleague. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said the officer found the Nazi symbol on their items when they began their shift earlier on Sunday. Assistant Chief Constable Mabs Hussain said he was ""appalled that one of our employees felt that this behaviour was acceptable"". The force has launched an internal investigation. GMP said the ""disgraceful and disgusting act"" had been declared a hate crime and said its professional standards team was treating it ""incredibly seriously"". ""A colleague has been subjected to a hate crime and there is no place for behaviour like this in GMP or policing nationally, and it's being treated incredibly seriously,"" Mr Hussain said.

"Privacy campaigners say England's test and trace programme has broken a key data protection law. The Department of Health has conceded the initiative to trace contacts of people infected with Covid-19 was launched without carrying out an assessment of its impact on privacy. The Open Rights Group (ORG) says the admission means the initiative has been unlawful since it began on 28 May. The government said there is no evidence of data being used unlawfully. The test and trace system involves people being asked to share sensitive personal information. This can include: their name, date of birth and postcode who they live with places they recently visited names and contact details of people they have recently been in close contact with, including sexual partners. ""In no way has [there] been a breach of any of the data that has been stored,"" said Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. He told BBC Breakfast: ""I think your viewers will understand that if we are to defeat this virus, we do need to have a test and trace system and we had to get that up and running at incredible speed.... Are you really advocating that we get rid of a test and trace system? I don't think you are."" ORG had threatened to go to court to force the government to conduct a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) -a requirement under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),externalfor projects that process personal data. A letter from the Department of Health to the group confirmed that a DPIA was a legal requirement and had not been obtained. ORG's executive director, Jim Killock, said the government had been ""reckless"" in ignoring this legally-required safety step and had endangered public health. ""A crucial element in the fight against the pandemic is mutual trust between the public and the government, which is undermined by their operating the programme without basic privacy safeguards,"" he added. England's Test and Trace initiative is run by Baroness Dido Harding, and is the responsibility of the Health Secretary Matt Hancock Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all carry out parallel contact-tracing schemes of their own but have not been accused of the same failing. The government has told the ORG it is working with the Information Commissioner's Office to make sure that data is processed in accordance with the requirements of the law. The ICO confirmed this and told the BBC it was providing guidance as ""a critical friend"". But the regulator added that, while it recognised the urgency in rolling out the programme, if the public were to have confidence in handing over their data and that of their friends, ""people need to understand how their data will be safeguarded and how it will be used"". The watchdog is already investigating the Test and Trace programme after the Sunday Times reported last week that some contact tracers hadposted private patient data to WhatsApp and Facebook groups,external. A Department of Health spokeswoman said: ""NHS Test and Trace is committed to the highest ethical and data governance standards - collecting, using, and retaining data to fight the virus and save lives, while taking full account of all relevant legal obligations."" 'Almost half' of Blackburn Covid-19 contacts not reached Coronavirus: How does contact tracing work? Contact tracing: My new skill The ORG's complaint stems from work carried out on its behalf by Ravi Naik, a lawyer at the AWO data rights consultancy. He said the legal requirements for data processing were more than just a tick-box exercise. ""They ensure that risks are mitigated before processing occurs, to preserve the integrity of the system,"" he explained. ""Instead, we have a rushed-out system, seemingly compromised by unsafe processing practices."" Mr Naik added the ORG had already won a concession from the government. It had originally planned to keep data for 20 years but has now cut that to eight years. Since the test and trace programme was launched, its 27,000 staff have contacted more than 155,000 people, who may have been infected with the virus, and asked them to go into isolation.

"Armed police could be seen patrolling the site A man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a member of staff was stabbed at a hospital. The 56-year-old victim was attacked at Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton, at about 08:40 BST. His injuries are not life-threatening and he is ""stable and safe"", the hospital trust said. The hospital was placed in lockdown as teams of armed police responded before a 30-year-old man was arrested in nearby Wilson Avenue at about 09:40. Access to the hospital was restricted for much of the day as police conducted searches. At 16:00,Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust tweeted,externalthat the hospital was ""running normally"". It thanked Sussex Police for its ""rapid and professional response"" and hospital staff ""whose performance has been exemplary throughout"". Local resident Maureen Bannister witnessed the aftermath of the arrest. She told the BBC: ""My grand-daughter came running through saying there's policemen out there with guns. She was absolutely terrified. ""So we went and looked and there was more police cars than I've ever seen. We counted at least 30 police officers, all armed."" Forensics officers collected evidence at the scene of the arrest on Wilson Avenue Hospital patient Gareth Cronin, from Hove, told the BBC: ""I was just in having an X-ray and I came out and there were 15-odd armed police in the A&E. ""I had to wait in there for about two and a half hours. I was quite shocked."" Sussex Police said the ""apparently isolated and unexplained"" attack was not being treated as terrorism. It said officers worked quickly with hospital security staff to ensure nobody else was injured and ""staff and patients were safe"". ""There is currently nothing to suggest that any other person has been involved or that anyone else is at risk,"" it added. Police said they worked hard to ensure staff and patient safety Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner Katy Bourne called it a ""dreadful event"" and said her thoughts were with ""the injured NHS staff member's family and those police officers and health colleagues at the scene"". Kemptown MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle told the BBC his thoughts were with the worker and his family. He added: ""Last year Labour passed (through a back bench Bill) a law to ensure that people who assault NHS workers got double time. ""This will be no relief to the person who was stabbed but I hope it will ensure justice can be delivered when the person is brought to book.""

"Sitel said it was ""urgently investigating"" the outbreak with Public Health Scotland Six people have tested positive for coronavirus in an outbreak at a test and trace call centre in North Lanarkshire. Sitel, which carries out contact tracing for NHS England, said it was aware of a ""local outbreak"" at its Motherwell site. Deputy First Minister John Swinney toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotlandthe call centre has been closed. He said ""extensive contact tracing"" was under way. Sitel said it was ""urgently investigating"" the outbreak with Public Health Scotland. The company said it had requested that all staff who have been working at the site undergo testing within the next 24 hours. A spokeswoman for NHS Test and Trace said everyone at the site is currently working from home while a deep clean takes place. NHS Test and Trace is a service operated by the NHS in England to track and help prevent the spread of Covid-19 south of the border. Coronavirus in Scotland: How many cases are there? What can I now do - and what are the rules? Mr Swinney told the BBC that the situation came to light at 08:00 on Sunday and since then a number of contacts of the people who tested positive have been identified. It was a ""pretty realistic conclusion"" that there had been transmission of the virus in the office, he added - but an investigation into how it spread is being carried out. Mr Swinney also said work would need to be undertaken to ""get an understanding"" of how guidance was being followed within the facility. When asked if penalties could levied against Sitel, Mr Swinney said: ""These are all issues that will be explored, but what our primary focus is on is to make sure that we interrupt any transmission of the virus. ""The virus is at a very low level within Scottish society today, the compliance efforts of members of the public have successfully reduced the prevalence of coronavirus, but we have to keep it that way."" Mr Swinney added that actions being taken by NHS Lanarkshire and North Lanarkshire Council were ""reassuring"". The outbreak involves a call centre which carries out coronavirus contact tracing Concerns had been raised after 23 new cases of Covid-19 in Scotland were announced on Sunday, although only three of these were in the Lanarkshire health board area. This followed 21 cases being confirmed on Saturday, with both of these figures the highest recorded since mid-June. However the number of new positive test results dropped back to seven on Monday, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon welcoming ""a reduction compared to recent days"". She said all cases ""will still be closely examined and contract tracing undertaken as appropriate"". Dr David Crome, a consultant in public health medicine at NHS Lanarkshire, said the health board was investigating the situation and putting measures in place to reduce risk. The Scottish government said contact tracing is under way following the detection of ""a small number of potentially linked cases in North Lanarkshire"". ""Where potential clusters of cases develop we must find them and act quickly to prevent further spread and we are grateful to local partners for their swift response,"" a spokesman said. The spokesman said ""a small increase in the number of cases is not unexpected as lockdown is lifted"", adding that it highlights the importance of the public co-operating with contact tracers as well as following guidelines on social distancing and wearing face coverings.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled the bonus scheme earlier in July Property website Rightmove and catering giant Compass have said they will reject the offer of millions of pounds in payouts from the government's job retention bonus scheme. They follow Primark and John Lewis in shunning the bonus, which pays firms Â£1,000 for each furloughed worker they keep on past January. It is meant to help stop a spike in joblessness when wage support programmes end in October. But some firms say they do not need it. It comes as MPs and economists warn that job retention bonus money could be claimed for staff that would have been returned from furlough anyway. Rightmove, which furloughed 160 employees after the coronavirus crisis hit, would have been eligible to claim Â£160,000 in bonus payments had it applied. However, it said: ""Now that the housing market has reopened across all parts of the UK we're in a fortunate position that by the end of July all of our furloughed employees will be back at work, and therefore we will not need to make use of the furlough bonus scheme."" Some 21,000 Compass staff are currently on furlough - around half of its workforce - meaning it could have claimed up to Â£21m. Rishi Sunak defends furlough bonus scheme Asos to repay furlough cash as lockdown sales rise Primark says no to Â£30m job retention payment Earlier this month, fashion retailer Primark promised to sacrifice a Â£30m payout after saying the bonus was unnecessary under ""current circumstances"". Fashion retailer Asos, holiday park operator Center Parcs and retailer John Lewis are among others to have said they will not use the scheme. Some 9.4 million workers are currently having 80% of their wages, up to Â£2,500 a month, paid under the government's furlough scheme. However, there are fears unemployment could top 11% after the programme is wound down. Earlier in July, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the bonus scheme as part a package of measures designed to prevent this outcome. However, if every furloughed worker returned to their jobs, it could cost the public purse more than Â£9bn in bonus payments - something that has fuelled scrutiny of the policy. The most senior civil servant at HM Revenue and Customs, Jim Harra,wrote to Mr Sunak this month, raising doubts over whether the policy offered value for money. And MPs on the Treasury select committee last week echoed warnings from economists that the scheme could risk funnelling money to already-rich companies. Mr Sunak rejected the criticisms, saying he believed the bonus would ""serve as a significant incentive"" to preserve jobs amid the pandemic. A Treasury spokesman told the BBC: ""It's great to see employers getting their staff back to work and protecting jobs without needing to draw on the extra support the job retention bonus offers, and we welcome the decision of businesses to do so. ""For those who do need further support, the Â£1,000 bonus will represent a significant benefit to them and make a difference to those people in the nine million jobs currently furloughed who can be brought back to their jobs.""

"TikTok's plan to base its international HQ in the UK has been thrown into doubt following pressure by Washington over the Chinese firm's future in the US. ByteDance, owner of the video sharing app, has had talks with the government about basing its HQ in London. But the US is considering banning TikTok and may only allow it to keep operating if it splits from China and becomes an American company. ""We remain fully committed to investing in London,"" said a ByteDance spokesman. A spokeswoman for the Department for International Trade said: ""ByteDance's decision on the location of their global HQ is a commercial decision for the company."" It comes as tensions mount between the UK and China over the government's recent decision to order the removal of Huawei's 5G equipment from Britain's mobile networks by 2027. TikTok: Chinese app may be banned in US, says Pompeo UK Huawei decision part of wider strategic tensions with China Huawei 5G kit must be removed from UK by 2027 There are fears it could prompt a tit-for-tat economic war between the two countries. Chinese ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, told The Andrew Marr Show: ""We are still evaluating the consequences. This is a very bad decision."" Asked whether China would punish UK companies operating in China, Mr Liu said: ""We do not want to politicise the economy. That is wrong."" But he said: ""It is wrong for the United Kingdom to discriminate [against a] Chinese company because of pressure from the United States."" The US has already implemented a number of sanctions against China's Huawei. The Trump administration claims that the Chinese telecoms firm provides a gateway for the state to spy on and potentially attack countries that use its equipment. Huawei strongly denies the claims. George Magnus, research associate at University of Oxford China Centre, said it was ""hard to predict"" how the Chinese government would retaliate for the Huawei decision. ""But we expect British companies will be in the crosshairs of all of this,"" he said. China is an important market for British business. Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by India's Tata Motors, sells its vehicles to China. Last month it borrowed Â£560m from five Chinese banks after sales dried up because of the coronavirus. China is also a major investor in the UK, in particular the nuclear industry. China General Nuclear Power Corporation has invested around Â£3.6bn in the UK, including the Hinkley Point nuclear power project in Somerset. Josh Hardie, deputy director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said: ""Post-Covid, promoting trade will be an important plank of our recovery, so we must think carefully about a future relationship that balances UK global competitiveness with wider interests. "" ""We do not want to politicise the economy,"" Chinese ambassador Liu Xiaoming claimed to the BBC about potential repercussions for UK businesses based in China after the government U-turn on Huawei. But given how trade is being used as a political weapon by both sides, it's impossible to see how this could not be the case. China has form in targeting companies as a proxy for the countries that it is rowing with. Take Australia, which has blocked Huawei from its national infrastructure since 2012. China has recently banned some of its beef businesses and put tariffs on barley, designed to hit the country's important agricultural sector. On the other hand, China is sinking vast sums of money into major infrastructure in the UK, such as nuclear power plants. Huawei alone is investing Â£1bn in developing chips in a new facility in Cambridge. These projects are just part of the deep economic interdependence between the UK and China - which could just still prove to be the glue holding an ever frostier relationship together. As Emily Taylor of Chatham House's International Security Programme argues: ""Mutual dependence creates stability and if that's hacked away at, global stability will suffer."" TikTok currently employs around 1,000 people in Europe, with the majority of those based in the UK and Ireland. The Sunday Times reported that a decision by TikTok to build its headquarters in the UK has the potential to create 3,000 jobs. The Chinese video-sharing platform is hugely popular and the app has been downloaded two billion times. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo - who is visiting the UK this week - has previously said Washington is considering banning TikTok. TikTok has already been banned in India But last week President Trump's chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow appeared to change course and said: ""As has been reported in some places I think TikTok is going to pull out of the holding company which is China-run and operate as an independent American company. ""That's a much better solution than banning [or] pushing away."" Mr Pompeo claims that America's TikTok users are at risk of their data ending up ""in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party"". A spokesperson for TikTok said: ""We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked."" India has already blocked TikTok as well as other Chinese apps. Australia, which has already banned Huawei and telecom equipment-maker ZTE, is also considering banning TikTok. TikTok deletes 29,000 coronavirus clips Could TikTok be banned in the US?

"Lewis Hamilton moved into the world championship lead for the first time this season with a dominant victory in the Hungarian Grand Prix. The Mercedes driver pulled out an eight-second lead in three wet laps at the start of the race before switching to dry tyres, and controlled the race from there. Hamilton even had time to stop for fresh tyres with three laps to go to grab the extra point for fastest lap. Valtteri Bottas failed in an attempt to pass Red Bull's Max Verstappen for second, giving Hamilton a five-point championship lead over his team-mate after three races. Verstappen's second place was extraordinary, for he crashed on the laps to the grid and damaged both his front wing and suspension. The Red Bull mechanics worked wonders to change his left front push-rod on the grid in the time permitted and get him into the race and he then drove a superb race to hold off Bottas at the end. Hungarian Grand Prix full race results Listen: Even Hamilton gets confused sometimes Hamilton driven by pain of past failures Hamilton criticises drivers for lack of anti-racism support Disaster struck for Max Verstappen after a crash before the race even started It was Hamilton's second consecutive victory in the third race of the season, and it came after another anti-racism protest from the drivers before the race. It ended up slightly chaotic, as it had in the Styrian Grand Prix a week ago, with the drivers rushing to take part. But as in the first two races, most of the drivers 'took the knee' alongside Hamilton, while a few chose to remain standing for their own reasons. Hamilton's win was never in doubt once he shot away from the field at the start, while Bottas may be considered lucky to get away with an apparent jumped start. The anti-racism protest felt disorganised for the second race in a row The Finn moved before the lights went out and then stopped again, saying he had reacted to a light on his dashboard. The subsequent slow getaway dropped him to sixth place on the first lap. Race director Michael Masi said the movement had not been enough to trigger the sensors that determine what is a jumped start. Hamilton took advantage to show off his renowned wet-weather skills in the opening laps, moving six seconds clear of the Racing Point of Lance Stroll in two laps and adding a further two seconds before pitting at the end of the next lap as the initially wet track quickly dried. By the time the other front-runners had all stopped a lap later, Hamilton was 7.8secs clear and in a position to control the race, and he simply moved further and further away as the laps ticked by. It was his eighth win in Hungary - and he now shares the record for most wins at a single circuit with Michael Schumacher. Hamilton won in Hungary for the eighth time, equalling Michael Schumacher's record of winning the French Grand Prix eight times - the last being in 2006, above Verstappen and Red Bull had had a difficult weekend, the Dutchman qualifying only seventh in what he said was a difficult car. But after the scare on the grid, a brilliant first lap put him up to third behind Hamilton and Stroll, and he was second by lap five after the pit stops for dry tyres. There will be questions as to how Bottas was not penalised for moving before the lights - just as there were with Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel in a similar incident in Japan last year. Once the Finn got going, he drove patiently and by mid-race was up to fourth, taking third from Stroll when they pitted for fresh tyres. Bottas is now second in the drivers' championship, with Verstappen 25 points behind the Finn Bottas caught Verstappen with 25 laps to go and then Mercedes pulled the same strategy as they had to win the race with Hamilton last year, pitting him again for fresh tyres with the idea of catching and passing Verstappen before the end of the race. But while Hamilton managed it in 2019, Bottas did not catch Verstappen until the final lap, and it was too late to pass the Dutchman. It was a three-point boost for Hamilton and the sort of missed opportunity for which Bottas might pay this year, when the title fight seems to be a private one between the Mercedes. Stroll was a strong fourth for Racing Point, while Red Bull's Alexander Albon twice took advantage of unforced errors from Vettel - once early in the race and once close to the end - to take fifth ahead of the second Racing Point of Sergio Perez. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc could manage only 11th, out of the points, after a decision to put him on the unloved 'soft' tyres at his first pit stop. Most teams avoided them, as they were prone to 'graining' and Leclerc struggled with a lack of grip before being forced into an earlier-than-ideal second stop, which left him on old, slow tyres in the closing laps, when he lost out to McLaren's Carlos Sainz. After the race, both Racing Point cars were protested by Renault, as they had been at the previous race, on the claim that they have not designed their brake ducts themselves. The stewards ruled that as the ducts were identical to those used in Austria a week ago, there was no need to impound the parts, and the two protests would be dealt with as one once a date has been set for the hearing. Some fans made it to the race to watch it from a nearby field Verstappen takes it for his controlled management of the race and cool recovery from his error on the treacherous surface before the grid. Splitting the Mercedes will feel almost like a win for the Dutchman when they have an advantage like this. An honourable mention for Kevin Magnussen, who hung on for two points for Haas in ninth after the team gambled on stopping for dry tyres after the formation lap. A weekend off and then the British Grand Prix, the first of two weekends at Silverstone. Mercedes are looking unstoppable and Hamilton will be determined to add to his record tally of home wins.

"Sitel said it was ""urgently investigating"" the outbreak with Public Health Scotland Six people have tested positive for coronavirus in an outbreak at a test and trace call centre in North Lanarkshire. Sitel, which carries out contact tracing for NHS England, said it was aware of a ""local outbreak"" at its Motherwell site. Deputy First Minister John Swinney toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotlandthe call centre has been closed. He said ""extensive contact tracing"" was under way. Sitel said it was ""urgently investigating"" the outbreak with Public Health Scotland. The company said it had requested that all staff who have been working at the site undergo testing within the next 24 hours. A spokeswoman for NHS Test and Trace said everyone at the site is currently working from home while a deep clean takes place. NHS Test and Trace is a service operated by the NHS in England to track and help prevent the spread of Covid-19 south of the border. Coronavirus in Scotland: How many cases are there? What can I now do - and what are the rules? Mr Swinney told the BBC that the situation came to light at 08:00 on Sunday and since then a number of contacts of the people who tested positive have been identified. It was a ""pretty realistic conclusion"" that there had been transmission of the virus in the office, he added - but an investigation into how it spread is being carried out. Mr Swinney also said work would need to be undertaken to ""get an understanding"" of how guidance was being followed within the facility. When asked if penalties could levied against Sitel, Mr Swinney said: ""These are all issues that will be explored, but what our primary focus is on is to make sure that we interrupt any transmission of the virus. ""The virus is at a very low level within Scottish society today, the compliance efforts of members of the public have successfully reduced the prevalence of coronavirus, but we have to keep it that way."" Mr Swinney added that actions being taken by NHS Lanarkshire and North Lanarkshire Council were ""reassuring"". The outbreak involves a call centre which carries out coronavirus contact tracing Concerns had been raised after 23 new cases of Covid-19 in Scotland were announced on Sunday, although only three of these were in the Lanarkshire health board area. This followed 21 cases being confirmed on Saturday, with both of these figures the highest recorded since mid-June. However the number of new positive test results dropped back to seven on Monday, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon welcoming ""a reduction compared to recent days"". She said all cases ""will still be closely examined and contract tracing undertaken as appropriate"". Dr David Crome, a consultant in public health medicine at NHS Lanarkshire, said the health board was investigating the situation and putting measures in place to reduce risk. The Scottish government said contact tracing is under way following the detection of ""a small number of potentially linked cases in North Lanarkshire"". ""Where potential clusters of cases develop we must find them and act quickly to prevent further spread and we are grateful to local partners for their swift response,"" a spokesman said. The spokesman said ""a small increase in the number of cases is not unexpected as lockdown is lifted"", adding that it highlights the importance of the public co-operating with contact tracers as well as following guidelines on social distancing and wearing face coverings.

"This is the first time EU leaders have met face-to-face in months EU leaders trying to hammer out a huge post-coronavirus economic recovery plan are now in an unscheduled third day of a testy summit in Brussels. Some member states believe the proposed â¬750bn ($857bn; Â£680bn) package is too large and should come as loans, rather than grants. Austria said there was still a ""way to go"", while Hungary's PM lashed out at his Dutch counterpart. Germany's Angela Merkel said a deal might not be reached on Sunday. With the impasse still unbroken on Sunday evening, President of the European Council Charles Michel reminded the leaders that 600,000 people had died of the virus worldwide and he hoped that the ""headline tomorrow is that the EU has accomplished mission impossible"". The third day of talks followed a record one-day rise in new infections worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Saturday that new cases rose by almost 260,000 in 24 hours. Officials said this wasthe largest single-day increase since the pandemic began, and the first time the number of new daily infections has surpassed a quarter of a million. The previous record rise in new confirmed cases was recorded by the WHO just one day earlier. The total number of confirmed cases of coronavirus passed 14 million on Saturday, according to the tally kept by US-based Johns Hopkins University. EU leaders first met on Friday in Brussels to discuss the bloc's â¬1 trillion seven-year budget and the planned stimulus package to help countries recover the pandemic. It is the first face-to-face meeting between leaders since governments began imposing lockdowns in a bid to stop the spread of the virus in March. This video can not be played German Chancellor Angela Merkel bumps elbows with EU Council leader Charles Michel Member states are split between those hit hardest by the outbreak, and those concerned about the costs of the recovery plan. Some northern nations like the Netherlands and Sweden have balked at the package, arguing it should take the forms of loans not grants. But nations including Italy and Spain are desperate to revive their shattered economies, and have accused the EU of not doing enough to help countries hit by the pandemic. Italy in particular was one of the earliest European countries to suffer an outbreak and has recorded 35,000 deaths - one of the highest tolls in the world. Big choices face EU leaders on Covid recovery cash Are Italians losing faith in the EU? Italian PM Giuseppe Conte said Europe was ""under the blackmail of the 'frugals'"" and described negotiations as ""heated"". Hungarian PM Viktor Orban accused Dutch PM Mark Rutte of a personal vendetta and of trying to link financial help to political issues. Mr Orban, and his ally Poland, have threatened to veto the package if it adopts a policy of withholding funds from nations who do not meet certain democratic principles. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said there was ""a way to go"" but that it was possible a deal could be achieved. Mrs Merkel said: ""I still cannot say whether we will find a solution. There is a lot of goodwill but also many different positions."" European Council President Charles Michel, left, with Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, right Many European nations have ended lockdown restrictions, but the virus remains a major threat. Officials are facing localised outbreaks across the continent, with the largest appearing in Spain's north-eastern region of Catalonia. About four million people in ââBarcelona, ââLa Noguera and El SegriÃ  have been ordered to stay at home for 15 days. Among the measures imposed are a ban on public or private meetings of more than 10 people; a ban on visits to nursing homes; and the closure of gyms and nightclubs. EU budget commissionerJohannes Hahn tweeted a ""solemn reminder"" on Saturday,externalthat the pandemic was ""not over"". ""High time to reach an agreement which allows us to provide the urgently needed support for our citizens and economies,"" he wrote. WHO officials said the largest increases in cases on Saturday were in Brazil, India, South Africa and the US. Florida is currently the epicentre of the US epidemic. The state recorded more than 10,000 new infections and 90 more deaths on Saturday, bringing its total number of cases to more than 337,000 and its death toll to more than 5,000. In Brazil, where the coronavirus and measures to contain it have been highly politicised, cases continue to surge - although the WHO announced earlier this week that infections were no longer increasing exponentially. Scientists have also warned that India could still be months away from the peak of its outbreak - despite already having the third-highest number of confirmed cases. Hospitals in the worst-hit cities, including Mumbai and Bangalore, have been overwhelmed with patients. India recorded another 34,884 infections in a 24-hour period on Saturday, and another 671 deaths linked to coronavirus. And South Africa, which saw one of the largest single-day rises in cases, has the highest number of confirmed infections on the African continent.

Mr Swinney told the BBC that the situation came to light at 08:00 on Sunday and since then a number of contacts of the people who tested positive have been identified. It was a ""pretty realistic conclusion"" that there had been transmission of the virus in the office, he added - but an investigation into how it spread is being carried out. Mr Swinney also said work would need to be undertaken to ""get an understanding"" of how guidance was being followed within the facility. When asked if penalties could levied against Sitel, Mr Swinney said: ""These are all issues that will be explored, but what our primary focus is on is to make sure that we interrupt any transmission of the virus. ""The virus is at a very low level within Scottish society today, the compliance efforts of members of the public have successfully reduced the prevalence of coronavirus, but we have to keep it that way."" Mr Swinney added that actions being taken by NHS Lanarkshire and North Lanarkshire Council were ""reassuring"". The outbreak involves a call centre which carries out coronavirus contact tracing Concerns had been raised after 23 new cases of Covid-19 in Scotland were announced on Sunday, although only three of these were in the Lanarkshire health board area. This followed 21 cases being confirmed on Saturday, with both of these figures the highest recorded since mid-June. However the number of new positive test results dropped back to seven on Monday, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon welcoming ""a reduction compared to recent days"". She said all cases ""will still be closely examined and contract tracing undertaken as appropriate"". Dr David Crome, a consultant in public health medicine at NHS Lanarkshire, said the health board was investigating the situation and putting measures in place to reduce risk. The Scottish government said contact tracing is under way following the detection of ""a small number of potentially linked cases in North Lanarkshire"". ""Where potential clusters of cases develop we must find them and act quickly to prevent further spread and we are grateful to local partners for their swift response,"" a spokesman said. The spokesman said ""a small increase in the number of cases is not unexpected as lockdown is lifted"", adding that it highlights the importance of the public co-operating with contact tracers as well as following guidelines on social distancing and wearing face coverings.

"England's contact tracers have only reached about 50% of people who have been in close contact with someone with Covid-19 in an area of Lancashire where new cases are rising. The figure was revealed by Prof Dominic Harrison, public health director of Blackburn with Darwen Council. He warned of ""exponential growth"" of new infections if the system did not become more efficient. The government said the NHS scheme had helped identify thousands of cases. It is not clear why the contacts provided were not able to be reached. The government's most recent statistics,externalreveal that of the people in England who tested positive for Covid-19 between 2-8 July, 17.1% could not be reached and a further 4.1% did not provide their phone number. It said 71.1% of the contacts provided were reached, but 21.8% of those who originally tested positive said they had not been in close contact with anyone during the required time frame. A leaked report,seen by the Independent,external, suggested that fewer than half of contacts were reached in Oldham, St Helens, Manchester and Rochdale. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme, Prof Harrison said that Blackburn with Darwen in Lancashire, which he oversees, faces a ""rising tide"" of infections. ""The key issue here is that 40% of people who are infected by someone with Covid-19 who goes for tests because they have symptoms, will be infected by them before they have those symptoms,"" said Prof Harrison. ""So, there's a 48 hour window which is critical to get the contacts of the first case contacted, and if we don't get them contacted, and if they don't then get tested and self-isolated, and they then have symptoms, we do risk the spread progressing."" Blackburn brings in extra Covid-19 measures Mosque 'facing police probe' over 250 at funeral Potential Covid-19 cluster in Lanarkshire Do I have to give contact details if I eat out? It later emerged that the Jamia Ghosia mosque in Blackburn said it isbeing investigated by the police and public health officials after holding a funeral on 13 July,attended by 250 people. The Imam has since tested positive for coronavirus and is recovering. The mosque has emailed its congregation advising everybody to self-isolate and said it ""made a mistake"" in allowing more than the officially-permitted 30 mourners to attend. Prof Harrison called for testing and tracing to be carried out at a local rather than national level, and for Public Health England to share more data with local authorities. Prof Harrison said PHE had only begun sharing data about the postcode areas in which new infections were being registered on 29 June. ""That has made a great difference in three weeks for us in being able to identify what our local outbreak issue is,"" he said. ""Had we had that data much earlier in this pandemic, I think we could have made progress much more rapidly."" In response the Department for Health and Social Care said the NHS test and trace scheme had so far ""helped test and isolate more than 180,000 cases"". ""The service is working closely with local authorities across England to help manage local outbreaks and data is shared daily,"" it added. It also urged anyone with coronavirus symptoms to seek a test and self-isolate immediately. ""The service relies on everyone playing their part - please book a test if you have symptoms, self-isolate and help us trace anyone you've been in contact with."" The NHS test and trace scheme is a crucial part of the government's plan for managing the spread of the virus. It began on 1 June andPrime Minister Boris Johnson claimed it would be ""world beating"". Sage, a committee of medical experts which advises the government,has said,externalthat at least 80% of contacts would need to isolate for the test and trace system to be effective.

"This video can not be played China's ambassador Liu Xiaoming: ""There is no such concentration camp in Xinjiang"" UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has accused China of ""gross and egregious"" human rights abuses against its Uighur population and said sanctions against those responsible cannot be ruled out. Reports of forced sterilisation and wider persecution of the Muslim group were ""reminiscent of something not seen for a long time"", he told the BBC. The UK would work with its allies to take appropriate action, he insisted. China's UK ambassador said talk of concentration camps was ""fake"". Liu Xiaoming told the BBC's Andrew Marr that the Uighurs received the same treatment under the law as other ethnic groups in his country. Shown drone footage that appears to show Uighurs being blindfolded and led to trains, and which has been authenticated by Australian security services, he said he ""did not know"" what the video was showing and ""sometimes you have a transfer of prisoners, in any country"". ""There is no such concentration camps in Xinjiang,"" he added. ""There's a lot of fake accusations against China."" It is believed that up to a million Uighur people have been detained over the past few years in what the Chinese state defines as ""re-education camps"". China 'using birth control' to suppress Uighurs Uighurs ask China: 'Are my family alive?' UK imposes sanctions against human rights abusers China previously denied the existence of the camps, before defending them as a necessary measure against terrorism, following separatist violence in the Xinjiang region. The authorities have recently been accused of forcing women to be sterilised or fitted with contraceptive devices in an apparent attempt to limit the population, prompting calls for the UN to investigate. Asked whether the treatment of the Uighurs met the legal definition of genocide, Mr Raab said the international community had to be ""careful"" before making such claims. But he said: ""Whatever the legal label, it is clear that gross, egregious human rights abuses are going on. According to recent research by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, the rate of population growth in the two largest Uighur prefectures in Xinjiang fell by more than 80% between 2013 and 2018. China does not accept the findings and pressed on the figures, China's ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming said that the Uighur population in Xinjiang stood at four to five million 40 years ago and had now grown to 11 million. ''People say we have ethnic cleansing, but the population has doubled,'' he added. Demographic research, which draws on Chinese official data and media reports, doesn't go back as far as 40 years. But it suggests there was a rapid rise in the growth rate of the population in Xinjiang between 2005 and 2015, followed by a sharp fall over subsequent years. ""It is deeply, deeply troubling and the reports on the human aspect of this - from forced sterilisation to the education camps - are reminiscent of something we have not seen for a very long time. ""We want a positive relationship with China but we can't see behaviour like that and not call it out."" There are growing calls for the UK to impose sanctions, such as asset freezes and travel bans, on Chinese officials responsible for the persecution of the Uighurs. A petition backing the move has amassed more than 100,000 signatures, meaning it will be considered for debate in Parliament. The long read: China's hidden camps Who are the Uighurs? Searching for truth in China's 're-education' camps China denies Muslim children separation campaign The UK recently took action against senior generals in Myanmar who orchestrated the campaign of violence against the Rohingya and against North Korean bodies behind forced labour camps. Mr Raab said this showed that the UK was prepared to take action unilaterally, as well as through bodies like the UN, but it was ""not as simple as deciding you can willy nilly sanction X or Y"". ""You have to, as we have done with the Rohingya and North Korea, build up an evidence base and that takes a long time to do because you have got to identify accurately and responsibly those involved,"" he said. Uighur women have faced a ""ruthless"" birth control programme, reports have suggested BBC News diplomatic correspondent James Landale said: ""The risk for Britain is that it gets caught in the crossfire between Washington and Beijing. ""The price for defending human rights could be less trade with China - and that could prove costly in a post-Covid economic downturn."" Conservative MPs are also pressing for action against senior officials in the Hong Kong government following the imposition of a new security law which the UK says violates international agreements protecting freedoms. The foreign secretary is due to update Parliament on Monday on the UK's response, amid speculation it will scrap the UK's existing extradition treaty with the former British colony. Speaking on The Andrew Marr Show, the Chinese ambassador said if the UK - which has also offered residency rights to three million Hong Kongers eligible for British passports - targeted its officials, his country could retaliate. ""If the UK goes that far to impose sanctions on any individuals in China, China will certainly make a resolute response to it,"" he said. He dismissed claims of ""ethnic cleansing"" of the Uighurs as baseless, saying they ""enjoy peaceful, harmonious coexistence with other ethnic groups of people"". He said figures suggesting population growth in Uighur areas had fallen by 84% between 2015 and 2018 were ""not correct"", claiming the number of Uighurs in the whole of Xinjiang had ""doubled"" over the past four decades. ""There is no so-called pervasive, massive forced sterilisation among Uighur people in China,"" he added. ""Government policy is strongly opposed to this kind of practice."" While he ""cannot rule out single cases"" of sterilisation, he insisted ""we treat every ethnic group as equal"". Who are the Uyghurs?

"This is the first time EU leaders have met face-to-face in months EU leaders trying to hammer out a huge post-coronavirus economic recovery plan are now in an unscheduled third day of a testy summit in Brussels. Some member states believe the proposed â¬750bn ($857bn; Â£680bn) package is too large and should come as loans, rather than grants. Austria said there was still a ""way to go"", while Hungary's PM lashed out at his Dutch counterpart. Germany's Angela Merkel said a deal might not be reached on Sunday. With the impasse still unbroken on Sunday evening, President of the European Council Charles Michel reminded the leaders that 600,000 people had died of the virus worldwide and he hoped that the ""headline tomorrow is that the EU has accomplished mission impossible"". The third day of talks followed a record one-day rise in new infections worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Saturday that new cases rose by almost 260,000 in 24 hours. Officials said this wasthe largest single-day increase since the pandemic began, and the first time the number of new daily infections has surpassed a quarter of a million. The previous record rise in new confirmed cases was recorded by the WHO just one day earlier. The total number of confirmed cases of coronavirus passed 14 million on Saturday, according to the tally kept by US-based Johns Hopkins University. EU leaders first met on Friday in Brussels to discuss the bloc's â¬1 trillion seven-year budget and the planned stimulus package to help countries recover the pandemic. It is the first face-to-face meeting between leaders since governments began imposing lockdowns in a bid to stop the spread of the virus in March. This video can not be played German Chancellor Angela Merkel bumps elbows with EU Council leader Charles Michel Member states are split between those hit hardest by the outbreak, and those concerned about the costs of the recovery plan. Some northern nations like the Netherlands and Sweden have balked at the package, arguing it should take the forms of loans not grants. But nations including Italy and Spain are desperate to revive their shattered economies, and have accused the EU of not doing enough to help countries hit by the pandemic. Italy in particular was one of the earliest European countries to suffer an outbreak and has recorded 35,000 deaths - one of the highest tolls in the world. Big choices face EU leaders on Covid recovery cash Are Italians losing faith in the EU? Italian PM Giuseppe Conte said Europe was ""under the blackmail of the 'frugals'"" and described negotiations as ""heated"". Hungarian PM Viktor Orban accused Dutch PM Mark Rutte of a personal vendetta and of trying to link financial help to political issues. Mr Orban, and his ally Poland, have threatened to veto the package if it adopts a policy of withholding funds from nations who do not meet certain democratic principles. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said there was ""a way to go"" but that it was possible a deal could be achieved. Mrs Merkel said: ""I still cannot say whether we will find a solution. There is a lot of goodwill but also many different positions."" European Council President Charles Michel, left, with Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, right Many European nations have ended lockdown restrictions, but the virus remains a major threat. Officials are facing localised outbreaks across the continent, with the largest appearing in Spain's north-eastern region of Catalonia. About four million people in ââBarcelona, ââLa Noguera and El SegriÃ  have been ordered to stay at home for 15 days. Among the measures imposed are a ban on public or private meetings of more than 10 people; a ban on visits to nursing homes; and the closure of gyms and nightclubs. EU budget commissionerJohannes Hahn tweeted a ""solemn reminder"" on Saturday,externalthat the pandemic was ""not over"". ""High time to reach an agreement which allows us to provide the urgently needed support for our citizens and economies,"" he wrote. WHO officials said the largest increases in cases on Saturday were in Brazil, India, South Africa and the US. Florida is currently the epicentre of the US epidemic. The state recorded more than 10,000 new infections and 90 more deaths on Saturday, bringing its total number of cases to more than 337,000 and its death toll to more than 5,000. In Brazil, where the coronavirus and measures to contain it have been highly politicised, cases continue to surge - although the WHO announced earlier this week that infections were no longer increasing exponentially. Scientists have also warned that India could still be months away from the peak of its outbreak - despite already having the third-highest number of confirmed cases. Hospitals in the worst-hit cities, including Mumbai and Bangalore, have been overwhelmed with patients. India recorded another 34,884 infections in a 24-hour period on Saturday, and another 671 deaths linked to coronavirus. And South Africa, which saw one of the largest single-day rises in cases, has the highest number of confirmed infections on the African continent.

"Tony May was only a few weeks old when he was abandoned by the River Thames in London, in the middle of World War Two. He had no idea who his parents were for more than 70 years. Then a DNA detective dug up the truth about his past. A few days before Christmas, in 1942, a baby boy was brought in to a police station near the Houses of Parliament in London. He had been found wrapped in a bright blue woman's coat on Victoria Embankment, a road lined with trees and occasional benches that runs along the north bank of the Thames. The boy was judged to be one month old and, after no-one came forward to claim him, he was allotted a birthday. He also needed a name. It was common at the time to refer to the place a child was found - and so he became Victor Banks. ""I always wondered who they were, you know? And why I would have been abandoned, I think that's the main thing."" Tony May is sitting in an old easy chair in his flat in St Albans, just to the north of London. There are jazz CDs piled on a side table, and photos of trumpet players on the wall. ""I used to run a club on the jazz circuit,"" he tells me. ""We'd get musicians who had played at Ronnie Scott's."" Tony is in his 70s. Though he moves carefully around his flat his voice is full of energy. He gestures now to one of the pictures crammed on to his mantelpiece. ""My mum and dad, Arthur and Ivy, didn't have any brothers or sisters so they had friends who we called aunt and uncle. They were lovely to me."" The couple adopted Victor Banks when he was a toddler in 1944, changing his name to Tony May. They went on to adopt a little girl called Eleanor who became Tony's sister. Tony remembers being told he was adopted when he was about seven. ""It was no big deal really. But I remember my sister went around telling everyone we were adopted and I was so embarrassed."" Tony and his sister, Eleanor When he was growing up, Tony was particularly close to his father. ""My dad was very bright but although he was very interested in sport he was no good at it at all. When he realised I was good at it, he used to give me and my friend Mick cricket catching practice every night. He'd come home from the bank - I can see him now with his hat and umbrella - and he'd come down the garden to help us. And he'd take me to see major sporting events at White City stadium in London. ""I became a very good cricketer and schoolboy athlete because he believed in me. And when you're adopted you need people to believe in you."" Tony's adoption was rarely mentioned by his parents. ""I remember once my dad knocked on my bedroom door when I was a teenager and asked what music I was listening to,"" Tony says. ""It was John Coltrane on tenor sax playing ballads. He said: 'Do you think you play such mournful music, because you're adopted?' I said: 'No Dad, this is world-class music played all over the world.' He said: 'Oh, OK then.' That was that, there was no dialogue about it."" Tony only discovered he had been found as a baby on his wedding day, at the age of 23. ""My dad sidled over to me after the service,"" he says. ""He told me that when I got back from my honeymoon he'd have an envelope for me with my exam passes and adoption order. He said: 'There's a word on it that you might not know, the wordfoundling. Just letting you know.' I didn't twig for ages what it meant. It was much later that I realised I'd been abandoned."" Tony went into banking, like his father, and then into recruitment. He also had two children. Looking back, he wonders whether not knowing where he came from did affect him, despite what he told his father about the music he'd been listening to that day. ""I worried a lot about things going wrong, which meant I worked extra hard at getting things right. It did mean when the auditors came around at work I knew I'd get a clean sheet. ""Though I laugh and joke and muck about, I'm not tactile. I'm fairly reserved, I would say, about showing emotion. But I can cry my eyes out watching a rugby match."" It wasn't until his adoptive parents had died that Tony felt ready to investigate where he came from. His first port of call was the London Record Office, where he was amazed to find out he wasn't allowed to look at his own adoption file. The rules at that time stipulated that a social worker had to go in and make notes in pencil on his behalf. The file revealed that after being found on Victoria Embankment on 19 December 1942 he was taken to the old Canon Row police station near Westminster Bridge - but there was no mention of who had found him or at what time of day. After being examined at a hospital in Chelsea, he was evacuated to Easneye Nursery in Ware, Hertfordshire, away from the risk of bombing. Ivy May Little Victor first met Arthur and Ivy May at Easneye. Before they were allowed to adopt him they  fostered him for a year and Tony is visibly moved as he reads out a welfare report from that time. ""Date on which visit made: 5 November 1943. Is the child well cared for? The answer is: 'She devotes her whole time and attention to the baby and he is responding well to individual care and is becoming interested in people and things.' Are the applicants satisfied with the child? 'They are very pleased with him and delighted to have a baby of their own.'"" ""That's lovely, that,"" Tony says, tapping the table for emphasis. Letters in Tony's file reveal the Mays wrote to the authorities to see if they could find out any more about his history. The reply was definitive - exhaustive inquiries had been carried out to trace the parents, but all efforts had been unsuccessful. Having reached this dead end, Tony then took his story to the media in the hope it might jog someone's memory. He appeared on radio, TV and in newspapers in the mid-1990s. Some nurses who had worked at the Easneye nursery during the war came forward, but Tony was no closer to finding out about the circumstances of his birth. ""I had given up. I thought, 'No man can do more than I have done, so that's it,'"" he says. Then, four years ago, Tony joined a Facebook group for foundlings. They swapped stories about their lives and their theories about why they might have been left. Tony thought he could be the result of a liaison between a British woman and an American GI. It's estimated that about 22,000 children were born in this way between 1942 and 1945. ""I was found in London and I know this is an area where it was happening,"" he says. He mentioned his theory in the Facebook group, and it was a move that would change his life. The post was spotted by Julia Bell, a genetic genealogist who has used DNA to track down American servicemen who fathered children during World War Two. Julia's first successful case was working out who her own GI grandfather was. DNA detective Julia Bell was looking for a new challenge ""My mother was over the moon to find out. Her father had died in 2009 but she had five brothers and sisters living all over the US. They send her presents for her birthday."" Julia was inspired by her experience to work on other GI cases, but she was now looking for a new challenge. ""I was finding the American servicemen cases very easy. They all knew who their mothers were, but not their fathers. I thought, 'How about giving that gift of knowing where you come from to people who don't know who either side was?'"" She had started looking at foundling cases when she came across Tony's Facebook post, so she introduced herself and offered to help free of charge. ""I thought, why not?"" Tony says. ""I've tried everything you know, if you like you might as well go for it. I didn't think she'd be successful. How can you possibly be from so little information?"" And he was right that the case was a tough one, in fact it was the hardest that Julia had ever attempted to crack. The first thing Julia did was search newspaper archives, where she found a small article from 20 December 1942 reporting Tony's discovery. It read: ""A blue-eyed boy four weeks old, wrapped in a bright blue jacket, part of a woman's costume, has been found abandoned on the Embankment."" Julia wondered whether this could be a sign that Tony was left in a hurry, and that perhaps it hadn't been planned. She then turned to DNA, which she was convinced could help unravel Tony's case. It was 2016, and there had been a massive increase in the number of people in the US and the UK using DNA testing kits to research their family history. Her first step was to send off a saliva sample from Tony to one of several privately owned companies that offer DNA matching with other clients on their database. The amount of DNA we share with other people is measured in centimorgans. The number ranges from single digits for distant cousins to 3,400 centimorgans for a parent and child. The test revealed a woman called Deborah in Toronto, who appeared to be about a third cousin of Tony's, judging from the amount of DNA they shared. But this promising link proved a dead end. Julia realised Deborah was most likely related to Tony on her father's side, and Deborah said she didn't know who her father was. Listen to Embankment Baby, a BBC World Service documentary on BBC Sounds Explore podcasts from The Documentary After Deborah, Tony's closest relation was a fourth cousin called June, in Scotland. That meant she probably shared with Tony a pair of great-great-great-grandparents, who lived sometime in the 1800s. ""Now June had more of a complete tree, which she was willing to share with me,"" Julia says. To find out which ancestor pair Tony and June shared, Julia searched the databases of the DNA-matching companies and found someone who was a cousin of both Tony and June at a similar distance. ""It's called triangulating,"" Julia explains. ""I found an ancestor pair living in the 1860s that all three people shared. Then I created a chart with all the different possible lines of descent, with every marriage and every birth. ""I looked for people further down the lines who were living descendants and asked them to do a DNA test. Each time I found a closer match that would help me refocus and refocus, getting closer to my goal."" By a closer match, Julia means a cousin closer to Tony in his family tree, sharing a larger amount of DNA. The most common DNA test examines the pairs of chromosomes inherited from each parent (except the pair of sex chromosomes), but Julia also got Tony to do another test that looked at mitochondrial DNA, which is passed from mother to child via the egg cell. It suggested a strong maternal link to Lanarkshire, in the central lowlands of Scotland. Every cell in your body contains DNA molecules, packaged in structures called chromosomes, which hold the instructions the body needs to develop, survive and reproduce. The most common DNA test focuses on chromosomes from the cell nucleus, and particularly those inherited from both parents (22 ""autosomal"" chromosome pairs). The test matches you with anyone else on the database who shares a direct ancestor, reaching back about seven generations. In men it is also possible to test the Y chromosome, which is passed from father to son and helps identify the paternal line. The maternal line can be investigated by testing the DNA in mitochondria - subunits of a cell responsible for generating the cell's energy. This DNA is passed from mother to child in the egg cell. It was slow and painstaking work but towards the end of 2018 Julia identified a couple she thought could be Tony's maternal grandparents, who had lived in Kirkcaldy, north of Edinburgh. They had a son still living in Scotland called Bill who was in his 90s and was reluctant to do a test. However Bill's daughter, Kathleen, agreed to help once she heard Tony's story. The results showed Kathleen was almost certainly his first cousin. ""So I'm thinking it's most likely that Tony's mother was Bill's sister,"" Julia says. ""Bill had a sister called Mary who died in 1988. Mary had had two children - a son, Peter, who had died in 2006, but also a daughter called Sheena, who was still living."" After thinking about it long and hard, Sheena agreed to meet Julia. ""Well this was back in January 2019,"" Sheena says, sitting across from me in her conservatory in Kettering, Northamptonshire. ""My cousin Kathleen had explained to me about Julia and this person who was looking for his parents. I thought whoever this Tony is deserves to know who his family is, but I didn't click at all what it had to do with me. ""She came here and told me, 'I'm 80% sure that your mum is Tony's mother.' Well you could have knocked me over with a feather, I knew nothing about it! ""I thought, 'How could my mum have done it?' And then I thought, 'What must she have been through to feel she had to do something like that?' If only she'd been able to talk to us."" Mary with Sheena's father Sheena agreed to take the test and it confirmed Sheena was indeed Tony's half-sister. Julia went to Tony's house to tell him the news. ""When she came I had a friend with me, who was writing it all down. It was a hell of a lot to absorb,"" Tony says. ""It was strange, I felt much less happy than I thought I would do. It didn't have as huge an effect as I thought it would. But then I heard Sheena was willing to meet me, that was a big bonus."" Sheena and her husband, George Haig, only live an hour's drive away from Tony and they agreed to meet him and Julia at a hotel. ""I just thought it was unbelievable. That I'm hugging the daughter of the woman who abandoned me and that she had been prepared to meet me,"" Tony says. ""Sheena gave me an album full of old photographs of the family. It was just lovely. She's a great girl."" Sheena, Tony, and the family photos Sheena immediately noticed something familiar about Tony. ""He walked in and I thought: 'That's my mum walking towards me.' He was so much like her it was scary. I just couldn't take my eyes off him."" Over time, Sheena, 65, has helped Tony build a picture of their mother. Mary married Sheena's father in 1946 and had two children. They moved to Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, when Sheena was two. However, they came back to the UK after her father was injured in a car accident. He never left hospital and Mary raised Peter and Sheena alone. Sheena as a young woman, and Mary ""She had a hard life but she was a loving person. She'd do anything for anybody,"" Sheena says. ""I've missed her more this year than I've done in a long time."" Meanwhile, Julia was still at work trying to find Tony's biological father. She discovered Mary had been married once before, which was a complete surprise to Sheena. ""Julia told us mum had married a man from Kirkcaldy called James on 1 August 1942, but she applied for a divorce in 1946,"" she says. As Tony was born in late November or early December, Julia knew Mary would have been about five months pregnant at the time of the wedding. Although the DNA hadn't indicated a strong Scottish lineage on Tony's paternal side, Julia decided to follow up the lead. She found out that James had gone on to remarry after his divorce from Mary and had had a daughter called Anita. When Anita was approached and told about Tony's story, her response took everyone by surprise. ""Her first words to us were along the lines of: 'Thank goodness he's fine,'"" Julia says. Anita says discovering the existence of Tony has laid to rest a family mystery that had troubled her for most of her life. ""I'd heard a whisper of a story but I was never sure it was true,"" she says. ""I was anything between eight and 10. I heard raised voices and I was listening at the door. I just heard, 'Oh, it's awful you know that a baby was left.' That would have been my mother speaking and my father was saying things like, 'You weren't there. It was dreadful, she was in a terrible state and she was going to jump off a bridge and I had to calm her down.'"" The young Mary Hunter It's not clear if James knew Mary was pregnant when they got married, but Anita says her father insisted the baby wasn't his. Her understanding was that this led to some sort of argument between James and Mary in London. At the time, James was in the military and serving on the south coast. Perhaps Mary came down with the baby from Kirkcaldy to meet him? ""I suppose that's how the abandonment happened,"" Anita says. ""My father removed Madie [Mary] from the baby to calm her down and perhaps - I think I remember hearing my mum saying something like 'Did you never go back to see if it was still there?' And I remember him saying 'Of course I did, but obviously the baby wasn't there.'"" This is a second-hand account, told decades later, but it does suggest that both Mary and James were involved in leaving Tony on Victoria Embankment. An action that their children think profoundly affected both of them for the rest of their lives. Mary had always told her daughter, Sheena, that her brother, Peter, had been a twin, but that the other baby had been stillborn. Sheena's cousin recently revealed she'd once asked their gran about the stillborn baby. ""My gran had been there at Peter's birth and apparently she said that was a load of rubbish, there was only one baby. So we now think that was my mum trying to make sense of it,"" Sheena says. Mary with Sheena as a young girl Anita said her father, James, was delighted when she had three girls and seemed uncomfortable around baby boys. ""He was a very supportive and helpful person. It just seems such an out-of-character thing for him and I think it weighed heavily on him,"" she says. ""In fact, in his late 70s he tried to take his own life and was treated for severe depression. I think the incident in 1942 with the baby [is something] he'd carried all those years and felt guilt and shame for. I think it contributed to his suicide attempt."" Both Sheena and Anita wish their parents could have known that Tony had been found and adopted. Anita took a DNA test that confirmed what her father had always said, he was not Tony's father. So Julia's hunt continued, looking at DNA databases and creating numerous family trees using birth, marriage and death records. She narrowed down her search to two family lines based in Yorkshire and Hertfordshire. This meant he was unlikely to be a GI as Tony had first supposed. Eric Wisbey emigrated to Australia Then, just a few months after finding Tony's mother, Julia hit the jackpot with his father. She discovered a 1906 marriage that seemed to bring those two lines together. The marriage resulted in a son called Eric. ""I found this man called Eric Wisbey who looked to me to be the dad. I approached some living relatives who told me he had gone to Australia,"" Julia says. ""Eric had died in 2004 and he had a son called Ken who had died in 2011. But Ken had a daughter called Leesa and she agreed to do a DNA test."" Leesa lives in Wodonga, on the border of New South Wales and Victoria. ""I Googled Julia Bell's name to make sure that it wasn't a hoax,"" she says over Skype. ""You never know nowadays. And then I thought, 'Well, it's not going to hurt me.' So I agreed and she sent the test over."" The results came back a month later and confirmed Leesa was Tony's half-niece. This meant Julia was correct and Eric Wisbey was Tony's father. Starting in 2016, Julia Bell identified cousins of Tony on his mother's side, and used them to reconstruct part of his family tree, which led her to Mary, Tony's mother, and to Sheena, his living half-sister, whom Julia met in January 2019. In her search for Tony's father, Julia established that Mary's first husband, James, had been present when Tony was abandoned, but was not his father. Her attention then focused on two families in Yorkshire and Hertfordshire and a man called Eric Wisbey. When Eric's granddaughter, Leesa, did a DNA test in spring 2019, the result showed she was Tony's half-niece, and the case was closed. Tony was amazed to discover he had family on the other side of the world. ""I have got a father that went out to Australia and now I've spoken to my father's granddaughter out there over the internet. These are huge bonuses,"" he says. Leesa was able to tell Tony a little about his father. ""Eric was sort of a reserved fella, sometimes he'd take my brother, dad and I fishing,"" she says. He was a painter and decorator who moved around the state of Victoria. After his wife, Leesa's grandmother, died, he married one of her friends. But how did Eric Wisbey, from the south of England, come to meet Mary Hunter from Scotland? Leesa pulled out her grandfather's war records, which revealed he was in the Army Pay Corps in World War Two. In 1942 he was stationed in Edinburgh, 11 miles across the Firth of Forth from Mary's hometown of Kirkcaldy. At the time Mary was 22 and living with her parents, while Eric was 35 and married with a young son back in Brighton. So how did this unlikely couple get together? Mary's brother, Bill - who has since died aged 93 - was asked if he could remember anything from that time. Who were my parents - and why was I left on a hillside to die? The mystery of the baby in the box The Christmas present that could tear your family apart I met my boyfriend 12 years after giving birth to his child ""He remembered an older guy coming to stay at the house because he had to share a room with him,"" Sheena says. ""He was 15 years or so older than my mum and he said he thinks she'd had an affair with him. But he doesn't remember her being pregnant or a baby being born."" Sheena and George have speculated that Eric was billeted with the Hunter family, and was perhaps involved in paying the munition workers in the town. But did Eric ever find out that Mary was pregnant? Leesa reveals a tantalising clue. ""I had rung my mum to tell her about what was going on with Julia and then mum spoke to John, who was my dad's friend. And John said Dad had told him he thought he had a half-brother or had an inkling. I don't know how Dad got that information. I wish he was still alive so we could ask him about it."" Eric Wisbey left Scotland in 1943 after he moved from the Pays Corps to the Intelligence Corps. By 1944 he was stationed in India. ""He didn't really like speaking about the war and we never asked him about it. We found his records in a drawer,"" Leesa says. Sheena thinks her mother was left in an impossible position. ""Whether he knew about it or not, Eric was married and quite a lot older than my mum. Then he went off to Australia. I think he got off scot free,"" she says. ""I feel angry and bitter that my mum felt she had to hide it all. What she must have gone through for the rest of her life, to my mind, is absolutely heart-breaking."" For Tony, the discoveries have helped him better understand why he was left on the Embankment. But he says he has never blamed his mother for leaving him. ""I wish I could tell her 'I'm sorry you had to do it,'"" he says. ""I was sure she wouldn't have abandoned me without a damn good reason."" Dr Marilyn Crawshaw from the University of York has worked for decades with people who were adopted or conceived with donor sperm. She warns people to think carefully before embarking on a journey like Tony's. ""I very definitely believe a child has a right to know where they come from,"" she says. ""But I always say to people don't go rushing into it, stop and think first. Talk to your mates about it. Are you prepared for all the different things you might find out? ""Some bits might feel immensely satisfying, but you may also find a birth parent who refuses to have contact with you. You have no idea what is happening in the lives of the people you are approaching. You really are stepping into the unknown."" Tony says there are some things he will always wonder about, such as whether he was born in Scotland or London, but he is ""happy to know what I now know"". His relationship with his half-sister has gone from strength to strength. Sheena and her husband, George, have met Tony's sister, Eleanor, while Tony has gone to watch his half-niece, Jessica, sing at a concert in London. Tony is now looking forward to introducing Sheena and her family to his children and grandchildren. ""When Julia first told me she had a result I think I was a bit stunned,"" Tony says. ""But now I've met my half-sister, I've corresponded with my half-niece in Australia. I'm looking forward to introducing my son and daughter to Sheena's family. It's given me a new lease of life.""

"This is the first time EU leaders have met face-to-face in months EU leaders trying to hammer out a huge post-coronavirus economic recovery plan are now in an unscheduled third day of a testy summit in Brussels. Some member states believe the proposed â¬750bn ($857bn; Â£680bn) package is too large and should come as loans, rather than grants. Austria said there was still a ""way to go"", while Hungary's PM lashed out at his Dutch counterpart. Germany's Angela Merkel said a deal might not be reached on Sunday. With the impasse still unbroken on Sunday evening, President of the European Council Charles Michel reminded the leaders that 600,000 people had died of the virus worldwide and he hoped that the ""headline tomorrow is that the EU has accomplished mission impossible"". The third day of talks followed a record one-day rise in new infections worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Saturday that new cases rose by almost 260,000 in 24 hours. Officials said this wasthe largest single-day increase since the pandemic began, and the first time the number of new daily infections has surpassed a quarter of a million. The previous record rise in new confirmed cases was recorded by the WHO just one day earlier. The total number of confirmed cases of coronavirus passed 14 million on Saturday, according to the tally kept by US-based Johns Hopkins University. EU leaders first met on Friday in Brussels to discuss the bloc's â¬1 trillion seven-year budget and the planned stimulus package to help countries recover the pandemic. It is the first face-to-face meeting between leaders since governments began imposing lockdowns in a bid to stop the spread of the virus in March. This video can not be played German Chancellor Angela Merkel bumps elbows with EU Council leader Charles Michel Member states are split between those hit hardest by the outbreak, and those concerned about the costs of the recovery plan. Some northern nations like the Netherlands and Sweden have balked at the package, arguing it should take the forms of loans not grants. But nations including Italy and Spain are desperate to revive their shattered economies, and have accused the EU of not doing enough to help countries hit by the pandemic. Italy in particular was one of the earliest European countries to suffer an outbreak and has recorded 35,000 deaths - one of the highest tolls in the world. Big choices face EU leaders on Covid recovery cash Are Italians losing faith in the EU? Italian PM Giuseppe Conte said Europe was ""under the blackmail of the 'frugals'"" and described negotiations as ""heated"". Hungarian PM Viktor Orban accused Dutch PM Mark Rutte of a personal vendetta and of trying to link financial help to political issues. Mr Orban, and his ally Poland, have threatened to veto the package if it adopts a policy of withholding funds from nations who do not meet certain democratic principles. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said there was ""a way to go"" but that it was possible a deal could be achieved. Mrs Merkel said: ""I still cannot say whether we will find a solution. There is a lot of goodwill but also many different positions."" European Council President Charles Michel, left, with Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, right Many European nations have ended lockdown restrictions, but the virus remains a major threat. Officials are facing localised outbreaks across the continent, with the largest appearing in Spain's north-eastern region of Catalonia. About four million people in ââBarcelona, ââLa Noguera and El SegriÃ  have been ordered to stay at home for 15 days. Among the measures imposed are a ban on public or private meetings of more than 10 people; a ban on visits to nursing homes; and the closure of gyms and nightclubs. EU budget commissionerJohannes Hahn tweeted a ""solemn reminder"" on Saturday,externalthat the pandemic was ""not over"". ""High time to reach an agreement which allows us to provide the urgently needed support for our citizens and economies,"" he wrote. WHO officials said the largest increases in cases on Saturday were in Brazil, India, South Africa and the US. Florida is currently the epicentre of the US epidemic. The state recorded more than 10,000 new infections and 90 more deaths on Saturday, bringing its total number of cases to more than 337,000 and its death toll to more than 5,000. In Brazil, where the coronavirus and measures to contain it have been highly politicised, cases continue to surge - although the WHO announced earlier this week that infections were no longer increasing exponentially. Scientists have also warned that India could still be months away from the peak of its outbreak - despite already having the third-highest number of confirmed cases. Hospitals in the worst-hit cities, including Mumbai and Bangalore, have been overwhelmed with patients. India recorded another 34,884 infections in a 24-hour period on Saturday, and another 671 deaths linked to coronavirus. And South Africa, which saw one of the largest single-day rises in cases, has the highest number of confirmed infections on the African continent.

"Armed police could be seen patrolling the site A man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a member of staff was stabbed at a hospital. The 56-year-old victim was attacked at Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton, at about 08:40 BST. His injuries are not life-threatening and he is ""stable and safe"", the hospital trust said. The hospital was placed in lockdown as teams of armed police responded before a 30-year-old man was arrested in nearby Wilson Avenue at about 09:40. Access to the hospital was restricted for much of the day as police conducted searches. At 16:00,Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust tweeted,externalthat the hospital was ""running normally"". It thanked Sussex Police for its ""rapid and professional response"" and hospital staff ""whose performance has been exemplary throughout"". Local resident Maureen Bannister witnessed the aftermath of the arrest. She told the BBC: ""My grand-daughter came running through saying there's policemen out there with guns. She was absolutely terrified. ""So we went and looked and there was more police cars than I've ever seen. We counted at least 30 police officers, all armed."" Forensics officers collected evidence at the scene of the arrest on Wilson Avenue Hospital patient Gareth Cronin, from Hove, told the BBC: ""I was just in having an X-ray and I came out and there were 15-odd armed police in the A&E. ""I had to wait in there for about two and a half hours. I was quite shocked."" Sussex Police said the ""apparently isolated and unexplained"" attack was not being treated as terrorism. It said officers worked quickly with hospital security staff to ensure nobody else was injured and ""staff and patients were safe"". ""There is currently nothing to suggest that any other person has been involved or that anyone else is at risk,"" it added. Police said they worked hard to ensure staff and patient safety Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner Katy Bourne called it a ""dreadful event"" and said her thoughts were with ""the injured NHS staff member's family and those police officers and health colleagues at the scene"". Kemptown MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle told the BBC his thoughts were with the worker and his family. He added: ""Last year Labour passed (through a back bench Bill) a law to ensure that people who assault NHS workers got double time. ""This will be no relief to the person who was stabbed but I hope it will ensure justice can be delivered when the person is brought to book."" Hove and Portslade MP Peter Kyletweeted,externalthat it was ""shocking news"" but thanked police for a ""swift arrest"" and wished the staff member a ""speedy recovery"".

"This is the first time EU leaders have met face-to-face in months EU leaders trying to hammer out a huge post-coronavirus economic recovery plan are now in an unscheduled third day of a testy summit in Brussels. Some member states believe the proposed â¬750bn ($857bn; Â£680bn) package is too large and should come as loans, rather than grants. Austria said there was still a ""way to go"", while Hungary's PM lashed out at his Dutch counterpart. Germany's Angela Merkel said a deal might not be reached on Sunday. With the impasse still unbroken on Sunday evening, President of the European Council Charles Michel reminded the leaders that 600,000 people had died of the virus worldwide and he hoped that the ""headline tomorrow is that the EU has accomplished mission impossible"". The third day of talks followed a record one-day rise in new infections worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Saturday that new cases rose by almost 260,000 in 24 hours. Officials said this wasthe largest single-day increase since the pandemic began, and the first time the number of new daily infections has surpassed a quarter of a million. The previous record rise in new confirmed cases was recorded by the WHO just one day earlier. The total number of confirmed cases of coronavirus passed 14 million on Saturday, according to the tally kept by US-based Johns Hopkins University. EU leaders first met on Friday in Brussels to discuss the bloc's â¬1 trillion seven-year budget and the planned stimulus package to help countries recover the pandemic. It is the first face-to-face meeting between leaders since governments began imposing lockdowns in a bid to stop the spread of the virus in March. This video can not be played German Chancellor Angela Merkel bumps elbows with EU Council leader Charles Michel Member states are split between those hit hardest by the outbreak, and those concerned about the costs of the recovery plan. Some northern nations like the Netherlands and Sweden have balked at the package, arguing it should take the forms of loans not grants. But nations including Italy and Spain are desperate to revive their shattered economies, and have accused the EU of not doing enough to help countries hit by the pandemic. Italy in particular was one of the earliest European countries to suffer an outbreak and has recorded 35,000 deaths - one of the highest tolls in the world. Big choices face EU leaders on Covid recovery cash Are Italians losing faith in the EU? Italian PM Giuseppe Conte said Europe was ""under the blackmail of the 'frugals'"" and described negotiations as ""heated"". Hungarian PM Viktor Orban accused Dutch PM Mark Rutte of a personal vendetta and of trying to link financial help to political issues. Mr Orban, and his ally Poland, have threatened to veto the package if it adopts a policy of withholding funds from nations who do not meet certain democratic principles. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said there was ""a way to go"" but that it was possible a deal could be achieved. Mrs Merkel said: ""I still cannot say whether we will find a solution. There is a lot of goodwill but also many different positions."" European Council President Charles Michel, left, with Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, right Many European nations have ended lockdown restrictions, but the virus remains a major threat. Officials are facing localised outbreaks across the continent, with the largest appearing in Spain's north-eastern region of Catalonia. About four million people in ââBarcelona, ââLa Noguera and El SegriÃ  have been ordered to stay at home for 15 days. Among the measures imposed are a ban on public or private meetings of more than 10 people; a ban on visits to nursing homes; and the closure of gyms and nightclubs.

"Changing Places have equipment such as a height-adjustable changing bench and a hoist Large accessible toilets for severely disabled people - known as Changing Places - will be made compulsory for new buildings in England from 2021. Shopping centres, supermarkets, sports and arts venues will be required to include at least one Changing Place, a government spokesman said. The facilities include hoists, changing benches and space for carers. Campaigner Zack Kerr said the announcement was ""nothing short of life changing"". A government spokesman said there were more than 1,400 Changing Places toilets in the UK, compared with 140 in 2007, but more were needed to support about 250,000 severely disabled people. This video can not be played A BBC News film last year highlighted the need for the larger toilet areas Many disabled people have spoken about restricting their drinking to avoid needing the toilet when they were out, risking dehydration and urinary tract infections. Other issues include sitting in soiled clothing or dirty nappies until they find a suitable toilet or returned home, and carers having to change a disabled person on a dirty toilet floor. Helen Whately, Minister for Care, said: ""Compulsory Changing Places in new public buildings is a major step in reducing the health inequalities. ""All public spaces should cater for people with disabilities so they don't have to suffer discomfort, embarrassment, or even injury without access to a Changing Place."" The government's announcement will be a major change for building rules in England which now require Changing Places, which are at about 12 sq m, to be designed for new public buildings. Nearly 40 service stations will build Changing Places toilets A Â£30m fund to install Changing Places in existing premises was also announced in March's Budget. On Sunday, the Department for Transport and Muscular Dystrophy UK announced a Â£1.27m fund to install 37 more Changing Places at service stations across England. It means 87 of England's 118 service stations will have the facilities in the next few years. Zack Kerr, who has cerebral palsy, launched a campaign for more Changing Places after a ""distressing"" journey from his Lancashire home to south Wales three years ago. ""We stopped at three service stations on route along the M62, M6 and M5 but none of them had an accessible changing facility,"" he said. Mr Kerr said when he started his service stations campaign ""there were about 10 [Changing Places] in the whole country and none of them were north of Birmingham"". He said he was ""especially pleased"" there would be more facilities in northern England.

"Brazil's coronavirus outbreak is one of the world's most severe, with more than 2m cases recorded since March. In fact, it is the second worst affected country behind the US. More than 74,000 people have died with the virus there and, owing to a lack of testing, the true figures are believed to be even higher. Here, we illustrate how the pandemic has played out in the South American country. The outbreak took some time to reach Brazil and it was the Amazonas region which was badly hit by the first wave of cases. In the state capital Manaus, a man can be seen arranging coffins at a funeral parlour. Officials warned that the stock of coffins in the region was likely to run out. They were forced to dig large burial sites as deaths spiked, and poverty and malnutrition made tackling the virus in the heart of the Amazon rainforest a major challenge. Indigenous communities have been among the worst affected by the virus and Manaus is home to a large proportion of them. Many of their homes are situated far away from health facilities. On the outskirts of the city, nurse Vanderlecia Ortega dos Santos, responded to the crisis by volunteering to care for her indigenous community of 700 families. And here, people can be seen moving a coffin in a rural community in the northern state of ParÃ¡. It was later buried in a cemetery at the mouth of the Amazon river. But it was not long before the virus spread to major cities such as Rio de Janeiro and SÃ£o Paulo. Cases then began to rise sharply. In May, SÃ£o Paulo's mayor warned that its underfunded health system was on the verge of collapse as it became a new hotspot for Covid-19. He said demand for hospital beds had skyrocketed. This hospital, built inside a sports gym in the city, is one of many makeshift facilities that opened up. But despite the rise in cases there was still no national lockdown. States and cities adopted their own measures, but these were met by protests and data later showed that compliance lessened as time went on. Stay-at-home orders and other restrictions were criticised by far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who denounced them as ""dictatorial"". He even joined anti-lockdown protests in the capital, Brasilia. This image shows supporters of the president at a separate demonstration in Rio de Janeiro. Mr Bolsonaro has repeatedly played down the risks of what he calls ""little flu"" and his response to the pandemic has been heavily criticised. He has argued that regional lockdowns are having a more damaging effect than the virus itself, and accused the media of spreading panic and paranoia. The president has also been spotted meeting supporters while not wearing a mask, such as here in Brasilia. And while many people share his concerns about the economic impact of lockdowns, health officials have disagreed with his approach. In fact, two doctors have left their posts as health minister since the pandemic began, one was sacked, one resigned. Mr Bolsonaro also said he would not be seriously affected by the virus. ""I'm not going to be brought down by a little flu,"" he said in March. That's been put to the test, as earlier this month he tested positive for Covid-19. This image shows the president meeting the US ambassador Todd Chapman the day before he said he started to feel symptoms. The pair were seen shaking hands, and Mr Chapman later went into quarantine. On 20 June, Brazil became only the second country to pass one million cases and that number has continued to rise steadily. Experts say it is likely much higher due to a lack of testing. But lockdowns were lifted even as cases surged. In Rio and SÃ£o Paulo, restaurants and bars were reopened despite the continued increase in transmissions. The rise in cases and the relaxation of lockdown measures left some Brazilians feeling as though they needed to take matters into their own hands. And one couple took extreme measures to keep safe. A chronic lung disease means that accountant Tercio Galdino, 66, is at high risk from Covid-19. He and his wife wear special outfits when out and about in Rio de Janeiro. And, as an added bonus, the outfit lets him celebrate his love of space. There is some hope, however, two major vaccine tests, in partnership with the pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca and Sinovac, will soon begin final phase testing on thousands of Brazilian volunteers. The hope is that a breakthrough on this front could help Brazil reverse its worrying rise in cases and deaths.

"This video can not be played Andrei Kelin: ""We do not see any point in interference"" Russia's ambassador to the UK has rejected allegations that his country's intelligence services tried to steal coronavirus vaccine research. ""I don't believe in this story at all, there is no sense in it,"" Andrei Kelin told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. However, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said it is ""very clear Russia did this"", adding that it is important to call out this ""pariah-type behaviour"". Mr Kelin also rejected suggestions that Russia had interfered in UK politics. Earlier this week, Mr Raab said Russians almost certainly sought to interfere in the 2019 UK election through illicitly-acquired documents. The papers, which emerged online, detailed UK-US trade discussions and were used by Labour in its election campaign. ""I do not see any point in using this subject as a matter of interference,"" Mr Kelin said. ""We do not interfere at all. We do not see any point in interference because for us, whether it will be [the] Conservative Party or Labour's party at the head of this country, we will try to settle relations and to establish better relations than now."" The interview comes days before a report into allegations of wider Russian interference into UK democracyis due to be publishedby Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee. Russian spies 'target coronavirus vaccine' Russians sought to meddle in UK election â Raab Kuenssberg: Curious timing of Russian meddling claims On Thursday, UK, US and Canada security services said a hacking group called APT29 had targeted various organisations involved in Covid-19 vaccine development, with the likely intention of stealing information. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said it was more than 95% certain that the group, also known as The Dukes or Cozy Bear, was part of Russian intelligence services. Asked whether that was true, Mr Kelin did not directly answer but said: ""I learned about their existence from British media."" ""In this world, to attribute any kind of computer hackers to any country, it is impossible,"" he said. Mr Raab responded on Sunday, saying the UK government does not just ""throw out allegations"" and accused Russia of denying the claims in the same way they ""denied responsibility for the 2018 nerve agent attack on Salisbury"". ""It is very clear that as the world was coming together and we were trying to drive vaccine collaboration to get a vaccination for this terrible virus, Russia has been trying to sabotage it,"" said the foreign secretary. Mr Kelin dismissed suggestions that it would be an ""advantage"" for Russia to know about vaccines being developed. He said Russian pharmaceutical company R-Pharm had already entered a partnership with AstraZeneca to manufacture the coronavirus vaccine being developed at the University of Oxford, should it prove effective. Elsewhere in the BBC interview, Mr Kelin said Russian officials studyingthe country's recent constitutional referendumdiscovered ""several cyber-attacks"" originating from UK territory. Two weeks ago, Russia voted in favour of a wide-ranging set of constitutional changes, which included clauses banning same-sex marriage and making it possible for President Vladimir Putin to stay in power until 2036. Mr Kelin stressed that Russia was not ""accusing the United Kingdom as a state"" of being involved in the cyber-attacks and did not give further details as to their nature. Andrew Marr also asked Mr Kelin whether he had seen the recent BBC miniseries, The Salisbury Poisonings, which dramatised the poisoning of former spy and MI6 informant Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. ""I saw part of them,"" he said, adding that it was ""so dull"" he could not watch the three-part series to the end. TheUK has accused two Russian military intelligence officersof being behind the poisonings but the ambassador indicated Moscow was keen to move on from the incident, saying: ""We still do not understand why some spy story should disrupt these important business relations which will be very helpful to Britain... when it is exiting from the European Union. ""We are prepared to turn the page and we are prepared to do business with Britain."" The interview with Andrei Kelin was shown onThe Andrew Marr Show on BBC Oneat 09:00 BST on Sunday.
