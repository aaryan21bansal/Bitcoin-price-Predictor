"Boots has suspended payments using loyalty points in shops and online after attempts to break into customers' accounts using stolen passwords. Customers will not be able to use Boots Advantage Card points to pay for products while the issue is dealt with. Boots said none of its own systems were compromised, but attackers had tried to access accounts using reused passwords from other sites. It comes days after a similar issue hit 600,000 Tesco Clubcard holders. A spokeswoman for Boots told the BBC the issue affected less than 1% of the company's 14.4 million active Advantage Cards - fewer than 150,000 people. But it could not give an exact number as the company was still dealing with the problem. No credit card information had been accessed, they said. Suspending payments using points removed the risk of hackers stealing the points to spend themselves, the spokeswoman said. Customers can still earn points when making purchases, and Boots hopes to have point payments back up as soon as possible. Boots launched its Advantage Card in 1997 ""We are writing to customers if we believe that their account has been affected, and if their Boots Advantage Card points have been used fraudulently we will, of course, replace them,"" the company said in a statement. ""We would like to reassure our customers that these details were not obtained from Boots,"" it added. The Boots Advantage card lets shoppers collect four points for every Â£1 spent, and each point is worth a penny. For example, a card with 200 points could be used to pay for an item worth Â£2. But the points can also be used when purchasing items online. Tesco issues warning to 600,000 Clubcard holders How do companies use my reward card data? So-called ""password stuffing"" happens when an attacker uses a list of compromised usernames and passwords from a previous data breach. They then try to log in to a different website, hoping for a match. Because many people use the same email and password combination for several websites, some of the combinations on the compromised list might work. In Tesco's case, the supermarket giant told customers it believed that a compromised list of usernames and passwords had been used to try to gain access to its customers' accounts - and it may have worked in some cases. It said no financial information was accessed, and it had restricted access to the accounts to prevent fraudulent use. Jake Moore, cyber-security specialist at internet security firm Eset, said that Boots reminding their customers about the risk was a good move - but that password reuse is a ""gigantic problem"" in cyber-security. ""These lists of passwords can be easily found on the dark web for very little, or even free,"" he said. ""It would be a good idea for people to check they have implemented two factor authentication on each of their accounts as this makes the password stuffing attack that much harder."" ""My further advice is to use a password manager to store your uniquely different passwords robustly online so you don't have to remember them all."" Boots said customers could reset their passwords online, and should choose a unique password not used on other sites.

"The Italian Red Cross of Mascalucia is among those warning children not to copy the challenge A stunt being shared on viral video platform TikTok has caused serious injury among teenagers in the UK and US. The skull-breaker challenge involves two people kicking the legs from under a third, making them fall over. US prosecutors have charged two youngsters with aggravated assault over the prank and warned parents to stop their children taking part. TikTok said it would remove such content from its platform. In an updated post to its newsroom,external, TikTok said: ""We do not allow content that encourages or replicates dangerous challenges that might lead to injury. ""In fact, it's a violation of our community guidelines and we will continue to remove this type of content from our platform. ""Nobody wants their friends or family to get hurt filming a video or trying a stunt. ""It's not funny - and since we remove that sort of content, it certainly won't make you TikTok famous."" TikTok urged users to report videos containing the challenge. And it told BBC News there was now text underneath #skullbreakerchallenge ""reminding users to not imitate or encourage public participation in dangerous stunts and/or risky behaviour that could lead to serious injury or death"". In February, a UK mother, whose daughter had taken part in the challenge with two friends wrote on Facebook: ""Please, please if you have teenagers doing TikToks, do not let them get involved in this. ""I'm sitting in [accident and emergency] with my daughter with a severe spinal injury."" Posted beneath the warning was a picture of her daughter taking part in the challenge alongside one of her in hospital in a neck brace. In New Jersey, the Camden County Prosecutor's Office said two children had been been charged with third-degree aggravated assault and third-degree endangering an injured victim after an incident involving the prank. And prosecutor Jill S Mayer urged parents,externalto talk to their children about potential consequences of taking part in a social media challenge. ""While the challenge may seem funny or get views on social media platforms, they can have long-lasting health consequences,"" she said. According to the Washington Post,external, a 13-year-old boy from Camden had been admitted to hospital after the prank. There have also been reports of injuries related to it in Pennsylvania, Oregon, Arkansas and Alabama. Some TikTok users have themselves started posting videos warning the prank can cause serious injury. At the time of writing, most content being shown following a search for ""skull-breaker challenge"" was videos explaining the risks and urging people not to take part.

"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer is asked about his pitch to be the next leader of the Labour Party. Sir Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey have been challenged about their electability and leadership skills in BBC interviews with Andrew Neil. Asked whether he had the charisma to transform Labour's fortunes, Sir Keir said there were ""different ways to inspire people"" and his ""unrelenting"" mission was to return Labour to power. Mrs Long-Bailey said she had the ""big ideas"" needed to win the next election. The pair also were also quizzed on donations and action on anti-Semitism. In separate interviews broadcast on the Andrew Neil show, both the Labour leadership contenders committed to retain key policies from the party's 2019 manifesto despite its overwhelming defeat. Who will be Labour's next leader? The third contender for the Labour crown,Lisa Nandy, was grilled by Andrew Neil last month. Sir Keir, Mrs Long-Bailey and Ms Nandy are vying to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as leader, with the result to be announced on 4 April. In his interview, Sir Keir said if he won his ""unrelenting"" focus would be returning Labour to government at the next election, expected in 2024. Asked if he had the ""fire in his belly"" needed to galvanise Labour after its worst electoral performance, in terms of seats won, since 1935, Sir Keir suggested his leadership style would be different from Mr Corbyn's. This video can not be played Rebecca Long-Bailey is asked what she would do differently as leader ""There are different ways to inspire people. You can inspire people so they want to sit at your feet listening to your next word. That is not me. ""Or you can inspire people by building a team of people who want to come with you on a journey and change their party and their country. That is what I am building in my campaign."" Keir Starmer acknowledged that, at the general election, the question of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership was the number one issue in many areas. But despite repeated invitations to say something critical of Mr Corbyn, he stuck to his message of ""unity"". Although suspected by some on the left of intending to move the party to the centre, he has gone out of his way to reassure the sizeable left-wing slice of the selectorate that he won't ""over-steer"" to the right. So much so that tonight he described the nationalisation of water, mail, and rail as ""baseline indicators"" of where he wants to go. And he went further than his pledge to repeal recent trade union laws. He now declared he'd get rid of all union legislation ""that prohibited collective action"". So in appealing to party members, he is trying to ensure he can't be ""out-lefted"" by Rebecca Long-Bailey. Polls suggest she is in second place. Although she is backed by left-wing grassroots group Momentum, she appeared to be trying to broaden her base. She insisted there was ""no such thing as Corbynism"", and that she is ""not a continuity of Jeremy Corbyn"". While she was 'proud' of the party's policies, she insisted they were ""not left-wing"" nor as ""radical"" as people had thought, stressing that the party needed to talk about ""aspiration"". There haven't been many surprises in this contest. But the respective rhetoric adopted by the apparent frontrunners might have raised some eyebrows, not least among some of their own supporters. Defending his continued backing for the free movement of people to and from Europe after Brexit, Sir Keir told Andrew Neil the views of Labour voters in the party's traditional heartlands on immigration were more nuanced than ""soundbites"" suggested. He dismissed suggestions, levelled by some of Mrs Long-Bailey's supporters, that he was ""hiding"" details of his campaign's financial backers, saying he had received support from trade unions, crowd-funding and individual donations. He insisted he was complying with the rules set out by the party before the contest started, saying the largest donation he had received so far - a Â£100,000 cheque from fellow barrister Robert Latham - had been declared in the MPs register of financial interests. ""The Labour rules say 'carry out the checks you have to carry out' and once you are satisfied that the donations are proper and in order, they go to the parliamentary authorities who put them on the parliamentary website so everyone can see them,"" he said. ""I have been following those procedures. How can you say I am hiding behind the process when it is the Labour Party process."" Mrs Long-Bailey, who has declared more than Â£300,000 in donations from the Unite union and left-wing campaign group Momentum, urged her rival to be open about the source of his donations and put ""more meat on the bone"" about the direction he would take the party in. She defended her record, while a member of Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet, of condemning anti-Semitism, rejecting suggestions she remained silent during a 2018 discussion on whether the party should adopt the international definition of anti-Semitism in full. But she conceded she had not always ""been quick enough"" to call out examples of anti-Semitism, including at a recent campaign event when a member of the public accused prominent Labour politicians, including Jewish MP Margaret Hodge of ""being part of the Israeli lobby"". ""I should have challenged that specific element of that gentleman's contribution directly and I wish I had done that because it was an anti-Semitic statement,"" she said, adding that those guilty of ""clear"" examples of anti-Jewish prejudice should be expelled. During an interview earlier in the campaign, the other candidate Lisa Nandy is asked for her views on university tuition fees, Royal Mail renationalisation, Trident, the NHS using private providers and the top rate of tax.

"The coronavirus pandemic has reached almost every country in the world. Its spread has left national economies and businesses counting the costs, as governments struggle with new lockdown measures to tackle the spread of the virus. Despite the development of new vaccines, many are still wondering what recovery could look like. Here is a selection of charts and maps to help you understand the economic impact of the virus so far. Big shifts in stock markets, where shares in companies are bought and sold, can affect the value of pensions or individual savings accounts (Isas). The FTSE, Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nikkei all saw huge falls as the number of Covid-19 cases grew in the first months of the crisis. The major Asian and US stock markets have recovered following the announcement of the first vaccine in November, but the FTSE is still in negative territory. The FTSE dropped 14.3% in 2020, its worst performance since 2008. In response, central banks in many countries, including the UK, have slashed interest rates. That should, in theory, make borrowing cheaper and encourage spending to boost the economy. Some markets recovered ground in January this year, but this is a normal tendency known as the ""January effect"". Analysts are worried that the possibility of further lockdowns and delays in vaccination programmes might trigger more market volatility this year. Many people have lost their jobs or seen their incomes cut. Unemployment rates have increased across major economies. In the United States, the proportion of people out of work hit a yearly total of 8.9%, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), signalling an end to a decade of jobs expansion. Millions of workers have also been put on government-supported job retention schemes as parts of the economy, such as tourism and hospitality, have come to a near standstill. The numbers of new job opportunities is still very low in many countries. Job vacancies in Australia have returned to the same level of 2019, but they are lagging in France, Spain, the UK and several other countries. Some experts have warned it could be years before levels of employment return to those seen before the pandemic. If the economy is growing, that generally means more wealth and more new jobs. It's measured by looking at the percentage change in gross domestic product, or the value of goods and services produced, typically over three months or a year. The IMF estimates that the global economy shrunk by 4.4% in 2020. The organisation described the decline as the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The only major economy to grow in 2020 was China.It registered a growth of 2.3%. The IMF is, however, predicting global growth of 5.2% in 2021. That will be driven primarily by countries such as India and China, forecast to grow by 8.8% and 8.2% respectively. Recovery in big, services-reliant, economies that have been hit hard by the outbreak, such as the UK or Italy, is expected to be slow. The travel industry has been badly damaged, with airlines cutting flights and customers cancelling business trips and holidays. New variants of the virus - discovered only in recent months - have forced many countries to introduce tighter travel restrictions. Data from the flight tracking service Flight Radar 24 shows that the number of flights globally took a huge hit in 2020 and it is still a long way from recovery. The hospitality sector has been hit hard, with millions of jobs and many companies bankrupt. Data from Transparent,external- an industry-leading intelligence company that covers over 35 million hotel and rental listings worldwide - has registered a fall in reservations in all the top travel destinations. Billions of dollars have been lost in 2020 and although the forecast for 2021 is better, many analysts believe that international travel and tourism won't return to the normal pre-pandemic levels until around 2025. Retail footfall has seen unprecedented falls as shoppers stayed at home. New variants and surges in cases have made problems worse. Pedestrian numbers have fallen further from the first lockdown, according to research firm ShopperTrak, Separate research suggests that consumers are still feeling anxious about their return to stores.Accountancy giant EY,externalsays 67% customers are now not willing to travel more than 5 kilometres for shopping. This change in shopping behaviour has significantly boosted online retail, with a global revenue of $3.9 trillion in 2020. Governments around the world have pledged billions of dollars for a Covid-19 vaccine and treatment options. Shares in some pharmaceutical companies involved in vaccine development have shot up. Moderna, Novavax and AstraZeneca have seen significant rises. But Pfizer has seen its share price fall. The partnership with BioNTech, the high cost of production and management of the vaccine, and the growing number of same-size competitors have reduced the investors' trust in the company to have bigger revenue in 2021. A number of pharmaceutical firms have started already distributing doses and many countries have started their vaccination programmes. Many more - such as Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi/GSK - will join the vaccine distribution during 2021.

"This is the village of San Fiorano in northern Italy's Lombardy region, one of the areas worst affected by coronavirus. Italy has 400 cases of coronavirus and 12 people have died there since the outbreak began. Eleven towns and villages in Lombardy, the region around Milan, and Veneto, which includes Venice, are in a quarantined red zone, home to a total of 55,000 people. They have been told not to leave for two weeks as Italian authorities try to contain the spread of the virus. Daniela Marchiotti, a writer and translator, lives in San Fiorano with husband Daniele and daughter Emma. It's been seven days since the family were told not to leave the red zone. Here, Daniela tells the BBC what life is like in a quarantined village. Daniela and her husband at home in San Fiorano in Italy's quarantined red zone ""It all feels surreal. ""Last week when the news first came out there was some initial anxiety as the information was worrying and confusing. ""There were long queues to buy supplies and the shops were only allowing people inside in small groups. People were buying bleach and disinfectant which quickly went out of stock. ""It was also compulsory to wear a mask. If you weren't wearing one you would be sent home. ""On Tuesday, it was carnival here but all events were cancelled. But my husband wore a wig and headed out to buy supplies. ""He wanted to give people a reason to laugh and keep their spirits up. Daniele donned a carnival wig when he headed out to buy groceries earlier this week ""But now things are less strict. Since yesterday the authorities have confirmed masks are no longer necessary inside supermarkets as long as people limit their movements, but many are wearing them nevertheless. ""Then there are the patrols, both the police and the army are at the borders of the red zone, which we are allowed to move within but not out of. ""Life has certainly taken an unexpected turn but people here are very resourceful. Coronavirus cases surge to 400 in Italy Live updates ""Volunteers are bringing food and medicines to the sick or the old who cannot leave their homes, and a few newsagents have opened so that older people can buy newspapers and keep up-to-date with the latest advice. ""Apart from the initial fears, it's all very calm and quiet. There is no panic. ""Sometimes we go out for short walks, to stop ourselves from going crazy confined inside. ""At least we can take advantage of this glorious weather but as you can see, there is almost nobody around. ""Just the odd dog walker or someone running an errand while wearing a face mask. ""Other times I pass the hours reading with my daughter. Daniela and her daughter Emma read together to pass the time. ""I am lucky that I can work from home but many can't and have been forced to stay home because their places of work are shut. ""Those of us with children try to keep them busy and calm and we are waiting for the schools to start some online activities.

"Struggling airline Flybe is facing fresh doubts over its future amid uncertainty about a rescue loan and the impact of coronavirus on its bookings. Flybe is looking to the government to commit to helping the airline in the next few days if it is to survive. But a Â£100m government loan to help stabilise the business is now unlikely to happen, the BBC understands. The coronavirus impact on travel ""has made a bad situation much worse,"" insiders told the BBC. According to the FT,external, which first reported the news, the airline believes it has enough financial resources to survive ""until the end of this month"". Flybe has been in discussions with the government about a loan of up to Â£100m to help it bridge the period between the lean months of winter - when airlines typically lose money - to the richer pickings in summer. The government also agreed to consider a cut to airline passenger duty (APD). Currently, this Â£13 per person tax on short haul flying is levied per passenger leaving UK airports. That means that domestic routes pay the tax twice and Flybe has been pushing for the tax to be halved on internal UK flights. Neither of these options now seem likely. Government considers ownership stake in Flybe The BBC understands that changes to the Air Passenger Duty regime are constrained by the fact that the UK is still bound by EU single market rules until the end of the transition period at the end of this year. If changes to APD can't take effect before then, the government is reluctant to extend any kind of loan to an airline likely to continue to be loss making for the next nine months. As one source put it ""the government has always been worried it would be throwing good money after bad - and those worries have only intensified. the direction of travel on these issues has been apparent to the government and the company  for weeks. The only thing that has changed is coronavirus."" Those worries have been amplified by the outrage of rival airlines that Flybe should be the recipient of tax payer money given the airline is owned by deep pocketed owners Virgin Atlantic, logistics company Stobart and multi-billion dollar US hedge fund Cyrus Capital. It is thought the owners have injected enough money to keep the airline aloft until the end of March but if the mood music coming from government is right, this airline's troubled journey may soon terminate. Flybe serves around 170 destinations and has a major presence at UK airports such as Aberdeen, Belfast City, Manchester and Southampton. It flies the most UK domestic routes between airports outside London. Rival Ryanair has predicted the drop in demand for flights due to the coronavirus will result in some European airlines failing in the coming weeks. In January, news that Flybe may benefit from government help, sparked a backlash from rivals. British Airways' owner IAG has filed a complaint to the EU arguing Flybe's rescue breaches state aid rules. While, EasyJet and Ryanair said taxpayer funds should not be used to save a rival. The government's proposal to cut Air Passenger Duty (APD), was also attacked by the rail industry's trade body and climate campaign groups.

"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer is asked about his pitch to be the next leader of the Labour Party. Sir Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey have been challenged about their electability and leadership skills in BBC interviews with Andrew Neil. Asked whether he had the charisma to transform Labour's fortunes, Sir Keir said there were ""different ways to inspire people"" and his ""unrelenting"" mission was to return Labour to power. Mrs Long-Bailey said she had the ""big ideas"" needed to win the next election. The pair also were also quizzed on donations and action on anti-Semitism. In separate interviews broadcast on the Andrew Neil show, both the Labour leadership contenders committed to retain key policies from the party's 2019 manifesto despite its overwhelming defeat. Who will be Labour's next leader? The third contender for the Labour crown,Lisa Nandy, was grilled by Andrew Neil last month. Sir Keir, Mrs Long-Bailey and Ms Nandy are vying to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as leader, with the result to be announced on 4 April. In his interview, Sir Keir said if he won his ""unrelenting"" focus would be returning Labour to government at the next election, expected in 2024. Asked if he had the ""fire in his belly"" needed to galvanise Labour after its worst electoral performance, in terms of seats won, since 1935, Sir Keir suggested his leadership style would be different from Mr Corbyn's. This video can not be played Rebecca Long-Bailey is asked what she would do differently as leader ""There are different ways to inspire people. You can inspire people so they want to sit at your feet listening to your next word. That is not me. ""Or you can inspire people by building a team of people who want to come with you on a journey and change their party and their country. That is what I am building in my campaign."" Keir Starmer acknowledged that, at the general election, the question of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership was the number one issue in many areas. But despite repeated invitations to say something critical of Mr Corbyn, he stuck to his message of ""unity"". Although suspected by some on the left of intending to move the party to the centre, he has gone out of his way to reassure the sizeable left-wing slice of the selectorate that he won't ""over-steer"" to the right. So much so that tonight he described the nationalisation of water, mail, and rail as ""baseline indicators"" of where he wants to go. And he went further than his pledge to repeal recent trade union laws. He now declared he'd get rid of all union legislation ""that prohibited collective action"". So in appealing to party members, he is trying to ensure he can't be ""out-lefted"" by Rebecca Long-Bailey. Polls suggest she is in second place. Although she is backed by left-wing grassroots group Momentum, she appeared to be trying to broaden her base. She insisted there was ""no such thing as Corbynism"", and that she is ""not a continuity of Jeremy Corbyn"". While she was 'proud' of the party's policies, she insisted they were ""not left-wing"" nor as ""radical"" as people had thought, stressing that the party needed to talk about ""aspiration"". There haven't been many surprises in this contest. But the respective rhetoric adopted by the apparent frontrunners might have raised some eyebrows, not least among some of their own supporters. Defending his continued backing for the free movement of people to and from Europe after Brexit, Sir Keir told Andrew Neil the views of Labour voters in the party's traditional heartlands on immigration were more nuanced than ""soundbites"" suggested. He dismissed suggestions, levelled by some of Mrs Long-Bailey's supporters, that he was ""hiding"" details of his campaign's financial backers, saying he had received support from trade unions, crowd-funding and individual donations. He insisted he was complying with the rules set out by the party before the contest started, saying the largest donation he had received so far - a Â£100,000 cheque from fellow barrister Robert Latham - had been declared in the MPs register of financial interests. ""The Labour rules say 'carry out the checks you have to carry out' and once you are satisfied that the donations are proper and in order, they go to the parliamentary authorities who put them on the parliamentary website so everyone can see them,"" he said. ""I have been following those procedures. How can you say I am hiding behind the process when it is the Labour Party process."" Mrs Long-Bailey, who has declared more than Â£300,000 in donations from the Unite union and left-wing campaign group Momentum, urged her rival to be open about the source of his donations and put ""more meat on the bone"" about the direction he would take the party in. She defended her record, while a member of Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet, of condemning anti-Semitism, rejecting suggestions she remained silent during a 2018 discussion on whether the party should adopt the international definition of anti-Semitism in full. But she conceded she had not always ""been quick enough"" to call out examples of anti-Semitism, including at a recent campaign event when a member of the public accused prominent Labour politicians, including Jewish MP Margaret Hodge of ""being part of the Israeli lobby"". ""I should have challenged that specific element of that gentleman's contribution directly and I wish I had done that because it was an anti-Semitic statement,"" she said, adding that those guilty of ""clear"" examples of anti-Jewish prejudice should be expelled. During an interview earlier in the campaign, the other candidate Lisa Nandy is asked for her views on university tuition fees, Royal Mail renationalisation, Trident, the NHS using private providers and the top rate of tax.

"A papillon named Dylan was crowned Best in Show with his owner Kathleen Roosens at last year's Crufts Two of Crufts' major sponsors have asked their staff not to attend the dog show amid fears over coronavirus. Royal Canin UK and James Wellbeloved said their representatives should stay away from large events like Crufts ""unless it is business critical"". The Association of Pet Dog Trainers (APDT) has also decided not to go. Crufts organisers the Kennel Club said the event in Birmingham will go ahead, with ""enhanced measures"" to protect people. The annual dog show at the National Exhibition Centre (NEC) attracts competitors and visitors from all over the world - last year there were 160,000 visitors. Out of almost21,000 competing dogs to attend last year, 3,611 were from overseas. Italy - where some 2,706 people are infected with the virus and 107 have died- led the way for last year's foreign entries with 413. The Kennel Club, saidin a statement,external, that the measures introduced would include hand sanitiser stations at entrances, additional signage, and hand sanitiser in toilets and catering areas. They added that Public Health England had not advised them to cancel the event, but  said they were ensuring all exhibitors were ""aware of current travel restrictions and guidelines"". Coronavirus cases in UK jump to 85 Patients to be seen by video to stem virus spread How is the UK planning to stop coronavirus? Eight charts on how coronavirus has hit the global economy A spokesperson for Mars Petcare UK, the parent company of Royal Canin UK and James Wellbeloved, said that as a global business, it has a ""responsibility"" to protect the health of its staff and prevent the spread of the virus. As a result, the company has ""decided to restrict international travel and not participate in large events through March 31 unless it is business critical."" The firm said it remained ""committed"" to Crufts, and hoped to be participating ""to the usual extent in the future"". The company would not disclose how many staff were asked not to attend Crufts, or what their duties were. Last year's Toy Poodle judging competition Meanwhile, the Association of Pet Dog Trainers (APDT), saidin a statement,externalthey had decided not to attend ""given the unprecedented and unpredictable situation."" They added they were ""very disappointed"" but the ""safety of our members remains our priority"". It comes as the total number of UK cases of the virus rises to 85, with more than 90,000 people infected globally in over 50 countries. The 129th edition of Crufts starts on Thursday and will take place over four days until Sunday March 8.

Sarah Fray, who is exhibiting Polly, her miniature poodle tomorrow, says is she only attending because the dog's ""novice"" co-owner is ""desperate"" for her to be shown. She is worried about the virus spreading at Crufts and plans to limit her time there to just a few hours, and will ask visitors to ""keep their distance"" from her and Polly. Sarah Fray, pictured with Polly at a previous dog show Ms Fray, from the Isle of Sheppey, in Kent, says it is a ""shame"" to have to do this, but as a veterinary medicine student and a single mother to a young child, she ""doesn't have time"" to get sick, were she to catch the virus. But not everyone shares her concerns, she says, with the issue causing something of a ""Brexit divide"" between exhibitors in online forums. Ann Mckeon Collins, from Dublin, had been due to show her Standard Poodle, Luda, at Crufts, but has cancelled her trip, saying she ""couldn't risk it"" on health grounds. Mrs Mckeon Collins, 59, said it would be ""a bit on the silly side"" to attend when she has a pacemaker fitted, has had cancer and her husband has asthma. She says a lot of elderly people go for a day out to admire the dogs, and felt she would be better off staying at home.

"The Italian Red Cross of Mascalucia is among those warning children not to copy the challenge A stunt being shared on viral video platform TikTok has caused serious injury among teenagers in the UK and US. The skull-breaker challenge involves two people kicking the legs from under a third, making them fall over. US prosecutors have charged two youngsters with aggravated assault over the prank and warned parents to stop their children taking part. TikTok said it would remove such content from its platform. In an updated post to its newsroom,external, TikTok said: ""We do not allow content that encourages or replicates dangerous challenges that might lead to injury. ""In fact, it's a violation of our community guidelines and we will continue to remove this type of content from our platform. ""Nobody wants their friends or family to get hurt filming a video or trying a stunt. ""It's not funny - and since we remove that sort of content, it certainly won't make you TikTok famous."" TikTok urged users to report videos containing the challenge. And it told BBC News there was now text underneath #skullbreakerchallenge ""reminding users to not imitate or encourage public participation in dangerous stunts and/or risky behaviour that could lead to serious injury or death"". In February, a UK mother, whose daughter had taken part in the challenge with two friends wrote on Facebook: ""Please, please if you have teenagers doing TikToks, do not let them get involved in this. ""I'm sitting in [accident and emergency] with my daughter with a severe spinal injury."" Posted beneath the warning was a picture of her daughter taking part in the challenge alongside one of her in hospital in a neck brace. In New Jersey, the Camden County Prosecutor's Office said two children had been been charged with third-degree aggravated assault and third-degree endangering an injured victim after an incident involving the prank. And prosecutor Jill S Mayer urged parents,externalto talk to their children about potential consequences of taking part in a social media challenge. ""While the challenge may seem funny or get views on social media platforms, they can have long-lasting health consequences,"" she said. According to the Washington Post,external, a 13-year-old boy from Camden had been admitted to hospital after the prank. There have also been reports of injuries related to it in Pennsylvania, Oregon, Arkansas and Alabama. Some TikTok users have themselves started posting videos warning the prank can cause serious injury. At the time of writing, most content being shown following a search for ""skull-breaker challenge"" was videos explaining the risks and urging people not to take part.

"Caroline Flack won a British Academy Television Award for Love Island in 2018 A watchdog has decided there is no need to investigate police contact with Caroline Flack before her death. The Independent Office for Police Conduct said there was no indication of a ""causal link"" between the actions of police and the presenter's death. Officers last had contact with the 40-year-old on 13 December when she was in custody following an alleged assault. Separately, an internal review by the CPS has defended its decision to charge Flack and its handling of the case. The ex-Love Island host, who took her own life in February, had been charged with assaulting her boyfriend, despite the fact he did not support the prosecution. Who decides whether someone should go to trial? TV presenter Caroline Flack dies at 40 Social media under scrutiny in wake of Flack death Following Flack's death on 15 February, the Metropolitan Police Servicereferred itself to the police watchdog It is standard practice for a referral to be made when a person who had recent contact with police died, the Met said. But the watchdog decided there was ""no indication of a causal link - directly or indirectly - between the actions or omissions of the police and Caroline Flack's tragic death"". It addedin a statement,external, that officers had arranged for her to see a health professional while she was in custody, and that ""relevant policy and procedure was followed to give her further guidance."" Meanwhilel, the CPS said its review ""found that the case was handled appropriately and in line with [our] published legal guidance"". ""Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Caroline Flack,"" a spokesperson said. The CPS review followed a Freedom of Information request fromthe Daily Mirror,externaland criticism from some that it had pursued a ""show trial"" against the star. The organisation said it was ""normal practice for prosecutors to hold a debriefing in complex or sensitive cases after they have ended"". Ms Flack pleaded not guilty to an assault charge at a court appearance on 23 December 2019, when it was heard her boyfriend Lewis Burton did not support the prosecution. She was released on bail but was ordered to stop any contact with Burton ahead of the trial, which would have begun on Wednesday. The TV presenter was found dead at her London flat last month - a day after she learned that the CPS were pursuing the charges against her. She had left her role presenting Love Island after being charged with assaulting Burton. Inan unpublished Instagram postshared by her family, Ms Flack said her ""whole world and future was swept from under my feet"" following her arrest - which saw the presenter become the focus of media scrutiny. At the time of her death, Ms Flack's management company said the star had been ""under huge pressure"" and criticised the CPS for refusing to drop charges, even though Burton said he did not want the case to go ahead. In a statement released the day after her death, the CPS said: ""We do not decide whether a person is guilty of a criminal offence - that is for the jury, judge or magistrate - but we must make the key decision of whether a case should be put before a court."" Earlier this week,a petition signed by more than 850,000 people was handed in to the government, calling for curbs on the British media. It calls for the establishment of a new law, dubbed Caroline's Law, which would make media bullying and harassment a criminal offence. ""Politicians need to urgently step in and make sure there are consequences when the media bully and harass,"" said Holly Maltby, of campaigning group 38 Degrees.

"Boots has suspended payments using loyalty points in shops and online after attempts to break into customers' accounts using stolen passwords. Customers will not be able to use Boots Advantage Card points to pay for products while the issue is dealt with. Boots said none of its own systems were compromised, but attackers had tried to access accounts using reused passwords from other sites. It comes days after a similar issue hit 600,000 Tesco Clubcard holders. A spokeswoman for Boots told the BBC the issue affected less than 1% of the company's 14.4 million active Advantage Cards - fewer than 150,000 people. But it could not give an exact number as the company was still dealing with the problem. No credit card information had been accessed, they said. Suspending payments using points removed the risk of hackers stealing the points to spend themselves, the spokeswoman said. Customers can still earn points when making purchases, and Boots hopes to have point payments back up as soon as possible. Boots launched its Advantage Card in 1997 ""We are writing to customers if we believe that their account has been affected, and if their Boots Advantage Card points have been used fraudulently we will, of course, replace them,"" the company said in a statement. ""We would like to reassure our customers that these details were not obtained from Boots,"" it added. The Boots Advantage card lets shoppers collect four points for every Â£1 spent, and each point is worth a penny. For example, a card with 200 points could be used to pay for an item worth Â£2. But the points can also be used when purchasing items online. Tesco issues warning to 600,000 Clubcard holders How do companies use my reward card data? So-called ""password stuffing"" happens when an attacker uses a list of compromised usernames and passwords from a previous data breach. They then try to log in to a different website, hoping for a match. Because many people use the same email and password combination for several websites, some of the combinations on the compromised list might work. In Tesco's case, the supermarket giant told customers it believed that a compromised list of usernames and passwords had been used to try to gain access to its customers' accounts - and it may have worked in some cases. It said no financial information was accessed, and it had restricted access to the accounts to prevent fraudulent use. Jake Moore, cyber-security specialist at internet security firm Eset, said that Boots reminding their customers about the risk was a good move - but that password reuse is a ""gigantic problem"" in cyber-security. ""These lists of passwords can be easily found on the dark web for very little, or even free,"" he said. ""It would be a good idea for people to check they have implemented two factor authentication on each of their accounts as this makes the password stuffing attack that much harder."" ""My further advice is to use a password manager to store your uniquely different passwords robustly online so you don't have to remember them all."" Boots said customers could reset their passwords online, and should choose a unique password not used on other sites.

"The UK has seen its biggest day-on-day increase in coronavirus cases, bringing the total number to 87. Almost all of the 36 new patients had recently travelled to affected countries or been infected by others who had done so, the UK's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty said. But it is not clear how three new patients in England caught the virus. Meanwhile, it has emerged that two patients at King's College Hospital have been diagnosed with the virus. A family member of an elderly patient at the south London hospital told the BBC one of those who was infected had been staying in the same room as his relative prior to being diagnosed. The hospital said it had restricted access for staff and visitors to the affected ward, and was tracing those who may have come into contact with the infected patients. As of Wednesday afternoon, 87 cases have been confirmed in the UK. There are 80 in England, three in Scotland, one in Wales andthree in Northern Ireland. HOW IS THE UK PLANNING FOR AN OUTBREAK:How prepared are we? WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?A simple guide HOW TO SELF-ISOLATE:What you need to know WHERE ARE WE WITH A VACCINE?Progress so far A VISUAL GUIDE TO THE OUTBREAK:Virus maps and charts Health minister Edward Argar toldBBC Breakfastthe UK was ""still very much"" in the first ""contain"" phase of the government'sfour-part response to the virus,external. He said the government would not move on to the second phase - known as the ""delay"" phase - unless Prof Whitty advised it ""on the basis of specific changes in circumstances"". The contain phase involves trying to prevent the virus from becoming widespread - in part by tracing contacts of anyone who is infected. The delay phase aims to slow the spread of the virus so that it does not reach its peak during the winter. This would ease the impact on the NHS. Two of the latest patients are Scottish, with one living in the Grampian area and the other in Ayrshire. One had recently travelled to northern Italy while the other had contact with a known positive case. New cases of the virus in England have been confirmed in Liverpool, York, Carlisle, Newcastle, Torquay and Manchester, as well as in Lancashire and Derbyshire. In Northern Ireland, a Queen's University postgraduate student, who recently returned from northern Italy and has been mixing with fellow students, tested positive. Eight charts on how coronavirus has hit the global economy Face mask ads banned for 'misleading' virus claims Meanwhile, students at Goldsmiths in south London have been told a visitor to one of the university's halls of residences has coronavirus. In an email, the university said the person was ""being looked after"" and that the student they visited was ""self-isolating as a precautionary measure"". Buckingham University and the University of London have put back their graduation ceremonies to minimise the spread of the disease. Prof Whitty -who earlier said an epidemic in the UK was ""likely""- said people who had been in contact with the new patients are being traced. In ""the worst case scenario"", up to 80% of the UK population could be infected with coronavirus, which causes the disease Covid-19, he said. But he said a move to lock down entire towns and cities across the UK would be ""very unlikely"".

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said washing hands regularly was the ""single most important thing that an individual can do"". Public Health England says to use a hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available, advising that hand washing is particularly important after using public transport. This video can not be played Steps the NHS says you should take to protect yourself from Covid-19 It's the biggest daily rise we have had. But this is not unexpected - health officials have been warning we should be braced for an increase. This could last for two or three months until a peak is reached. Of the new cases, three are worrying from the perspective that the government has been unable to establish how they were infected. They have no links to people who have been abroad to places where there are significant outbreaks. That brings the total number of cases like this to five - and could be a sign that the virus is circulating in the community. Some of the other new cases are not people who had been abroad, but were infected in this country by people who had been. That in itself is a sign there are clusters developing that the health authorities will be working hard to contain. Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced emergency legislation allowingworkers to get statutory sick pay from the first day they are off work, not the fourth, to help contain the virus. Mr Johnson told the House of Commons that people who self-isolate should not be ""penalised for doing the right thing"".

"Italy has the most serious outbreak in Europe Italy has confirmed that it will shut all schools from Thursday for 10 days as it battles to contain the coronavirus outbreak. And all professional sport, including Serie A football matches, will be played behind closed doorsfor a month. A total of 107 people have now been killed by the coronavirus in Italy, which has the most serious outbreak in Europe. PM Giuseppe Conte said the health service risked being overwhelmed. Most of the more than 3,000 cases are in the north but others have been confirmed in 19 of Italy's 20 regions. As it happened: Updates from across the globe Eight charts on how coronavirus has hit the global economy Face mask ads banned for 'misleading' virus claims Globally about 3,200 people have died and more than 90,000 have been infected, the vast majority in China, where the virus emerged late last year. The World Health Organization has so far stopped short of declaring a pandemic - an epidemic spreading across the world through local transmission - but on Wednesday Germany's health minister said the coronavirus now met the definition. This video can not be played Steps the NHS says you should take to protect yourself from Covid-19 ""The situation is changing very quickly... What's clear is that we have not yet reached the peak of the outbreak,"" Jens Spahn said. Confirmed cases have been reported in 81 countries, with Italy, Iran and South Korea emerging as hotspots outside China. Mark Lowen, BBC Rome correspondent Italy is suffering: with cafes and hotels half-empty, the tourism sector here is predicted to lose Â£6.5bn (8.5bn). Another town north of Milan could be placed in quarantine as cases there grow. But the containment measures so far have failed to halt the spread - there's now been the first death south of Rome. And while the prime minister sounded a reassuring note in an address last night, fear of this crisis is deepening. The US House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved an $8.3bn (Â£6.5bn) funding bill to combat the spread of coronavirus. The emergency legislation now goes to the Senate California has recorded the first death in the US outside Washington state. Los Angeles has declared a public health emergency Israel is imposing new travel restrictions on five European countries - France, Germany, Spain, Austria and Switzerland Saudi Arabia has suspended the lesser Muslim pilgrimage, or Umra, for Saudi citizens and residents of the Gulf kingdom Iraq has announced two deaths.

Education Minister Lucia Azzolina said she hoped students would be able to resume classes as soon as possible. ""My commitment is to ensure that the essential public service, albeit from a distance, is provided to all our students,"" she said. Local media said health experts and Italy's health ministry had been in favour of closing schools. Italy's death toll from the virus had jumped by 28 to 107, the Civil Protection Agency said on Wednesday. Most of the deaths have been in the Lombardy region around Milan, and in northern areas near Bologna and Venice. Earlier measures including the quarantine of 11 towns near Milan with a combined population of 50,000 have failed to stop the spread of infections.

"The UK has seen its biggest day-on-day increase in coronavirus cases, bringing the total number to 87. Almost all of the 36 new patients had recently travelled to affected countries or been infected by others who had done so, the UK's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty said. But it is not clear how three new patients in England caught the virus. Meanwhile, it has emerged that two patients at King's College Hospital have been diagnosed with the virus. A family member of an elderly patient at the south London hospital told the BBC one of those who was infected had been staying in the same room as his relative prior to being diagnosed. The hospital said it had restricted access for staff and visitors to the affected ward, and was tracing those who may have come into contact with the infected patients. As of Wednesday afternoon, 87 cases have been confirmed in the UK. There are 80 in England, three in Scotland, one in Wales andthree in Northern Ireland. HOW IS THE UK PLANNING FOR AN OUTBREAK:How prepared are we? WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?A simple guide HOW TO SELF-ISOLATE:What you need to know WHERE ARE WE WITH A VACCINE?Progress so far A VISUAL GUIDE TO THE OUTBREAK:Virus maps and charts Health minister Edward Argar toldBBC Breakfastthe UK was ""still very much"" in the first ""contain"" phase of the government'sfour-part response to the virus,external. He said the government would not move on to the second phase - known as the ""delay"" phase - unless Prof Whitty advised it ""on the basis of specific changes in circumstances"". The contain phase involves trying to prevent the virus from becoming widespread - in part by tracing contacts of anyone who is infected. The delay phase aims to slow the spread of the virus so that it does not reach its peak during the winter. This would ease the impact on the NHS. Two of the latest patients are Scottish, with one living in the Grampian area and the other in Ayrshire. One had recently travelled to northern Italy while the other had contact with a known positive case. New cases of the virus in England have been confirmed in Liverpool, York, Carlisle, Newcastle, Torquay and Manchester, as well as in Lancashire and Derbyshire. In Northern Ireland, a Queen's University postgraduate student, who recently returned from northern Italy and has been mixing with fellow students, tested positive. Eight charts on how coronavirus has hit the global economy Face mask ads banned for 'misleading' virus claims Meanwhile, students at Goldsmiths in south London have been told a visitor to one of the university's halls of residences has coronavirus. In an email, the university said the person was ""being looked after"" and that the student they visited was ""self-isolating as a precautionary measure"". Buckingham University and the University of London have put back their graduation ceremonies to minimise the spread of the disease. Prof Whitty -who earlier said an epidemic in the UK was ""likely""- said people who had been in contact with the new patients are being traced. In ""the worst case scenario"", up to 80% of the UK population could be infected with coronavirus, which causes the disease Covid-19, he said. But he said a move to lock down entire towns and cities across the UK would be ""very unlikely"".

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said washing hands regularly was the ""single most important thing that an individual can do"". Public Health England says to use a hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available, advising that hand washing is particularly important after using public transport. This video can not be played Steps the NHS says you should take to protect yourself from Covid-19 It's the biggest daily rise we have had. But this is not unexpected - health officials have been warning we should be braced for an increase. This could last for two or three months until a peak is reached. Of the new cases, three are worrying from the perspective that the government has been unable to establish how they were infected. They have no links to people who have been abroad to places where there are significant outbreaks. That brings the total number of cases like this to five - and could be a sign that the virus is circulating in the community. Some of the other new cases are not people who had been abroad, but were infected in this country by people who had been. That in itself is a sign there are clusters developing that the health authorities will be working hard to contain. Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced emergency legislation allowingworkers to get statutory sick pay from the first day they are off work, not the fourth, to help contain the virus. Mr Johnson told the House of Commons that people who self-isolate should not be ""penalised for doing the right thing"". The sick pay announcement means those receiving statutory sick pay would get an extra Â£40 a week, paid for by their employers. The government has saidup to a fifth of the workforce may be off sickduring the peak of a coronavirus epidemic in the UK. About 90,000 people have been infected globally since the outbreak of coronavirus in Hubei province, China, in December, with cases in more than 50 countries and more than 3,000 deaths.

"Victoria Police described the fishing-rod theft as ""fairly blatant"" and ""quite bold"" Australian police are attempting to catch a thief who used a fishing rod to steal a Versace necklace from a high-end designer store in Melbourne. The thief was caught on CCTV trying to hook the A$800 (US$529; Â£414) jewellery off a mannequin's neck. He poked the rod through a hole he chipped in the store's window without setting off the alarm, police said. Using two rods, the thief took three hours to land his catch, reeling in the necklace at about 02:00 on 24 February. Steven Adigrati, owner of the Le Style boutique, told local media he was stunned by the ""outrageous and courageous"" theft. ""I couldn't believe it,""Mr Adigrati told Nine News,external.

"Det Supt Emma Kirby said she wants to identify the men in the CCTV pictures Images of three suspects have been released after a racist attack on a student who was told ""we don't want your coronavirus in our country"". Jonathan Mok, 23, said he was walking down Oxford Street on 24 February when a group of four men began shouting. Mr Mok, from Singapore, said the group beat him up when he confronted them. Det Sgt Emma Kirby said the attack was being treated as racially aggravated and the Met was ""committed to finding the perpetrators"". University College London student Mr Mok said he was attacked at about 21:15 GMT close to Tottenham Court Road. Images of his bruised eye posted on Facebook have been shared thousands of times. Jonathan Mok posted a selfie and another photo of his injuries on Facebook Describing the attack, Mr Mok said the man who kicked him ""was really angry"". ""He shouted: 'I don't want your coronavirus in my country',"" Mr Mok told the BBC. The 23-year-old said one of the men threw a punch, causing his nose to bleed badly. ""I just could not understand why someone would target another person simply because of their skin colour - it simply does not make sense to me,"" he said. ""I had an X-ray scan and the doctor told me there was a broken bone around the right side of my face and that I will need to see a specialist. ""It is possible I will need an operation."" Police said the attack happened on Oxford Street near to Tottenham Court Road Tube station Mr Mok said he felt the coronavirus outbreak has been used by some as an excuse to ""further hatred for people different from them"". ""I just think it's a pity to have such experiences taint the image of this beautiful city [that has] so many nice people. ""When people see Asian [people] wearing face masks they automatically assume that they are ill and I've heard of incidents of people getting shouted at on the Tube for wearing face masks. ""I've really been blind to subtle racism issues, so coming out here and experiencing it shows there is a serious problem and we need to do something about it.""

"Taliban fighters were celebrating the US deal earlier this week The US military has conducted an air strike against Taliban fighters in Afghanistan, just hours after President Donald Trump said he had had a ""very good talk"" with a leader of the group. The US signed a deal with the Taliban on Saturday aimed at bringing peace to Afghanistan after years of war. But a US forces spokesman said it launched an air strike on Wednesday in response to Taliban fighters attacking Afghan forces in Helmand province. The Taliban called for de-escalation. In a post on Twitter, spokesman Suhail Shaheen said the group ""plans to implement all parts of the agreement one after another to prevent conflict escalation"". ""The opposite side should also remove the obstacles in implementing all parts of the agreement so the way is paved for comprehensive peace and for the Afghans to have their basic rights,"" he added. It was not clear if there were any casualties. Wednesday's strike was the first by the US against the Taliban in 11 days, when a reduction in violence agreement began between the two sides in the lead-up to Saturday's pact. In a statement on Twitter, Colonel Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for the US forces in Afghanistan, said it was a ""defensive strike"" to disrupt an attack on an Afghan National Security Forces checkpoint. The Afghan war: The short and long story What will Taliban do after signing US deal? Who are the Taliban? Afghanistan: the long road to peace The spokesman added that the US was still ""committed to peace"" but had a responsibility to defend its Afghan partners. He said Afghans and the US had complied with their side of the agreement, while the Taliban appeared intent on ""squandering"" the opportunity. This video can not be played Is peace with the Taliban possible? On Tuesday alone, he said, the Taliban had launched 43 attacks on checkpoints belonging to Afghan forces in Helmand. ""We call on the Taliban to stop needless attacks and uphold their commitments. As we have demonstrated, we will defend our partners when required,"" he wrote. The Taliban has so far declined to confirm or deny responsibility for any of the attacks. Secunder Kermani, Pakistan/Afghanistan correspondent US and Afghan officials had both said they expected the partial truce or ""reduction in violence"" that led up to the agreement in Doha would continue afterwards. But the text of the agreement makes no mention of this. That ambiguity seems partly responsible for the confusing situation developing on the ground. The current spate of attacks by the Taliban could be seen as an attempt by the insurgents to pressurise the Afghan government into releasing thousands of their prisoners. They're demanding that before beginning ""intra-Afghan"" talks with the government and other Afghan political leaders. But so far President Ashraf Ghani has refused to agree to this. However, it's also possible that the Taliban plan to continue fighting throughout the ""intra-Afghan talks"" in order to improve their negotiating position, and to keep their fighters mobilised. On Saturday the US and the Taliban signed an ""agreement for bringing peace"" to Afghanistan after more than 18 years of conflict. The US and its Nato allies agreed to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants upheld the deal. This video can not be played The United States and the Taliban mark the signing of their agreement in Doha But violence surged in Afghanistan just days after the agreement was signed, with the Taliban ending a partial truce and resuming fighting with Afghan government troops. Central to the obstacles facing the deal is the disagreement over prisoner swaps. Under the accord, some 5,000 Taliban prisoners and 1,000 Afghan security force prisoners are meant to be exchanged by 10 March, when talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government are due to start. But Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani said on Sunday that his government had agreed to no such release. And on Monday the militants said talks would not take place if their prisoners were not released first. Although the US-Taliban deal provides for the prisoner swap, a separate US-Afghan declaration commits the government in Kabul only to participating in talks on the ""feasibility"" of such a release. Following reports of numerous Taliban attacks on Tuesday, Mr Trump shared a phone call with a leader of the group, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, about keeping peace efforts on track. The US president said it was a ""very good talk"", while the Taliban said Mr Trump had pledged to ask his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to talk with Mr Ghani to make sure negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban went ahead as planned. This video can not be played Donald Trump hails ""very good talk"" with Taliban leader The Taliban have previously refused to negotiate with the Afghan government, so Saturday's deal was just with the US. The US attacked Afghanistan in October 2001 to oust the Taliban, whom they said were harbouring Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 9/11 attacks. The Taliban were removed from power but became an insurgent force that by 2018 was active in more than two-thirds of the country.

"The Ring doorbells use both cameras and motion sensors to detect when someone approaches Amazon keeps records of every motion detected by its Ring doorbells, as well as the exact time they are logged down to the millisecond. The details were revealed via a data request submitted by the BBC. It also disclosed that every interaction with Ring's app is also stored, including the model of phone or tablet and mobile network used. One expert said it gave Amazon the potential for even broader insight into its customers' lives. ""What's most interesting is not just the data itself, but all the patterns and insights that can be learned from it,"" commented independent privacy expert Frederike Kaltheuner. ""Knowing when someone rings your door, how often, and for how long, can indicate when someone is at home. ""If nobody ever rang your door, that would probably say something about your social life as well."" She added that it remained unclear how much further ""anonymised"" data was also being collected. ""This isn't just about privacy, but about the power and monetary value that is attached to this data."" Amazon says it uses the information to evaluate, manage and improve its products and services. The BBC originally made the data subject access request (DSAR) in January to tie into a wider investigation into the ways Amazon gathers and uses information about its customers. Find out how Bezos built his data machine At that point, the firm declined to elaborate on what information was collectedbeyond its privacy notice's mentions,externalof ""data about your interactions"", ""device characteristics"" and other such inexact terms. The records ultimately provided ran from 28 September 2019 until 3 February 2020. A Ring 2 Video Doorbell was in use over all this time, and a Ring Indoor Cam was added to the account over the final fortnight. Over the period, there were 1,939 individual ""camera events"" documented. These included: a motion being detected by the cameras' sensors a ""ding"" of the doorbell, when its button had been pressed by a visitor a remote ""on-demand"" action by the user to get a live video and audio feed and/or remotely speak to a visitor A sample of the ""event"" database, which has been edited to obscure the device IDs In each case, the length of time the equipment was activated was also logged. Ring says its camerasuse face and body-shape analysis to help differentiate between humans and other living things,externalin order to minimise false alarms. However, there was no indication of different types of motion being detected in the shared data. The largest database provided documented every interaction with Ring's apps. It listed 4,906 actions over the 129-day period. These included: every time the app was opened whenever the user ""zoomed in"" via a finger-pinch to view the footage more clearly a variety of different-classed screen taps details of the start and end to each live-view In each case, the model of device used, the version of its operating system, the type of mobile data-connection involved and network supplier were all listed. Ring's app allows you to review past footage as well as see a live-view from the camera Among other records were the details of the latitude and longitude co-ordinates of the two devices, provided to 13 decimal places. In theory, this would pinpoint where the products had been installed to the nearest 0.00001mm. Amazon: How Bezos built his data machine Amazon Ring workers fired for accessing user video Ring doorbell makes two-factor verification mandatory When checked via an online tool, the readings corresponded to the right property. However, since the same co-ordinates were given for both devices - which were based in different parts of the building - it appears that Amazon does not know the products' locations to this degree of precision. In total, 11 databases were shared containing close to 26,500 individual fields. Ring's privacy notice indicates that other data is also collected for analysis, which is anonymised so that it cannot be linked back to individual accounts. Ring offers a range of security cameras for use inside and outside the home ""Data access requests only ever show us the tip of the iceberg of the amount of data that companies collect about us,"" commented Ms Kaltheuner. ""There's huge value - and power - in collecting non-personal data for all sorts of purposes: market research, training and AI. ""Even anonymous data can have privacy implications, for instance about the collective privacy of, say, a housing block, a group of people, or a household unit."" No video files were included in the DSAR response. Ring justified the omission on the basis that its app already makes it possible to download the clips for up to 30 days if the user had a paid subscription. After that time, the company said each recording was permanently deleted. It added that if a user did not subscribe to a plan then Ring did not keep any recordings. Amazon's retail operation and its Ring subsidiary operate under different data controllers. The BBC asked if the two might ever make their records available to each other to make it possible to make joint use of the information - for example, using Ring's data to see when a family was typically at home in order to help schedule package deliveries.

"This video can not be played What unites these two bitter rivals? Joe Biden has won nine of the 14 states that voted to pick a Democratic White House candidate on Super Tuesday, a remarkable rebound for his campaign. The former US vice-president overturned predictions to narrowly take the key state of Texas from his main challenger, Bernie Sanders. However, Mr Sanders is projected to win California - the biggest prize of the night - as well as three other states. They lead the race to face Republican President Donald Trump in November. Super Tuesday: The winners and losers How the big night unfolded Super Tuesday results in full Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg spent more than $500m (Â£390m) of his own money on his campaign, but did not win a single state. And Senator Elizabeth Warren, once the frontrunner in the race, suffered a humiliating defeat to Mr Biden in her home state of Massachusetts. Super Tuesday awards more than 1,300 of the 1,991 delegates needed to clinch the Democratic White House nomination in July. As things stand, Mr Biden has 402 delegates and Mr Sanders 314. However, results from California, which has 415 delegates, could affect the current standing. Only last month, Mr Biden's campaign was all but written off by some observers after he finished a poor fourth in the Iowa caucuses and fifth in the New Hampshire primary. But on Tuesday, Mr Biden won Texas - the second biggest state with 228 delegates - along with Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia. Maine, which has 24 delegates, is also yet to declare but partial results put Mr Biden slightly ahead of Mr Sanders. Virginia and North Carolina are crucial because they are key swing states in the 2020 election. What are primaries and how do they work? Exit polls across the board suggested Mr Biden - who was vice-president to Barack Obama - attracted large majorities of African-American voters, a crucial bloc for the Democratic party. Mr Biden, 77, also appears to have won among the type of suburban voters who pollsters say have been turning away from the current US president. ""We are very much alive,"" Mr Biden told a crowd in Los Angeles. ""Make no mistake about it, this campaign will send Donald Trump packing."" If Mr Sanders, 78, does win California, as the Associated Press news agency projects, he will pick up the lion's share of the whopping 415 delegates that the Golden State sends to the party convention. US election 2020 : All you need to know The left-wing senator also won his home state of Vermont, along with Colorado and Utah. Mr Sanders had been heavily favoured to win Texas, but it was finally claimed by Mr Biden. In a victory speech, Mr Sanders lambasted Mr Trump, but also took a shot at Mr Biden. ""We're taking on the political establishment,"" he said. ""You cannot beat Trump with the same-old, same-old kind of politics."" The next primaries take place on 10 March in Michigan, Washington state, Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri and North Dakota, with 352 delegates available. Joe Biden came into Super Tuesday hoping his momentum from a surprisingly big South Carolina win would translate into a strong showing in some of the Super Tuesday states and allow him to keep within sight of Bernie Sanders in the delegate count. By that metric, his evening succeeded beyond his best expectations. His support among black voters, which was on display in South Carolina, was replicated across the South and helped offset Bernie Sanders' strength with Hispanic voters in Texas. The endorsements mattered too - in Dallas on Monday, he had the support of Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke, and he ended up greatly over-performing his polls in that state and winning Klobuchar's Minnesota. But now the hard work begins. He is in for a state-by-state slog against Mr Sanders that could stretch all the way to the Democratic National Convention in July. He'll have to fundraise and organise rapidly to make up for the Vermont senator's advantages. Meanwhile, Republicans are going to start training their fire on him - again. If he ends up winning the nomination, after being left for dead just a few weeks ago, he will have earned it. Ms Warren, 70, lost to Mr Biden in Massachusetts despite the fact that he did not campaign in the state or spent money advertising there. Mr Bloomberg, 78, could only pick up a consolation win in the tiny US territory of American Samoa. He did, however, garner enough votes in California and Texas to pick up delegates, according to incomplete results. Mr Bloomberg was appearing on a presidential ballot for the first time after skipping all four contests last month. This video can not be played Bloomberg loses badly then rolls out Trump jokes But after his poor showing, he announced on Wednesday he was ending his campaign and would support Mr Biden.

ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL:Watch Biden on 'No Malarkey' tour WHERE HE STANDS:Against other Democrats like Obama HIS RIVALS:All the Democrats and their key issues The Democratic Party is at a crossroads as its voters decide which candidate has the best chance of denying Mr Trump a second term in office this autumn. Once a crowded field of more than two dozen, celebrated for its women and candidates of colour, the Democratic contest now increasingly looks like a two-man race between two white male septuagenarians. Mr Biden, a moderate, and Mr Sanders, a liberal firebrand, offer starkly different visions for America's future. The former vice-president presents himself as an electable pragmatist who will bring incremental change and restore ""decency"" after the Trump presidency. Match the A-lister to their favoured 2020 Democrat Eighteen things Bernie Sanders believes But critics say his campaign is uninspiring, and that he brings too much political baggage from his lifelong career as a Washington insider. Mr Sanders' detractors say a self-described democratic socialist cannot win over the swing voters needed to capture the White House. He is planning to transform the American economy with a multi-trillion dollar, higher taxation blueprint covering everything from healthcare to education.

"Workers will get statutory sick pay from the first day off work, not the fourth, to help contain coronavirus, the prime minister has said. Boris Johnson said people who self-isolate are helping to protect others from the virus and should not be ""penalised for doing the right thing"". It means those receiving statutory sick pay would get an extra Â£40. The number of confirmed cases increased by 34on Wednesday to a total of 85 - up from 51 on Tuesday. England's chief medical officer earlier said it was ""likely"" the virus will become an epidemic in the UK. Prof Chris Whitty also told BBC Breakfast that up to 80% of the population could be infected with coronavirus, which causes Covid-19, ""in the worst-case scenario"". Officials believeup to a fifth of the workforce may be off sickduring the peak of an epidemic in the UK. HOW IS THE UK PLANNING FOR AN OUTBREAK:How prepared are we? WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?A simple guide HOW TO SELF-ISOLATE:What you need to know WHERE ARE WE WITH A VACCINE?Progress so far A VISUAL GUIDE TO THE OUTBREAK:Virus maps and charts In order to receive statutory sick pay (SSP) people must be earning at least Â£118 a week. The change, which is being introduced in emergency legislation, is expected to mean an extra Â£40 for people receiving SSP - which is set at Â£94.25 a week and paid by employers. But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said two million workers do not earn enough to qualify. Prospect union added that freelancers and self-employed people would continue to face ""the dilemma of no pay or going to work when it may be putting their colleagues at risk"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn asked Mr Johnson if the sick pay announcement would help those currently not eligible for statutory sick pay - such as those on zero hours contracts, or self-employed people. The prime minister said ""a great many"" people would be entitled to SSP, adding: ""Others will be entitled to help through existing systems such as universal credit and we are urgently looking at the application process to reflect on the advice on self-isolation."" This is a significant announcement by the prime minister, but it is far from the end of the debate over sick pay. Clearly, the aim of paying statutory sick pay from day one is to ensure people with coronavirus do not feel financial pressure to come into work and risk spreading the disease. It is understood this change will only be temporary during the period of the outbreak, but may effectively apply to all illnesses. Unions will argue this should be the case for any illness, at any time - not just when coronavirus is raging. They will also continue a campaign saying those on very low pay, particularly women, should be eligible. There is lobbying too for millions of freelancers and the self-employed, many of whom do not get sick pay. Employers in the private sector, who will now face a bigger sick pay bill, will no doubt be pressing for financial support from the government. More detail is needed over how this particular concession will work in the short-term, but in the long-term it may provide encouragement to those who say the whole system of sick pay is unfair and should be overhauled. The announcement, which Mr Johnson made duringPrime Minister's Questions, comes after NHS England sent a letter to hospital trusts and other health organisations outlining steps they should take to prepare for a possible surge in the number of patients. This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson: ""Nobody should be penalised for doing the right thing"" They have been asked tocarry out more video consultations from homeand to consider ways to increase the availability of hospital beds and resources.

"Caroline Flack won a British Academy Television Award for Love Island in 2018 A watchdog has decided there is no need to investigate police contact with Caroline Flack before her death. The Independent Office for Police Conduct said there was no indication of a ""causal link"" between the actions of police and the presenter's death. Officers last had contact with the 40-year-old on 13 December when she was in custody following an alleged assault. Separately, an internal review by the CPS has defended its decision to charge Flack and its handling of the case. The ex-Love Island host, who took her own life in February, had been charged with assaulting her boyfriend, despite the fact he did not support the prosecution. Who decides whether someone should go to trial? TV presenter Caroline Flack dies at 40 Social media under scrutiny in wake of Flack death Following Flack's death on 15 February, the Metropolitan Police Servicereferred itself to the police watchdog It is standard practice for a referral to be made when a person who had recent contact with police died, the Met said. But the watchdog decided there was ""no indication of a causal link - directly or indirectly - between the actions or omissions of the police and Caroline Flack's tragic death"". It addedin a statement,external, that officers had arranged for her to see a health professional while she was in custody, and that ""relevant policy and procedure was followed to give her further guidance."" Meanwhilel, the CPS said its review ""found that the case was handled appropriately and in line with [our] published legal guidance"". ""Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Caroline Flack,"" a spokesperson said. The CPS review followed a Freedom of Information request fromthe Daily Mirror,externaland criticism from some that it had pursued a ""show trial"" against the star. The organisation said it was ""normal practice for prosecutors to hold a debriefing in complex or sensitive cases after they have ended"". Ms Flack pleaded not guilty to an assault charge at a court appearance on 23 December 2019, when it was heard her boyfriend Lewis Burton did not support the prosecution. She was released on bail but was ordered to stop any contact with Burton ahead of the trial, which would have begun on Wednesday. The TV presenter was found dead at her London flat last month - a day after she learned that the CPS were pursuing the charges against her. She had left her role presenting Love Island after being charged with assaulting Burton. Inan unpublished Instagram postshared by her family, Ms Flack said her ""whole world and future was swept from under my feet"" following her arrest - which saw the presenter become the focus of media scrutiny. At the time of her death, Ms Flack's management company said the star had been ""under huge pressure"" and criticised the CPS for refusing to drop charges, even though Burton said he did not want the case to go ahead. In a statement released the day after her death, the CPS said: ""We do not decide whether a person is guilty of a criminal offence - that is for the jury, judge or magistrate - but we must make the key decision of whether a case should be put before a court."" Earlier this week,a petition signed by more than 850,000 people was handed in to the government, calling for curbs on the British media. It calls for the establishment of a new law, dubbed Caroline's Law, which would make media bullying and harassment a criminal offence. ""Politicians need to urgently step in and make sure there are consequences when the media bully and harass,"" said Holly Maltby, of campaigning group 38 Degrees.

"The study takes a look at school achievement in terms of transport connections There is a striking overlap between places in England with slow public transport and places with struggling secondary schools, say researchers. Instead of only looking at education data, researchers compared schools using journey times from the Department for Transport. They found clusters of bad transport and underachieving schools in places such as Norfolk and north-east England. Even in richer areas, poor transport seemed linked to lower school results. The long wait for progress - bad transport seems to overlap with lower secondary school results In reports on academic underachievement the same coldspots repeatedly recur - such as the ""left behind"" towns in the north west and north east, declining seaside towns in the south, or along the Norfolk coast. The study from education analysts, SchoolDash, has examined this pattern not in terms of exam results or Ofsted grades, but from the perspective of transport connections. Above a map showing clusters of struggling schools and, below, clusters of deprivation and slow transport. This is not how long it takes pupils to get to school - but how well their local communities are served by buses and trains. This found thatbadly connected places were more likely to have low-achieving secondary schools,external. Trains for brains - faster connections seemed to mean better school results Even in places without much deprivation, researcher Timo Hannay said ""more isolated schools are substantially more likely to under-perform and less likely to be judged outstanding"". Across secondary schools, 31% of those with fast public transport links are graded as outstanding. Among secondary schools in places with slow travel times, 17% are outstanding. Where poor public transport is combined with high levels of deprivation, there is a ""double whammy"", say researchers. Among all secondary schools, 24% are rated inadequate or requires improvement. But in schools in deprived areas with longer travel times, there are 66% of schools in these bottom Ofsted categories. The measurements used are journey-time statistics from the Department for Transport, which show how long it takes by public transport to reach a major centre for employment. London has high levels of connectivity in transport - and the best school results in the country The average travel time is 33 minutes - and the researcher's analysis shows how school results seem to worsen as journey times stretch beyond this. The slow connections are not just the end-of-the line towns on the coast, it can affect the edges of big cities, such as Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol and Newcastle, and pockets of Kent and the south west. Seaside towns can face a ""double whammy"" of poor transport and underachieving schools There are places where deprivation and slow transport overlap, such as: Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft in East Anglia Clacton-on-Sea in Essex Margate and the Isle of Sheppey in Kent Fleetwood and Accrington in Lancashire Rochdale in Greater Manchester Runcorn in Cheshire, Redcar in North Yorkshire South Shields and Jarrow in Tyne and Wear Skegness and Grimsby in Lincolnshire Bridlington in East Yorkshire Hastings in East Sussex In contrast, London has high levels of connectivity in transport - and despite deep pockets of deprivation, some of the best school results in the country. There is a political dimension to this too. Boris Johnson's government has promised to invest in transport as a form of economic regeneration, particularly in the north of England. Places with bad transport suffer from a lack of physical as well as social mobility In the geography of the last general election, this study from SchoolDash shows the places with poor transport and under-performing schools were the seats where voters swung to the Conservatives. These are areas where social mobility is held up by a lack of physical mobility. University choices decided by cost of train fares Poor pupils in London get more university places than rich outside capital School grades linked to where you live Why are coastal schools at such a low ebb? But why should transport have any link to schools? How could trains mean brains? Or is this just a pattern of multiple, overlapping forms of neglect, without any causal connections? And is funding of transport part of a bigger picture including inequalities in funding of schools? Anna Vignoles, a professor in education at Cambridge University, highlights a double impact - with pupils from communities with low horizons and schools where the cut-off location makes it hard to recruit teachers. ""Staffing is key,"" she says. The quality of public transport links makes a big difference for access to local jobs markets A school needs to be in commuting distance to attract teachers, she says - and the location has to be practical for their partners to get to work too. Prof Vignoles says in a highly-connected city, pupils are ""surrounded by clear evidence of good jobs and the value of education"". ""By contrast in peripheral and rural locations with little connection to industries and good jobs, it may be harder to see the benefit of education."" Dame Rachel de Souza, chief executive of the Inspiration Trust with schools in Norfolk and Suffolk, says: ""Poor transport infrastructure obviously limits the extent to which people are physically mobile, but it can also in some cases be an indicator of poverty of aspirations. ""And of course, added into the mix are the challenges around attracting and retaining staff. ""Coastal areas have their own unique set of challenges, but these need not determine a young person's future,"" she says. There has been a growing awareness of regional differences in school results Simon Burgess, a professor in the economics of education from the University of Bristol, says there is never going to be any ""one-cause"" explanation for the pattern of schools doing well or badly. But he says poor local transport can mean there is in effect ""zero competition"" between schools, with parents unable to choose an alternative. Timo Hannnay, founder of SchoolDash, says the research supports an ""intuitive"" sense about places that are ""cut off and disadvantaged"". But he says there are more unexpected findings. It affects secondary but not particularly primary schools, which he thinks reflects the difficulty in recruiting specialist teachers. He was also surprised to see how soon the isolation factor is felt, including in the outskirts of big cities. ""You don't have to be very far away for it to make a difference"".

"The Ring doorbells use both cameras and motion sensors to detect when someone approaches Amazon keeps records of every motion detected by its Ring doorbells, as well as the exact time they are logged down to the millisecond. The details were revealed via a data request submitted by the BBC. It also disclosed that every interaction with Ring's app is also stored, including the model of phone or tablet and mobile network used. One expert said it gave Amazon the potential for even broader insight into its customers' lives. ""What's most interesting is not just the data itself, but all the patterns and insights that can be learned from it,"" commented independent privacy expert Frederike Kaltheuner. ""Knowing when someone rings your door, how often, and for how long, can indicate when someone is at home. ""If nobody ever rang your door, that would probably say something about your social life as well."" She added that it remained unclear how much further ""anonymised"" data was also being collected. ""This isn't just about privacy, but about the power and monetary value that is attached to this data."" Amazon says it uses the information to evaluate, manage and improve its products and services.

These included: a motion being detected by the cameras' sensors a ""ding"" of the doorbell, when its button had been pressed by a visitor a remote ""on-demand"" action by the user to get a live video and audio feed and/or remotely speak to a visitor A sample of the ""event"" database, which has been edited to obscure the device IDs In each case, the length of time the equipment was activated was also logged. Ring says its camerasuse face and body-shape analysis to help differentiate between humans and other living things,externalin order to minimise false alarms. However, there was no indication of different types of motion being detected in the shared data. The largest database provided documented every interaction with Ring's apps. It listed 4,906 actions over the 129-day period. These included: every time the app was opened whenever the user ""zoomed in"" via a finger-pinch to view the footage more clearly a variety of different-classed screen taps details of the start and end to each live-view In each case, the model of device used, the version of its operating system, the type of mobile data-connection involved and network supplier were all listed. Ring's app allows you to review past footage as well as see a live-view from the camera Among other records were the details of the latitude and longitude co-ordinates of the two devices, provided to 13 decimal places. In theory, this would pinpoint where the products had been installed to the nearest 0.00001mm. Amazon: How Bezos built his data machine Amazon Ring workers fired for accessing user video Ring doorbell makes two-factor verification mandatory When checked via an online tool, the readings corresponded to the right property. However, since the same co-ordinates were given for both devices - which were based in different parts of the building - it appears that Amazon does not know the products' locations to this degree of precision. In total, 11 databases were shared containing close to 26,500 individual fields. Ring's privacy notice indicates that other data is also collected for analysis, which is anonymised so that it cannot be linked back to individual accounts. Ring offers a range of security cameras for use inside and outside the home ""Data access requests only ever show us the tip of the iceberg of the amount of data that companies collect about us,"" commented Ms Kaltheuner. ""There's huge value - and power - in collecting non-personal data for all sorts of purposes: market research, training and AI. ""Even anonymous data can have privacy implications, for instance about the collective privacy of, say, a housing block, a group of people, or a household unit."" No video files were included in the DSAR response. Ring justified the omission on the basis that its app already makes it possible to download the clips for up to 30 days if the user had a paid subscription. After that time, the company said each recording was permanently deleted. It added that if a user did not subscribe to a plan then Ring did not keep any recordings. Amazon's retail operation and its Ring subsidiary operate under different data controllers. The BBC asked if the two might ever make their records available to each other to make it possible to make joint use of the information - for example, using Ring's data to see when a family was typically at home in order to help schedule package deliveries. However, the firm declined to respond.

"Taliban fighters were celebrating the US deal earlier this week The US military has conducted an air strike against Taliban fighters in Afghanistan, just hours after President Donald Trump said he had had a ""very good talk"" with a leader of the group. The US signed a deal with the Taliban on Saturday aimed at bringing peace to Afghanistan after years of war. But a US forces spokesman said it launched an air strike on Wednesday in response to Taliban fighters attacking Afghan forces in Helmand province. The Taliban called for de-escalation. In a post on Twitter, spokesman Suhail Shaheen said the group ""plans to implement all parts of the agreement one after another to prevent conflict escalation"". ""The opposite side should also remove the obstacles in implementing all parts of the agreement so the way is paved for comprehensive peace and for the Afghans to have their basic rights,"" he added. It was not clear if there were any casualties. Wednesday's strike was the first by the US against the Taliban in 11 days, when a reduction in violence agreement began between the two sides in the lead-up to Saturday's pact. In a statement on Twitter, Colonel Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for the US forces in Afghanistan, said it was a ""defensive strike"" to disrupt an attack on an Afghan National Security Forces checkpoint. The Afghan war: The short and long story What will Taliban do after signing US deal? Who are the Taliban? Afghanistan: the long road to peace The spokesman added that the US was still ""committed to peace"" but had a responsibility to defend its Afghan partners. He said Afghans and the US had complied with their side of the agreement, while the Taliban appeared intent on ""squandering"" the opportunity. This video can not be played Is peace with the Taliban possible? On Tuesday alone, he said, the Taliban had launched 43 attacks on checkpoints belonging to Afghan forces in Helmand. ""We call on the Taliban to stop needless attacks and uphold their commitments. As we have demonstrated, we will defend our partners when required,"" he wrote. The Taliban has so far declined to confirm or deny responsibility for any of the attacks. Secunder Kermani, Pakistan/Afghanistan correspondent US and Afghan officials had both said they expected the partial truce or ""reduction in violence"" that led up to the agreement in Doha would continue afterwards. But the text of the agreement makes no mention of this. That ambiguity seems partly responsible for the confusing situation developing on the ground. The current spate of attacks by the Taliban could be seen as an attempt by the insurgents to pressurise the Afghan government into releasing thousands of their prisoners. They're demanding that before beginning ""intra-Afghan"" talks with the government and other Afghan political leaders. But so far President Ashraf Ghani has refused to agree to this. However, it's also possible that the Taliban plan to continue fighting throughout the ""intra-Afghan talks"" in order to improve their negotiating position, and to keep their fighters mobilised. On Saturday the US and the Taliban signed an ""agreement for bringing peace"" to Afghanistan after more than 18 years of conflict. The US and its Nato allies agreed to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants upheld the deal. This video can not be played The United States and the Taliban mark the signing of their agreement in Doha But violence surged in Afghanistan just days after the agreement was signed, with the Taliban ending a partial truce and resuming fighting with Afghan government troops. Central to the obstacles facing the deal is the disagreement over prisoner swaps. Under the accord, some 5,000 Taliban prisoners and 1,000 Afghan security force prisoners are meant to be exchanged by 10 March, when talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government are due to start. But Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani said on Sunday that his government had agreed to no such release. And on Monday the militants said talks would not take place if their prisoners were not released first. Although the US-Taliban deal provides for the prisoner swap, a separate US-Afghan declaration commits the government in Kabul only to participating in talks on the ""feasibility"" of such a release. Following reports of numerous Taliban attacks on Tuesday, Mr Trump shared a phone call with a leader of the group, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, about keeping peace efforts on track. The US president said it was a ""very good talk"", while the Taliban said Mr Trump had pledged to ask his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to talk with Mr Ghani to make sure negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban went ahead as planned. This video can not be played Donald Trump hails ""very good talk"" with Taliban leader The Taliban have previously refused to negotiate with the Afghan government, so Saturday's deal was just with the US. The US attacked Afghanistan in October 2001 to oust the Taliban, whom they said were harbouring Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 9/11 attacks. The Taliban were removed from power but became an insurgent force that by 2018 was active in more than two-thirds of the country.

"Det Supt Emma Kirby said she wants to identify the men in the CCTV pictures Images of three suspects have been released after a racist attack on a student who was told ""we don't want your coronavirus in our country"". Jonathan Mok, 23, said he was walking down Oxford Street on 24 February when a group of four men began shouting. Mr Mok, from Singapore, said the group beat him up when he confronted them. Det Sgt Emma Kirby said the attack was being treated as racially aggravated and the Met was ""committed to finding the perpetrators"". University College London student Mr Mok said he was attacked at about 21:15 GMT close to Tottenham Court Road. Images of his bruised eye posted on Facebook have been shared thousands of times. Jonathan Mok posted a selfie and another photo of his injuries on Facebook Describing the attack, Mr Mok said the man who kicked him ""was really angry"". ""He shouted: 'I don't want your coronavirus in my country',"" Mr Mok told the BBC. The 23-year-old said one of the men threw a punch, causing his nose to bleed badly. ""I just could not understand why someone would target another person simply because of their skin colour - it simply does not make sense to me,"" he said. ""I had an X-ray scan and the doctor told me there was a broken bone around the right side of my face and that I will need to see a specialist. ""It is possible I will need an operation."" Police said the attack happened on Oxford Street near to Tottenham Court Road Tube station Mr Mok said he felt the coronavirus outbreak has been used by some as an excuse to ""further hatred for people different from them"". ""I just think it's a pity to have such experiences taint the image of this beautiful city [that has] so many nice people. ""When people see Asian [people] wearing face masks they automatically assume that they are ill and I've heard of incidents of people getting shouted at on the Tube for wearing face masks. ""I've really been blind to subtle racism issues, so coming out here and experiencing it shows there is a serious problem and we need to do something about it."" Det Sgt Kirby added: ""There's no room on our streets for this kind of violent behaviour and we are committed to finding the perpetrators.""

"The coronavirus pandemic has reached almost every country in the world. Its spread has left national economies and businesses counting the costs, as governments struggle with new lockdown measures to tackle the spread of the virus. Despite the development of new vaccines, many are still wondering what recovery could look like. Here is a selection of charts and maps to help you understand the economic impact of the virus so far. Big shifts in stock markets, where shares in companies are bought and sold, can affect the value of pensions or individual savings accounts (Isas). The FTSE, Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nikkei all saw huge falls as the number of Covid-19 cases grew in the first months of the crisis. The major Asian and US stock markets have recovered following the announcement of the first vaccine in November, but the FTSE is still in negative territory. The FTSE dropped 14.3% in 2020, its worst performance since 2008. In response, central banks in many countries, including the UK, have slashed interest rates. That should, in theory, make borrowing cheaper and encourage spending to boost the economy. Some markets recovered ground in January this year, but this is a normal tendency known as the ""January effect"". Analysts are worried that the possibility of further lockdowns and delays in vaccination programmes might trigger more market volatility this year. Many people have lost their jobs or seen their incomes cut. Unemployment rates have increased across major economies. In the United States, the proportion of people out of work hit a yearly total of 8.9%, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), signalling an end to a decade of jobs expansion. Millions of workers have also been put on government-supported job retention schemes as parts of the economy, such as tourism and hospitality, have come to a near standstill. The numbers of new job opportunities is still very low in many countries. Job vacancies in Australia have returned to the same level of 2019, but they are lagging in France, Spain, the UK and several other countries. Some experts have warned it could be years before levels of employment return to those seen before the pandemic. If the economy is growing, that generally means more wealth and more new jobs. It's measured by looking at the percentage change in gross domestic product, or the value of goods and services produced, typically over three months or a year. The IMF estimates that the global economy shrunk by 4.4% in 2020. The organisation described the decline as the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The only major economy to grow in 2020 was China.It registered a growth of 2.3%. The IMF is, however, predicting global growth of 5.2% in 2021. That will be driven primarily by countries such as India and China, forecast to grow by 8.8% and 8.2% respectively. Recovery in big, services-reliant, economies that have been hit hard by the outbreak, such as the UK or Italy, is expected to be slow. The travel industry has been badly damaged, with airlines cutting flights and customers cancelling business trips and holidays. New variants of the virus - discovered only in recent months - have forced many countries to introduce tighter travel restrictions. Data from the flight tracking service Flight Radar 24 shows that the number of flights globally took a huge hit in 2020 and it is still a long way from recovery. The hospitality sector has been hit hard, with millions of jobs and many companies bankrupt. Data from Transparent,external- an industry-leading intelligence company that covers over 35 million hotel and rental listings worldwide - has registered a fall in reservations in all the top travel destinations. Billions of dollars have been lost in 2020 and although the forecast for 2021 is better, many analysts believe that international travel and tourism won't return to the normal pre-pandemic levels until around 2025. Retail footfall has seen unprecedented falls as shoppers stayed at home. New variants and surges in cases have made problems worse. Pedestrian numbers have fallen further from the first lockdown, according to research firm ShopperTrak, Separate research suggests that consumers are still feeling anxious about their return to stores.Accountancy giant EY,externalsays 67% customers are now not willing to travel more than 5 kilometres for shopping. This change in shopping behaviour has significantly boosted online retail, with a global revenue of $3.9 trillion in 2020. Governments around the world have pledged billions of dollars for a Covid-19 vaccine and treatment options. Shares in some pharmaceutical companies involved in vaccine development have shot up. Moderna, Novavax and AstraZeneca have seen significant rises. But Pfizer has seen its share price fall. The partnership with BioNTech, the high cost of production and management of the vaccine, and the growing number of same-size competitors have reduced the investors' trust in the company to have bigger revenue in 2021. A number of pharmaceutical firms have started already distributing doses and many countries have started their vaccination programmes. Many more - such as Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi/GSK - will join the vaccine distribution during 2021.

"The newly identified Omicron variant of Covid has led to more disruption for international travellers. Quarantine is being reintroduced for people arriving from some African countries, flights have been cancelled and PCR tests will be mandatory within 48 hours of arrival to the UK from 30 November. If the government announces that travel to a particular country is not advised, then airlines and travel companies are likely to cancel any pre-booked flights or holidays there. For example, that is already the case for some flights to and from South Africa as a result of risks associated with the Omicron variant. What are the UK's new travel rules? If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund and you can choose to receive that refund in cash rather than as a voucher. An airline should refund the money within seven days, although some people have waited longer. A package holiday should be refunded, in full, within 14 days. This is far less clear-cut. If you cancel, rather than your travel provider, then you have no automatic right to a refund. In this situation, it is worth contacting the airline/holiday provider to see what options you have. EasyJet, for example, has announced that it will extend its ""freedom to change"" service - which allows passengers to change flights up to two hours before departure for free  - until 31 March, 2022. Some may charge a fee to transfer to another date or destination, but some may allow it without charging a fee. You would have to pay the difference if the alternative flight is more expensive. They may give you a voucher, or they may allow you to cancel and get a refund. That may be trickier, according to Rory Boland, travel editor at Which? who said that the property's specific policy will determine whether refunds would be given. ""If your trip is several weeks or months away, travellers should at this stage do nothing as the situation may change,"" he said. ""Those booking a trip should do so through holiday providers with good, flexible booking policies in case it cannot go ahead."" People who have booked a package holiday will be refunded in full, including accommodation, if it is cancelled by the operator. Operators do not have to refund you if you are unexpectedly forced to self-isolate. It is best to study their policies before booking, or see whether they can offer some support if you have already booked and want to cancel. Travel insurers are offering different levels of cover. In part, this depends on how much you pay for a policy. The majority, but not all, will pay out if you test positive for Covid and have to cancel before you travel. Importantly, if the Foreign Office advises against travel to a country - as it is for some in southern Africa at the moment, then all but a handful of travel insurance policies would be invalid if you still decide to go. Rules are inevitably going to be complex, given the risk of Covid varies so much between countries. The government haspublished a charter,externalthat ""clearly sets out consumer rights and responsibilities when booking travel while Covid-19 measures remain in place"". It says it expects travel operators to be ""flexible"" with customers, given the circumstances, and theCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) has warned package holiday firmsthey must stick to refund rules. â¨ How are travel rules being relaxed?

"The study takes a look at school achievement in terms of transport connections There is a striking overlap between places in England with slow public transport and places with struggling secondary schools, say researchers. Instead of only looking at education data, researchers compared schools using journey times from the Department for Transport. They found clusters of bad transport and underachieving schools in places such as Norfolk and north-east England. Even in richer areas, poor transport seemed linked to lower school results. The long wait for progress - bad transport seems to overlap with lower secondary school results In reports on academic underachievement the same coldspots repeatedly recur - such as the ""left behind"" towns in the north west and north east, declining seaside towns in the south, or along the Norfolk coast. The study from education analysts, SchoolDash, has examined this pattern not in terms of exam results or Ofsted grades, but from the perspective of transport connections. Above a map showing clusters of struggling schools and, below, clusters of deprivation and slow transport. This is not how long it takes pupils to get to school - but how well their local communities are served by buses and trains. This found thatbadly connected places were more likely to have low-achieving secondary schools,external. Trains for brains - faster connections seemed to mean better school results Even in places without much deprivation, researcher Timo Hannay said ""more isolated schools are substantially more likely to under-perform and less likely to be judged outstanding"". Across secondary schools, 31% of those with fast public transport links are graded as outstanding. Among secondary schools in places with slow travel times, 17% are outstanding. Where poor public transport is combined with high levels of deprivation, there is a ""double whammy"", say researchers. Among all secondary schools, 24% are rated inadequate or requires improvement. But in schools in deprived areas with longer travel times, there are 66% of schools in these bottom Ofsted categories. The measurements used are journey-time statistics from the Department for Transport, which show how long it takes by public transport to reach a major centre for employment. London has high levels of connectivity in transport - and the best school results in the country The average travel time is 33 minutes - and the researcher's analysis shows how school results seem to worsen as journey times stretch beyond this. The slow connections are not just the end-of-the line towns on the coast, it can affect the edges of big cities, such as Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol and Newcastle, and pockets of Kent and the south west. Seaside towns can face a ""double whammy"" of poor transport and underachieving schools There are places where deprivation and slow transport overlap, such as: Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft in East Anglia Clacton-on-Sea in Essex Margate and the Isle of Sheppey in Kent Fleetwood and Accrington in Lancashire Rochdale in Greater Manchester Runcorn in Cheshire, Redcar in North Yorkshire South Shields and Jarrow in Tyne and Wear Skegness and Grimsby in Lincolnshire Bridlington in East Yorkshire Hastings in East Sussex In contrast, London has high levels of connectivity in transport - and despite deep pockets of deprivation, some of the best school results in the country. There is a political dimension to this too. Boris Johnson's government has promised to invest in transport as a form of economic regeneration, particularly in the north of England. Places with bad transport suffer from a lack of physical as well as social mobility In the geography of the last general election, this study from SchoolDash shows the places with poor transport and under-performing schools were the seats where voters swung to the Conservatives. These are areas where social mobility is held up by a lack of physical mobility. University choices decided by cost of train fares Poor pupils in London get more university places than rich outside capital School grades linked to where you live Why are coastal schools at such a low ebb? But why should transport have any link to schools? How could trains mean brains? Or is this just a pattern of multiple, overlapping forms of neglect, without any causal connections? And is funding of transport part of a bigger picture including inequalities in funding of schools? Anna Vignoles, a professor in education at Cambridge University, highlights a double impact - with pupils from communities with low horizons and schools where the cut-off location makes it hard to recruit teachers. ""Staffing is key,"" she says. The quality of public transport links makes a big difference for access to local jobs markets A school needs to be in commuting distance to attract teachers, she says - and the location has to be practical for their partners to get to work too. Prof Vignoles says in a highly-connected city, pupils are ""surrounded by clear evidence of good jobs and the value of education"". ""By contrast in peripheral and rural locations with little connection to industries and good jobs, it may be harder to see the benefit of education."" Dame Rachel de Souza, chief executive of the Inspiration Trust with schools in Norfolk and Suffolk, says: ""Poor transport infrastructure obviously limits the extent to which people are physically mobile, but it can also in some cases be an indicator of poverty of aspirations. ""And of course, added into the mix are the challenges around attracting and retaining staff. ""Coastal areas have their own unique set of challenges, but these need not determine a young person's future,"" she says. There has been a growing awareness of regional differences in school results Simon Burgess, a professor in the economics of education from the University of Bristol, says there is never going to be any ""one-cause"" explanation for the pattern of schools doing well or badly. But he says poor local transport can mean there is in effect ""zero competition"" between schools, with parents unable to choose an alternative. Timo Hannnay, founder of SchoolDash, says the research supports an ""intuitive"" sense about places that are ""cut off and disadvantaged"". But he says there are more unexpected findings. It affects secondary but not particularly primary schools, which he thinks reflects the difficulty in recruiting specialist teachers. He was also surprised to see how soon the isolation factor is felt, including in the outskirts of big cities. ""You don't have to be very far away for it to make a difference"".

"Millions of workers are receiving a smaller pay packet as the economic realities of coronavirus bite. Struggling companies and self-employed workers have been offered financial help by the government, to help keep their businesses afloat and staff paid during the coronavirus outbreak. But, with millions on reduced wages, who is affected and what happens when workers fall ill? If you work in the private sector, and pay tax through the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system, your employer can put you on furlough - essentially, lay you off temporarily -by applying for a government grant,externalto pay 80% of your gross salary up to a limit of Â£2,500 per month. What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? More than eight million workers have been furloughed since March, at a cost of billions of pounds to the government. Full and part-time employees are eligible, as are those on agency, flexible or zero-hour contracts. The typical full-time worker is paid Â£585 a week,external, about Â£2,340 a month, using a median average - the middle point of all workers. It has been hoped the grants, available through Revenue & Customs (HMRC) by the end of April, will stop big redundancy announcements. The money was backdated to March and the scheme will last until the end of October. New rules will apply over the summer that will see employers sharing some of the burden of these costs. Employers will be able to bring back furloughed employees part-time from July - although they will be expected to share the cost of paying people's salaries. An employer still pays their staff, and can decide whether to pay in full or only the 80% that has been covered. Ria Fortin only started her job as a coordinator with Morepour, a cellar and bar installation and maintenance company, four months ago. Now, she has been furloughed. ""There was an intake of breath when I was paid. It was not as much as I have been used to,"" says the 34-year-old, who has just bought a home with her self-employed partner. ""But it is a relief just to be paid. At least it is something. Other people are in a much worse situation."" Ria Fortin says she feels lucky to still have her job The company she works for is small, so she feels grateful to have been furloughed, rather than laid off, given that the hospitality industry may be one of the last to reopen. The couple have organised payment holidays on regular bills, but know these will eventually have to be paid, so Ria - a former NHS worker - says they are very conscious of budgeting. If you are self-employed and have had a loss of income,you can receive a taxable grantof 80% of your average monthly profits over the past three years - up to a cap of Â£2,500 per month. Initially, this has been available for three months in one lump-sum payment. A ""second and final"" payment, covering another three months and representing 70% of profits up to a cap of Â£2,190 a month will be available from August. You can access theCoronavirus Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS),externalas long as you traded in the past financial year, are still trading now and plan to continue doing so. Most of your income needs to come from self-employment and your average trading profit needs to have been less than Â£50,000 a year. If you became self-employed since April 2019, you will not receive any help under this scheme. This is because you haven't yet have filed a tax return, which is needed to help calculate financial support. HMRC will contact those who are eligible. You will have to try to claim benefits - such asuniversal credit,externaland/or contribution-basedemployment and support allowance (ESA),external. In his Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said claimants could apply for ESA straight away, rather than waiting a week. He also temporarily removed the minimum income floor criteria for self-employed people - which looked at how much people could expect to earn in a month to calculate universal credit levels. Self-employed people not covered by the SEISS can now access universal credit in full, potentially allowing them to receivea payment equivalent to statutory sick pay (SSP). However, this does depend on your household's financial situation. If you are already in receipt of other benefits, these could stop when applying for universal credit, so it may be worth getting some advice. You can now apply on the phone or online, instead of having to attend a job centre. Benefit levels have also been increased temporarily. Rishi Sunak's 2020 budget speech in full,external What is universal credit? You should continue to work and have your wages paid as normal, even if you are home-working or have been told to work at another location temporarily. If you can work from home, you should do so. Working hours can still be clearly defined. Employers still have a duty of care and are responsible for any equipment they give you. The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Servicehas set out guidance.,external If you are an employee, your employermust give you time off,externalin an emergency. But you might not get paid - it depends on the terms of your work contract. However, many bosses during this period are allowing parents to work flexibly, to try to manage both work and childcare. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash If you are an employee, any sick pay you may receive will depend on where you work. Some workers' contracts offer full pay to those off ill - albeit for a limited time. If that time runs out, or if you don't get paid sick leave in the first place,you should receive SSP.,external The money - set at Â£95.85 a week - is paid by employers for up to 28 weeks. So if you are self-employed, you will not be eligible - but if you are a casual or agency worker, you will be. To receive SSP you need to be earning at least Â£120 a week.The ONS estimates,externalthere are 1,766,000 adult jobs in the UK that pay less than that amount - although some people will earn money from several jobs over the course of a week. SSP can now be claimed from a person's first day away from work, rather than the fourth day as before. Anyone claiming should be able to get a sick note from the NHS's 111 service rather than their GP. There have been concerns aboutwhether SSP is sufficient, especially for those who must self-isolate more than once following the introduction of the various test and trace systems.

coronavirus outbreak. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the country's health service
risked being overwhelmed. Most of the more than 3,000 cases are in the north but others have been confirmed in 19 of Italy's 20 regions.  More on the decision to postpone the release of the new James Bond film(see our 17:37 entry). The film - with Daniel Craig's last outing as 007 - had been set to have its premiere in the UK on 31 March 31, before its rollout worldwide in April. But now the studios behind the film wrote on Twitter: ""MGM, Universal and Bond producers, Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, announced today that after careful consideration and thorough evaluation of the global theatrical marketplace, the release of NO TIME TO DIE will be postponed until November 2020.""

In a separate tweet, the studios said the film ""will be released in the U.K. on November 12, 2020 with worldwide release dates to follow, including the US launch on November 25, 2020"". The pause comes after two James Bond fan sites had written to the studios behind the film to ask for its release to be delayed over worries that cinemas could be closed then, Reuters reports. IOC president Thomas Bach says ""cancellation"" and ""postponement"" was not mentioned in regards to Tokyo 2020 at Wednesday's board meeting. A Â£100m government loan to help stabilise the business is now unlikely to happen, the BBC understands. More on the outbreak in Italy. The new death toll was announced at a news briefing,externalby the country's civil protection service chief Angelo Borrelli. Mr Borrelli added that 276 patients had recovered.  The death toll from the coronavirus in Italy has now risen to 107, the authorities say. They say 2,706 people have tested positive in the country - Europe's worst-hit. The country's education minister also confirmed earlier reports that schools and universities throughout the country would be closed until mid-March. Israel is imposing new travel restrictions on five European countries - France, Germany, Spain, Austria and Switzerland - due to fears over the spread of coronavirus. ""We are at the peak of a global epidemic,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said as he announced the move on Wednesday. Mr Netanyahu said non-residents arriving from the five countries listed would have to prove they could self-isolate in order to be granted entry. Israel is also ordering its citizens returning from those countries to self-quarantine in their homes for 14 days. The country's health ministry said the measures would come into effect ""in the coming days"". More on the two new cases in Northern Ireland, which has brought the total number there to three since the testing began. Both of those infected are adults, with one recently returning from northern Italy, officials say. The second person was in contact with someone in the UK who had tested positive for Covid-19. The cases are not connected. The very first case, confirmed on 27 February, was a woman who had returned to Northern Ireland via Dublin from northern Italy. Chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said the two new patients were receiving the appropriate careand officials were working to identify anyone they had come into contact with. The first case, confirmed last week, was a woman who had returned from northern Italy. One is a postgraduate student at Queen's University who had been in northern Italy, the BBC understands. German airline Lufthansa says it is grounding 150 of its 770 aircraft due to ""extraordinary circumstances"" in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters news agency reports. A spokesman for Lufthansa Group - which includes Swiss, Brussels and Austrian Airlines - told AFP news agency that ""25 long-haul aircraft and 125 short- and medium-haul aircraft"" will no longer fly. Lufthansa Group earlier said it planned to reduce the
number of flights by up to 25%, largely to virus-hit areas such as northern Italy. The Vietnamese government has revealed that Vietnam Airlines carried a Japanese
passenger from Siem Reap, Cambodia, to Ho Chi Minh City, who then traveled on to Nagoya, Japan, where he tested positive for coronavirus. This happened on Tuesday. Meanwhile, five fellow passengers who are in Vietnam are now being contacted for self-quarantine. But 50 others had already gone on their way to London, the government said.

The number of infected people in the US state of New York has now risen to six, Governor Andrew
Cuomo has said. He said among them were the family of a Manhattan lawyer who had tested positive for the coronavirus on Tuesday. The lawyer's son is believed to have been studying at New York's Yeshiva University, which has cancelled Wednesday classes as a ""precautionary step"". Speaking at a news conference, Governor Cuomo warned that there were going to be ""many, many people who test positive"". ""By definition, the more you test, the more people you will find
who test positive,"" he said. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned of the growing economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak, predicting a drop in global growth below last year's modest level. ""[Coronavirus] is no longer a regional issue, it is a global problem [that] calls for global response,"" IMF boss Kristalina Georgieva said. She said the epidemic posed a ""serious threat"" to global growth because of its ""sheer geographic spread"", adding that its full impact was difficult to predict.  The coronavirus is believed to have originated in Wuhan, the Chinese city of 11 million people that has now been locked down for weeks. No-one is allowed to leave the city, which is the capital of Hubei province. The city's normally busy main railway station is now virtually deserted. ...and so are the main streets, where an occasional bike rider in a protective suit can be spotted going shopping. But residents have been slowly adjusting to the new reality. Here people are seen resting outside their houses in an area blocked by barriers. Laundry is put to dry above boards blocking an entrance to a residential area in Wuhan Some have made good use of the blocking board to put out their laundry. Twitter has said it ""will halt any attempt by advertisers to opportunistically use the Covid-19 outbreak to target inappropriate ads"". In a statement, the company added:,external""Government entities that want to disseminate public health information will be permitted to promote ads on Covid-19."" Earlier, Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg also said the company was removing false claims and ads for fake cures for the coronavirus. In Tuesday's post, Mr Zuckerberg founder explains that his company has been working closely with health authorities,externalto co-ordinate their response to the virus. But can Facebook stop coronavirus conspiracies? Here'sBBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones' take on the issue.    The Geneva International Motor Show in Switzerland has been cancelled due to the Covid-19 epidemic Swiss government officials say it is ""unlikely"" that the country will be able to avoid recording some deaths linked to the coronavirus outbreak, the BBC's Imogen Foulkes reports. The situation in Switzerland was described by health officials on Wednesday as ""serious, and becoming more so"", our correspondent adds. Total confirmed cases in the country are approaching 100 - most of them young people who can trace their infection to Italy. The government is now putting in place more measures to protect the elderly, who are viewed as most at risk. French cycling teams who said they were being ""held against their will"" and ""treated like plague victims"" in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will be held in quarantine there until 14 March. Cofidis and Groupama-FDJ riders had been taking part in the UAE Tour when it was cancelled in the final stages because of two suspected cases of coronavirus and fears the infection may have spread among participants and staff. On Tuesday, UAE authorities announced six more cases connected to the race. Cofidis and Groupama-FDJ said all their riders and staff have tested negative for coronavirus, but they have been told by the International Cycling Union (UCI) to stay in isolation until Saturday. ""It's a kind of relief,"" said Cofidis president Thierry Vittu. Read the full story here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Taliban fighters were celebrating the US deal earlier this week The US military has conducted an air strike against Taliban fighters in Afghanistan, just hours after President Donald Trump said he had had a ""very good talk"" with a leader of the group. The US signed a deal with the Taliban on Saturday aimed at bringing peace to Afghanistan after years of war. But a US forces spokesman said it launched an air strike on Wednesday in response to Taliban fighters attacking Afghan forces in Helmand province. The Taliban called for de-escalation. In a post on Twitter, spokesman Suhail Shaheen said the group ""plans to implement all parts of the agreement one after another to prevent conflict escalation"". ""The opposite side should also remove the obstacles in implementing all parts of the agreement so the way is paved for comprehensive peace and for the Afghans to have their basic rights,"" he added. It was not clear if there were any casualties. Wednesday's strike was the first by the US against the Taliban in 11 days, when a reduction in violence agreement began between the two sides in the lead-up to Saturday's pact. In a statement on Twitter, Colonel Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for the US forces in Afghanistan, said it was a ""defensive strike"" to disrupt an attack on an Afghan National Security Forces checkpoint. The Afghan war: The short and long story What will Taliban do after signing US deal? Who are the Taliban? Afghanistan: the long road to peace The spokesman added that the US was still ""committed to peace"" but had a responsibility to defend its Afghan partners. He said Afghans and the US had complied with their side of the agreement, while the Taliban appeared intent on ""squandering"" the opportunity. This video can not be played Is peace with the Taliban possible? On Tuesday alone, he said, the Taliban had launched 43 attacks on checkpoints belonging to Afghan forces in Helmand. ""We call on the Taliban to stop needless attacks and uphold their commitments. As we have demonstrated, we will defend our partners when required,"" he wrote. The Taliban has so far declined to confirm or deny responsibility for any of the attacks. Secunder Kermani, Pakistan/Afghanistan correspondent US and Afghan officials had both said they expected the partial truce or ""reduction in violence"" that led up to the agreement in Doha would continue afterwards. But the text of the agreement makes no mention of this. That ambiguity seems partly responsible for the confusing situation developing on the ground. The current spate of attacks by the Taliban could be seen as an attempt by the insurgents to pressurise the Afghan government into releasing thousands of their prisoners. They're demanding that before beginning ""intra-Afghan"" talks with the government and other Afghan political leaders. But so far President Ashraf Ghani has refused to agree to this. However, it's also possible that the Taliban plan to continue fighting throughout the ""intra-Afghan talks"" in order to improve their negotiating position, and to keep their fighters mobilised. On Saturday the US and the Taliban signed an ""agreement for bringing peace"" to Afghanistan after more than 18 years of conflict. The US and its Nato allies agreed to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants upheld the deal. This video can not be played The United States and the Taliban mark the signing of their agreement in Doha But violence surged in Afghanistan just days after the agreement was signed, with the Taliban ending a partial truce and resuming fighting with Afghan government troops. Central to the obstacles facing the deal is the disagreement over prisoner swaps. Under the accord, some 5,000 Taliban prisoners and 1,000 Afghan security force prisoners are meant to be exchanged by 10 March, when talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government are due to start. But Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani said on Sunday that his government had agreed to no such release. And on Monday the militants said talks would not take place if their prisoners were not released first. Although the US-Taliban deal provides for the prisoner swap, a separate US-Afghan declaration commits the government in Kabul only to participating in talks on the ""feasibility"" of such a release. Following reports of numerous Taliban attacks on Tuesday, Mr Trump shared a phone call with a leader of the group, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, about keeping peace efforts on track. The US president said it was a ""very good talk"", while the Taliban said Mr Trump had pledged to ask his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to talk with Mr Ghani to make sure negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban went ahead as planned. This video can not be played Donald Trump hails ""very good talk"" with Taliban leader The Taliban have previously refused to negotiate with the Afghan government, so Saturday's deal was just with the US. The US attacked Afghanistan in October 2001 to oust the Taliban, whom they said were harbouring Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 9/11 attacks. The Taliban were removed from power but became an insurgent force that by 2018 was active in more than two-thirds of the country.

In Nashville, Tennessee's biggest city, the tornadoes caused widespread damage to homes and other buildings. The storm hit after midnight and moved so quickly that many people sleeping didn't have time to take shelter, US media report. President Donald Trump confirmedhe planned to visit the state on Friday.,external The number of missing people decreased from 88 on Tuesday to 22 on Wednesday after search and rescue efforts continued overnight, Putnam county Mayor Mayor Randy Porter said.

The scene in Nashville is ""like a war zone"", one resident told the BBC. One couple in Cookeville told CBS that they tried to shelter in their bathtub. ""We were flying in the air, into the trees back there, where once we hit those trees, the house... it just exploded. The house just disintegrated,"" Seth Wells said. ""I have no clue how we survived, it was like Wizard of Oz."" Much of the damage is centred in Putnam County - 80 miles (130km) east of Nashville - where 18 deaths, including five children, were reported. In Wilson County, three people died, as well as two people in Davidson County and one in Benton. A state of emergency remains in place, and several counties are working to clear debris and fallen trees. Five shelters are open, and about 40,000 people remain without power. Nashville's Emergency Operations Centre said it had opened a shelter with running water in a farmers' market to help displaced residents. Nashville Mayor John Cooper said the city was ""devastated"" and urged people to ""lend a helping hand"" to neighbours. There was also ""significant damage"" to John C Tune Airport, about eight miles from the city centre, the airport said. The National Weather Service reported that winds of 165mph hit Nashville. The storms were the deadliest to hit Tennessee since 2011, according to the Weather Channel. John C Tune Airport in Nashville was damaged when the tornadoes hit early on Tuesday morning Music stars Taylor Swift and Dolly Parton tweeted their support for those affected. ""My heart is with everyone in Tennessee who has been affected by the tornados. Sending you my love and prayers,"" wrote Taylor Swift.

"There are fears the slowdown from the outbreak could tip countries into recession The World Bank has committed $12bn (Â£9.4bn) in aid for developing countries grappling with the spread of the coronavirus. The emergency package includes low-cost loans, grants and technical assistance. The action comes as leaders around the world pledge to shield their countries from the economic impact of the outbreak. It follows warnings that slowdown from the outbreak could tip countries into recession. The aid is intended to help countries improve their public health response to the crisis, as well as work with the private sector to reduce the economic impact. ""What we're trying to do is limit the transmission of the disease,"" World Bank Group President David Malpass told the BBC. Coronavirus outbreak: Follow the latest updates on our live blog The organisation said it would prioritise the poorest and most at-risk countries in distributing the aid to counter the effects of the virus, which has spread to more than 70 countries around the world. Half of the package comes from the bank's International Finance Corporation, which works with the private sector. About $4bn of the $12bn is being shifted from previously available funds. Countries with weak health systems, limited financial resources and close economic links with China are said to be most vulnerable to the coronavirus outbreak.

"Social and cultural reforms in Saudi Arabia have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, campaigners say Dominic Raab is to press the Saudi Arabian government on its human rights record during his first visit to the country as foreign secretary. The Foreign Office said Mr Raab would ""engage"" with Saudi counterparts on the issue and other areas of ""difference"". He will also discuss the ""devastating"" humanitarian situation in Yemen and efforts to end its long-running war. Labour has urged ministers to end all arms sales to Saudi Arabia, a major protagonist in the Yemeni conflict. Last summer, the UK promised to stop approving export licences for arms to Saudi Arabia which could potentially be used in the civil war following a legal challenge by campaigners. The UK and other Western powers are providing logistical support to a Saudi-led multinational coalition which is supporting the Yemeni government in its fight against the Iranian-backed rebel Houthi movement. UK minister apologises for Saudi military sales Yemen crisis: Why is there a war? The five-year conflict, seen as part of a regional power struggle between Shia-ruled Iran and Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia, has devastated the country and, according to the UN, claimed the lives of at least 7,500 civilians. Ahead of his two-day visit to Saudi Arabia, Mr Raab stressed its long-standing economic, security and intelligence ties with the UK but also the need for close co-operation on regional and global challenges. Mr Raab will stress the close ties between the countries but also the need for co-operation on shared challenges The foreign secretary will hold talks with his Saudi counterpart, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, and the government's National Security Adviser Dr Musaad Al Aiyban as well as the Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. Officials said Mr Raab would continue to ""drive progress"" on the Yemen peace process, following the recent surge in Houthi violence and constraints on getting humanitarian aid to those in need. Four-fifths of the Yemeni population - 24 million people - are in need of humanitarian assistance or protection, including ten million who rely on food aid to survive. The Foreign Office said Mr Raab would also raise issues ""where we have differences, including on human rights and values"". Human rights groups have accused Saudi Arabia's ruling royal family of condoning the torture of political opponents as part of a sustained crackdown on dissent in the past couple of years - something the regime has rejected. In November 2018, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch alleged that scores of human rights activists, intellectuals and clerics had been unlawfully detained and several of them, including women, had been either flogged, electrocuted or sexually harassed. Saudi Arabia also continues to face international pressure over the unresolved murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. It has blamed the killing on rogue agents but denied claims that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had knowledge of the operation. However, the CIA reportedly believes Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder. Saudi Arabia 'tortured women activists' The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Mr Raab, who visited Oman and Turkey earlier this week, said Saudi Arabia was one of the UK's ""closest trade partners and plays an important role in keeping Britain safe"". He added: ""As a valued partner, we have to work closely together to tackle the crisis in Yemen, terrorism and climate change as well as pursuing reform and engaging on human rights issues."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has called for the UK to suspend all military aid to Saudi Arabia, amid claims that the Saudi-led coalition has been responsible for the indiscriminate killing of civilians in Yemen. Under UK export policy, military equipment licences should not be granted if there is a ""clear risk"" that weapons might be used in a ""serious violation of international humanitarian law"". The Court of Appeal ruled last summer that existing sales should be reviewed, although not suspended, following a challenge by the Campaign Against the Arms Trade. Ministers subsequently gave assurances that no further export licences would be issued while the government considered the ruling although, in September, International Trade Secretary Liz Truss, was forced to apologise for two breaches of the pledge.

"Results roll in for Super Tuesday, the biggest day yet in the race for the White House Democrats in 14 states chose candidates to run against Trump in November's election Joe Biden wins eight states to become front-runner Early leader Bernie Sanders wins three states, still doing well Contests still close in biggest states California and Texas Mike Bloomberg performs poorly - but could do well in California Max Matza, Roland Hughes, Ritu Prasad, Helier Cheung and Holly Honderich This video can not be played Super Tuesday: Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden trade punches We're wrapping our live coverage of Super Tuesday, now it is Wednesday on the US east coast. It's been a fascinating few hours in the race to decide which Democrat will take on Donald Trump in November's election. Here are the main takeaways:  You can follow the latest with our up-to-date news storyhere, and you can read who the winners and losers werehere- thanks for following. It's almost 01:30 here in Washington, and the picture is starting to become a little clearer. But here are a few things wedon'tknow after Super Tuesday: Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Joe Biden came into Super Tuesday hoping his momentum from a
surprisingly big South Carolina win would translate into success in some of the
state and allow him to keep within sight of Bernie Sanders in the delegate
count. By that metric, his evening succeeded beyond his best expectations. Bidenâs support among black voters, which was on display in South Carolina,
was replicated across the south, in states like North Carolina, Virginia and
Alabama, where he consistently won about 60%. It also helped offset Bernie
Sanders's strength with Hispanic voters in Texas. Tuesday night was a celebration for Biden. Now the hard work begins. He is in for a state-by-state slog against Sanders that could stretch all the way to the Democratic National Convention in July. Heâll have to fundraise furiously and organise rapidly to make up for the Vermont senatorâs advantages. Meanwhile, Republicans are going to start training their fire on him - again. If he ends up winning the nomination, after being left for dead just a few weeks ago, he will have earned it. The state with the most at stake for the candidates is also the one that's most uncertain right now. California has a cool 415 delegates to dole out, but its size also means counting millions of votes could take quite a while - possibly weeks. About 30% of precincts have reported their results, and there are still thousands of mail-in votes to look at. In addition, local media report people are still waiting in long lines to cast their ballots even though polls closed nearly two hours ago. But the Associated Press has already called the state for Sanders. The New York Times has forecasted it's ""pretty likely"" Sanders who will take home the California haul. Bloomberg has also been doing well in California, overtaking Biden for the second-place spot. A reminder: you need 1,991 delegates total to win the Democratic nomination. Winning most delegates here will help, a lot, but it still won't make you the candidate. Here are where things stand right now when it comes to the all-important delegates that candidates have won. (These are assigned according to how well candidates have performed): Some caveats: we don't have the results from the two biggest states Texas (where Joe Biden is building up a lead) or California (where Sanders is leading Bloomberg). This picture could change quite a lot over the coming hours, and Sanders could pull closer to the former vice-president. Michael Bloomberg has said he will be re-evaluating his campaign following tonight's results. His only win was the US territory of American Samoa, but early polls in California and Texas have shown him in second and third place, respectively. Good results in these two states could get him closer to the front-runners. The BBC's North America reporter Anthony Zurcher says the former New York mayor could have an impact on this race depending on what he decides to do with his campaign machine. ""Whether Michael Bloomberg decides to use this machine he's built up and turn it to say, support Joe Biden going forward, or whoever the Democratic nominee is in November, that's an open question,"" he says. ""I think Joe Biden and his supporters have a very real interest in what Michael Bloomberg does from here on out...even if he doesn't have quite the same amount of support he did just a few days ago."" If Bloomberg pours money into states like Michigan and Florida, for example, he could be drawing votes away from Biden. Comedy actor Keegan-Michael Key, who once portrayed former President Obama's ""anger translator"" in a sketch, is once again pretending to be Biden's old boss. Allow Twitter content?

Before Tuesday, it looked like Bernie Sanders would win there fairly comfortably, thanks partly to his support among Latino voters. That hasn't proven to be the case. With 61% of results in, Joe Biden has now edged into the lead. It's still very close though. There are 228 delegates available here - they may end up being shared fairly evenly between Sanders and Biden. The BBC's Katty Kay points out, Biden's many wins could be thanks to issues of tone and civility. ""It's not just this concept of civility, it's actually the words people use about each other,"" she says. ""And Joe Biden, I think, appeals to people who might be looking for that in this country."" Perhaps in particular to women, she adds, who are looking for the political landscape to be ""less aggressive, less combative"". It's no longer Super Tuesday here on the east coast of the US, it's now less-super Wednesday. As we continue to await results from California, Texas and Maine, here are some key takeaways from Tuesday's big vote. 1) A new front-runner? Former vice-president Joe Biden's campaign was drying up until he won South Carolina on Saturday. That momentum has continued, with projected wins in eight states on Super Tuesday so far. 2) Biden's Southern base comes out African-American voters were a big part of Biden's wins in the South. He won the majority of black voters in these states, proving his campaign's claim that he has a strong base among southern Democrats. 3) But Bernie's still in Biden may have taken up his front-runner position once more, but Sanders could still unseat him. Sanders has been winning big among young voters and Latino voters. Latino voters, in particular, are a key demographic in the big-win states of California and Texas that are still up for grabs (it's stillincrediblyclose between Sanders and Biden in Texas). 4) A bad night for Bloomberg and Warren It has been a poor showing for both Michael Bloomberg (who has spent over $400m on his campaign) and Elizabeth Warren - who lost her home state (Massachusetts) and birth state (Oklahoma). In Massachusetts, women opted for Biden over her by a big margin. Katty KayWorld News America presenter One voter and dog line up to vote in Oklahoma City on Tuesday When it comes to Democrats and American politics, Oklahoma
isnât the first state you think of. Solidly Republican, the heartland state
doesnât feature in the Democratic story in presidential elections. But tonight,
true-red Oklahoma is telling an interesting tale about the state of the
Democratic race. In the 2016 Democratic primary race, Senator Bernie Sanders
beat Hillary Clinton to win Oklahoma by 10 percentage points. Four years ago
Sanders was seen as the anti-Clinton vote. He was the person Democrats
rallied around if they didnât want to hand the nomination to the establishment
candidate. Tonight Oklahoma tells a different story. Joe Biden has beaten Bernie Sanders. In 2020, Joe Biden has
become the anti-Sanders vote. For all those Democrats who donât
want a nominee from the left of the party, Biden is the guy. Not only is he the
anti-Sanders candidate, heâs also the anti-Trump candidate. For Democratic
voters for whom beating Trump is the number one goal, Biden, not Sanders looks
like the most viable candidate. As rumours fly that Michael Bloomberg may drop out on Wednesday, let's take a look at what his nearly half billion dollars of personal campaign contributions could have bought. The billionaire ex-New York City mayor is the ninth richest man in the world, and has spent $464m on his campaign so far, according to federal campaign filings. For that money he could have: Democrats aren't the only ones hosting primaries on Super Tuesday - Republicans have had their say too. Technically, the president isn't running uncontested for the Republican nomination. Former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld is also on the ballot, but his candidacy is a long-shot, as a brief scroll through Trump's Twitter feed shows. Without calling each other out by name, both Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden have criticised each other. Watch as they trade political blows - over the Iraq War and general election electability - in their speeches tonight. This video can not be played Super Tuesday: Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden trade punches We're still waiting for projections for three states: massive Texas and California, as well as tiny Maine. And we're still awaiting the full results in almost every state. Remember, the aim for all candidates is to win1,991 delegates, a different amount of which are awarded in each state, and according to how well each candidate has performed. With that target in mind, this is how many delegates each candidate has so far:  We are a long, long way away from this being resolved. Voters line up outside a library in Burbank, California The Bernie Sanders campaign is asking a judge to grant an emergency injunction to keep polling stations open in Los Angeles county due what they describe as long queues of waiting voters. Voters, their suit claims, have waited for up to four hours to vote at ""multiple"" voting locations. California has made strides to make voting as accessible as possible, according to the BBC's Sophie Long in Los Angeles. Some polling stations, which have been open since last week, allow for 24-hour voting. And across the city, public transit has been made free to allow voters to more easily get to their polling station. Biden is projected to win Massachusetts, which has 91 delegates. It's an embarrassing loss for Elizabeth Warren, one of the state's current US senators. Sanders was expected to do well, and he is projected to take second place, leaving Warren in a dismal third on home turf. It's been a bad night for the former mayor of New York. Michael Bloomberg has spent more than half a billion dollars of his own fortune and so far has only a win in American Samoa to show for it. Talking to supporters in Florida, however, he insisted he was still the candidate who could beat Donald Trump. And instead of despair in the face of defeat, he turned to humour (possibly with help from a teleprompter). We'll let you decide if Bloomberg did better with jokes than votes. This video can not be played Watch Bloomberg joke about Trump's golf and brainpower. California is the prize tonight's Democratic presidential hopefuls all want to take home. The state has a massive 415 delegates up for grabs. Sanders currently has an edge in the state - as expected, given his success with Latino voters, who are a key California voter demographic. Early polls also show Sanders with a major lead over his rivals among young voters. The Associated Press has already called the state for Sanders, though polls closed just minutes ago. Marianna BradyBBC News Over the day, we've been introducing you to young Democrats voting in 2020. The fourth isPaige Thielke, 17, from California. Although she was too young to vote in todayâs primary, she will take part in Novemberâs general election. Whatâs at stake in this election? A lot, not just because it could bring about a change in government, but because the world is at a crossroads. Far-right, nationalistic political movements have been gaining popularity all around the world, and the climate crisis is only getting worse. Whoever becomes the president will have to deal with those issues, and after almost four years of Trump, itâs pretty clear how he would address those issues. Do you know who you are voting for? If not, what will decide your vote? While I understand the appeal of Bernie Sanders, who is by far the favorite candidate among many of my friends and fellow high school students, his reputation as being disliked by his fellow senators and the drastic nature of his policy proposals doesnât make me feel like he could work across the aisle to get stuff done during his presidency. Because of that, my support tends to lean more towards moderates, even though the majority of them in the race arenât ideal options. What should someone outside the US know about your state that makes it unique? California has the unique quality of being generally known across the world. But 40 million people live here (a bigger population than Canada), and there is no typical âCalifornianâ. While the entertainment industry is certainly big, the Central Valley also produces 13% of all agricultural products in the US. Itâs the most diverse state in the country, and is diverse not only in terms of race, but socioeconomic status, cultural experience, etc. So while the majority of voters do lean liberal, there are plenty of conservative areas as well.

This video can not be played Survivors from Tennessee tornado share their stories An earlier death toll of 25 was revised after one person's death was found to be unrelated to the storm. The scene in Nashville is ""like a war zone"", one resident told the BBC. One couple in Cookeville told CBS that they tried to shelter in their bathtub. ""We were flying in the air, into the trees back there, where once we hit those trees, the house... it just exploded. The house just disintegrated,"" Seth Wells said. ""I have no clue how we survived, it was like Wizard of Oz."" Much of the damage is centred in Putnam County - 80 miles (130km) east of Nashville - where 18 deaths, including five children, were reported. In Wilson County, three people died, as well as two people in Davidson County and one in Benton. A state of emergency remains in place, and several counties are working to clear debris and fallen trees. Five shelters are open, and about 40,000 people remain without power. Nashville's Emergency Operations Centre said it had opened a shelter with running water in a farmers' market to help displaced residents. Nashville Mayor John Cooper said the city was ""devastated"" and urged people to ""lend a helping hand"" to neighbours. There was also ""significant damage"" to John C Tune Airport, about eight miles from the city centre, the airport said. The National Weather Service reported that winds of 165mph hit Nashville. The storms were the deadliest to hit Tennessee since 2011, according to the Weather Channel. John C Tune Airport in Nashville was damaged when the tornadoes hit early on Tuesday morning Music stars Taylor Swift and Dolly Parton tweeted their support for those affected. ""My heart is with everyone in Tennessee who has been affected by the tornados. Sending you my love and prayers,"" wrote Taylor Swift. The city's schools, courts and transport lines closed on Tuesday because of the damage, officials said. Election polling sites located at schools opened for Super Tuesday, but four polling stations were moved. Tennessee was one of 14 US states holding primary contest votes onSuper Tuesdayto select a Democratic nominee to stand in November's presidential election. Tornadoes strike central Tennessee.

"Results roll in for Super Tuesday, the biggest day yet in the race for the White House Democrats in 14 states chose candidates to run against Trump in November's election Joe Biden wins eight states to become front-runner Early leader Bernie Sanders wins three states, still doing well Contests still close in biggest states California and Texas Mike Bloomberg performs poorly - but could do well in California Max Matza, Roland Hughes, Ritu Prasad, Helier Cheung and Holly Honderich This video can not be played Super Tuesday: Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden trade punches We're wrapping our live coverage of Super Tuesday, now it is Wednesday on the US east coast. It's been a fascinating few hours in the race to decide which Democrat will take on Donald Trump in November's election. Here are the main takeaways:  You can follow the latest with our up-to-date news storyhere, and you can read who the winners and losers werehere- thanks for following. It's almost 01:30 here in Washington, and the picture is starting to become a little clearer. But here are a few things wedon'tknow after Super Tuesday: Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Joe Biden came into Super Tuesday hoping his momentum from a
surprisingly big South Carolina win would translate into success in some of the
state and allow him to keep within sight of Bernie Sanders in the delegate
count. By that metric, his evening succeeded beyond his best expectations. Bidenâs support among black voters, which was on display in South Carolina,
was replicated across the south, in states like North Carolina, Virginia and
Alabama, where he consistently won about 60%. It also helped offset Bernie
Sanders's strength with Hispanic voters in Texas. Tuesday night was a celebration for Biden. Now the hard work begins. He is in for a state-by-state slog against Sanders that could stretch all the way to the Democratic National Convention in July. Heâll have to fundraise furiously and organise rapidly to make up for the Vermont senatorâs advantages. Meanwhile, Republicans are going to start training their fire on him - again. If he ends up winning the nomination, after being left for dead just a few weeks ago, he will have earned it. The state with the most at stake for the candidates is also the one that's most uncertain right now. California has a cool 415 delegates to dole out, but its size also means counting millions of votes could take quite a while - possibly weeks. About 30% of precincts have reported their results, and there are still thousands of mail-in votes to look at. In addition, local media report people are still waiting in long lines to cast their ballots even though polls closed nearly two hours ago. But the Associated Press has already called the state for Sanders. The New York Times has forecasted it's ""pretty likely"" Sanders who will take home the California haul. Bloomberg has also been doing well in California, overtaking Biden for the second-place spot. A reminder: you need 1,991 delegates total to win the Democratic nomination. Winning most delegates here will help, a lot, but it still won't make you the candidate. Here are where things stand right now when it comes to the all-important delegates that candidates have won. (These are assigned according to how well candidates have performed): Some caveats: we don't have the results from the two biggest states Texas (where Joe Biden is building up a lead) or California (where Sanders is leading Bloomberg). This picture could change quite a lot over the coming hours, and Sanders could pull closer to the former vice-president. Michael Bloomberg has said he will be re-evaluating his campaign following tonight's results. His only win was the US territory of American Samoa, but early polls in California and Texas have shown him in second and third place, respectively. Good results in these two states could get him closer to the front-runners. The BBC's North America reporter Anthony Zurcher says the former New York mayor could have an impact on this race depending on what he decides to do with his campaign machine. ""Whether Michael Bloomberg decides to use this machine he's built up and turn it to say, support Joe Biden going forward, or whoever the Democratic nominee is in November, that's an open question,"" he says. ""I think Joe Biden and his supporters have a very real interest in what Michael Bloomberg does from here on out...even if he doesn't have quite the same amount of support he did just a few days ago."" If Bloomberg pours money into states like Michigan and Florida, for example, he could be drawing votes away from Biden. Comedy actor Keegan-Michael Key, who once portrayed former President Obama's ""anger translator"" in a sketch, is once again pretending to be Biden's old boss. Allow Twitter content?

You can take our own celebrity endorsement quiz to see if you can match the A-lister to the candidatehere. There's a lot at stake in the country's second-most populous state. Before Tuesday, it looked like Bernie Sanders would win there fairly comfortably, thanks partly to his support among Latino voters. That hasn't proven to be the case. With 61% of results in, Joe Biden has now edged into the lead. It's still very close though. There are 228 delegates available here - they may end up being shared fairly evenly between Sanders and Biden. The BBC's Katty Kay points out, Biden's many wins could be thanks to issues of tone and civility. ""It's not just this concept of civility, it's actually the words people use about each other,"" she says. ""And Joe Biden, I think, appeals to people who might be looking for that in this country."" Perhaps in particular to women, she adds, who are looking for the political landscape to be ""less aggressive, less combative"". It's no longer Super Tuesday here on the east coast of the US, it's now less-super Wednesday. As we continue to await results from California, Texas and Maine, here are some key takeaways from Tuesday's big vote. 1) A new front-runner? Former vice-president Joe Biden's campaign was drying up until he won South Carolina on Saturday. That momentum has continued, with projected wins in eight states on Super Tuesday so far. 2) Biden's Southern base comes out African-American voters were a big part of Biden's wins in the South. He won the majority of black voters in these states, proving his campaign's claim that he has a strong base among southern Democrats. 3) But Bernie's still in Biden may have taken up his front-runner position once more, but Sanders could still unseat him. Sanders has been winning big among young voters and Latino voters. Latino voters, in particular, are a key demographic in the big-win states of California and Texas that are still up for grabs (it's stillincrediblyclose between Sanders and Biden in Texas). 4) A bad night for Bloomberg and Warren It has been a poor showing for both Michael Bloomberg (who has spent over $400m on his campaign) and Elizabeth Warren - who lost her home state (Massachusetts) and birth state (Oklahoma). In Massachusetts, women opted for Biden over her by a big margin. Katty KayWorld News America presenter One voter and dog line up to vote in Oklahoma City on Tuesday When it comes to Democrats and American politics, Oklahoma
isnât the first state you think of. Solidly Republican, the heartland state
doesnât feature in the Democratic story in presidential elections. But tonight,
true-red Oklahoma is telling an interesting tale about the state of the
Democratic race. In the 2016 Democratic primary race, Senator Bernie Sanders
beat Hillary Clinton to win Oklahoma by 10 percentage points. Four years ago
Sanders was seen as the anti-Clinton vote. He was the person Democrats
rallied around if they didnât want to hand the nomination to the establishment
candidate. Tonight Oklahoma tells a different story. Joe Biden has beaten Bernie Sanders. In 2020, Joe Biden has
become the anti-Sanders vote. For all those Democrats who donât
want a nominee from the left of the party, Biden is the guy. Not only is he the
anti-Sanders candidate, heâs also the anti-Trump candidate. For Democratic
voters for whom beating Trump is the number one goal, Biden, not Sanders looks
like the most viable candidate. As rumours fly that Michael Bloomberg may drop out on Wednesday, let's take a look at what his nearly half billion dollars of personal campaign contributions could have bought. The billionaire ex-New York City mayor is the ninth richest man in the world, and has spent $464m on his campaign so far, according to federal campaign filings. For that money he could have: Democrats aren't the only ones hosting primaries on Super Tuesday - Republicans have had their say too. Technically, the president isn't running uncontested for the Republican nomination. Former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld is also on the ballot, but his candidacy is a long-shot, as a brief scroll through Trump's Twitter feed shows. Without calling each other out by name, both Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden have criticised each other. Watch as they trade political blows - over the Iraq War and general election electability - in their speeches tonight. This video can not be played Super Tuesday: Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden trade punches We're still waiting for projections for three states: massive Texas and California, as well as tiny Maine. And we're still awaiting the full results in almost every state. Remember, the aim for all candidates is to win1,991 delegates, a different amount of which are awarded in each state, and according to how well each candidate has performed. With that target in mind, this is how many delegates each candidate has so far:  We are a long, long way away from this being resolved. Voters line up outside a library in Burbank, California The Bernie Sanders campaign is asking a judge to grant an emergency injunction to keep polling stations open in Los Angeles county due what they describe as long queues of waiting voters. Voters, their suit claims, have waited for up to four hours to vote at ""multiple"" voting locations. California has made strides to make voting as accessible as possible, according to the BBC's Sophie Long in Los Angeles. Some polling stations, which have been open since last week, allow for 24-hour voting. And across the city, public transit has been made free to allow voters to more easily get to their polling station. Biden is projected to win Massachusetts, which has 91 delegates. It's an embarrassing loss for Elizabeth Warren, one of the state's current US senators. Sanders was expected to do well, and he is projected to take second place, leaving Warren in a dismal third on home turf. It's been a bad night for the former mayor of New York. Michael Bloomberg has spent more than half a billion dollars of his own fortune and so far has only a win in American Samoa to show for it. Talking to supporters in Florida, however, he insisted he was still the candidate who could beat Donald Trump. And instead of despair in the face of defeat, he turned to humour (possibly with help from a teleprompter). We'll let you decide if Bloomberg did better with jokes than votes. This video can not be played Watch Bloomberg joke about Trump's golf and brainpower. California is the prize tonight's Democratic presidential hopefuls all want to take home. The state has a massive 415 delegates up for grabs. Sanders currently has an edge in the state - as expected, given his success with Latino voters, who are a key California voter demographic. Early polls also show Sanders with a major lead over his rivals among young voters. The Associated Press has already called the state for Sanders, though polls closed just minutes ago. Marianna BradyBBC News Over the day, we've been introducing you to young Democrats voting in 2020. The fourth isPaige Thielke, 17, from California. Although she was too young to vote in todayâs primary, she will take part in Novemberâs general election. Whatâs at stake in this election? A lot, not just because it could bring about a change in government, but because the world is at a crossroads. Far-right, nationalistic political movements have been gaining popularity all around the world, and the climate crisis is only getting worse. Whoever becomes the president will have to deal with those issues, and after almost four years of Trump, itâs pretty clear how he would address those issues. Do you know who you are voting for? If not, what will decide your vote? While I understand the appeal of Bernie Sanders, who is by far the favorite candidate among many of my friends and fellow high school students, his reputation as being disliked by his fellow senators and the drastic nature of his policy proposals doesnât make me feel like he could work across the aisle to get stuff done during his presidency. Because of that, my support tends to lean more towards moderates, even though the majority of them in the race arenât ideal options. What should someone outside the US know about your state that makes it unique? California has the unique quality of being generally known across the world. But 40 million people live here (a bigger population than Canada), and there is no typical âCalifornianâ. While the entertainment industry is certainly big, the Central Valley also produces 13% of all agricultural products in the US. Itâs the most diverse state in the country, and is diverse not only in terms of race, but socioeconomic status, cultural experience, etc. So while the majority of voters do lean liberal, there are plenty of conservative areas as well.

"There are fears the slowdown from the outbreak could tip countries into recession The World Bank has committed $12bn (Â£9.4bn) in aid for developing countries grappling with the spread of the coronavirus. The emergency package includes low-cost loans, grants and technical assistance. The action comes as leaders around the world pledge to shield their countries from the economic impact of the outbreak. It follows warnings that slowdown from the outbreak could tip countries into recession. The aid is intended to help countries improve their public health response to the crisis, as well as work with the private sector to reduce the economic impact. ""What we're trying to do is limit the transmission of the disease,"" World Bank Group President David Malpass told the BBC. Coronavirus outbreak: Follow the latest updates on our live blog The organisation said it would prioritise the poorest and most at-risk countries in distributing the aid to counter the effects of the virus, which has spread to more than 70 countries around the world. Half of the package comes from the bank's International Finance Corporation, which works with the private sector. About $4bn of the $12bn is being shifted from previously available funds. Countries with weak health systems, limited financial resources and close economic links with China are said to be most vulnerable to the coronavirus outbreak. The countries most at risk to the economic impact of the outbreak are Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and the Philippines,according to a vulnerability index by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI),external.

The country on Wednesday reported 38 more deaths but a fall in fresh cases for a third consecutive day. The worst-hit country outside China remains South Korea which on Wednesday reported 516 new confirmed infections, bringing the total to 5,328. The country's death toll stands at 33. ""The point is to move fast; speed is needed to save lives,"" Mr Malpass said in conference with reporters. ""There are scenarios where much more resources may be required. We'll adapt our approach and resources as needed."" The Dow Jones shed nearly 800 points on Tuesday, paring Monday's big gains.

Most of the deaths are in Lombardy. Nine deaths have now been confirmed in the US. All of those killed lived in Washington state. And in Spain, an autopsy on a 69-year-old man who died on 13 February has revealed he was infected with SARS-CoV-2, local media report. It is the country's first fatality from the virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) says the virus appears to particularly affect those over 60, and people already ill. In the first large analysis of more than 44,000 cases from China, the death rate was 10 times higher in the very elderly compared to the middle-aged. The WHO also warned that prices of protective equipment, such as surgical masks and gloves, are soaring due to a global shortage, and asked companies and governments to increase production by 40%.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Keeping the country safe is the government's overriding priority"" Up to a fifth of the workforce may be off sick during the peak of a coronavirus epidemic in the UK, the government says inits latest plans.,external Police may need to focus on only the most serious crimes and maintaining public order if the virus spreads. The military could also provide support to emergency services if needed. The government's response is in its first stage - containing the outbreak - with the number of UK cases rising from 39 to 51 on Tuesday. Out of the positive cases, 12 people have since recovered. Eight charts on how coronavirus has hit the global economy It is ""highly likely"" the UK will see further infection, the prime minister has warned, and the next phase of government contingency planning will be to do with delaying the spread of the virus. If the coronavirus, which causes Covid-19, becomes widespread, some non-urgent hospital care may be delayed to focus on treating those who are infected, while recently retired doctors and nurses may be called back to work. Other possible measures include school closures, reducing large-scale gatherings and working from home. HOW IS THE UK PLANNING FOR AN OUTBREAK:How prepared are we? WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?A simple guide HOW TO SELF-ISOLATE:What you need to know WHERE ARE WE WITH A VACCINE?Progress so far A VISUAL GUIDE TO THE OUTBREAK:Virus maps and charts Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that widespread transmission of the virus across the UK was becoming ""more likely"" and urged people to ""act on official medical advice"". Meanwhile, 12 new cases of coronavirus have been announced in England, eight of whom had travelled from Italy, and one each from Germany, Singapore, Japan and Iran. The patients are from London, Hampshire, Northamptonshire, Bury, Wirral, Greater Manchester and Hull. Consultancy firm Deloitte said one of its employees had tested positive for the virus after returning from Asia. A spokesman said one of the floors in its UK offices was affected. A British woman has also been diagnosed with the virus at a hotel in Tenerife that was hit by an outbreak of the virus last week. About 90,000 people have been infected globally since the outbreak of Covid-19, with cases in more than 50 countries and more than 3,000 deaths. A British man who was infectedon the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japanbecame the first UK citizen to die from the virus last week. The Queen wore gloves as she awarded the CBE to actress Wendy Craig The Queen was seen wearing white gloves when she carried out an investiture at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday. The palace would not confirm if the decision was linked to the coronavirus outbreak. It's a finely balanced judgement - not wanting to scare the public but being straight with them about what might happen and how intervention to limit the spread of the virus might affect their everyday lives. The government has chosen to make no secret of its assumption that things could well get significantly worse - after all the coronavirus plan published today is entitled ""a guide to what you can expect across the UK"". If medical experts are assuming widespread transmission of the virus ministers can hardly hide that from the public. Preparing secret contingency plans for school closures and then risking an uncontrolled leak might worry people more. The plan, though, contains few details of how new powers might be used and how the NHS might find the beds and staff to cope with an increased number of very sick patients. In the weeks ahead there will be increasing questions about the measures which have been flagged up with the launch of the plan. While the vast majority of patients in the UK will have a mild to moderate illness, similar to seasonal flu, a minority will require hospital care and a small proportion could die, the government's plans warn. There are no estimates given in the plans but they do warn of an increase in deaths, particularly among the elderly and those with existing health conditions. Young children can become infected and ""suffer severe illness"", but overall the illness is less common in the under-20s. It is possible an outbreak could come in multiple waves, the government said. Wales' chief medical officer has suggested cases of coronaviruscould increase from April with a peak in May or June.

There arefour stages to the government's response, which also includes mitigating the impact of the virus once it becomes established and a research programme to improve diagnostics and treatment for the disease. Boris Johnson reiterated on Tuesday that the ""single most important thing"" people could do was wash their hands with soap and hot water for the length of time it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice. He added: ""I want to stress that for the vast majority of the people of this country, we should be going about our business as usual."" This video can not be played Do face masks work? And other coronavirus questions answered Mr Johnson said schools should stay open ""if possible"" and follow advice from Public Health England. Meanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has ordered Treasury officials to work up plans to support the public health response, businesses and the economy in his Budget on 11 March. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has said Labour would seek to work ""constructively"" with the government. However, he has called for emergency legislation to ensure those working in the gig economy are guaranteed sick pay, and for the government to provide emergency funding to support the NHS through the outbreak. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has warnedthe NHS was already at 94% bed occupancybefore coronavirus hit. Mr Hancock told MPs that people who needed to self-isolate to protect others were entitled to sick pay. He added that resources had been increased to the NHS, but did not rule out the government taking future action if needed. In other developments: European markets have climbed for a second dayafter fears over coronavirus affected shares, and Bank of England governor Mark Carney said policymakers stand ready to support the British economy Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said there were currently no plans to postpone the London Marathon nor to restrict public transport England's Six Nations game against Waleson Saturday and Scotland's against France on Sunday will go ahead, however England prop Mako Vunipola has gone into self-isolation as a coronavirus precaution and will not join the squad UK supermarkets have said they have ""well-rehearsed contingency plans"" to deal with the outbreak and ensure continued availability in stores. G7 finance ministers have saidthey will use ""all appropriate policy tools""to tackle the economic impact of the virus TheTokyo 2020 Olympic Games could be postponedto the end of the year, according to the country's Olympic minister As of Tuesday morning, the Department of Health said 13,911 people had been tested in the UK, of which 13,860 were negative. The outbreak originated in China's Hubei province in December before spreading globally. The battle plan stops short of predicting how many people would be infected in an epidemic in the UK. Worst case scenario modelling suggests 80% of people can become infected when there is a new virus like this. But officials believe it will not be this high. The evidence suggests just over half of people infected develop symptoms and 1% of those infected could die. The elderly and those with existing health conditions are the most at risk. If there is a widespread transmission - which seems highly likely at this stage - it could take two or three months to peak. The peak would last two or three weeks and about 50% of people who become infected could become infected in those peak weeks. There would then be a period of two or three months of declining cases, although the battle plan acknowledges there could be multiple waves. The government is likely to use its most drastic measures at its disposal just ahead of the peak in an attempt to flatten it. What questions do you have about the UK's preparations?

"Iowa, where it's never too cold to caucus Four years after the world watched Donald Trump's momentum build and build until he became the Republican nominee, America is again deciding who will run for the White House. The nominees are being chosen through a series of primaries and caucuses in every US state and territory, that began in Iowa on 3 February and ends in Puerto Rico in early June. The Republican nominee will be Donald Trump. Even though technically he has a challenger, he is so popular among Republicans, he has a clear run ahead of him. With that in mind, the Democratic primaries are the only ones worth watching. It's an unusual process, not all of which makes sense, although we've tried. A whole year before the primaries, the first candidates emerged from hibernation. Over the year, others woke up and eventually 28 people announced they were running to become the Democratic nominee for president. But dwindling funds, luke-warm or (ice-cold) public reaction and campaign infighting have, to varying degrees, led to most of them pulling out of the race. Which Democrat will take on Trump? The strange symbol on one candidate's hand At the start of primary season, 11 people remained in the running, a number that has now reduced to three. In theory, any one of them could become the nominee. In reality, only two now have a chance. The first event of the primary season isn't a primary at all - it's a series of caucuses, in Iowa. These took place on Monday 3 February, in somewhat chaotic fashion. What are caucuses? This video can not be played How Iowa is like the luge: An unconventional guide to the caucuses A caucus involves people attending a meeting - maybe for a few hours - before they vote on their preferred candidate, perhaps via a head count or a show of hands. Those meetings might be in just a few select locations - you can't just turn up at a polling station. As a result, caucuses tend to really suit candidates who are good at rousing their supporters to get out of bed. People like Bernie Sanders, for example, who performed well in Iowa this time, as did Pete Buttigieg. Nine odd things about the Iowa caucuses Democrats' key issues explained Caucuses used to be far more popular back in the day, but this year, Democrats are holding only four in US states - in Nevada, North Dakota, Wyoming and Iowa. If any candidate gets under 15% of the vote in any caucus, their supporters then get to pick a second choice from among the candidates whodidget more than 15%, or they can just choose to sit out the second vote. Why does Iowa matter? A win there for any candidate can help give them momentum and propel them to victory in the primaries. Why is Iowa first in the primary calendar? You can blame Jimmy Carter, sort of. Iowa became first in 1972, for various technical electoral reasons too boring to go into here. But when Carter ran for president in 1976, his team realised they could grab the momentum by campaigning early in Iowa. He won there, then surprisingly won the presidency, and Iowa's fate was sealed. Why does Iowa not matter? Iowa doesn't represent the entire US - it's largely white, so the way people vote there is very, very different than in other states. Its record on picking the eventual nominees is a bit rubbish too, at least when it comes to Republicans - when there's an open Republican race, Iowa hasn't opted for the eventual nominee since 2000. Such names as Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum and Ted Cruz have won there in recent years. This year, Iowa suffered a bloody nose when the Democratic result was delayed by days due to technical glitches. Its curtain-raiser status may now be in doubt. New Hampshire: Intensely bucolic Eight days after Iowa on Tuesday, 11 February, was the first primary, in New Hampshire. The tiny north-eastern state of only 1.3m people once again became an unlikely hotbed of political activity. What is a primary? Unlike a caucus, where voters are expected to turn up at a few limited locations at certain times and stick around for a while, primary voters can just turn up at a polling booth and vote in secret. Then leave. How does a primary work? The more votes a candidate gets in a caucus or primary, the more ""delegates"" they are awarded, and all candidates will be hoping to win an unbeatable majority of delegates. The number of delegates differs in each state, and is decided by a convoluted series of criteria. In California's primary, for example, there are 415 Democratic delegates up for grabs this year. In New Hampshire, it was only 24. This year is a bit different. Any candidate would need to get at least 15% of the vote in any primary or caucus to be awarded delegates. There are still eight candidates in the running - an unusually large number - so there's a risk the vote share will be spread out and some of the candidates may struggle to reach 15%. After New Hampshire, we started to get a clear picture of who was struggling (Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren), but even though Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg had claimed the most delegates at this stage, neither is guaranteed to become the nominee. The picture became much clearer on... A few other states voted in between New Hampshire and the end of February, but things really started to warm up by Super Tuesday, on 3 March. What is Super Tuesday? THE big date in the primary calendar, when 16 states, territories or groups voted for their preferred candidate in primaries or caucuses. A third of all the delegates available in the entire primary season were up for grabs on Super Tuesday. By the end of the dayit became much clearer that Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders were the front-runnersfor the Democratic nomination. The two states with the most delegates voted on Super Tuesday - California (with 415 Democratic delegates) and Texas (228). California voted three months earlier than in 2016, making Super Tuesday even more super than normal. After hectic Super Tuesday, everyone gets to cool down for a week, before another busy day on Tuesday, 10 March, when six states vote, with 352 delegates available. After that, the primary season still has three months left to run and at the end, the role of those delegates will become clear... Hillary Clinton celebrates becoming the Democratic nominee at the 2016 convention. This is as good as things got for her campaign. Donald Trump will almost certainly be sworn in as the Republican nominee at the party convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, between 24 and 27 August. The Democrats will confirm their candidate at their own convention between 13 and 16 July in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. What happens in a convention? Here's where those delegates come in. Let's say that during primary season, candidate A wins 10 delegates. During the convention, those 10 delegates would vote for candidate A to become the Democratic nominee. (Any party member can apply to be a delegate - they tend to be party activists or local political leaders.) All through the Democratic primaries, there are3,979 delegatesavailable. If any one candidate wins more than 50% of those delegates during primary season (that's1,990 delegates), then they become the nominee in a vote at the convention. But if we get to the Democratic convention and no-one has more than 50% of the delegates, it becomes what's known as a ""contested"" or ""brokered"" convention. This could well happen this year. There are so many candidates that no one frontrunner emerges in the primaries, and they split the delegates between them. In that circumstance, asecondvote would follow. In that second vote, all the 3,979 delegates would vote again, except this time they would be joined by an estimated771 ""superdelegates"". These are senior party officials past and present (former president Bill Clinton is one, as is current Vermont senator and presidential contender Bernie Sanders), and they're free to vote for whomever they wish. If a candidate wins 50% or more in that vote - 2,376 delegates - then they become the nominee. This is all thanks to a rule change in 2020: last time around, the superdelegates voted at the start of the convention, with the delegates. But many had pledged their support to Hillary Clinton even before the convention, leading her rival Mr Sanders to suggest the deck was stacked against him. He's the one who campaigned for the change - and it may benefit him in 2020. After inching past Iowa, negotiated New Hampshire, survived Super Tuesday and come through the convention, there is only one step left for the nominee: the presidential election, on 3 November. We'll explain how that one works a little closer to the time.

"Voters across America are preparing to take part in the biggest day of the 2020 election so far. More than a year after the first Democratic candidates joined the race to take on Donald Trump, we've now reached Super Tuesday. Fourteen states will vote on which Democrat they want to run in November's election. Bernie Sanders is in the lead after the early contests. By Wednesday, we could have a clearer picture of who the nominee will be. Democrats across the US have been taking part in a series of caucuses (essentially party meetings, where you vote publicly at the end) or primaries (secret ballots) to pick their preferred candidate. Bernie Sanders's success has come as a bit of a surprise. The Vermont senator lost out to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 race, buthe isn't a typical Democrat by any means(in fact, he sits as an Independent in the Senate). He's a staunch left-winger, so may struggle to convince the party's moderates if he becomes the candidate. He's also 78, and suffered a heart attack in the autumn. But he's proven extremely popular in the primaries so far across many age groups and ethnicities, and all the momentum is on his side. The handful of moderate Democrats running have split the vote, so it's made it hard for any of them to break out (and this has helped Sanders build up a lead). One of them, former vice-president and early favouriteJoe Biden, underwhelmed before winning convincingly in South Carolina on Saturday. However, he has since seen a swell in momentum after centrist rivalsPete Buttigieg, andAmy Klobucharquit the race to endorse him. Sanders does not have the left lane to himself either -Elizabeth Warren, the experienced Massachusetts senator, shares several of his policy objectives but has not lived up to expectations. So might any of these candidates win the election in November? Honestly, it's too close to call, and there are so many unknown factors. It's all about the delegates. Let's say Candidate A gets the most support in one state. Candidate B does OK, but not as well. Candidate A is then awarded the most delegates, and Candidate B fewer. The number of delegates available differs in each state. Later in the summer, those delegates will then vote for their candidate to become the Democratic nominee. The target for any candidate is to reach an unbeatable majority of1,990 delegates. This is where Super Tuesday comes in. This video can not be played Why Alexis and Amira could help decide the US election Up to now,only 155 delegateshave been awarded in four states. On Super Tuesday, a massive1,357 delegateswill be distributed, and 14 states are voting. The two most populous, California and Texas, will take part - the former for the first time on Super Tuesday. Here's what is at stake in each state - the smallest to the largest - with some bonus nuggets of trivia thrown in. Who will do best?A no-brainer: Bernie Sanders. He is one of the state's senators, after all. Who could do well?Honestly? There's a chance no-one except Sanders will cross the 15% threshold of votes and get any delegates. He is extremely popular in his home state and won the 2016 primary here with 86% of the vote (though he eventually lost the nomination to Hillary Clinton). We could see the first results from here at about 19:00 local time (midnight GMT). One piece of contextIn a poll by Vermont Public Radio in February,almost a third of people said the economy, jobs and cost of living were among the main issues,externalon their minds - although Vermont has the joint-lowest unemployment rate in the country, at 2.3%. State bird?Hermit thrush Who will do best?We're going to start sounding repetitive, but polls point to Bernie Sanders. In 2016, he won more than double the number of delegates claimed by Hillary Clinton here. Who could do well?There are more contenders than in 2016 which means Sanders' lead won't be as large. But billionaire Michael Bloomberg and Joe Biden are polling far behind. One piece of contextThis isn't the only thing on the ballot on Super Tuesday in Maine. There's also a referendum on whether to reject a law that would block religious and philosophical objections to vaccinations. State animal?Moose Who will do best?Clue: his name is an anagram of Desire Banners. Sanders won here convincingly in 2016. Who could do well?It's unlikely anyone will challenge Sanders. The most recent poll put Bloomberg in a distant second and former Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg in third, before he dropped out. Could Bloomberg win votes that might have gone to Buttigieg, and tighten the gap on Sanders? One piece of contextUtah has not voted for a Democrat in the presidential election since 1964, when it picked Lyndon B Johnson. So whoever comes out on top here may not take the state in November. State gem?Topaz A simple guide to US primaries and caucuses Five charts that explain the Democratic race Who will do best?A recent poll by Hendrix College in Arkansas suggested Bloomberg's plan of concentrating on Super Tuesday states could pay off here. Who could do well?Biden and Sanders possibly, although it's a close-run thing. Forecasting site FiveThirtyEight gives Biden a stronger chance - the vote could be split fairly evenly. One piece of contextIt might not matter who Democrats pick: Arkansas has opted for a Democrat in a presidential election only twice in 40 years (and even then, it was local boy Bill Clinton, twice). State dinosaur?Arkansaurus fridayi Who will do best?It's tough to say. Biden, maybe just. Who could do well?Bloomberg and Sanders, according to Oklahoma polling group Sooner last week. One piece of contextFracking is a big issue here, and Sanders and Warren (who was born in Oklahoma City) have both proposed measures to ban it. The underground disposal of waste water used in fracking has led to a rise in earthquakes in this part of the US. State beverage?Milk Who will do best?We're in safe Biden territory. He has the support of plenty of senior Democrats in Alabama, and is widely liked among African Americans there. Who could do well?Biden's lead in the polls looks fairly comfortable, but Bloomberg and Sanders appear most likely to challenge him. One piece of contextRepublicans are also deciding who will run in November's Senate race, where they are very hopeful of ousting Democrat Doug Jones (and making it harder for Democrats to win the Senate later this year). The favourite right now is Jeff Sessions, Donald Trump's former attorney general. State amphibian?Red Hills Salamander The candidates hoping to unseat Trump Which celebrity has endorsed whom? Who will do best?It's close. FiveThirtyEight suggests Biden's chances here have improved a lot over the past few days. Who could do well?There has been very little polling here, but it could well be Sanders, who was a distant second to Hillary Clinton here in 2016. One piece of contextIn Tennessee, who votes may be a bigger issue than who wins - it has one of the worst voter turnout rates in the US. In the last presidential election, just over half of registered voters turned out, 10 points below the national average. State wild animal?Raccoon Who will do best?FiveThirtyEight gives Sanders a seven in eight chance of winning most votes here. You may notice that a picture is starting to form. Who could do well?The site puts Biden in a distant second, with Elizabeth Warren just behind him. One piece of contextOnce a Republican stronghold, out-of-state migration and population growth has turned Colorado increasingly ""blue"" - a Democratic tilt that extends down the ballot.

State cactus?Claret Cup Cactus How Bernie Sanders always beats the odds Who will do best?It was all set to be Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar until she withdrew on Monday. She has now endorsed Biden, so... maybe Biden? Who could do well?Sanders had been close behind Klobuchar in second, and is likely to pick up a decent amount of delegates here. One piece of contextThis part of the US was badly hit by Donald Trump's trade war with China - advocacy group Tariffs Hurt The Heartland said businesses in Minnesota had to pay $797m (Â£604m) more in tariffs as a result. Will that translate into more support for Democrats in this election? State mushroom?Morel Who will do best?Sanders, maybe. But it will be close. Who could do well?Elizabeth Warren, but it might be embarrassing if she doesn't win, given she is the senior senator for the state. Buttigieg's withdrawal may help her. One piece of contextA massive 40% of the candidates left in the race (two people) live in Massachusetts - as well as Warren, the other is Michael Bloomberg, who lives in Medford. Despite actor Michael Douglas campaigning for him there, he is not expected to do especially well here. State fish?Cod Who will do best?This will be a really interesting one to follow. The vote could be split fairly evenly between Sanders, Bloomberg and Biden. Who could do well?See above. One piece of contextWatch the results in the Washington DC suburbs. This suburban vote will be crucial across the country in November's election (as it was in the 2018 mid-terms). How will the nationwide favourite, Bernie Sanders, perform there? Will moderates in the suburbs warm to him? State dog?American foxhound Who will do best?It's quite a similar picture to neighbouring Virginia, and will also be worth following - it's close between Sanders and Biden. Who could do well?Bloomberg was polling well here at one point, but is drifting behind a little by now. One piece of contextThis will also be a battleground state in November. As with Virginia, watch the crucially important suburbs of cities like Charlotte and Raleigh. But watch who they vote for, and whether that person ends up becoming the nominee. The way the votes go here in Novembermighthelp decide the election. State fruit?Scuppernong grape Who will do best?We're into the big league now. It's very close between Sanders and Biden here. Either way, it looks likely Sanders will claim a large amount of delegates and by the time the results come in from Texas, his lead could be big. Who could do well?It is likely to be a good night for Biden here too. Elizabeth Warren is third or fourth in most polls. One piece of contextThere's reason to think that the so-called sleeping giant of the Texas Hispanic vote - now almost two million voters - is about to wake up. In the 2018 midterms, 46.9% of registered Hispanic voters turned out, a leap from 24.4% in 2014. State crustacean?Texas Gulf Shrimp Who will do best?If Sanders really does have an eight in nine chance of winning most votes here, as FiveThirtyEight predicts, you might as well call him the nominee. This is where Sanders' appeal to his ""multiracial coalition"" pays off - he looks like he could do well with African Americans, Latinos and Asian Americans here. Who could do well?Right now, Biden looks like being a distant second. One piece of contextThis will be a Super Tuesday debut for California. Lawmakers moved the state's primary up a month from its traditional spot in June in an effort to increase California's impact.

It's been a fascinating few hours in the race to decide which Democrat will take on Donald Trump in November's election. Here are the main takeaways:  You can follow the latest with our up-to-date news storyhere, and you can read who the winners and losers werehere- thanks for following. It's almost 01:30 here in Washington, and the picture is starting to become a little clearer. But here are a few things wedon'tknow after Super Tuesday: Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Joe Biden came into Super Tuesday hoping his momentum from a
surprisingly big South Carolina win would translate into success in some of the
state and allow him to keep within sight of Bernie Sanders in the delegate
count. By that metric, his evening succeeded beyond his best expectations. Bidenâs support among black voters, which was on display in South Carolina,
was replicated across the south, in states like North Carolina, Virginia and
Alabama, where he consistently won about 60%. It also helped offset Bernie
Sanders's strength with Hispanic voters in Texas. Tuesday night was a celebration for Biden. Now the hard work begins. He is in for a state-by-state slog against Sanders that could stretch all the way to the Democratic National Convention in July. Heâll have to fundraise furiously and organise rapidly to make up for the Vermont senatorâs advantages. Meanwhile, Republicans are going to start training their fire on him - again. If he ends up winning the nomination, after being left for dead just a few weeks ago, he will have earned it. The state with the most at stake for the candidates is also the one that's most uncertain right now. California has a cool 415 delegates to dole out, but its size also means counting millions of votes could take quite a while - possibly weeks. About 30% of precincts have reported their results, and there are still thousands of mail-in votes to look at. In addition, local media report people are still waiting in long lines to cast their ballots even though polls closed nearly two hours ago. But the Associated Press has already called the state for Sanders. The New York Times has forecasted it's ""pretty likely"" Sanders who will take home the California haul. Bloomberg has also been doing well in California, overtaking Biden for the second-place spot. A reminder: you need 1,991 delegates total to win the Democratic nomination. Winning most delegates here will help, a lot, but it still won't make you the candidate. Here are where things stand right now when it comes to the all-important delegates that candidates have won. (These are assigned according to how well candidates have performed): Some caveats: we don't have the results from the two biggest states Texas (where Joe Biden is building up a lead) or California (where Sanders is leading Bloomberg). This picture could change quite a lot over the coming hours, and Sanders could pull closer to the former vice-president. Michael Bloomberg has said he will be re-evaluating his campaign following tonight's results. His only win was the US territory of American Samoa, but early polls in California and Texas have shown him in second and third place, respectively. Good results in these two states could get him closer to the front-runners. The BBC's North America reporter Anthony Zurcher says the former New York mayor could have an impact on this race depending on what he decides to do with his campaign machine. ""Whether Michael Bloomberg decides to use this machine he's built up and turn it to say, support Joe Biden going forward, or whoever the Democratic nominee is in November, that's an open question,"" he says. ""I think Joe Biden and his supporters have a very real interest in what Michael Bloomberg does from here on out...even if he doesn't have quite the same amount of support he did just a few days ago."" If Bloomberg pours money into states like Michigan and Florida, for example, he could be drawing votes away from Biden. Comedy actor Keegan-Michael Key, who once portrayed former President Obama's ""anger translator"" in a sketch, is once again pretending to be Biden's old boss. Allow Twitter content?

Before Tuesday, it looked like Bernie Sanders would win there fairly comfortably, thanks partly to his support among Latino voters. That hasn't proven to be the case. With 61% of results in, Joe Biden has now edged into the lead. It's still very close though. There are 228 delegates available here - they may end up being shared fairly evenly between Sanders and Biden. The BBC's Katty Kay points out, Biden's many wins could be thanks to issues of tone and civility. ""It's not just this concept of civility, it's actually the words people use about each other,"" she says. ""And Joe Biden, I think, appeals to people who might be looking for that in this country."" Perhaps in particular to women, she adds, who are looking for the political landscape to be ""less aggressive, less combative"". It's no longer Super Tuesday here on the east coast of the US, it's now less-super Wednesday. As we continue to await results from California, Texas and Maine, here are some key takeaways from Tuesday's big vote. 1) A new front-runner? Former vice-president Joe Biden's campaign was drying up until he won South Carolina on Saturday. That momentum has continued, with projected wins in eight states on Super Tuesday so far. 2) Biden's Southern base comes out African-American voters were a big part of Biden's wins in the South. He won the majority of black voters in these states, proving his campaign's claim that he has a strong base among southern Democrats. 3) But Bernie's still in Biden may have taken up his front-runner position once more, but Sanders could still unseat him. Sanders has been winning big among young voters and Latino voters. Latino voters, in particular, are a key demographic in the big-win states of California and Texas that are still up for grabs (it's stillincrediblyclose between Sanders and Biden in Texas). 4) A bad night for Bloomberg and Warren It has been a poor showing for both Michael Bloomberg (who has spent over $400m on his campaign) and Elizabeth Warren - who lost her home state (Massachusetts) and birth state (Oklahoma). In Massachusetts, women opted for Biden over her by a big margin. Katty KayWorld News America presenter One voter and dog line up to vote in Oklahoma City on Tuesday When it comes to Democrats and American politics, Oklahoma
isnât the first state you think of. Solidly Republican, the heartland state
doesnât feature in the Democratic story in presidential elections. But tonight,
true-red Oklahoma is telling an interesting tale about the state of the
Democratic race. In the 2016 Democratic primary race, Senator Bernie Sanders
beat Hillary Clinton to win Oklahoma by 10 percentage points. Four years ago
Sanders was seen as the anti-Clinton vote. He was the person Democrats
rallied around if they didnât want to hand the nomination to the establishment
candidate. Tonight Oklahoma tells a different story. Joe Biden has beaten Bernie Sanders. In 2020, Joe Biden has
become the anti-Sanders vote. For all those Democrats who donât
want a nominee from the left of the party, Biden is the guy. Not only is he the
anti-Sanders candidate, heâs also the anti-Trump candidate. For Democratic
voters for whom beating Trump is the number one goal, Biden, not Sanders looks
like the most viable candidate. As rumours fly that Michael Bloomberg may drop out on Wednesday, let's take a look at what his nearly half billion dollars of personal campaign contributions could have bought. The billionaire ex-New York City mayor is the ninth richest man in the world, and has spent $464m on his campaign so far, according to federal campaign filings. For that money he could have: Democrats aren't the only ones hosting primaries on Super Tuesday - Republicans have had their say too. Technically, the president isn't running uncontested for the Republican nomination. Former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld is also on the ballot, but his candidacy is a long-shot, as a brief scroll through Trump's Twitter feed shows. Without calling each other out by name, both Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden have criticised each other. Watch as they trade political blows - over the Iraq War and general election electability - in their speeches tonight. This video can not be played Super Tuesday: Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden trade punches We're still waiting for projections for three states: massive Texas and California, as well as tiny Maine. And we're still awaiting the full results in almost every state. Remember, the aim for all candidates is to win1,991 delegates, a different amount of which are awarded in each state, and according to how well each candidate has performed. With that target in mind, this is how many delegates each candidate has so far:  We are a long, long way away from this being resolved. Voters line up outside a library in Burbank, California The Bernie Sanders campaign is asking a judge to grant an emergency injunction to keep polling stations open in Los Angeles county due what they describe as long queues of waiting voters. Voters, their suit claims, have waited for up to four hours to vote at ""multiple"" voting locations. California has made strides to make voting as accessible as possible, according to the BBC's Sophie Long in Los Angeles. Some polling stations, which have been open since last week, allow for 24-hour voting. And across the city, public transit has been made free to allow voters to more easily get to their polling station. Biden is projected to win Massachusetts, which has 91 delegates. It's an embarrassing loss for Elizabeth Warren, one of the state's current US senators. Sanders was expected to do well, and he is projected to take second place, leaving Warren in a dismal third on home turf. It's been a bad night for the former mayor of New York. Michael Bloomberg has spent more than half a billion dollars of his own fortune and so far has only a win in American Samoa to show for it. Talking to supporters in Florida, however, he insisted he was still the candidate who could beat Donald Trump. And instead of despair in the face of defeat, he turned to humour (possibly with help from a teleprompter). We'll let you decide if Bloomberg did better with jokes than votes. This video can not be played Watch Bloomberg joke about Trump's golf and brainpower. California is the prize tonight's Democratic presidential hopefuls all want to take home. The state has a massive 415 delegates up for grabs. Sanders currently has an edge in the state - as expected, given his success with Latino voters, who are a key California voter demographic. Early polls also show Sanders with a major lead over his rivals among young voters. The Associated Press has already called the state for Sanders, though polls closed just minutes ago. Marianna BradyBBC News Over the day, we've been introducing you to young Democrats voting in 2020. The fourth isPaige Thielke, 17, from California. Although she was too young to vote in todayâs primary, she will take part in Novemberâs general election. Whatâs at stake in this election? A lot, not just because it could bring about a change in government, but because the world is at a crossroads. Far-right, nationalistic political movements have been gaining popularity all around the world, and the climate crisis is only getting worse. Whoever becomes the president will have to deal with those issues, and after almost four years of Trump, itâs pretty clear how he would address those issues. Do you know who you are voting for? If not, what will decide your vote? While I understand the appeal of Bernie Sanders, who is by far the favorite candidate among many of my friends and fellow high school students, his reputation as being disliked by his fellow senators and the drastic nature of his policy proposals doesnât make me feel like he could work across the aisle to get stuff done during his presidency. Because of that, my support tends to lean more towards moderates, even though the majority of them in the race arenât ideal options. What should someone outside the US know about your state that makes it unique? California has the unique quality of being generally known across the world. But 40 million people live here (a bigger population than Canada), and there is no typical âCalifornianâ. While the entertainment industry is certainly big, the Central Valley also produces 13% of all agricultural products in the US. Itâs the most diverse state in the country, and is diverse not only in terms of race, but socioeconomic status, cultural experience, etc. So while the majority of voters do lean liberal, there are plenty of conservative areas as well.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Keeping the country safe is the government's overriding priority"" Up to a fifth of the workforce may be off sick during the peak of a coronavirus epidemic in the UK, the government says inits latest plans.,external Police may need to focus on only the most serious crimes and maintaining public order if the virus spreads. The military could also provide support to emergency services if needed. The government's response is in its first stage - containing the outbreak - with the number of UK cases rising from 39 to 51 on Tuesday. Out of the positive cases, 12 people have since recovered. Eight charts on how coronavirus has hit the global economy It is ""highly likely"" the UK will see further infection, the prime minister has warned, and the next phase of government contingency planning will be to do with delaying the spread of the virus. If the coronavirus, which causes Covid-19, becomes widespread, some non-urgent hospital care may be delayed to focus on treating those who are infected, while recently retired doctors and nurses may be called back to work. Other possible measures include school closures, reducing large-scale gatherings and working from home. HOW IS THE UK PLANNING FOR AN OUTBREAK:How prepared are we? WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?A simple guide HOW TO SELF-ISOLATE:What you need to know WHERE ARE WE WITH A VACCINE?Progress so far A VISUAL GUIDE TO THE OUTBREAK:Virus maps and charts Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that widespread transmission of the virus across the UK was becoming ""more likely"" and urged people to ""act on official medical advice"". Meanwhile, 12 new cases of coronavirus have been announced in England, eight of whom had travelled from Italy, and one each from Germany, Singapore, Japan and Iran. The patients are from London, Hampshire, Northamptonshire, Bury, Wirral, Greater Manchester and Hull. Consultancy firm Deloitte said one of its employees had tested positive for the virus after returning from Asia. A spokesman said one of the floors in its UK offices was affected. A British woman has also been diagnosed with the virus at a hotel in Tenerife that was hit by an outbreak of the virus last week. About 90,000 people have been infected globally since the outbreak of Covid-19, with cases in more than 50 countries and more than 3,000 deaths. A British man who was infectedon the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japanbecame the first UK citizen to die from the virus last week. The Queen wore gloves as she awarded the CBE to actress Wendy Craig The Queen was seen wearing white gloves when she carried out an investiture at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday. The palace would not confirm if the decision was linked to the coronavirus outbreak. It's a finely balanced judgement - not wanting to scare the public but being straight with them about what might happen and how intervention to limit the spread of the virus might affect their everyday lives. The government has chosen to make no secret of its assumption that things could well get significantly worse - after all the coronavirus plan published today is entitled ""a guide to what you can expect across the UK"". If medical experts are assuming widespread transmission of the virus ministers can hardly hide that from the public. Preparing secret contingency plans for school closures and then risking an uncontrolled leak might worry people more. The plan, though, contains few details of how new powers might be used and how the NHS might find the beds and staff to cope with an increased number of very sick patients. In the weeks ahead there will be increasing questions about the measures which have been flagged up with the launch of the plan. While the vast majority of patients in the UK will have a mild to moderate illness, similar to seasonal flu, a minority will require hospital care and a small proportion could die, the government's plans warn. There are no estimates given in the plans but they do warn of an increase in deaths, particularly among the elderly and those with existing health conditions. Young children can become infected and ""suffer severe illness"", but overall the illness is less common in the under-20s. It is possible an outbreak could come in multiple waves, the government said. Wales' chief medical officer has suggested cases of coronaviruscould increase from April with a peak in May or June.

There arefour stages to the government's response, which also includes mitigating the impact of the virus once it becomes established and a research programme to improve diagnostics and treatment for the disease. Boris Johnson reiterated on Tuesday that the ""single most important thing"" people could do was wash their hands with soap and hot water for the length of time it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice. He added: ""I want to stress that for the vast majority of the people of this country, we should be going about our business as usual."" This video can not be played Do face masks work? And other coronavirus questions answered Mr Johnson said schools should stay open ""if possible"" and follow advice from Public Health England. Meanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has ordered Treasury officials to work up plans to support the public health response, businesses and the economy in his Budget on 11 March. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has said Labour would seek to work ""constructively"" with the government. However, he has called for emergency legislation to ensure those working in the gig economy are guaranteed sick pay, and for the government to provide emergency funding to support the NHS through the outbreak. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has warnedthe NHS was already at 94% bed occupancybefore coronavirus hit. Mr Hancock told MPs that people who needed to self-isolate to protect others were entitled to sick pay. He added that resources had been increased to the NHS, but did not rule out the government taking future action if needed. In other developments: European markets have climbed for a second dayafter fears over coronavirus affected shares, and Bank of England governor Mark Carney said policymakers stand ready to support the British economy Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said there were currently no plans to postpone the London Marathon nor to restrict public transport England's Six Nations game against Waleson Saturday and Scotland's against France on Sunday will go ahead, however England prop Mako Vunipola has gone into self-isolation as a coronavirus precaution and will not join the squad UK supermarkets have said they have ""well-rehearsed contingency plans"" to deal with the outbreak and ensure continued availability in stores. G7 finance ministers have saidthey will use ""all appropriate policy tools""to tackle the economic impact of the virus TheTokyo 2020 Olympic Games could be postponedto the end of the year, according to the country's Olympic minister As of Tuesday morning, the Department of Health said 13,911 people had been tested in the UK, of which 13,860 were negative. The outbreak originated in China's Hubei province in December before spreading globally. The battle plan stops short of predicting how many people would be infected in an epidemic in the UK. Worst case scenario modelling suggests 80% of people can become infected when there is a new virus like this. But officials believe it will not be this high. The evidence suggests just over half of people infected develop symptoms and 1% of those infected could die. The elderly and those with existing health conditions are the most at risk. If there is a widespread transmission - which seems highly likely at this stage - it could take two or three months to peak. The peak would last two or three weeks and about 50% of people who become infected could become infected in those peak weeks. There would then be a period of two or three months of declining cases, although the battle plan acknowledges there could be multiple waves. The government is likely to use its most drastic measures at its disposal just ahead of the peak in an attempt to flatten it. What questions do you have about the UK's preparations?

anti-Sanders candidate, heâs also the anti-Trump candidate. For Democratic
voters for whom beating Trump is the number one goal, Biden, not Sanders looks
like the most viable candidate. As rumours fly that Michael Bloomberg may drop out on Wednesday, let's take a look at what his nearly half billion dollars of personal campaign contributions could have bought. The billionaire ex-New York City mayor is the ninth richest man in the world, and has spent $464m on his campaign so far, according to federal campaign filings. For that money he could have: Democrats aren't the only ones hosting primaries on Super Tuesday - Republicans have had their say too. Technically, the president isn't running uncontested for the Republican nomination. Former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld is also on the ballot, but his candidacy is a long-shot, as a brief scroll through Trump's Twitter feed shows. Without calling each other out by name, both Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden have criticised each other. Watch as they trade political blows - over the Iraq War and general election electability - in their speeches tonight. This video can not be played Super Tuesday: Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden trade punches We're still waiting for projections for three states: massive Texas and California, as well as tiny Maine. And we're still awaiting the full results in almost every state. Remember, the aim for all candidates is to win1,991 delegates, a different amount of which are awarded in each state, and according to how well each candidate has performed. With that target in mind, this is how many delegates each candidate has so far:  We are a long, long way away from this being resolved. Voters line up outside a library in Burbank, California The Bernie Sanders campaign is asking a judge to grant an emergency injunction to keep polling stations open in Los Angeles county due what they describe as long queues of waiting voters. Voters, their suit claims, have waited for up to four hours to vote at ""multiple"" voting locations. California has made strides to make voting as accessible as possible, according to the BBC's Sophie Long in Los Angeles. Some polling stations, which have been open since last week, allow for 24-hour voting. And across the city, public transit has been made free to allow voters to more easily get to their polling station. Biden is projected to win Massachusetts, which has 91 delegates. It's an embarrassing loss for Elizabeth Warren, one of the state's current US senators. Sanders was expected to do well, and he is projected to take second place, leaving Warren in a dismal third on home turf. It's been a bad night for the former mayor of New York. Michael Bloomberg has spent more than half a billion dollars of his own fortune and so far has only a win in American Samoa to show for it. Talking to supporters in Florida, however, he insisted he was still the candidate who could beat Donald Trump. And instead of despair in the face of defeat, he turned to humour (possibly with help from a teleprompter). We'll let you decide if Bloomberg did better with jokes than votes. This video can not be played Watch Bloomberg joke about Trump's golf and brainpower. California is the prize tonight's Democratic presidential hopefuls all want to take home. The state has a massive 415 delegates up for grabs. Sanders currently has an edge in the state - as expected, given his success with Latino voters, who are a key California voter demographic. Early polls also show Sanders with a major lead over his rivals among young voters. The Associated Press has already called the state for Sanders, though polls closed just minutes ago. Marianna BradyBBC News Over the day, we've been introducing you to young Democrats voting in 2020. The fourth isPaige Thielke, 17, from California. Although she was too young to vote in todayâs primary, she will take part in Novemberâs general election. Whatâs at stake in this election? A lot, not just because it could bring about a change in government, but because the world is at a crossroads. Far-right, nationalistic political movements have been gaining popularity all around the world, and the climate crisis is only getting worse. Whoever becomes the president will have to deal with those issues, and after almost four years of Trump, itâs pretty clear how he would address those issues. Do you know who you are voting for? If not, what will decide your vote? While I understand the appeal of Bernie Sanders, who is by far the favorite candidate among many of my friends and fellow high school students, his reputation as being disliked by his fellow senators and the drastic nature of his policy proposals doesnât make me feel like he could work across the aisle to get stuff done during his presidency. Because of that, my support tends to lean more towards moderates, even though the majority of them in the race arenât ideal options. What should someone outside the US know about your state that makes it unique? California has the unique quality of being generally known across the world. But 40 million people live here (a bigger population than Canada), and there is no typical âCalifornianâ. While the entertainment industry is certainly big, the Central Valley also produces 13% of all agricultural products in the US. Itâs the most diverse state in the country, and is diverse not only in terms of race, but socioeconomic status, cultural experience, etc. So while the majority of voters do lean liberal, there are plenty of conservative areas as well.

"The Ring doorbells use both cameras and motion sensors to detect when someone approaches Amazon keeps records of every motion detected by its Ring doorbells, as well as the exact time they are logged down to the millisecond. The details were revealed via a data request submitted by the BBC. It also disclosed that every interaction with Ring's app is also stored, including the model of phone or tablet and mobile network used. One expert said it gave Amazon the potential for even broader insight into its customers' lives. ""What's most interesting is not just the data itself, but all the patterns and insights that can be learned from it,"" commented independent privacy expert Frederike Kaltheuner. ""Knowing when someone rings your door, how often, and for how long, can indicate when someone is at home. ""If nobody ever rang your door, that would probably say something about your social life as well."" She added that it remained unclear how much further ""anonymised"" data was also being collected. ""This isn't just about privacy, but about the power and monetary value that is attached to this data."" Amazon says it uses the information to evaluate, manage and improve its products and services. The BBC originally made the data subject access request (DSAR) in January to tie into a wider investigation into the ways Amazon gathers and uses information about its customers. Find out how Bezos built his data machine At that point, the firm declined to elaborate on what information was collectedbeyond its privacy notice's mentions,externalof ""data about your interactions"", ""device characteristics"" and other such inexact terms. The records ultimately provided ran from 28 September 2019 until 3 February 2020. A Ring 2 Video Doorbell was in use over all this time, and a Ring Indoor Cam was added to the account over the final fortnight. Over the period, there were 1,939 individual ""camera events"" documented. These included: a motion being detected by the cameras' sensors a ""ding"" of the doorbell, when its button had been pressed by a visitor a remote ""on-demand"" action by the user to get a live video and audio feed and/or remotely speak to a visitor A sample of the ""event"" database, which has been edited to obscure the device IDs In each case, the length of time the equipment was activated was also logged. Ring says its camerasuse face and body-shape analysis to help differentiate between humans and other living things,externalin order to minimise false alarms. However, there was no indication of different types of motion being detected in the shared data. The largest database provided documented every interaction with Ring's apps. It listed 4,906 actions over the 129-day period. These included: every time the app was opened whenever the user ""zoomed in"" via a finger-pinch to view the footage more clearly a variety of different-classed screen taps details of the start and end to each live-view In each case, the model of device used, the version of its operating system, the type of mobile data-connection involved and network supplier were all listed. Ring's app allows you to review past footage as well as see a live-view from the camera Among other records were the details of the latitude and longitude co-ordinates of the two devices, provided to 13 decimal places. In theory, this would pinpoint where the products had been installed to the nearest 0.00001mm. Amazon: How Bezos built his data machine Amazon Ring workers fired for accessing user video Ring doorbell makes two-factor verification mandatory When checked via an online tool, the readings corresponded to the right property. However, since the same co-ordinates were given for both devices - which were based in different parts of the building - it appears that Amazon does not know the products' locations to this degree of precision. In total, 11 databases were shared containing close to 26,500 individual fields. Ring's privacy notice indicates that other data is also collected for analysis, which is anonymised so that it cannot be linked back to individual accounts. Ring offers a range of security cameras for use inside and outside the home ""Data access requests only ever show us the tip of the iceberg of the amount of data that companies collect about us,"" commented Ms Kaltheuner. ""There's huge value - and power - in collecting non-personal data for all sorts of purposes: market research, training and AI. ""Even anonymous data can have privacy implications, for instance about the collective privacy of, say, a housing block, a group of people, or a household unit."" No video files were included in the DSAR response. Ring justified the omission on the basis that its app already makes it possible to download the clips for up to 30 days if the user had a paid subscription. After that time, the company said each recording was permanently deleted. It added that if a user did not subscribe to a plan then Ring did not keep any recordings. Amazon's retail operation and its Ring subsidiary operate under different data controllers. The BBC asked if the two might ever make their records available to each other to make it possible to make joint use of the information - for example, using Ring's data to see when a family was typically at home in order to help schedule package deliveries. However, the firm declined to respond.

"Facebook is reportedly rethinking its plans for its own digital currency after resistance from regulators. It is now considering a system with digital versions of established currencies, including the dollar and the Euro, according to Bloomberg and tech site The Information. The Libra Association, which Facebook founded to create the currency, will continue its work, the reports said. The plan will include Libra, the company said in response. The social network's digital wallet is now expected to launch this autumn, several months later than initially planned, according to the reports. Of earlier reports that it might drop Libra itself, the firm said: ""Facebook remains fully committed to the project."" Facebook announced in June last year that it would launch the Libra digital currency, with a goal of making payments easier and cheaper. Its partners in the Libra Association include Lyft, Spotify, Shopify, but several other high-profile members such as Visa left after the idea was criticised by authorities. Dante Disparte, head of Policy and Communications at the Libra Association said: ""The Libra Association has not altered its goal of building a regulatory compliant global payment network, and the basic design principles that support that goal have not been changed nor has the potential for this network to foster future innovation."" In October, the world's biggest economies warned cryptocurrencies such as Libra pose a risk to the global financial system. France has said it threatens the ""monetary sovereignty""of governments; others have warned it could be abused for money laundering and other nefarious purposes.

"This video can not be played What unites these two bitter rivals? Joe Biden has won nine of the 14 states that voted to pick a Democratic White House candidate on Super Tuesday, a remarkable rebound for his campaign. The former US vice-president overturned predictions to narrowly take the key state of Texas from his main challenger, Bernie Sanders. However, Mr Sanders is projected to win California - the biggest prize of the night - as well as three other states. They lead the race to face Republican President Donald Trump in November. Super Tuesday: The winners and losers How the big night unfolded Super Tuesday results in full Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg spent more than $500m (Â£390m) of his own money on his campaign, but did not win a single state. And Senator Elizabeth Warren, once the frontrunner in the race, suffered a humiliating defeat to Mr Biden in her home state of Massachusetts. Super Tuesday awards more than 1,300 of the 1,991 delegates needed to clinch the Democratic White House nomination in July. As things stand, Mr Biden has 402 delegates and Mr Sanders 314. However, results from California, which has 415 delegates, could affect the current standing. Only last month, Mr Biden's campaign was all but written off by some observers after he finished a poor fourth in the Iowa caucuses and fifth in the New Hampshire primary. But on Tuesday, Mr Biden won Texas - the second biggest state with 228 delegates - along with Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia. Maine, which has 24 delegates, is also yet to declare but partial results put Mr Biden slightly ahead of Mr Sanders. Virginia and North Carolina are crucial because they are key swing states in the 2020 election. What are primaries and how do they work? Exit polls across the board suggested Mr Biden - who was vice-president to Barack Obama - attracted large majorities of African-American voters, a crucial bloc for the Democratic party. Mr Biden, 77, also appears to have won among the type of suburban voters who pollsters say have been turning away from the current US president. ""We are very much alive,"" Mr Biden told a crowd in Los Angeles. ""Make no mistake about it, this campaign will send Donald Trump packing."" If Mr Sanders, 78, does win California, as the Associated Press news agency projects, he will pick up the lion's share of the whopping 415 delegates that the Golden State sends to the party convention. US election 2020 : All you need to know The left-wing senator also won his home state of Vermont, along with Colorado and Utah. Mr Sanders had been heavily favoured to win Texas, but it was finally claimed by Mr Biden. In a victory speech, Mr Sanders lambasted Mr Trump, but also took a shot at Mr Biden. ""We're taking on the political establishment,"" he said. ""You cannot beat Trump with the same-old, same-old kind of politics."" The next primaries take place on 10 March in Michigan, Washington state, Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri and North Dakota, with 352 delegates available. Joe Biden came into Super Tuesday hoping his momentum from a surprisingly big South Carolina win would translate into a strong showing in some of the Super Tuesday states and allow him to keep within sight of Bernie Sanders in the delegate count. By that metric, his evening succeeded beyond his best expectations. His support among black voters, which was on display in South Carolina, was replicated across the South and helped offset Bernie Sanders' strength with Hispanic voters in Texas. The endorsements mattered too - in Dallas on Monday, he had the support of Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke, and he ended up greatly over-performing his polls in that state and winning Klobuchar's Minnesota. But now the hard work begins. He is in for a state-by-state slog against Mr Sanders that could stretch all the way to the Democratic National Convention in July. He'll have to fundraise and organise rapidly to make up for the Vermont senator's advantages. Meanwhile, Republicans are going to start training their fire on him - again. If he ends up winning the nomination, after being left for dead just a few weeks ago, he will have earned it. Ms Warren, 70, lost to Mr Biden in Massachusetts despite the fact that he did not campaign in the state or spent money advertising there. Mr Bloomberg, 78, could only pick up a consolation win in the tiny US territory of American Samoa. He did, however, garner enough votes in California and Texas to pick up delegates, according to incomplete results. Mr Bloomberg was appearing on a presidential ballot for the first time after skipping all four contests last month.

"US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin led a conference call with finance chiefs from other major economies Finance ministers from the G7 group of nations have said they will use ""all appropriate policy tools"" to tackle the economic impact of coronavirus. The group of major economies said in a joint statement they were monitoring the outbreak and ready to deploy ""fiscal measures"". It follows warnings the economic impact could tip countries into recession. On Tuesday, Bank of England boss Mark Carney said the virus could produce a ""large"" but temporary hit to UK growth. Central bankers and finance ministers from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US held a conference call on Tuesday, led by US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and US Federal Reserve boss Jerome Powell. ""Given the potential impacts of Covid-19 on global growth, we reaffirm our commitment to use all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth and safeguard against downside risks,"" they said. ""Alongside strengthening efforts to expand health services, G7 finance ministers are ready to take actions, including fiscal measures where appropriate, to aid in the response to the virus and support the economy during this phase.

""G7 central banks will continue to fulfill their mandates, thus supporting price stability and economic growth while maintaining the resilience of the financial system."" On Monday, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) warned the global economy could grow at its slowest rate since 2009 this year because of the virus. The influential think tank forecast growth of just 2.4% in 2020, down from 2.9% in November, but it said a longer ""more intensive"" outbreak could tip many countries into recession. There were also sharp falls on global stock markets last week as factory activity in China contracted. Mark Carney expects 'disruption not destruction' Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Carney told MPs that the virus was ""beyond the containment phase"", before adding the economic effects in the UK could last up to six months. But he said he expected to see ""disruption not destruction"" and added that the Bank was ready to help businesses and households adjust. Mr Carney hands over his role to Andrew Bailey on 16 March, and said the two had been in constant contact in order to have a smooth transition. Stock markets have rebounded this week amid signs that governments and major central banks will work together to tackle the economic hit of coronavirus. The US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan have said they are ready to help stabilise markets, after the recent volatility. And both Australia and Malaysia cut interest rates on Tuesday as a result of the outbreak. The Reserve Bank of Australia cut rates to a record low of 0.5% because of the ""significant effect"" of the outbreak on the country's economy.
