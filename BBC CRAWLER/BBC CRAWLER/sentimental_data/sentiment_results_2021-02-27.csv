"Demonstrators are calling for a rise in the US minimum wage - but it will be difficult to get through Congress President Joe Biden's $1.9tn (Â£1.4tn) relief plan to help Americans during the Covid pandemic has been approved in the House of Representatives. The vote was along partisan lines. Two Democrats joined Republicans - who see it as too expensive - in opposing it. The bill must now go to the evenly-divided Senate, which has already blocked a key element - doubling the US minimum wage to $15 an hour. The package seeks to boost vaccinations and testing, and stabilise the economy. Biden's Covid stimulus plan: It costs $1.9tn but what's in it? Can Biden succeed in economic rescue mission? How the pandemic has changed the world economy The cash would be extended as emergency financial aid to households, small businesses and state governments. Unemployment is close to 10%, with some 10 million jobs lost in the pandemic. The vote comes in the same week the US passed 500,000 coronavirus-related deaths - the largest figure of any nation in the world. In brief remarks at the White House on Saturday, President Biden hailed the House's approval of the plan, saying he hoped it would receive ""quick action"" at the Senate. ""We have no time to waste,"" he said. ""If we act now, decisively, quickly and boldly we can finally get ahead of this virus, we can finally get our economy moving again. And the people in this country have suffered far too much for too long. We need to relieve that suffering."" Joe Biden had appealed for bipartisan unity when he took office last month, but there was little on show in the early hours of Saturday when the Democrats scraped the bill through on a 219 to 212 vote. President Biden has championedwhat he calls the American Rescue Plan,externalas a way to help struggling Americans through Covid-19. But Republicans say the plan is unnecessarily large and stuffed with Democratic priorities unrelated to the pandemic. The divisions were reflected by the representatives. Democrat Brendan Boyle said: ""After 12 months of death and despair, the American recovery begins tonight."" The leader of the Republicans in the House, Kevin McCarthy, said: ""Democrats are so embarrassed by all the non-Covid waste in this bill that they are jamming it through in the dead of night."" This video can not be played The 'colourful' lives lost to Covid - how obituaries are helping us all mourn It is the third major US spending package of the pandemic, and actually not quite as big as Donald Trump's $2tn last March. The key elements include: A $1,400 cheque per person, although payments phase out for higher incomes Extending jobless benefits until the end of August to help the more than 11 million long-term unemployed Parents of children under the age of 18 to get a year of monthly benefits $70bn to boost Covid testing and vaccinations Financial support for schools and universities to help them reopen Grants for small businesses and other targeted industries Funds for local government One of the other major elements is the increase of the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour - where it has been since 2009 - to $15. But on Thursday, Elizabeth MacDonough, the non-partisan Senate parliamentarian - who interprets its rules - said that raising the minimum wage would violate the budgetary limits allowed in this kind of measure. Unemployed in the US: 'I don't know what to do The bill that passed in the House does still include the increase and it remains unclear how the issue can be resolved. The minimum wage rise remains a key Democrat goal, particularly for the party's progressive wing, and some top Democrats are considering a measure to penalise employers who pay less than $15 an hour. Republicans argue the minimum wage increase would be too heavy a toll on firms struggling to rebuild following the Covid-19 outbreak. Mr McCarthy has said the only way out of Covid is to ""fully reopen our economy"". The package goes to the Senate - spilt evenly between Democrats and Republicans 50-50 - probably next week. The rules of the Senate do allow a reconciliation bill like this to be passed on a simple majority, rather than 60-40. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said it would be ""catastrophic"" if no bill were passed In the event of a tie, Democrat Vice-President Kamala Harris gets the deciding vote. Traditionally, the text the Senate agrees then has to be reconciled with the House bill. The single bill is voted on again and passed to the president for signing. Democrats are confident a bill will go through, but the minimum wage issue is problematic. Senator Bernie Sanders was among those angry that ""archaic"" procedural rules were blocking the increase. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said a bill will still pass, even if this section is taken out by the Senate. Work will still need to be done with lawmakers to get a version of the bill over the line. The Democrats want it done by 14 March at the latest. How are other economies dealing with the downturn? Covid vaccine tracker: How's my country doing?

"A mortgage guarantee scheme to help people with small deposits get on the property ladder is set to be announced at next week's Budget. The government will offer incentives to lenders, bringing back 95% mortgages which have ""virtually disappeared"" during the pandemic, the Treasury says. Chancellor Rishi Sunak says public finances are facing a ""challenge"" from the pandemic's impact on the economy. The government has borrowed Â£271bn this financial year - up Â£222bn on 2019-20. This has pushed the national debt to Â£2.13 trillion. Explaining the government's economic response to the pandemic, Mr Sunaktold the Financial Times,external: ""We went big, we went early, but there is more to come and there will be more to come in the Budget. But there is a challenge [in the public finances] and I want to level with people about the challenge."" He added: ""I will do whatever it takes to protect the British people through this crisis and I remain committed to that."" Former Conservative chancellor Lord Clarke called for Mr Sunak to raise taxes in order to bring the UK's finances under control, and warned ""if we don't get it under control before inflation comes back then we will face a financial crisis"". What is the Budget and when will it happen? 'Furlough is a lifeline, I hope they extend it' Sunak injecting Â£126m to boost traineeship scheme The question of tax rises is one the chancellor will need to address when he unveils his Budget in a Commons speech on Wednesday. In the run-up to the 2019 election, the Conservatives promised not to increase income tax, National Insurance Contributions or VAT - but Mr Sunak could argue circumstances have changed. Carlisle MP John Stevenson, of the Conservative Northern Research Group, said it was ""too early"" for tax rises, saying UK still had a few months of the pandemic to get through and he wanted to see continuing support. But Lord Clarke said the pandemic had been ""unfair financially"" on ""the poor, the young, the low-paid, the vulnerable"" and suggested making people who continue in full-time work after the age of 65 pay the same taxes as younger people. Labour has criticised the government for a ""stop, start"" approach to support measures during the pandemic. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Doddstold the Times,externalher party did not support an ""immediate"" increase in corporation tax but would welcome longer-term rises and said she wanted a ""more progressive tax system"". The chancellor is also expected to announce anÂ£126m scheme for traineeships in England. It will include a new ""flexi-job"" apprenticeship, enabling apprentices to work with different employers in one sector. With unemployment at its highest level for almost five years, Mr Sunak said this was ""vital"" support for getting people back into work. Mortgage providers will only lend to those with a regular income, irrespective of any government incentive. But young adults' finances, and their employment prospects, have been hit hard by this pandemic. It was the same in the financial crisis of a decade ago. That is why jobs will be central to this Budget - both protecting them now and creating them in the future to aid an economic recovery. While the chancellor may be able to borrow fairly cheaply now to pay for that support, the prospect of future tax rises to foot the bill will no doubt be addressed too. Covid has led everyone to face the realities of home, work, and working from home. On Wednesday, many will be looking to Mr Sunak to save their jobs and keep a roof over their heads - whether they own it, or not. The new mortgage scheme is not restricted to first-time buyers or new-build homes, but there will be a Â£600,000 limit. The coronavirus pandemic has meant there are now few low-deposit mortgages available, the Treasury said, with just eight on the market in January. They are often seen as riskier by banks as they are more vulnerable to negative changes in property prices - meaning people hold more debt than their home is worth. Under the scheme, which will launch across the UK in April, the government will offer to take on some of this risk. It is based on the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme, whichclosed to new loans at the end of 2016, a policy the Treasury said ""reinvigorated the market for high loan-to-value lending after the 2008 financial crisis"". But housing charity Shelter said that schemeincreased house prices,externalby 1.4%. Shadow housing secretary Thangam Debbonaire also raised concerns, saying young people needed ""genuinely affordable"" new houses to be built and did not want to go ""back to the days of sky-high mortgages"". The new scheme could coincide with the expected end of a stamp duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland on 31 March - though this may yet be extended. 4 ways it may get harder for first-time buyers Help to Buy deadline extended amid Covid delays Did Help to Buy help first-time buyers? Next week's announcement is also expected to include a new Â£100m taskforce to crack down on fraudsters who have exploited support schemes, such as furlough. Tax officials have opened about 10,000 inquiries into suspected fraudulent activity, the government said. THAT PETER CROUCH PODCAST:What does a young player go through in order to make it to the top?

Hannah Ingram-Moore described her father as ""a beacon of light and hope to the world"". His other daughter Lucy Teixeira said: ""Daddy, I am so proud of you. You may be gone but your message and your spirit lives on."" The service for the 100-year-old, who raised almost Â£33m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, began with him being honoured by the military. Six Yorkshire Regiment members carried the Army veteran's coffin, draped in the union jack, and an honour guard fired three volleys. Captain Sir Tom Moore's funeral cortege was driven through the village of Marston Moretaine After the military honours, which included a flypast from a World War Two-era plane, his family followed the coffin into the crematorium for the private service.

The service opened with a rendition of You'll Never Walk Alone, which Capt Sir Tom recorded with Michael Ball and the NHS Voices of Care Choir. The celebrant conducting the funeral described him as ""a proud British veteran and a gentleman"". Following the White Cliffs Of Dover by Dame Vera Lynn, his daughter Lucy Teixeira told the service she was ""proud"" of her father. ""You always told us to put your best foot forward and that's what you did last year,"" she said. A version of the song Smile, recorded especially for the funeral by singer Michael Buble, was also played. Capt Sir Tom died with coronavirus earlier this month. Hero who gave a nation hope Honoured by The Queen Captain Sir Tom Moore's son-in-law Colin Ingram, granddaughter Georgia, grandson Benjie and daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore My Way by Frank Sinatra was heard toward the end of the service, as requested by Capt Sir Tom, who said he liked the line about ""having too few regrets to mention"".

The Army veteran's funeral was attended by just eight members of his immediate family, in line with Covid-19 restrictions John Maguire, BBC News Captain Sir Tom Moore's coffin was lifted from the hearse on to the shoulders of the six bearers from the Yorkshire Regiment in dignified silence. Then, from the north-west, came first the rumble then the roar of the engines of the wartime Dakota as it flew overhead in tribute through clear blue skies. Three volleys were fired by the 14-man firing party as the coffin was carried into Bedford Crematorium, followed by his two daughters and their families - people who would reflect and remember the cherished times they spent with their father and grandfather. On top of the coffin, draped in the union jack, were Captain Sir Tom's war medals, his knighthood medal, and a specially commissioned officer's sword. On one side was his regiment's motto ""Fortune Favours the Brave"" and on the other, his motto, ""tomorrow will be a good day"". The service lasted just over an hour, featuring music he had requested, and a specially-recorded version of the song Smile. And his picture on the order of service showed him doing exactly that. The service celebrated his life, and thanked him for his incredible contribution - to his family, and to the world. Capt Sir Tom with daughters Lucy Teixeira (left) and Hannah Ingram-Moore (right) The veteran had spent the last few months of his life writing a book which he had planned to publish just before his 101st birthday.

"A White Helmet rescues a child from a bombed building The British man behind the Syrian civil defence group, the White Helmets, found himself at the centre of a battle to control the narrative of the Syrian war. Russian and Syrian propagandists accused his teams of faking evidence of atrocities - and convinced some in the West. The battle for truth formed a backdrop to James Le Mesurier's sudden death in Istanbul in November 2019. With the setting sun reflecting in the water and the lights of Istanbul twinkling on the horizon, the wedding guests sat around lantern-lit tables: diplomats from several countries, military officers, journalists and activists who had flown in from around the world to see James Le Mesurier get married. A dashing former army officer in his 40s, Le Mesurier had made his name as the co-founder of the White Helmets - the group of several thousand young Syrian men and women who pulled survivors and bodies from the rubble of bombed-out buildings in rebel-held areas of the war-ravaged country. The woman he was marrying, Emma Winberg, once worked for the UK Foreign Office but had latterly been helping him manage the White Helmets. She was his third wife. The couple lived in a traditional white wooden house overlooking the Marmara Sea on Buyukada island, off the coast of Istanbul. The small island once had a reputation for hosting subversives and spies - Trotsky lived there in a similar wooden house a few years before his fateful meeting with the icepick in Mexico. These days it's popular with journalists, artists and those wanting to escape the chaos of the city. The wedding party, in summer of 2018, was held in the garden of the couple's home with the bride and groom dressed like old-fashioned movie stars. Le Mesurier was carried on the shoulders of his Syrian guests as they bounced him around in a traditionalaradasword dance - his face flushed and glowing. It was a romantic setting and it was obvious the couple was very much in love. But if you had been able to listen in to the guests, you wouldn't have heard the usual wedding chatter - the main topic of conversation among the champagne and canapes was the ongoing conflict in Syria. The war was always present - even on their wedding day. They found it impossible to separate their work and their private lives. Emma knew their future together wouldn't be stress-free. ""We often said, as bad as it gets, we will have each other. We knew it would be an adventure,"" she says. And after the fairy-tale wedding things did get bad - far worse than Emma could have imagined. In just 18 months, James was dead. Spoiler alert: This is the story told in the BBC's 11-part Mayday podcast -if you prefer to listen to the audio please click here, otherwise read on (this story is a 23-minute read) On 11 November 2019 at around 05:00, a worshipper on his way to morning prayers discovered James Le Mesurier's crumpled body lying on the cobblestones in a narrow alleyway in Istanbul. He had apparently fallen from the apartment above his office, three floors up. Emma was still asleep in their bed when the police banged on the door and woke her. Turkish detectives questioned her and took her DNA and fingerprints before forensically scouring the scene. There were concerns that Le Mesurier had also been murdered by foreign agents, like the Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi a year earlier, almost to the day. As the news of the 48-year-old's death broke around the world, lots of people - including many friends and associates - assumed he had been murdered. The White Helmets were a thorn in the side of the Syrian and Russian governments, bearing witness to the bombing and killing of innocents and posting the videos online. In Moscow the television news described his death as a ""purely English murder"" claiming he had been finished off by his ""MI6 handlers"" when he stopped being useful. Syria's President Bashar al-Assad later gave an interview where he likened Le Mesurier's death to that of Jeffrey Epstein, saying both men knew too many secrets to be allowed to live. The British government was quick to dismiss such allegations. ""The Russian charges against him that came out of the Foreign Ministry that he was a spy - categorically untrue,"" said Karen Pierce, the UK ambassador to the UN. ""He was a real humanitarian, and the world and Syria in particular is poorer for his loss."" Digging into his past it seems that at one point Le Mesurier did want to be a spy. After leaving the army he applied to join MI6 and - on paper at least - he looked a perfect fit. He aced the application process, but he was turned down at vetting; it took him months to recover from the disappointment. An old friend, Alistair Harris, describes Le Mesurier as ""Lawrence of Arabia-esque"" - an image friends say he liked to cultivate. He had a taste for the finer things in life, and lived in a series of homes on islands. During several years living in the Gulf, he would regularly travel into town from his home on Futaisi island, Abu Dhabi, standing at the wheel of a boat wearing a suit and brogues, his tie flapping in the wind. But he was never in the Security and Intelligence Services says Harris, a former UK diplomat who worked with Le Mesurier on several projects in the Middle East. The son of a decorated colonel, Le Mesurier earned a degree in international politics and strategic studies before graduating top of his class from Sandhurst military academy. Friends from that time describe him as an incredibly talented soldier, head and shoulders above the others in strategy and communications but ""too much of a nice guy for anyone to begrudge him it"". He spent the next decade in the Army but left after becoming disillusioned with the failures of the West to prevent atrocities in Kosovo, where he served as an officer. By 2004 he was working as an adviser to the new Iraqi government, but again he became exasperated by what he saw as wasted opportunities and money squandered on projects which failed to rebuild the country or win the support of its people. So when, in 2011, he was invited by Alistair Harris to move to Turkey and manage civil society projects across the border in Syria, he jumped at the chance. A democratic uprising, which the Syrian government had attempted to crush by force, had become a civil war, and government-run services were absent in rebel-held areas. As head of the Istanbul office of Harris's organisation, Ark, one of the projects Le Mesurier's took on focused on training young Syrians to act as firefighters, ambulance drivers and rescuers. Young men and women were already rushing in to help their relatives and neighbours whenever a bomb landed on a residential area, flattening apartments and trapping the residents inside - but often without the necessary skills. Le Mesurier felt that here at last was an inspiring Western-funded project. In a dark complex war, these were heroes: local people, instinctively trusted by their own communities, doing what they could in a time of crisis. He brought them all together in one organisation and got them professionally trained by the Turkish earthquake rescue specialists, Akut. White Helmets in training in Idlib (September 2016) One of Le Mesurier's colleagues at Ark, Shiyar Mohammed, remembers that before this vital training, volunteers would rush into a bomb site wanting to help, but without any idea what they were doing - which sometimes made things considerably worse. ""They hadn't even heard of things like maintaining an open airway,"" says Mohammed. ""Somebody with a neck injury would get picked up from his arms and legs and put on the back of a pickup truck."" Le Mesurier and his team pulled in funding from the British, French, Dutch, Japanese, German and Canadian governments: one of his talents was persuading diplomats to part with their country's money. Once the trainees returned to their neighbourhoods with their new civil defence skills, Le Mesurier began securing funding for equipment - shovels, medical supplies and hard hats. There weren't enough of the red helmets meant for firefighters, so they ordered white ones - and these helmets would eventually earn the rescuers their nickname. A White Helmet walks past the remains of a blasted building in al-Kalasa district of Aleppo (June 2016) But at Ark the White Helmets were just one of many projects and Le Mesurier wanted to focus on them exclusively, so in 2014 - with Harris's blessing - he set up his own not-for-profit organisation, Mayday Rescue. Speaking to the BBC in 2014, Le Mesurier described the rescuers as ordinary people: ""Former bakers, former builders, former students who... chose to stay with very little equipment, and at the beginning with no training whatsoever, to respond to bomb attacks, respond to shellings and to try to save their fellow Syrian civilians."" While rescue operations were taking place in Syria, Le Mesurier was in Istanbul, hundreds of miles away. The only way he could find out what was happening on the ground was by watching videos of the new trainees in action. So he equipped the White Helmets with Go-Pro cameras attached to their hard hats. Before long, films of the White Helmets' daring rescues were going viral on social media. You can still find them on their Facebook page: hundreds of videos showing men and women in fleece jackets digging, sometimes for hours, through rubble and blocks of concrete, to the sound of cries from those trapped below. Often they pull out corpses - many of them dead children, whose parents are seen wailing over their tiny bodies. Sometimes they manage to pull people out alive, dusty and blood-splattered, who are rushed into ambulances. This video can not be played White Helmet volunteers carry out a dramatic rescue of a girl trapped under rubble in 2017 in Damascus Much of the footage showed the destruction caused by Syrian and Russian war planes. The Syrian Air Force's weapons of choice were oil barrels stuffed with explosives - barrel bombs - which were dropped from helicopters on to rebel neighbourhoods. Occasionally the rescuers themselves can be seen weeping - a reminder that they are local people and that the victims were probably people they knew. One incident in Aleppo in 2014 was filmed in detail: It's night and a lot of people are panicking, frantically digging for their neighbours who are buried under concrete following an aerial attack. A woman caught in the rubble is rescued relatively quickly, but her two-month-old baby is still trapped under layers of debris. The White Helmets are filmed removing the concrete piece by piece until they can see the baby's head, butthey continue to dig until finally they can access the baby's body and a rescuer called Khaled Omar Harrah is able to pull him out,external. ""We saved a baby. It was an incredible accomplishment for all of us,"" says Shiyar Mohammed. He remembers it as a moment of elation, feeling that all their hard work and the training sessions had been worth it. But their joy was tempered by the realities of war. ""This was just one baby out of thousands and thousands of other babies who have died, who couldn't be reached,"" he says. Khaled Omar Harrah died in an air strike two years after rescuing this baby That scene of the baby's rescue had a huge impact in the West. It was the first time that a lot of people had seen the work of the White Helmets, and many were very moved. Le Mesurierexplained to the BBC that Khaled was a former painter and decorator,external, who became a civil defence volunteer after his own street was heavily bombed. The baby was under seven feet of concrete and the rescue took 19 hours to complete. ""The work that they do is absolutely humbling,"" he said. But for cynics, the baby-rescue drama seemed a little too slick. Could the whole thing have been stage-managed by Le Mesurier and the White Helmets to gain support and extra funding, they wondered? And in some more radical circles - where everything financed by the West was seen as tainted by an imperialist agenda - the White Helmets started being accused of producing propaganda to push for intervention in the war. The videos were not stage-managed but the rescuers were deliberately documenting what they believed were war crimes, including the indiscriminate bombing of civilian apartment buildings, markets, schools and hospitals. And while the White Helmets were not calling for Western boots on the ground, they were pushing for the declaration of a no-fly zone enforced by foreign governments. There is also no doubt that the videos were tremendously helpful for fund-raising. By the time a Netflix documentary about the rescuers won an Oscar in 2017 Le Mesurier's organisation, Mayday Rescue, was receiving millions of dollars from states around the world including the USA, France, Britain, Germany, Holland, Japan and Qatar. The money was used to run training camps for the rescuers and to send equipment across the border into Syria, including fire trucks and ambulances. Aleppo's White Helmets - life under siege,external Idlib 'double tap' air strike Russia says never was Filming beneath the rubble But the Syrian and Russian governments insisted that James Le Mesurier and the White Helmets were manipulating the truth. According to their account the Syrian state, with Russia's help, was protecting a loyal and grateful population from evil jihadists, some of whom were dressed as White Helmets. The Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad repeated these accusations in televised interviews and Russian diplomats began publishing what they said was evidence of the White Helmets using film sets to produce faked rescues. Two injured children - Omran and Aya - found themselves at the heart of this upside-down story of the war. In the summer of 2016 a Russian bomb fell on the Al-Qaterji neighbourhood in rebel-held East Aleppo. When it exploded it took out the home of the Dagnish family. When the White Helmets arrived on the scene they pulled five-year-old Omran from the debris along with his parents and baby brother. His older brother didn't survive. There's footage of little Omran, being carried by a White Helmet and put into the back of an ambulance. He's tiny and monochrome - covered head to toe in brick dust like a little grey ghost. He sits there, expressionless, utterly dazed. Omran's photo was on the front page of newspapers around the globe. Another child whose face appeared on our TVs here in the West, was a little girl called Aya. The eight-year-old was filmed in a hospital in Homs, in western Syria. She had been hiding under a table when the ceiling of her home collapsed on her. A week afterAya's story was broadcast on CNN,external, the Syrian president gave an interview to Swiss TV where he was confronted with a photo of Omran. Unflustered, he replied that Omran and Aya were just props, siblings being used by the White Helmets in fake videos. And he claimed the rescuers had used them not just once, but several times in different videos. When journalists (includingChannel 4,externalandFrance 24,external) looked into the claims, they found that they were false. Aya was confused with another child, pictured in the arms of three different people, but that was at a single rescue event where the pictures were taken moments apart. Journalists also tracked down witnesses, including Omran's father, who confirmed they had been involved in real bombings. Facebook post claiming a fake rescue In another ""discovery"" of fake videos, the Russian Embassy in South Africatweeted a photograph purporting to show the White Helmets mid-shoot,external, with dressing rooms in the background and a clapper board in front of the camera. The photograph was quickly identified as having been lifted from the set of a real film, called Revolution Man. A still from the Revolution Man film's website In a bizarre twist, the feature film, financed by the Syrian Ministry of Culture, was about a corrupt Western journalist who travels to rebel-held areas of Syria and finds himself helping the White Helmets to fake videos. The White Helmets in the photograph weren't actors working to discredit the Syrian state, they were actors workingforthe Syrian state. What the Russian and Syrian governments say about the war is unlikely to have much influence on most people in the UK, but they are not alone in spreading these stories about the White Helmets - a network of sympathetic Western bloggers and activists have amplified their ideas. The most prolific among them is Vanessa Beeley, a British diplomat's daughter who quit her job in manufacturing about a decade ago in order to highlight what she saw as injustices in the Middle East. Beeley began travelling to Gaza to report on the suffering of ordinary people there. She set up a citizen journalist blog and began posting articles about what she saw. When the war in Syria began in earnest she, along with a small group of other pro-Palestinian activists, became convinced that the uprising had been instigated by Western proxies. She soon turned her attention to the White Helmets, accusing the organisation of being a Western-created disinformation operation masterminded by a British spy - James Le Mesurier. She took up the allegation that they were faking videos, and also put great emphasis on the idea that they were jihadists, who had been taking part in executions. The Syrian state granted her visas and offered her government-guided tours of recently captured areas, where Islamist logos on the walls of White Helmets premises were pointed out to her. What Beeley's videos show is evidence that a variety of groups, some of them jihadists, have operated in the same areas as the White Helmets and possibly used the same buildings - not that the rescuers and Islamists ever worked together.

Nevertheless, there are other photographs and videos online that seem to show individual White Helmets supporting jihadists - from the so-called Islamic State group or the al-Nusra Front (al-Qaeda's representatives in Syria) - either cheering their arrival in an area, or appearing to assist in an execution by removing the body afterwards. ""There's no way to deny it,"" says Nur (not his real name) who helps manage the White Helmets' media online. ""Former volunteers were in pictures waving flags."" In the early days, in a few isolated cases, rescuers joined the White Helmets having left jihadist organisations, he says. In other cases individuals might have seen the jihadists as a possible solution to the bombs that were raining down on them from Syrian government aircraft - but he says the organisation quickly sacked anyone who showed such sympathies. Le Mesurier helped put a code of conduct in place which required independence from all armed groups, among other things, and all the rescuers were trained to understand its importance. As for the executions, Nur explains, one of the jobs of the White Helmets is to replace undertakers in rebel-controlled areas. ""Someone has to respectfully deal with the bodies and get them to their families,"" he says, adding that they were just informed when and where an execution would take place The White Helmets say their impartiality and adherence to humanitarian principles has been the secret to their survival as an organisation through so many years of war and in so many different areas with different groups in control. White helmets rescue an injured fighter in a Damascus suburb in 2017 ""There have been multiple different examples of White Helmets teams, responding to buildings, not knowing who is trapped inside, and they continue regardless,""James Le Mesurier told Dutch TV in 2015,external. ""They have rescued regime soldiers from under piles of rubble, and they do so neutrally and they do so impartially. For them what is important is saving a life. It doesn't matter who that life belongs to."" One video in 2016 left the White Helmets wide open to Vanessa Beeley's accusations of fakery. The mannequin challenge was an online fad where people pretended to be mannequins - frozen mid-action before suddenly starting to move, like a mannequin coming to life. The White Helmets had filmed a mannequin challenge of their own. In it they are frozen mid-rescue about to pull a young man out of the rubble. For their detractors this was further proof that the organisation were expert fakers. Speaking on the Russian state-funded channel Russia Today (RT), shortly after her first visit to Moscow, Vanessa Beeley called the video bizarre. ""Whatever reason the White Helmets had for doing this extraordinary event, we've seen a reaction that I believeâ¦ massively backfired on them,"" she said, adding that the stunt made a mockery of the suffering of the Syrian people. Listen to the 11-part Mayday podcast with Chloe Hadjimatheou on BBC Sounds When the whole scandal broke James Le Mesurier was furious. His wife, Emma, says she had never seen him so angry. ""He just thought it was the most stupid own goal. James was very frustrated because this would keep getting used and recycled on a routine basis by the White Helmets' antagonists."" I managed to track down the young Syrian who filmed the video. He wasn't a White Helmet - he was a media activist. He hoped the mannequin challenge might help people in the West connect to what was going on in Syria. It never occurred to him that it would be used as proof that the White Helmets' videos were fake. Vanessa Beeley is so convinced that the White Helmets are working for Western intelligence (and with Islamist militant groups) that she has even argued they are legitimate targets for the Syrian military. ""The White Helmets cannot be considered a humanitarian organisation, when they are embedded with a designated terrorist organisation al-Qaeda, and of course, ISIS and various other armed groups... They do not behave in any way like a humanitarian organisation inside Syria, and thereforeâ¦ they themselves are a legitimate target in a war situation,"" she said in an interview to UK Column News in October 2020, repeating a view she had expressed before. James Le Mesurier was horrified when he saw hertweet this idea,external. ""I don't really have words for it. It was clearly legitimising the targeting of civilians,"" says his wife, Emma. ""And the fact that Beeley was a UK national, and was hosted on Russia Today as an independent investigative journalist, put them at even greater risk."" Vanessa Beeley taking part in a joint Russian and Syrian presentation at the UN in December 2018 Even before Vanessa Beeley's comments, Syrian and Russian states had begun employing double and triple-tap strikes in what appear to be deliberate efforts to bomb the rescuers. After a bomb falls the planes circle around waiting for the rescuers to arrive at the sitebefore bombing a second timeand sometimes delaying again before bombing a third time. Almost a quarter of all the White Helmets - there were around 4,300 at the height of the war in 2016/17- have been killed or seriously injured in the course of their work; it's one of the most dangerous jobs in the world. But perhaps Vanessa Beeley's most bizarre claim is that James Le Mesurier was involved in an organ-harvesting racket. In 2018 she was invited to speak ata joint Russian and Syrian presentation at the United Nations,external, sharing the floor with a Russian researcher. Apparent witnesses were shown in videos being interviewed by the researcher and saying that they had seen the White Helmets return the bodies of injured victims back to their families with all their organs missing. It is impossible to know whether the people who provided these accounts were speaking freely, and no other evidence was presented. The White Helmets say they have never heard any such claims from anyone in the areas where they operate. White Helmets investigate a collapsed house in countryside west of Aleppo in February 2020 The accusation that Le Mesurier was involved in murder and organ theft might sound far-fetched but the fact that the ideas were presented at the UN gave them the veneer of officialdom. Misinformation about the Syrian war has become so ubiquitous it has resulted in what psychologists have called the ""illusionary truth effect"" where most people end up absorbing some of the false narratives, even on an unconscious level. When I first began looking into the White Helmets I had a feeling they were a bit dodgy, but I wouldn't have been able to tell you why or where I had heard that. All this was beginning to have a real effect on Le Mesurier. At one point, his colleagues say, when he tried to open a new bank account he was turned down because of concerns he might be involved in organ-trafficking. His wife Emma says he worried that after the war was over his reputation might be so damaged that he would never work again. Vanessa Beeley has denied being pro-Assad despite singing the praises of the presidential couple and the Syrian Army on social media. These days she lives in Damascus and drives around the city in a bright pink 1970s VW Beetle with a picture of Bashar al-Assad pasted in the back window. The pink VW with a portrait of Bashar al-Assad in the rear window She declined to give me an interview but we did exchange emails. She told me she is not incentivised by any government, that she is self-funded and that her concern is getting to the truth. She also made it clear that she believes the BBC is a mouthpiece for the British government and is engaged in deliberate anti-Assad propaganda. Beeley sometimes claims to have been a finalist for the prestigious Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism. But when I contacted a member of the prize committee, James Fox, he told me: ""There are no finalists of the Gellhorn Prize for Journalism, and no 'runners up'. The prize does not draw up or publish such a list. The judges publish only winners or special commendations."" There are other British Assad sympathisers. One is Peter Ford, the UK ambassador to Syria from 2003 to 2006, who says the White Helmets have faked all but a handful of rescues, have been involved in beheadings, and played a crucial role in the faking of chemical attacks - all of which he believes were hoaxes. He argues that the Syrian revolution was instigated by Western governments with the intention of toppling President Assad. Ford co-chairs the British Syrian Society with Assad's father-in-law, Fawaz Akhraz, who lives in London and has recently come under US sanctions as one of the state's ""enablersâ¦ in perpetuating their atrocities"". These days the organisation is seen by many as a propaganda operation for the Syrian leadership, though Peter Ford is at pains to make it known that he isn't paid by the society. He has also made it clear he believes the BBC was commissioned ""by Le Mesurier's handlers"" to whitewash the White Helmets. Peter Ford is a former UK ambassador to Syria Ford has shared a platform with The Working Group on Syria Propaganda and the Media, led by a group of British professors from some of the country's top universities, which also argues that chemical attacks in Syria have probably been faked. In 2020three members of the Working Group gave a presentation at Portcullis House,external, part of the Houses of Parliament complex, focusing on a chemical attack in the Damascus suburb of Douma in April 2018. It argued that dead bodies and gas canisters had been moved and manipulated in photographs that had been presented as evidence of a chemical attack, and that this staging would have required the active participation of the White Helmets. The Douma attack is one of the most contested events in the Syrian war, with both the Syrian government and their Russian allies claiming it was a ""false-flag"" attack, perpetrated by the rebels against their own side, so that the Syrian government would be blamed - and on this occasion the US, France and the UK did in fact respond with a punitive missile strike. (In the view of the Russian and Syrian governments, all the chemical attacks Syria has been accused of are Western-sponsored fakes. The Russian Embassy in London says the White Helmets ""have performed a number of cynical actions,externalaimed at discrediting the Syrian authorities and promoting the Western narrative centred around a regime change in Damascus. This includes fake and false-flag chemical attacks."") An investigation into the Douma incident,externalby the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) concluded - in characteristically careful language - that there were reasonable grounds to believe chlorine gas was used and that it was delivered from the sky, which would indicate it had been dropped by Syrian or Russian government forces, as no other parties to the conflict possess aircraft.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. But two members of the OPCW investigation team rejected this report, alleging that the US had pressured the organisation to reach this conclusion. They questioned whether the limited amount of gas that had apparently been dropped would have killed people where they lay, and also whether the canisters could have crashed through a concrete ceiling without showing more damage. The OPCW said these former employees had not been involved in the full investigation and had not had access to all the facts and independent reports. Despite this, the Working Group found the whistleblowers' arguments convincing - but then had to explain how the more than 40 victims who had been filmed at the location of the attack had died at the same time from the same cause. One of the Working Group's members, Prof Paul McKeigue of Edinburgh University - whose area of expertise is genetic epidemiology and statistical genetics - suggested that the most likely scenario was that the victims had been executed in a gas chamber and then carried to the apartment building and posed to look as if they had died there. I contacted the spokesman of the Working Group - a former professor from Sheffield University, Piers Robinson - who told me they did not accept that their assertions were conspiracy theories. He said their output was objective and rigorous and that they consulted widely when expertise outside their own research areas was needed. James Le Mesurier's wife, Emma, says attacks like these made during his lifetime were putting him under a great deal of stress. She believes it is likely that he was also suffering from trauma after years of watching distressing videos of the White Helmets' rescues. Most of those they pulled out of the rubble were already dead, including a disproportionate number of children. In making the podcast series Mayday I ended up watching dozens of these videos - there are hundreds on their Facebook page. This stuff sticks with you, and it left people like Le Mesurier's colleague at Ark, Shiyar Mohammed, traumatised. ""Because I was subjected to so much graphic footage and so much violence. I ended up with sort of basically horrific scenes stuck in my head. Instead of the victims, I'm imagining myself to be in their place,"" he says. There was a macho culture, Mohammed says, in which Le Mesurier and his colleagues saw themselves as too tough to be affected by all the horror of the war. Mohammed admits he was naive. By the time he left Ark he was no longer able to function in his daily life, suffering from panic attacks for three or four minutes every couple of hours. How close was Le Mesurier to experiencing this kind of trauma? I asked Emma about that and instead of answering me she showed me the photos and videos he had on his mobile phone when he died. There are happy times at home on Buyukada island, hanging out with his dog Balloo, and weekends spent entertaining his two young daughters from his previous marriage. But interspersed with all these domestic scenes are images the White Helmets sent him, of tiny shroud-wrapped dead children, videos of parents wailing over corpses, a lot of horrifying images of cruelty and death. And it wasn't just the horror of the war - it was the denial of all that horror that got to him. The Syrian and Russian governments were flipping everything on its head, as he saw it, and turning the war's heroes into villains. That's why, among all those awful images on Le Mesurier's phone at the end of his life there were also countless screenshots of online messages doubting whether any of it was true and calling him a liar, an organ harvester and a jihadist. In the end, though, it was misinformation from inside his own organisation that was apparently the final straw. Although Le Mesurier excelled in wooing donors, finances proved to be his Achilles' heel. He had never been across the books at Mayday Rescue, which was dealing with tens of millions of dollars a year - he left that to his colleagues. And it was the financial fallout following a major rescue mission that proved his undoing. James Le Mesurier (right) with the leader of the White Helmets, Raed Salah This time the people being rescued were the White Helmets themselves. In the summer of 2018, rescuers in the south of the country were caught between President Assad's forces and the Islamic State group. In a daring plan dubbed Operation Magic Carpet Le Mesurier organised the evacuation of 800 White Helmets and their families through three border crossings into Israel - a country which had been at war with Syria for decades. To make this happen he helped orchestrate high-level discussions with the governments of Canada, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as Jordan and Israel. The discussions continued at his and Emma's wedding, attended by some of the key players - a detailed plan was cooked up among the canapes and lamb shanks. Emma crafted a clever seating arrangement for the reception, grouping together people who needed to speak to each other. Five days later, Le Mesurier flew to Amman, Jordan, to help oversee the huge operation. He was in his element - all his talents in strategising, learned at Sandhurst and honed over his decade in the military, came into play. White Helmets and their families had been hiding for days in a town near the razor-wire fences and concrete watch towers that marked the disputed border with Israel on the Golan Heights. They had fled their homes as the Syrian military advanced on their towns. Fear of arrest and torture - they had seen videos of ""confessions"" colleagues had been forced to make - had them running with only the clothes on their backs, carrying crying, hungry children. Le Mesurier was determined to get them out. Finally, on 21 July 2018, just as the sun was setting, the Israeli military cranked open the huge metal gates at two of the border crossings to let the families through. A Russian airstrike inside Syria, seen from the Israeli Golan Heights on 23 July 2018 It had taken just a few weeks to mobilise the huge international operation but it wasn't fast enough. One exit route had already become too dangerous - in the previous days it had fallen under the control of Islamic State - and half of those they hoped to rescue didn't make it out. It is not clear what happened to these 400 people, but they were advised to burn their uniforms and hide. Senior members of the White Helmets told me they believe many of those left behind were captured and tortured or killed. Le Mesurier had managed to save 400 White Helmets, but at a huge political cost. Now he and the whole organisation appeared directly connected to Israel and his detractors - ever prone to see conspiracies involving the hidden hand of Zionism - had more fuel than ever. ""It was extremely frustrating, not just that there was this relentless personal attack on him, but that some people would believe it. I remember him saying, 'Will I ever work again after this?' So I think it was a huge strain on him,"" says Robin Wettlaufer, then Canada's Special Representative to Syria and one of the people who made the rescue happen. Le Mesurier returned to Istanbul utterly depleted. He hadn't slept for days and in this exhausted state he made a fatal mistake. To cover any expenses during the rescue mission Le Mesurier had withdrawn $50,000 in cash from Mayday Rescue's safe. In the event, he only spent around $9,000. Months after his return to Istanbul his head of finance, a Dutchman named Johan Eleveld, asked where the remaining cash had gone. James Le Mesurier couldn't remember. ""He might have lost it, he might have left it at the airport. He couldn't remember,"" admits his wife Emma. ""James had made a mistake."" A bookshelf in Emma Winberg and James Le Mesurier's home He would make an even bigger one. At a meeting with several senior staff members, including Eleveld, Le Mesurier took the decision to repay the missing cash out of his salary. But fearing he would look unprofessional if he publicly admitted he had misplaced such a large amount, he also decided to fake a receipt making it look as if he had replaced the unspent cash as soon as had returned from Jordan. In November 2019 an audit firm was checking operational changes at Mayday Rescue, with Johan Eleveld assisting them with their work. At some point they turned their attention to the organisation's cash books and came across the faked receipt. When they questioned Le Mesurier about it he immediately confessed. The audit firm also flagged loans and advances that had been taken by his wife, Emma, and warned Le Mesurier that he was leaving himself open to some difficult financial questions. Emma Le Mesurier says that their relationship with Johan Eleveld had been deteriorating for some time and he was avoiding their calls. Meanwhile, colleagues at Mayday Rescue say Eleveld was telling them the loan Emma had taken, which she had paid back within days, and the faked receipt amounted to fraud - and that there was a high chance Le Mesurier would face a prison sentence. Johan Eleveld said a non-disclosure agreement prevented him from talking to me, but in an email he denied saying that James might be jailed. Two nights before his death Le Mesurier wrote to the governments supporting the White Helmets saying that he took responsibility for any financial wrongdoing and offering to resign. The donors did not accept his resignation but said they would need a forensic audit and that would involve freezing Mayday Rescue's operations until a full investigation had been concluded. This meant the White Helmets' salaries, training and equipment would be withheld at a time when they were facing an escalating bombing campaign. Emma says Le Mesurier spent three tortured days believing that a stupid mistake he had made would result in harm and suffering to the most vulnerable people in Syria - those he had spent years trying to protect. He also believed that he would be publicly humiliated, and thought it was true that he might go to prison. Perhaps after years of fighting an increasingly personal disinformation campaign and seeing the brutality of war close up, James Le Mesurier was too tired to fight any more. The couple spent the evening of 10 November in their flat above the Mayday Rescue offices in central Istanbul. They had a difficult night. James went to bed and left Emma pacing the flat thinking. Around 04:00 he got up and offered her a sleeping pill and stood by the window smoking a cigarette, waiting for her to fall asleep. An hour later Emma was woken by police banging on her door. In the end, the Turkish police concluded that James's death was suicide. The detective in charge of the investigation told me a high-tech security system meant no-one else could have entered the apartment, and they found no evidence of a struggle. Six months later, an extensive independent financial investigation by Grant Thornton would conclude that Mayday Rescue's book-keeping was shoddy - but they could find no evidence of financial mismanagement or fraud by either Emma or James Le Mesurier. Trawling through years of correspondence, they unearthed emails from Le Mesurier to the finance department in the summer of 2018, soon after he had returned from the rescue mission. It turned out the money had never been missing. The emails show he kept the cash and asked the accountants to offset it from his salary. But he was so tired he had completely forgotten what he had done. Mayday Rescue went into administration in July 2020 and these days the White Helmets' finances are all managed by an American organisation called Chemonics - but as a commercial operation they charge considerably more for their services than Mayday Rescue did so the White Helmets get less of the funds. When someone kills themselves, that single act, that one moment in the thousands of moments that made up their life, ends up colouring everything. It inverts their biography so we look back at all they did through the lens of their death. And that is not always fair. James Le Mesurier was a man who lived several lives. He was a soldier, he was a Middle East traveller and an island dweller, a father and a husband and he was a humanitarian. And, like the people of Syria, he was a victim of disinformation. These days his wife Emma lives alone in Amsterdam, in an apartment they bought together on an island in the centre of the city. She spends hours sitting by a shrine she has built for James; a photograph of him, holding a bottle of wine with a cheeky lopsided smile, sits on top of the wooden box containing his ashes, surrounded by flowers and candles. ""I talk to him, and he talks back,"" she says, her voice breaking. ""He was an extraordinarily robust and resilient person. But he was exhausted and we were on the losing side. But I don't want to speculate on what James was thinking [in his final moments]. I don't think anyone has the right to do that.""

"This video can not be played Anas Sarwar: ""I'll work day and night to give you the Labour Party you deserve"" Anas Sarwar has been announced as the new Scottish Labour leader. Glasgow MSP Mr Sarwar defeated Monica Lennon, the only other candidate in the race. The contest was triggered afterRichard Leonard resigned as leader, saying it was in the best interests of the party for him to stand down. Mr Sarwar takes charge of the party ahead of the Scottish Parliament election, which is scheduled to be held on 6 May. Mr Sarwar, who is the first non-white leader of a major political party in the UK, got 57.6% of the vote, while Ms Lennon got 42.4%. Who is the new Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar? In his acceptance speech, he said: ""I want to say directly to the people of Scotland, I know Labour has a lot of work to do to win back your trust. ""Because if we're brutally honest, you haven't had the Scottish Labour Party you deserve. ""With rising injustice, inequality and division, I'm sorry we haven't been good enough. ""And I will work day and night to change that, so we can build the country we all need."" The election of Anas Sarwar is obviously important for Scottish Labour but it is a landmark in UK politics too. Never before has any major political party chosen a leader from a non-white minority ethnic group. That could afford Mr Sarwar a voice, an influence and a status as a role model well beyond Scotland. However, his primary job is to rebuild Labour in Scotland from their current position in a miserable third place, with Holyrood elections less than 10 weeks away. While his opposition to indyref2 for the whole of the next parliament offers clarity and reassurance to pro-UK voters, it may cause frustration among Labour-minded voters who support independence. That he is his party's 10th leader since devolution, the seventh since the SNP took over from Labour in the Scottish government in 2007 gives a clue to the severity of his challenge. Former leader Mr Leonard congratulated Mr Sarwar, calling for the party to get behind him. Ms Lennon also took to Twitter to congratulate the new leader, as well as thank her campaign staff and issue a call for party unity. She said: ""Congratulations to Anas Sarwar, our new leader. Proud to have been part of this positive leadership debate."" Lothians Labour MSP Neil Findlay told BBC Scotland that the prospect of another independence referendum remained the ""elephant in the room"" for his party. He said: ""We cannot rebuild the labour party taking a hard unionist stance, I don't think that is credible because that immediately writes off the 50% or so of the electorate who want a referendum. ""We need a clear, radical alternative based on maximum devolution and I would argue that should be the third option on any ballot paper in any future referendum."" On becoming the first non-white leader of a major political party in the UK, Mr Sarwar said: ""That doesn't say something about me. That says something great about Scotland and its people."" The move was welcomed by Scotland's justice secretary and SNP MSP Humza Yousaf. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Scottish Labour leadership race was short, and largely overshadowed by the Covid crisis, but was more cordial than previous contests the party has held. Scotland's constitutional future was one of the major features of the campaign, with both candidates repeatedly asked for their take on the issue. While both have said they are opposed to the idea of Scottish independence, Ms Lennon said that should a pro-independence majority be elected to Holyrood in May, the party would have to accept another referendum on the issue. Mr Sarwar, meanwhile, has urged independence-supporting parties to put the issue aside and focus on the recovery from coronavirus. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon congratulated Mr Sarwar and tweeted, ""he (and his dad before him) and I are long-time political opponents, but I also like and rate him. That may not always be obvious in the weeks ahead as election battle is joined, so worth saying so now."" Douglas Ross, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, also congratulated Mr Sarwar in a tweet and added: ""Yesterday I said @ScotTories will not support indyref2 or work with the SNP at any stage. I hope he will now do the same."" Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said Mr Sarwar faced a ""divided party"" on the issue of Scottish independence. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the new leader should concentrate on advancing UK federalism. He said: ""I am keen to work with Anas and his party to make reform of the UK a reality. "" Reacting to the announcement, trade unions have appealed for Labour party unity ahead of May's Holyrood elections. Who is the new Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar?

"Arfon Jones is stepping down as North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner at May's election A police and crime commissioner wants prisoners to be given cannabis behind bars in a bid to tackle addiction and curb violence.

He is standing down from his role overseeing North Wales Police after elections for a new commissioner in May. The Prison Service said it had a zero-tolerance approach to drugs.

It also highlighted a spot check by prison inspectors in Cardiff, who found 52% of prisoners said it was easy to get illegal drugs. The report pointed to concerns raised by HM Inspectorate for Prisons, which described the rise in the use of synthetic psychoactive drugs such as Spice as""now the most serious threat to the safety and security of the prison system"",external. Mr Jones said authorities needed to be ""addressing the causes"" of addiction and violence in prisons - especially the abundance of drugs such as Spice. The dangers of the synthetic drugs was highlighted by the case of 22-year-old prisoner Luke Morris Jones, from Blaenau Ffestiniog in Gwynedd, who died at HMP Berwyn in Wrexham in 2018. An inquest jury later foundthere had been a ""systemic failure"" in stopping drugs from entering the prison, contributing to his death. Luke Jones died at HMP Berwyn in Wrexham in 2018 after taking Spice Mr Jones, the Plaid Cymru police and crime commissioner (PCC), said he was also concerned about the levels of prescription painkillers given to prisoners, especially opioid-based drugs. ""If they are on opioids, why can't they be prescribed cannabis?"" he asked. ""Opioids are a damn sight more dangerous than cannabis. Let's supply cannabis in controlled conditions and see if offences reduce."" Drug overdoes spray trialled by North Wales Police Behind bars and addicted to Spice Mr Jones has been a long-time campaigner on the issues surrounding drug use and prohibition, andhas often backed calls for heroin injection schemesto provide safe, controlled environments for addicts. He previously saidit was a ""national scandal"" that people were ""dying needlessly""because governments had refused to acknowledge a radical new approach to drug policy was needed. Both the Welsh Conservative and Labour candidates vying for votes to take over his post in May have been critical of his latest idea. Tory PCC candidate for north Wales, Pat Astbury, said: ""There may be other ways to treat prisoners, using alternative medicines which are legal and mimic illegal drugs. ""One can't be seen to break the law at the expense of the force you are representing."" The HM Inspectorate of Prisons warned that psychoactive drugs such as Spice posed a ""serious threat"" behind bars Labour's Andy Dunbobbin added: ""There are lots of ways to prevent problematic drug use but this isn't one of them - prevention and treatment programmes in and out of prison should be strengthened and I'll work with partners, if elected, to do so."" He said the biggest issue was ""not drugs in prisons - it is drugs in society"" and called for ""decimated"" drug, alcohol and mental health service cuts to be rolled-back. Ann Griffith, Plaid Cymru's choice to replace Mr Jones, said a cannabis trial was ""something I would be willing to cautiously explore"" with criminal justice partners. ""Any such initiative would need to consider any unintended consequences and would need to be based on sound evidence and robust evaluation,"" she added. A Prison Service official said: ""We have a zero-tolerance approach to drugs and work closely with healthcare to support offenders through treatment and recovery.""

"A mortgage guarantee scheme to help people with small deposits get on the property ladder is set to be announced at next week's Budget. The government will offer incentives to lenders, bringing back 95% mortgages which have ""virtually disappeared"" during the pandemic, the Treasury says. Chancellor Rishi Sunak says public finances are facing a ""challenge"" from the pandemic's impact on the economy. The government has borrowed Â£271bn this financial year - up Â£222bn on 2019-20. This has pushed the national debt to Â£2.13 trillion. Explaining the government's economic response to the pandemic, Mr Sunaktold the Financial Times,external: ""We went big, we went early, but there is more to come and there will be more to come in the Budget. But there is a challenge [in the public finances] and I want to level with people about the challenge."" He added: ""I will do whatever it takes to protect the British people through this crisis and I remain committed to that."" Former Conservative chancellor Lord Clarke called for Mr Sunak to raise taxes in order to bring the UK's finances under control, and warned ""if we don't get it under control before inflation comes back then we will face a financial crisis"". What is the Budget and when will it happen? 'Furlough is a lifeline, I hope they extend it' Sunak injecting Â£126m to boost traineeship scheme The question of tax rises is one the chancellor will need to address when he unveils his Budget in a Commons speech on Wednesday. In the run-up to the 2019 election, the Conservatives promised not to increase income tax, National Insurance Contributions or VAT - but Mr Sunak could argue circumstances have changed. Carlisle MP John Stevenson, of the Conservative Northern Research Group, said it was ""too early"" for tax rises, saying UK still had a few months of the pandemic to get through and he wanted to see continuing support. But Lord Clarke said the pandemic had been ""unfair financially"" on ""the poor, the young, the low-paid, the vulnerable"" and suggested making people who continue in full-time work after the age of 65 pay the same taxes as younger people. Labour has criticised the government for a ""stop, start"" approach to support measures during the pandemic. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Doddstold the Times,externalher party did not support an ""immediate"" increase in corporation tax but would welcome longer-term rises and said she wanted a ""more progressive tax system"". The chancellor is also expected to announce anÂ£126m scheme for traineeships in England. It will include a new ""flexi-job"" apprenticeship, enabling apprentices to work with different employers in one sector. With unemployment at its highest level for almost five years, Mr Sunak said this was ""vital"" support for getting people back into work. Mortgage providers will only lend to those with a regular income, irrespective of any government incentive. But young adults' finances, and their employment prospects, have been hit hard by this pandemic. It was the same in the financial crisis of a decade ago. That is why jobs will be central to this Budget - both protecting them now and creating them in the future to aid an economic recovery. While the chancellor may be able to borrow fairly cheaply now to pay for that support, the prospect of future tax rises to foot the bill will no doubt be addressed too. Covid has led everyone to face the realities of home, work, and working from home. On Wednesday, many will be looking to Mr Sunak to save their jobs and keep a roof over their heads - whether they own it, or not. The new mortgage scheme is not restricted to first-time buyers or new-build homes, but there will be a Â£600,000 limit. The coronavirus pandemic has meant there are now few low-deposit mortgages available, the Treasury said, with just eight on the market in January. They are often seen as riskier by banks as they are more vulnerable to negative changes in property prices - meaning people hold more debt than their home is worth. Under the scheme, which will launch across the UK in April, the government will offer to take on some of this risk. It is based on the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme, whichclosed to new loans at the end of 2016, a policy the Treasury said ""reinvigorated the market for high loan-to-value lending after the 2008 financial crisis"". But housing charity Shelter said that schemeincreased house prices,externalby 1.4%. Shadow housing secretary Thangam Debbonaire also raised concerns, saying young people needed ""genuinely affordable"" new houses to be built and did not want to go ""back to the days of sky-high mortgages"". The new scheme could coincide with the expected end of a stamp duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland on 31 March - though this may yet be extended. 4 ways it may get harder for first-time buyers Help to Buy deadline extended amid Covid delays Did Help to Buy help first-time buyers? Next week's announcement is also expected to include a new Â£100m taskforce to crack down on fraudsters who have exploited support schemes, such as furlough. Tax officials have opened about 10,000 inquiries into suspected fraudulent activity, the government said. THAT PETER CROUCH PODCAST:What does a young player go through in order to make it to the top?

"Ray and Rosemary Scovell grew up in the same street and were well known on the Isle of Wight A woman has described the ""horrific"" anguish of losing both parents to Covid, just two weeks apart. Ray and Rosemary Scovell, from Sandown on the Isle of Wight, had been looking forward to their golden wedding anniversary when Ray, 76, fell ill. Their daughter Claire Apsey and grandson, Simon, said their grief had been compounded by lockdown. Mrs Apsey said she also felt ""guilty"" for being unable to give them the send-off they deserved. The couple grew up in the same street and were well known on the island after a lifetime dedicated to helping others. Mr Scovell, who was a hammer coach at Isle of Wight Athletics Club, set up numerous sports initiatives for schools and was responsible for bringing events, such as Parkrun, to the island. His 73-year-old wife supported his work, which included organising medals. Simon Apsey's grandparents were described as community-minded and always thinking of others Mrs Apsey said that throughout lockdown her father continued to encourage children to go running and sent out certificates to keep them motivated. He would also do errands for elderly neighbours, leaving shopping in their porches. ""They always wanted to do the best for people,"" she said. ""Always thinking of helping others."" The couple had been looking forward to celebrating their golden wedding anniversary this year In recent times, Mrs Scovell suffered from short-term memory loss so, on 8 January, when Mr Scovell was admitted to hospital, Mrs Apsey and Simon, 14, moved in to care for her. ""While Dad was in hospital, we were having to explain it to her, which is hard because she kept forgetting, and when Dad died she would forget so we would have to explain again,"" Mrs Apsey said, adding: ""She was heartbroken."" Although she was allowed to be with her father when he died, Mrs Apsey said she was ""gowned up"" and had to wear a face shield. ""It wasn't the ending we wanted,"" she said. Claire and Simon Apsey said their grief had been compounded by lockdown and isolation A little over a week after losing her husband, Mrs Scovell ended up in hospital after a fall. X-rays revealed she had inflammation on her lungs and she tested positive for Covid-19. She died five days later. Mrs Apsey said: ""She went very quickly. She had a pulmonary embolism."" She added: ""It's been horrific really... The hardest thing is not being able to share the grief."" Mr and Mrs Scovell helped thousands of young people through sport The funeral arrangements and contact with the solicitor, which had to be done via email, had also been ""so clinical"", Mrs Apsey said. ""When we had my dad's funeral, I felt so guilty there were only 30 people there,"" she added. ""It felt so wrong because my dad was so well known. We were inundated with cards and flowers."" She added they had both received ""the most wonderful care"" at St Mary's Hospital, which had given her and Simon ""great comfort"".

"This video can not be played Anas Sarwar: ""I'll work day and night to give you the Labour Party you deserve"" Anas Sarwar has been announced as the new Scottish Labour leader. Glasgow MSP Mr Sarwar defeated Monica Lennon, the only other candidate in the race. The contest was triggered afterRichard Leonard resigned as leader, saying it was in the best interests of the party for him to stand down. Mr Sarwar takes charge of the party ahead of the Scottish Parliament election, which is scheduled to be held on 6 May. Mr Sarwar, who is the first non-white leader of a major political party in the UK, got 57.6% of the vote, while Ms Lennon got 42.4%. Who is the new Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar? In his acceptance speech, he said: ""I want to say directly to the people of Scotland, I know Labour has a lot of work to do to win back your trust. ""Because if we're brutally honest, you haven't had the Scottish Labour Party you deserve. ""With rising injustice, inequality and division, I'm sorry we haven't been good enough. ""And I will work day and night to change that, so we can build the country we all need."" The election of Anas Sarwar is obviously important for Scottish Labour but it is a landmark in UK politics too. Never before has any major political party chosen a leader from a non-white minority ethnic group. That could afford Mr Sarwar a voice, an influence and a status as a role model well beyond Scotland. However, his primary job is to rebuild Labour in Scotland from their current position in a miserable third place, with Holyrood elections less than 10 weeks away. While his opposition to indyref2 for the whole of the next parliament offers clarity and reassurance to pro-UK voters, it may cause frustration among Labour-minded voters who support independence. That he is his party's 10th leader since devolution, the seventh since the SNP took over from Labour in the Scottish government in 2007 gives a clue to the severity of his challenge. Former leader Mr Leonard congratulated Mr Sarwar, calling for the party to get behind him. Ms Lennon also took to Twitter to congratulate the new leader, as well as thank her campaign staff and issue a call for party unity. She said: ""Congratulations to Anas Sarwar, our new leader. Proud to have been part of this positive leadership debate."" Lothians Labour MSP Neil Findlay told BBC Scotland that the prospect of another independence referendum remained the ""elephant in the room"" for his party. He said: ""We cannot rebuild the labour party taking a hard unionist stance, I don't think that is credible because that immediately writes off the 50% or so of the electorate who want a referendum. ""We need a clear, radical alternative based on maximum devolution and I would argue that should be the third option on any ballot paper in any future referendum."" On becoming the first non-white leader of a major political party in the UK, Mr Sarwar said: ""That doesn't say something about me. That says something great about Scotland and its people."" The move was welcomed by Scotland's justice secretary and SNP MSP Humza Yousaf. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Scottish Labour leadership race was short, and largely overshadowed by the Covid crisis, but was more cordial than previous contests the party has held. Scotland's constitutional future was one of the major features of the campaign, with both candidates repeatedly asked for their take on the issue. While both have said they are opposed to the idea of Scottish independence, Ms Lennon said that should a pro-independence majority be elected to Holyrood in May, the party would have to accept another referendum on the issue. Mr Sarwar, meanwhile, has urged independence-supporting parties to put the issue aside and focus on the recovery from coronavirus. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon congratulated Mr Sarwar and tweeted, ""he (and his dad before him) and I are long-time political opponents, but I also like and rate him. That may not always be obvious in the weeks ahead as election battle is joined, so worth saying so now."" Douglas Ross, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, also congratulated Mr Sarwar in a tweet and added: ""Yesterday I said @ScotTories will not support indyref2 or work with the SNP at any stage. I hope he will now do the same."" Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said Mr Sarwar faced a ""divided party"" on the issue of Scottish independence. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the new leader should concentrate on advancing UK federalism. He said: ""I am keen to work with Anas and his party to make reform of the UK a reality. "" Reacting to the announcement, trade unions have appealed for Labour party unity ahead of May's Holyrood elections. Who is the new Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar?

"Anas Sarwar has been elected the new leader of Scottish Labour, replacing Richard Leonard who led the party for three years. The Glasgow MSP takes over less than three months before the next Holyrood elections. Anas Sarwar became a member of the Scottish Labour party at the age of 16, but politics was already in his blood. His dad, Mohammad Sarwar, was the UK's first ever Muslim MP and held the Glasgow Central seat for Labour between 1997 and 2010  - until his son Anas succeeded him. Graduating from the University of Glasgow, Mr Sarwar worked as a dentist in Paisley for five years prior to becoming a MP. Anas Sarwar wins Scottish Labour leadership race The 37-year-old was the Glasgow Central MP from 2010 to 2015 and was firmly in the Gordon Brown camp of New Labour. Mr Sarwar took an active role in the pro-Union campaign leading up to the 2014 independence referendum, touring Scotland in a bus with No activists. Anas Sarwar and his wife Furheen in 2017 - the couple have three children together After the Glasgow Central seat was won by the SNP's Alison Thewliss in the 2015 general election, Mr Sarwar turned his attention to Holyrood and was elected a list MSP for Glasgow in 2016. As has often been the case for Scottish Labour in the last decade, the party faced a leadership election in 2017 after Kezia Dugdale quit and Mr Sarwar was pitted against Richard Leonard. It was a rancorous campaign and Mr Sarwar faced criticism over his children attending a fee-paying school in Glasgow, with questions also raised over hisfamily's cash-and-carry firm advertising jobs that paid less than the ""real"" living wageof Â£8.45 an hour. Sarwar to stand in Scottish Labour leader race 'Leonard's Labour leadership just wasn't working' Mr Leonard won the race, becoming the first Scottish Labour leader to come from the left of the party. The victory firmly reflected the party's membership make-up at the time; Mr Leonard was a firm supporter of the UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn whereas Mr Sarwar had signed a letter opposing Mr Corbyn's bid for re-election. Mr Sarwar's most high profile role as an MSP was as Scottish Labour's health spokesman and he played a key role in the concern over safety issues at Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital whichled to a public inquiry. Mr Sarwar congratulating Mr Leonard after his victory in 2017 after an acrimonious leadership contest Mr Sarwar will be the first non-white leader of a major political party in the UK and has spoken in the past about the racism he has experienced as a politician. This included death threats made against his family. Following his unsuccessful leadership bid in 2017, Mr Sarwar claimed that one councillor had told him Scotland would not vote for him because of his religion and the colour of his skin. A party investigation ultimately foundthere was no case to answerbut Mr Sarwar was critical of Scottish Labour's complaints system which did not allow him to give evidence at the hearing. In 2018, Mr Sarwar established the Scottish Parliament's cross-party group on tackling Islamophobia. In his pitch to party members, Mr Sarwar said he wanted to ""rebuild Scottish Labour, and then rebuild Scotland"". The Glasgow MSP has also taken a firm stance against the prospect of another independence referendum which he claims is not credible as the country rebuilds after Covid. The immediate concern for Mr Sarwar is May's Holyrood election where party strategists are hoping the new leader can lift them from third to second place in Scottish politics.

"A doctor receives his second dose of vaccine in Newbridge, Caerphilly county More than one million doses of the coronavirus vaccine have been administered in Wales, according to the Welsh Government. A total of 916,336 people have received their first dose, of which 89,053 have had a second jab, a total of 1,005,389. It means one in three of the country's adult population have received at least one dose. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said it was a ""fantastic testament"" to the hard work of staff involved in the rollout. He said it was an ""incredible marker"" in the 12 weeks since the rollout of the country's vaccination programme. Can Wales meet its Covid-19 vaccine targets? Q&A: When will I get my Covid-19 vaccine? Covid jab impact on serious illness 'spectacular' Mr Gething was in Barry on Saturday where he was ""delighted"" to be helping his mother get to her vaccine appointment. He added: ""It's a remarkable achievement in just a few short months, from a slower start building our infrastructure to really moving very, very quickly, ahead of [schedule]. ""I'm very confident we'll be getting through a million first doses in short order and completing the first nine priority groups by the middle of April."" Vaughan Gething took his mother to get her first jab on Saturday It means 29.1% of the Welsh population have had a first dose and 2.8% have had a full vaccination. Themajority of care home residentsand other target groups aged over 70 have had their first doses. On Friday, Wales' chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton saidpeople aged in their 40s will be next in line to get the coronavirus vaccine. Last week saw a stock of 46,000 Pfizer-BioNTech doses being used in Wales and another 56,000 Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines available.

The Durham Miners' Gala, one of the largest trade union-organised events in Europe,has been cancelled for the second year running because of coronavirus. The first gala was hosted in 1871 and the 150th anniversary event was due to take place on 10 July. Only world wars and strikes - the General Strike in 1926 and Miners' Strike in 1984 - have previously stopped the gathering from taking place. Easington's Labour MP Graeme Morris says the Durham Miners' Association feels there is not enough time to organise the event, assuming the roadmap for easing lockdown stays as it is. ""Reluctantly, they had to take this decision rather than commit time and resources. It's disappointing but I think it's wise,"" he says. ""A gala of 100,000 people would be terrible if it put people at risk."" A German radio host hasapologised after comparing K-pop group BTS to the coronavirus. Matthias Matuschik said he didn't intend to ""racially insult"" BTS - one of the biggest groups in the world - adding that making a connection between the band and Covid was ""completely wrong"". On Wednesday, during his show on Bayern3, Matuschik played the group's cover of Coldplay's ""Fix You"" on his show, calling it ""blasphemy"". ""For this you will be vacationing in North Korea for the next 20 years!"" he added. Matuschik then described BTS as ""some crappy virus that hopefully there will be a vaccine for soon as well"". Many took to social media to share their outrage at the comments. The station said the presenter ""overshot the mark in his choice of words"" and he did not intend to hurt the feelings of BTS fans. Matuschik said he accepted ""I could have racially insulted many of you, especially the Asian community, with my words"". ""That was never my intention, but I know that in the end it is how the words are received by the recipients - and not how they were meant,"" he added. Labour is accusing the government of ""burying their heads in the sand"" over May's local elections and warns there could be a major disenfranchisement of voters without further action. Deputy leader Angela Rayner says the government has to set out a ""proper plan"" to run the elections safely and is calling for a drive to boost postal voting. The government has already set out guidance for measures including mask-wearing and voters bringing their own pens to the polls. It says a ""comprehensive public information campaign"" will be launched soon. But Labour is warning of ""dangerously crowded polling stations"" and ""long queues"" on election day. Rayner says ministers have ""once again been too slow to act"", saying it is ""completely inexplicable"" they are not urging people to sign up to vote from home. ""With 10 weeks to go, we are yet to see a proper plan from the government setting out how these elections will be run safely while councils face shortages of electoral staff, lack of venues and funding uncertainty,"" she says.

Jade Juckeston said there was insufficient support when she was having trouble breastfeeding First-time mothers have been calling for extra support for those going through pregnancy and labour in the pandemic. ZoÃ« O'Donnell, who is due to give birth in May, is planning a home birth after two friends shared their ""traumatic experiences"" of giving birth alone in hospital. One of those friends is Jade Juckeston, who says she believes the level of care she received following the birth of her daughter Hazel has contributed to long-term problems with breastfeeding. She spent two days in Bristol's Southmead Hospital after giving birth in June - with her husband not allowed on the ward. She says there is not enough support from the midwives and nurses when she is having trouble breastfeeding. ""As a new mother you are in a vulnerable and emotional position. I felt really lonely and I know others in the ward did too,"" she adds. North Bristol NHS Trust has now increased some access for those attending maternity services with their pregnant partners. It says it has tried to balance partners' support with protecting people from Covid-19. Read more here.

A-list glamour will be in short supply - with no red carpet and nominees appearing from home. It highlights the impact of the pandemic on make-up artists, as well as hair and wardrobe stylists. Many have seen long stretches of downtime as the film industry has been temporarily shuttered. When they do work, it's nearly impossible to maintain social distance, so they must wear masks and get tested regularly. ""I love doing red carpet,"" says make-up artist Kimberley Bosso. ""It sucks that we can't do it and things are virtual now, but slowly we will get back to normal - we just have to be patient."" By Dominic Bailey ""I've tried to make a routine for myself as much as possible,"" Samantha says A Â£1,750 all-inclusive

something far less glamorous -hotel quarantine near some of England's busiest

quarantine applies to those who have visited or transited through countries on
the UK's ""red list"". âComing
from Dubai which is a very sociable place and having been a cabin crew manager...
going from everything to nothing is a very big shock,"" says Samantha. The 41-year-old is using her enforced solitude in a Heathrow hotel to study to become an

The couple had been due to celebrate their golden wedding anniversary this year A daughter has describedthe ""horrific"" anguish of losing both parents to Covid, just two weeks apart. Ray and Rosemary Scovell, from Sandown, on the Isle of Wight, had been looking forward to their golden wedding anniversary when Ray, 76, fell ill. Claire Apsey and grandson, Simon, says the family's grief has been compounded by lockdown. She says she felt ""guilty"" for being unable to give her parents the send-off they deserved, describing the funeral arrangements as ""clinical"". Mr and Mrs Scovell were well known for their work in the community. Her father was responsible for bringing sporting events, such as Parkrun, to the island - and was ably supported by his wife. When Mr Scovell was admitted to hospital in early January, Claire and her son moved in with her mum, who had developed short-term memory loss. ""When Dad died she would forget, so we would have to explain again,"" says daughter Claire, adding: ""She was heartbroken."" Barely more than a week after her husband's death, Mrs Scovell suffered a fall and, while in hospital, tested positive for the virus. She died five days later. ""It's been horrific really... The hardest thing is not being able to share the grief."" A woman who is deaf blind says she's been left feeling alone after giving birth during the pandemic. Bethany Fanthom, 27, gave birth to son Freddie on 11 March last year. She's calling for more support for disabled people's mental health and says she has felt isolated, with Covid restrictions cutting off most of her support. Ms Fanthom, from Halesowen, West Midlands, communicates with sign language and has tunnel vision - a loss of her peripheral view that makes it hard to watch her baby son while doing household jobs such as cooking and cleaning. While she lives with her fiancÃ©, his work keeps him away from the home most of the day. She says she has no one to speak to who's in a similar situation. ""I've not been able to meet any other moms with disabilities, nor have I been able to take my son on any play dates or outings,"" she says. ""Feeling isolated has had a huge impact on my mental health and physical health as I am forever reliant on my family for all my social needs."" The Sense charity is calling on the government to do more to support disabled people who it says have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. If you're just joining us, we reported earlier on the funeral of Captain Sir Tom Moore, who helped raise more than Â£33m for NHS charities during lockdown last year.

You may be gone but your message and your spirit lives on."" You can read a fuller version of the day's events here. Relatives of Captain Sir Tom Moore have spoken of their ""pride"" during his funeral. The service for the 100-year-old, who raised almost Â£33m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, began with him being honoured by the military. Six Yorkshire Regiment members carried his coffin, draped in the union jack, and an honour guard fired volleys. Below are some images from the day.

In early February, physicians in Amravati district, some 700km (435 miles) from India's commercial capital, Mumbai, noticed a sudden surge in the number of people suffering from Covid-19. Life in this cotton-growing district in the western state of Maharashtra had almost returned to normal after the first wave of infections last summer. The ICUs of the 1,600-bed state-run hospital and half-a-dozen private hospitals were nearly empty. ""But everything changed in February,"" says Anil Jadhav, a local journalist. ""And now there's panic in the district."" Since the beginning of February, Amravati has recorded more than 10,000 cases, and there has been a similar rise in neighbouring districts. Maharashtra recorded nearly 9,000 cases on Thursday, the largest single-day spike in four months. ""People here have been not wearing masks. They have been attending unregulated mass gatherings such as marriages and campaigns for local elections. ""There is free intermingling of people, carriers are not getting isolated, and testing and tracking is low.

"A doctor receives his second dose of vaccine in Newbridge, Caerphilly county More than one million doses of the coronavirus vaccine have been administered in Wales, according to the Welsh Government. A total of 916,336 people have received their first dose, of which 89,053 have had a second jab, a total of 1,005,389. It means one in three of the country's adult population have received at least one dose. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said it was a ""fantastic testament"" to the hard work of staff involved in the rollout. He said it was an ""incredible marker"" in the 12 weeks since the rollout of the country's vaccination programme. Can Wales meet its Covid-19 vaccine targets? Q&A: When will I get my Covid-19 vaccine? Covid jab impact on serious illness 'spectacular' Mr Gething was in Barry on Saturday where he was ""delighted"" to be helping his mother get to her vaccine appointment. He added: ""It's a remarkable achievement in just a few short months, from a slower start building our infrastructure to really moving very, very quickly, ahead of [schedule]. ""I'm very confident we'll be getting through a million first doses in short order and completing the first nine priority groups by the middle of April."" Vaughan Gething took his mother to get her first jab on Saturday It means 29.1% of the Welsh population have had a first dose and 2.8% have had a full vaccination. Themajority of care home residentsand other target groups aged over 70 have had their first doses. On Friday, Wales' chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton saidpeople aged in their 40s will be next in line to get the coronavirus vaccine. Last week saw a stock of 46,000 Pfizer-BioNTech doses being used in Wales and another 56,000 Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines available. Along with this week, there was aplanned reduction in supply, as manufacturers prepare their processes for a significant ramp-up of production from March onwards, when between 160,000 and 190,000 doses are expected to be available.

"Arfon Jones is stepping down as North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner at May's election A police and crime commissioner wants prisoners to be given cannabis behind bars in a bid to tackle addiction and curb violence. Arfon Jones said he wanted to see a trial commissioned and introduced to see if the measure could work. He is standing down from his role overseeing North Wales Police after elections for a new commissioner in May. The Prison Service said it had a zero-tolerance approach to drugs. According to a recent report by Swansea University'sGlobal Drug Policy Observatory,external, officials in UK prisons found13% of men ""reported that they had developed a problem with illicit drugs"" since being locked up,external. It also highlighted a spot check by prison inspectors in Cardiff, who found 52% of prisoners said it was easy to get illegal drugs. The report pointed to concerns raised by HM Inspectorate for Prisons, which described the rise in the use of synthetic psychoactive drugs such as Spice as""now the most serious threat to the safety and security of the prison system"",external. Mr Jones said authorities needed to be ""addressing the causes"" of addiction and violence in prisons - especially the abundance of drugs such as Spice. The dangers of the synthetic drugs was highlighted by the case of 22-year-old prisoner Luke Morris Jones, from Blaenau Ffestiniog in Gwynedd, who died at HMP Berwyn in Wrexham in 2018. An inquest jury later foundthere had been a ""systemic failure"" in stopping drugs from entering the prison, contributing to his death. Luke Jones died at HMP Berwyn in Wrexham in 2018 after taking Spice Mr Jones, the Plaid Cymru police and crime commissioner (PCC), said he was also concerned about the levels of prescription painkillers given to prisoners, especially opioid-based drugs. ""If they are on opioids, why can't they be prescribed cannabis?"" he asked. ""Opioids are a damn sight more dangerous than cannabis. Let's supply cannabis in controlled conditions and see if offences reduce."" Drug overdoes spray trialled by North Wales Police Behind bars and addicted to Spice Mr Jones has been a long-time campaigner on the issues surrounding drug use and prohibition, andhas often backed calls for heroin injection schemesto provide safe, controlled environments for addicts. He previously saidit was a ""national scandal"" that people were ""dying needlessly""because governments had refused to acknowledge a radical new approach to drug policy was needed. Both the Welsh Conservative and Labour candidates vying for votes to take over his post in May have been critical of his latest idea. Tory PCC candidate for north Wales, Pat Astbury, said: ""There may be other ways to treat prisoners, using alternative medicines which are legal and mimic illegal drugs. ""One can't be seen to break the law at the expense of the force you are representing."" The HM Inspectorate of Prisons warned that psychoactive drugs such as Spice posed a ""serious threat"" behind bars Labour's Andy Dunbobbin added: ""There are lots of ways to prevent problematic drug use but this isn't one of them - prevention and treatment programmes in and out of prison should be strengthened and I'll work with partners, if elected, to do so."" He said the biggest issue was ""not drugs in prisons - it is drugs in society"" and called for ""decimated"" drug, alcohol and mental health service cuts to be rolled-back. Ann Griffith, Plaid Cymru's choice to replace Mr Jones, said a cannabis trial was ""something I would be willing to cautiously explore"" with criminal justice partners. ""Any such initiative would need to consider any unintended consequences and would need to be based on sound evidence and robust evaluation,"" she added. A Prison Service official said: ""We have a zero-tolerance approach to drugs and work closely with healthcare to support offenders through treatment and recovery.""

Jade Juckeston said there was insufficient support when she was having trouble breastfeeding First-time mothers have been calling for extra support for those going through pregnancy and labour in the pandemic. ZoÃ« O'Donnell, who is due to give birth in May, is planning a home birth after two friends shared their ""traumatic experiences"" of giving birth alone in hospital. One of those friends is Jade Juckeston, who says she believes the level of care she received following the birth of her daughter Hazel has contributed to long-term problems with breastfeeding. She spent two days in Bristol's Southmead Hospital after giving birth in June - with her husband not allowed on the ward. She says there is not enough support from the midwives and nurses when she is having trouble breastfeeding. ""As a new mother you are in a vulnerable and emotional position. I felt really lonely and I know others in the ward did too,"" she adds. North Bristol NHS Trust has now increased some access for those attending maternity services with their pregnant partners. It says it has tried to balance partners' support with protecting people from Covid-19. Read more here.  This video can not be played Golden Globes: Celebrity make-up artists on their job in the pandemic The film award season kicks off in Hollywood tomorrow, with this year's Golden Globes being celebrated in a largely virtual ceremony. A-list glamour will be in short supply - with no red carpet and nominees appearing from home. It highlights the impact of the pandemic on make-up artists, as well as hair and wardrobe stylists. Many have seen long stretches of downtime as the film industry has been temporarily shuttered. When they do work, it's nearly impossible to maintain social distance, so they must wear masks and get tested regularly. ""I love doing red carpet,"" says make-up artist Kimberley Bosso. ""It sucks that we can't do it and things are virtual now, but slowly we will get back to normal - we just have to be patient."" By Dominic Bailey ""I've tried to make a routine for myself as much as possible,"" Samantha says A Â£1,750 all-inclusive
break, with food delivered to your hotel door, plus round-the-clock TV might
sound appealing to some. But the reality is
something far less glamorous -hotel quarantine near some of England's busiest
international airports. The enforced
quarantine applies to those who have visited or transited through countries on
the UK's ""red list"". âComing
from Dubai which is a very sociable place and having been a cabin crew manager...
going from everything to nothing is a very big shock,"" says Samantha. The 41-year-old is using her enforced solitude in a Heathrow hotel to study to become an
accountant. ""That is what is
saving me completely. There is only so much TV I can watch."" We've been speaking to some of those in quarantineabout how they occupy the time - and what the food's like.

During the service, his daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore described her father as ""a beacon of light and hope to the world"". His other daughter Lucy Teixeira said: ""Daddy, I am so proud of you. You may be gone but your message and your spirit lives on."" Read more here. The couple had been due to celebrate their golden wedding anniversary this year A daughter has describedthe ""horrific"" anguish of losing both parents to Covid, just two weeks apart. Ray and Rosemary Scovell, from Sandown, on the Isle of Wight, had been looking forward to their golden wedding anniversary when Ray, 76, fell ill. Claire Apsey and grandson, Simon, says the family's grief has been compounded by lockdown. She says she felt ""guilty"" for being unable to give her parents the send-off they deserved, describing the funeral arrangements as ""clinical"". Mr and Mrs Scovell were well known for their work in the community. Her father was responsible for bringing sporting events, such as Parkrun, to the island - and was ably supported by his wife. When Mr Scovell was admitted to hospital in early January, Claire and her son moved in with her mum, who had developed short-term memory loss. ""When Dad died she would forget, so we would have to explain again,"" says daughter Claire, adding: ""She was heartbroken."" Barely more than a week after her husband's death, Mrs Scovell suffered a fall and, while in hospital, tested positive for the virus. She died five days later. ""It's been horrific really... The hardest thing is not being able to share the grief."" A woman who is deaf blind says she's been left feeling alone after giving birth during the pandemic. Bethany Fanthom, 27, gave birth to son Freddie on 11 March last year. She's calling for more support for disabled people's mental health and says she has felt isolated, with Covid restrictions cutting off most of her support. Ms Fanthom, from Halesowen, West Midlands, communicates with sign language and has tunnel vision - a loss of her peripheral view that makes it hard to watch her baby son while doing household jobs such as cooking and cleaning. While she lives with her fiancÃ©, his work keeps him away from the home most of the day. She says she has no one to speak to who's in a similar situation. ""I've not been able to meet any other moms with disabilities, nor have I been able to take my son on any play dates or outings,"" she says. ""Feeling isolated has had a huge impact on my mental health and physical health as I am forever reliant on my family for all my social needs."" The Sense charity is calling on the government to do more to support disabled people who it says have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. If you're just joining us, we reported earlier on the funeral of Captain Sir Tom Moore, who helped raise more than Â£33m for NHS charities during lockdown last year. Hannah Ingram-Moore described her father as ""a beacon of light and hope to the world"". His other daughter, Lucy Teixeira, said: ""Daddy, I am so proud of you. You may be gone but your message and your spirit lives on."" You can read a fuller version of the day's events here. Relatives of Captain Sir Tom Moore have spoken of their ""pride"" during his funeral. The service for the 100-year-old, who raised almost Â£33m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, began with him being honoured by the military. Six Yorkshire Regiment members carried his coffin, draped in the union jack, and an honour guard fired volleys. Below are some images from the day. There was a flypast ahead of the funeral service Eight members of Capt Sir Tom's family attended the service Members of the Yorkshire Regiment took part in the ceremony By Vikas Pandey and Soutik Biswas Social distancing measures are not being strictly followed After reporting a significant drop in the number of Covid-19 cases for months, some Indian states have seen a sharp uptick in infections in February. In early February, physicians in Amravati district, some 700km (435 miles) from India's commercial capital, Mumbai, noticed a sudden surge in the number of people suffering from Covid-19. Life in this cotton-growing district in the western state of Maharashtra had almost returned to normal after the first wave of infections last summer. The ICUs of the 1,600-bed state-run hospital and half-a-dozen private hospitals were nearly empty. ""But everything changed in February,"" says Anil Jadhav, a local journalist. ""And now there's panic in the district."" Since the beginning of February, Amravati has recorded more than 10,000 cases, and there has been a similar rise in neighbouring districts. Maharashtra recorded nearly 9,000 cases on Thursday, the largest single-day spike in four months. ""People here have been not wearing masks. They have been attending unregulated mass gatherings such as marriages and campaigns for local elections. ""There is free intermingling of people, carriers are not getting isolated, and testing and tracking is low. This has led to this situation,"" Dr Sanjay Oak, a member of the state's Covid task force, tells the BBC. Â© 2025 BBC.

The service celebrated his life, and thanked him for his incredible contribution - to his family, and to the world. Capt Sir Tom with daughters Lucy Teixeira (left) and Hannah Ingram-Moore (right) The veteran had spent the last few months of his life writing a book which he had planned to publish just before his 101st birthday. A section was released, in which he said he would ""like to watch my own funeral from a distance"" and laugh at ""everyone making a lot of fuss over me"". ""I want the service to end with My Way by Frank Sinatra because I always did things my way and I especially like the line about having too few regrets to mention,"" he wrote. Captain Sir Tom was originally from Keighley near Bradford, and his family said that once Covid-19 restrictions allow, his ashes will be interred in Yorkshire, where he will rest with his parents and grandparents in the Moore family plot.

"Anas Sarwar has been elected the new leader of Scottish Labour, replacing Richard Leonard who led the party for three years. The Glasgow MSP takes over less than three months before the next Holyrood elections. Anas Sarwar became a member of the Scottish Labour party at the age of 16, but politics was already in his blood. His dad, Mohammad Sarwar, was the UK's first ever Muslim MP and held the Glasgow Central seat for Labour between 1997 and 2010  - until his son Anas succeeded him. Graduating from the University of Glasgow, Mr Sarwar worked as a dentist in Paisley for five years prior to becoming a MP. Anas Sarwar wins Scottish Labour leadership race The 37-year-old was the Glasgow Central MP from 2010 to 2015 and was firmly in the Gordon Brown camp of New Labour. Mr Sarwar took an active role in the pro-Union campaign leading up to the 2014 independence referendum, touring Scotland in a bus with No activists. Anas Sarwar and his wife Furheen in 2017 - the couple have three children together After the Glasgow Central seat was won by the SNP's Alison Thewliss in the 2015 general election, Mr Sarwar turned his attention to Holyrood and was elected a list MSP for Glasgow in 2016. As has often been the case for Scottish Labour in the last decade, the party faced a leadership election in 2017 after Kezia Dugdale quit and Mr Sarwar was pitted against Richard Leonard. It was a rancorous campaign and Mr Sarwar faced criticism over his children attending a fee-paying school in Glasgow, with questions also raised over hisfamily's cash-and-carry firm advertising jobs that paid less than the ""real"" living wageof Â£8.45 an hour. Sarwar to stand in Scottish Labour leader race 'Leonard's Labour leadership just wasn't working' Mr Leonard won the race, becoming the first Scottish Labour leader to come from the left of the party. The victory firmly reflected the party's membership make-up at the time; Mr Leonard was a firm supporter of the UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn whereas Mr Sarwar had signed a letter opposing Mr Corbyn's bid for re-election. Mr Sarwar's most high profile role as an MSP was as Scottish Labour's health spokesman and he played a key role in the concern over safety issues at Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital whichled to a public inquiry. Mr Sarwar congratulating Mr Leonard after his victory in 2017 after an acrimonious leadership contest Mr Sarwar will be the first non-white leader of a major political party in the UK and has spoken in the past about the racism he has experienced as a politician. This included death threats made against his family. Following his unsuccessful leadership bid in 2017, Mr Sarwar claimed that one councillor had told him Scotland would not vote for him because of his religion and the colour of his skin. A party investigation ultimately foundthere was no case to answerbut Mr Sarwar was critical of Scottish Labour's complaints system which did not allow him to give evidence at the hearing. In 2018, Mr Sarwar established the Scottish Parliament's cross-party group on tackling Islamophobia. In his pitch to party members, Mr Sarwar said he wanted to ""rebuild Scottish Labour, and then rebuild Scotland"". The Glasgow MSP has also taken a firm stance against the prospect of another independence referendum which he claims is not credible as the country rebuilds after Covid. The immediate concern for Mr Sarwar is May's Holyrood election where party strategists are hoping the new leader can lift them from third to second place in Scottish politics.

"The former Army captain became affectionately known as Captain Tom Captain Sir Tom Moore won the nation's hearts with his extraordinary fundraising efforts for National Health Service charities. The retired Army officer served in India and Myanmar, also known as Burma, during World War Two but it was by walking laps around his garden that he became known to millions. When he was 99, he was catapulted into the global spotlight with his attempt to raise an initial Â£1,000 for charity. Early in April 2020, with the aid of his walking frame and a steely determination, he vowed to complete 100 laps of his patio before his 100th birthday at the end of that month. The war veteran was inspired to help the health service after receiving treatment for skin cancer of the head, and a broken hip after a fall in 2018. He described the NHS staff who helped him through this as ""marvellous"", and pledged to help those same ""super"" people who were working on the front line during the coronavirus pandemic. Soldiers from 1st Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment formed a Guard of Honour for the final laps of his walk in April 2020 His family thought reaching the Â£1,000 mark would be ""a real stretch"" but, as press coverage of his efforts increased, so did the donations. By the time he completed his 100 laps - on 16 April 2020 - Captain Tom, as he had become affectionately known, had raised more than Â£12m for NHS Charities Together. 'Hero' fundraiser Capt Sir Tom Moore dies aged 100 Queen leads tributes to Captain Sir Tom Moore Captain Sir Tom Moore's life in pictures In 2007, he had moved from Kent to Bedfordshire to be with his youngest daughter, Hannah Ingram-Moore, and her family. It was here, in Marston Moretaine, that the idea of raising relatively modest funds for a charity supporting the NHS was hatched. He was surrounded by members of his family - and the world's media - as he fulfilled his mission Capt Sir Tom began walking - planning on 10 laps at a time of the 25-metre (82ft) loop in his back garden - and the donations began mounting up. Every million was another milestone, but the veteran, who became a well-known face on national television, took it all in his stride. Capt Sir Tom Moore (bottom row, far left) and colleagues pictured during his service in the Army Capt Sir Tom with daughters Lucy Teixeira (left) and Hannah Ingram-Moore (right) Ever modest about the challenge he had set himself, Capt Sir Tom was nevertheless astounded by the generosity of donors, describing it as ""completely out of this world"". ""It's all for the sake of the nurses and the NHS we have, because they are doing such a magnificent job,"" he said at the time. ""Every penny that we get, they deserve every one of it."" The NHS said it was ""humbled"" by his fundraising effort for their charities He was described as a ""one-man fundraising machine"" by the Duke of Cambridge, while both the prime minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Capt Sir Tom was ""an inspiration"" to everyone. Not only did his efforts encourage thousands to donate to the fundraising appeal, but heinspired many to join his campaignto raise both awareness and money for those working in, and supporting, the NHS. From a teenage girl learning to walk again on a treadmill as part of her recovery from a stroke, to a non-verbal boy with autism - who wrote ""He is a hero to us,"" as he embarked on his own challenge to walk for the NHS - people set themselves their own challenges, buoyed by the former soldier. Age, it seemed, was no barrier - as Capt Sir Tom was proving. Dozens dusted off their own walking frames and took to the streets to prove they could play their own part in the drive to raise funds. One woman completed a marathon by walking laps near her Berkshire home, at the age of 104. ""Tom, I've done it,"" she laughed, as shefinished her challenge. This video can not be played Captain Tom Moore celebrates his birthday in style A week before his 100th birthday, Capt Sir Tom became the oldest person ever to get to number one in the UK singles charts when his duet of You'll Never Walk Alone - with singer Michael Ball - took the top spot. His100th birthday on 30 April 2020was marked with an RAF flypast, personal birthday greetings from the Queen and prime minister, and he was made an honorary colonel of the British Army. ""I'm still Captain Tom, that's who I really am but if people choose to call me colonel, well, thank you very much,"" he replied. The following month it was announced he would beawarded a knighthood for his fundraising effortsand would be known as Captain Sir Thomas Moore ""under Ministry of Defence protocol"". On 17 July 2020, he was knighted in the grounds of Windsor Castle, in the Queen's first official engagement in person since the lockdown period began in March. This was the first knighthood the Queen had carried out in person since the beginning of the pandemic His youngest daughter said at the time of his fundraising efforts that her father had become a ""beacon of hope"" during challenging times. And indeed, Capt Sir Tom always seemed to know just the right thing to say to buoy the nation's spirits as the public tried to abide by government regulations to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. ""To all those people who are finding it difficult at the moment, the sun will shine on you again, and the clouds will go away,"" he said. ""Tomorrow will be a good day"" - another example of his positivity - became a hashtag on social media posts. An image of Capt Sir Tom lit up the night sky during the virtual 2021 New Year celebrations over the Millennium Dome (O2 Arena) in London The proud Yorkshireman completed his 100 laps of his garden live on television in April 2020, with a Guard of Honour from 1st Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment and a rousing round of applause from his family. By the time he closed his fundraising page at midnight on his 100th birthday, Capt Sir Tom had raised Â£32,794,701 for charities supporting the NHS, from more than one-and-a-half-million global donors.

Katy PrickettBBC News Shanise Fowler was so frustrated at delays in her care that she paid for a private consultation Some people living with the incurable autoimmune disease lupus have had treatments delayed or cancelled during the coronavirus pandemic. But they also told Cambridge University researchers they now feel more understood by society because ""there is a lot more awareness of vulnerable people who need to shield"", as one patient put it. Melanie Sloan isleading the research team,external, which includes rheumatologists, behavioural scientists, expert patients and the charity Lupus UK. She also has lupus herself. Sloan hopes lupus can benefit from the type of support that is emerging for ""long Covid"" patients and believes they share similar life-changing symptoms such as severe fatigue and pain. Read what three patients had to sayabout their experience of living with lupus during lockdown. The Durham Miners' Gala, one of the largest trade union-organised events in Europe,has been cancelled for the second year running because of coronavirus. The first gala was hosted in 1871 and the 150th anniversary event was due to take place on 10 July. Only world wars and strikes - the General Strike in 1926 and Miners' Strike in 1984 - have previously stopped the gathering from taking place. Easington's Labour MP Graeme Morris says the Durham Miners' Association feels there is not enough time to organise the event, assuming the roadmap for easing lockdown stays as it is. ""Reluctantly, they had to take this decision rather than commit time and resources. It's disappointing but I think it's wise,"" he says. ""A gala of 100,000 people would be terrible if it put people at risk."" A German radio host hasapologised after comparing K-pop group BTS to the coronavirus. Matthias Matuschik said he didn't intend to ""racially insult"" BTS - one of the biggest groups in the world - adding that making a connection between the band and Covid was ""completely wrong"". On Wednesday, during his show on Bayern3, Matuschik played the group's cover of Coldplay's ""Fix You"" on his show, calling it ""blasphemy"". ""For this you will be vacationing in North Korea for the next 20 years!"" he added. Matuschik then described BTS as ""some crappy virus that hopefully there will be a vaccine for soon as well"". Many took to social media to share their outrage at the comments. The station said the presenter ""overshot the mark in his choice of words"" and he did not intend to hurt the feelings of BTS fans. Matuschik said he accepted ""I could have racially insulted many of you, especially the Asian community, with my words"". ""That was never my intention, but I know that in the end it is how the words are received by the recipients - and not how they were meant,"" he added. Labour is accusing the government of ""burying their heads in the sand"" over May's local elections and warns there could be a major disenfranchisement of voters without further action. Deputy leader Angela Rayner says the government has to set out a ""proper plan"" to run the elections safely and is calling for a drive to boost postal voting. The government has already set out guidance for measures including mask-wearing and voters bringing their own pens to the polls. It says a ""comprehensive public information campaign"" will be launched soon. But Labour is warning of ""dangerously crowded polling stations"" and ""long queues"" on election day. Rayner says ministers have ""once again been too slow to act"", saying it is ""completely inexplicable"" they are not urging people to sign up to vote from home. ""With 10 weeks to go, we are yet to see a proper plan from the government setting out how these elections will be run safely while councils face shortages of electoral staff, lack of venues and funding uncertainty,"" she says. Voting on 6 May will include polls for district and county councils in England, for police and crime commissioners and for city mayors, including in London. An Electoral Commission spokeswoman says voters have a range of options including voting in person, by post or by proxy. David Pearson, deputy lieutenant for West Yorkshire, left a floral tribute in Keighley Moving tributes have been paid to Captain Sir Tom Moore by his closest family at a private service in Bedfordshire where the veteran fundraiser was honoured with a flypast, a gun volley and The Last Post. But it is not only in his home village of Marston Moretaine where the 100-year-old, who raised almost Â£33m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, is being remembered. Floral tributes have been left at a memorial to him in Keighley where the ""proud Yorkshireman"" was born. On the day of his funeral, David Pearson, deputy lieutenant for West Yorkshire laid a wreath of 200 white roses, alongside floral posies left by members of the public at the plaque which recognises ""the high esteem in which he is held by his fellow citizens"".  GardaÃ­ (Irish police) in Dublin have been attacked after hundreds of people protesting against Covid-19 restrictions were prevented from gathering in St Stephen's Green.

Jade Juckeston said there was insufficient support when she was having trouble breastfeeding First-time mothers have been calling for extra support for those going through pregnancy and labour in the pandemic. ZoÃ« O'Donnell, who is due to give birth in May, is planning a home birth after two friends shared their ""traumatic experiences"" of giving birth alone in hospital. One of those friends is Jade Juckeston, who says she believes the level of care she received following the birth of her daughter Hazel has contributed to long-term problems with breastfeeding. She spent two days in Bristol's Southmead Hospital after giving birth in June - with her husband not allowed on the ward. She says there is not enough support from the midwives and nurses when she is having trouble breastfeeding. ""As a new mother you are in a vulnerable and emotional position. I felt really lonely and I know others in the ward did too,"" she adds. North Bristol NHS Trust has now increased some access for those attending maternity services with their pregnant partners.

A-list glamour will be in short supply - with no red carpet and nominees appearing from home. It highlights the impact of the pandemic on make-up artists, as well as hair and wardrobe stylists.

During the service, his daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore described her father as ""a beacon of light and hope to the world"". His other daughter Lucy Teixeira said: ""Daddy, I am so proud of you. You may be gone but your message and your spirit lives on."" Read more here. The couple had been due to celebrate their golden wedding anniversary this year A daughter has describedthe ""horrific"" anguish of losing both parents to Covid, just two weeks apart. Ray and Rosemary Scovell, from Sandown, on the Isle of Wight, had been looking forward to their golden wedding anniversary when Ray, 76, fell ill. Claire Apsey and grandson, Simon, says the family's grief has been compounded by lockdown. She says she felt ""guilty"" for being unable to give her parents the send-off they deserved, describing the funeral arrangements as ""clinical"". Mr and Mrs Scovell were well known for their work in the community. Her father was responsible for bringing sporting events, such as Parkrun, to the island - and was ably supported by his wife. When Mr Scovell was admitted to hospital in early January, Claire and her son moved in with her mum, who had developed short-term memory loss. ""When Dad died she would forget, so we would have to explain again,"" says daughter Claire, adding: ""She was heartbroken."" Barely more than a week after her husband's death, Mrs Scovell suffered a fall and, while in hospital, tested positive for the virus. She died five days later. ""It's been horrific really... The hardest thing is not being able to share the grief."" A woman who is deaf blind says she's been left feeling alone after giving birth during the pandemic. Bethany Fanthom, 27, gave birth to son Freddie on 11 March last year. She's calling for more support for disabled people's mental health and says she has felt isolated, with Covid restrictions cutting off most of her support. Ms Fanthom, from Halesowen, West Midlands, communicates with sign language and has tunnel vision - a loss of her peripheral view that makes it hard to watch her baby son while doing household jobs such as cooking and cleaning. While she lives with her fiancÃ©, his work keeps him away from the home most of the day. She says she has no one to speak to who's in a similar situation. ""I've not been able to meet any other moms with disabilities, nor have I been able to take my son on any play dates or outings,"" she says. ""Feeling isolated has had a huge impact on my mental health and physical health as I am forever reliant on my family for all my social needs."" The Sense charity is calling on the government to do more to support disabled people who it says have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. If you're just joining us, we reported earlier on the funeral of Captain Sir Tom Moore, who helped raise more than Â£33m for NHS charities during lockdown last year. Hannah Ingram-Moore described her father as ""a beacon of light and hope to the world"". His other daughter, Lucy Teixeira, said: ""Daddy, I am so proud of you. You may be gone but your message and your spirit lives on."" You can read a fuller version of the day's events here. Relatives of Captain Sir Tom Moore have spoken of their ""pride"" during his funeral. The service for the 100-year-old, who raised almost Â£33m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, began with him being honoured by the military. Six Yorkshire Regiment members carried his coffin, draped in the union jack, and an honour guard fired volleys. Below are some images from the day. There was a flypast ahead of the funeral service Eight members of Capt Sir Tom's family attended the service Members of the Yorkshire Regiment took part in the ceremony By Vikas Pandey and Soutik Biswas Social distancing measures are not being strictly followed After reporting a significant drop in the number of Covid-19 cases for months, some Indian states have seen a sharp uptick in infections in February. In early February, physicians in Amravati district, some 700km (435 miles) from India's commercial capital, Mumbai, noticed a sudden surge in the number of people suffering from Covid-19. Life in this cotton-growing district in the western state of Maharashtra had almost returned to normal after the first wave of infections last summer. The ICUs of the 1,600-bed state-run hospital and half-a-dozen private hospitals were nearly empty. ""But everything changed in February,"" says Anil Jadhav, a local journalist. ""And now there's panic in the district."" Since the beginning of February, Amravati has recorded more than 10,000 cases, and there has been a similar rise in neighbouring districts. Maharashtra recorded nearly 9,000 cases on Thursday, the largest single-day spike in four months. ""People here have been not wearing masks. They have been attending unregulated mass gatherings such as marriages and campaigns for local elections. ""There is free intermingling of people, carriers are not getting isolated, and testing and tracking is low. This has led to this situation,"" Dr Sanjay Oak, a member of the state's Covid task force, tells the BBC. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Student Francesca Murphy is one of those sharing her mental health message after a year of Covid in Wales ""You might have to fight for it - but the support is out there, there is help - don't give up."" It is the overwhelming message of hope from Francesca Murphy, a 24-year-old student who has spent the Covid pandemic fighting her own mental health battles. She is just one of those who shared her lockdown wellbeing stories with BBC Wales News. They have all been touched by the virus - often in ways they did not expect. Sports science undergraduate Francesca said she knew her mental health was deteriorating not long before the pandemic was officially declared on 11 March, 2020. The World Health Organization made the announcement just two weeks after the very first case was identified in Wales, in Swansea,when a holidaymaker returned from a skiing trip in Italy. Francesca had already experienced episodes of illness before, including dealing with the eating disorder anorexia. As the pandemic began to spiral out of control across Europe, she knew she was becoming ill again. A number of hospital admissions followed, and referrals to mental health services. And when the first lockdown kicked in - so did the anorexia. ""Everyone was quite panicky, I guess, in March and April time,"" she explained. ""Everyone's routine has changed for a start. ""And for those who struggle with eating issues, it had such a detrimental effect."" ""Fight for help,"" insists Francesca The biggest challenge for Francesca then became food shopping, as supermarkets and stores asked customers to shop on their own. ""Some individuals may look absolutely fine on the outside, but actually really need someone else to go shopping with them,"" she said. She said without that support, for those experiencing eating disorders it can be difficult and mean even more anxiety. How has Covid affected mental health? The mental health cost to young people in the pandemic Francesca is continuing to study for the final year of her degree remotely from her home in Fishguard, Pembrokeshire, and frankly admitted: ""I'd like to say that I'm better, but that's far from the truth."" She said she was an individual who thrived on structure and certainties, getting outside and to the gym, and mixing with others. Lockdown after lockdown has stripped those certainties away. However, she remains positive. She is waiting for a place at a specialist eating disorders centre, and said the mental health support she has been receiving has been ""fantastic"". But she and her family had to fight for the care and support she needed, she added. ""If you need extra support, if you need therapy, fight for it. Ask the GP, get your parents on board. If your families recognises the signs, they can ask for help too. ""Go out and fight for the help that is out there."" Living alone with depression and anxiety has made the pandemic challenging for SiÃ¢n Edwards Some 40 or so miles away down the road in Carmarthen, SiÃ¢n Edwards has gone back to work this week. It's a relief. For her, the weeks - then months - of Covid lockdown have been a strain. She experiences both depression and anxiety, and like Francesca, she has missed the structure of her life before lockdown - with a job as a youth worker and a school crossing patrol. ""When the virus first arrived, I thought it would fade away and wouldn't amount to anything,"" she recalled. ""And then of course we had lockdown, which immediately set off alarm bells: 'Oh my god, how am I going to cope with my mental health' kind of thing. ""If I'm stuck in my flat, if I'm not allowed to go anywhere, if I'm not going to see anyone face-to-face, how am I going to cope?"" Five ways to stay positive through lockdown Personality that the pandemic SiÃ¢n said without being able to bubble with her mother, and enjoy the family garden during the warm spring, she would most likely have ""ended up in hospital"". But the continuing uncertainty about when restrictions will end, when the ""new normal"" will return - or what it will look like, plays on her mind. ""Normally at about three o'clock in the morning,"" she said. ""I like to plan ahead, I'm not one for spontaneity."" But she said the vaccination programme did offer hope that things would begin to change. And she was out on patrol, stopping traffic outside her school again this week, as foundation age classes started to return in Wales. ""It was lovely to see all the children. I think they were quite happy to get back, and I think their parents were very happy to have them back."" Lorena Mihalcea has been shielding in Newport since the start of the pandemic to protect her disabled sister Alisa In Newport, Lorena Mihalcea is a full-time carer for her severely disabled sister Alisa. It has meant the 25-year-old has also been shielding throughout to protect Alisa, who has cerebral palsy and complex care needs. In a city with Wales' third largest population, Lorena describes the pandemic in one word: ""Lonely."" ""It's been almost a year since I've been quarantined completely. I did it willingly because I want to protect my sister, as she is very vulnerable. ""But this is getting all too much now. Covid has made it 10 times worse. You get frustrated, and you breakdown sometimes."" Does Wales have a road map out of lockdown? Q&A: Wales and the lockdown rules She said she has found it difficult - almost impossible - to access respite care during the pandemic, especially as her 26-year-old sister requires a special blended food diet, which is an added complication. Lorena said there needs to be a change in policy in Wales to allow others to feed her sister, and she is still waiting for that to happen. However, after starting a business management degree, remotely, she is now getting some help with personal care at home for her sister. As the first anniversary of the first lockdown in Wales approaches, Lorena said she hoped 2021 would be a better year than 2020 - but she has yet to be convinced. ""Here we are now, still in the same situation as we were last year. I am sceptical - is this year going to a better time? Or should we hope that it will be the next one?"" Tom Morgan was on his way to a promising Welsh rugby career when injury struck - it became his inspiration in lockdown Tom Morgan knows all about hoping for better years, and also hopes he can help others to get there. At 22, he hoped he was going to have a glittering career in rugby. He had already been capped for Welsh Students rugby league side, was captain of the Welsh Academicals RFC and had been signed to Cardiff RFC, when just a couple of games in for them he suffered a career-ending injury. ""I slipped two discs in my back, and the doctors just said 'you can carry on, but you may not be okay when you are a little bit older', so I knocked it on the head,"" said Tom, who is now 25. He said he was left feeling ""anxious"" and  ""searching for something - and I didn't know what it was"". He found that ""something"" and is now a primary school teacher in Cardiff. So when the pandemic hit, he decided to use his own experience of navigating mental wellbeing and his classroom talentto launch a podcast to help others,external. The concept of ""Unlocking Your Mind"" is simple, he chats with elite athletes about how they have overcome injury, defeat, or even retirement. ""I thought that really translated into something people were going through in lockdown,"" said Tom. ""When the things they like doing, with the people they love, and then suddenly you can't do those things - and what are you left with? ""So I set up the podcast and it aims at looking at mindsets of how we embark on challenges, how we perceive setbacks, and how we overcome failures."" He has been fortunate to recently chat with rugby greats such as Australia scrum-half Will Genia, capped 110 times for his country, and the former Leeds Rhino's captain Stevie Ward who retired from the game last month at 27, due to the long-term effects of concussion. Tom said that chat in particular was ""hard"" to listen back to because of Ward's honesty about the end of his career. ""But he also focused on how important it is to listen to your body, and that there is more to life than putting your goals and identity into one thing."" He said he hoped he could help others ""unlock their own potential"" in what has been such a difficult time for so many people.

"On Budget day the chancellor usually holds up a traditional red box full of financial documents On Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak will unveil his Budget. He'll say how much of our money the government will take in taxes, and what they will spend it on. Each year, the chancellor of the exchequer - who is in charge of the government's finances - makes a Budget statement to MPs in the House of Commons. It outlines the government's plans for raising or lowering taxes. It also includes big decisions on what the government will spend money on - including health, schools, police and other public services. The Budget speech will be delivered onWednesday 27 October. It usually starts at about 12:30 UK time and lasts about an hour. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will give his response straight afterwards. This year's Autumn Budget is unusual for two reasons: It's the second of the year - there was a Budget in March too It comes on the same day asthe results of a spending review,external, which details how government will fund public services for the next three years After the speech, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - which monitors government spending - will publish a report on how the economy is doing. The Budget is likely to include help to support businesses and individuals recover from the economic effects of Covid. A number of measures have been announced in advance of the Budget, including a rise inthe minimum wage from Â£8.91 per hour to Â£9.50and anend to the public sector pay freeze. The chancellor will likely set out some more details of the government's long term ambitions: Reducing the UK's net greenhouse emissions to zero by 2050 to combat climate change Levelling up - bringing jobs and investment to the poorer regions of the UK. Budget 2021: What has already been announced? Though many businesses are open again, the impact of the pandemic on government finances will last for years Measures such as thefurlough scheme- which finished at the end of September - were expensive, and government income is down because it collected less money in tax during the pandemic. To close the gap between higher spending and less money, the government has had to borrow more. In the year ending April 2021, the government borrowed Â£320bn - the highest figure seen outside wartime. Economists expect it to borrow around Â£180bn more this year, another enormous sum. During his Budget speech, the Chancellor will set out the latest borrowing forecasts for the years ahead. Where does the government borrow billions from? The government needs to cut the gap between what it spends and what it raises. One major tax rise was announced in September - the Â£12bnHealth and Social Care Levy. This broke a promise the Conservatives made at the last election, not to raise the three biggest taxes - income tax, national insurance and VAT. There has been speculation that graduates may be asked to start paying back student loans earlier. At the same time,the cost of living is rising. So the chancellor may want to cut some taxes, such as the amount of VAT pay on energy bills. He is also expected to announce major changes to the complicated alcohol tax system, which could see sparkling wine become cheaper. Six things that could affect you in the Budget Why is the cost of living going up? Overall government spending will rise next year, with big increases already announced for health and schools in England. The government has already said thatthe NHS in England will receive an extra Â£5.9bnto help clear the record backlog of people waiting for tests and scans. But other government departments, such as courts, prisons, local government and transport,are braced for cuts to their day-to-day budgetsnext year. They have already faced a decade of tight spending, and making further cuts will be painful. Could alcohol duty be reformed in the Budget? Some parts of the Budget, such as defence spending, affect the whole of the UK. Others, such as education, only affect England. This is because Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland make their own decisions. Scotland has income tax-raising powers, which means its rates differ from the rest of the UK. The Scottish government will publish its Budget on 9 December. If the government announces extra spending on areas that only affect England, the other nations get an equivalent extra sum of money to spend as they choose, according to a rulecalled the Barnett formula.

Katy PrickettBBC News Shanise Fowler was so frustrated at delays in her care that she paid for a private consultation Some people living with the incurable autoimmune disease lupus have had treatments delayed or cancelled during the coronavirus pandemic. But they also told Cambridge University researchers they now feel more understood by society because ""there is a lot more awareness of vulnerable people who need to shield"", as one patient put it. Melanie Sloan isleading the research team,external, which includes rheumatologists, behavioural scientists, expert patients and the charity Lupus UK. She also has lupus herself. Sloan hopes lupus can benefit from the type of support that is emerging for ""long Covid"" patients and believes they share similar life-changing symptoms such as severe fatigue and pain. Read what three patients had to sayabout their experience of living with lupus during lockdown. The Durham Miners' Gala, one of the largest trade union-organised events in Europe,has been cancelled for the second year running because of coronavirus. The first gala was hosted in 1871 and the 150th anniversary event was due to take place on 10 July. Only world wars and strikes - the General Strike in 1926 and Miners' Strike in 1984 - have previously stopped the gathering from taking place. Easington's Labour MP Graeme Morris says the Durham Miners' Association feels there is not enough time to organise the event, assuming the roadmap for easing lockdown stays as it is. ""Reluctantly, they had to take this decision rather than commit time and resources. It's disappointing but I think it's wise,"" he says. ""A gala of 100,000 people would be terrible if it put people at risk."" A German radio host hasapologised after comparing K-pop group BTS to the coronavirus. Matthias Matuschik said he didn't intend to ""racially insult"" BTS - one of the biggest groups in the world - adding that making a connection between the band and Covid was ""completely wrong"". On Wednesday, during his show on Bayern3, Matuschik played the group's cover of Coldplay's ""Fix You"" on his show, calling it ""blasphemy"". ""For this you will be vacationing in North Korea for the next 20 years!"" he added. Matuschik then described BTS as ""some crappy virus that hopefully there will be a vaccine for soon as well"". Many took to social media to share their outrage at the comments. The station said the presenter ""overshot the mark in his choice of words"" and he did not intend to hurt the feelings of BTS fans. Matuschik said he accepted ""I could have racially insulted many of you, especially the Asian community, with my words"". ""That was never my intention, but I know that in the end it is how the words are received by the recipients - and not how they were meant,"" he added. Labour is accusing the government of ""burying their heads in the sand"" over May's local elections and warns there could be a major disenfranchisement of voters without further action. Deputy leader Angela Rayner says the government has to set out a ""proper plan"" to run the elections safely and is calling for a drive to boost postal voting. The government has already set out guidance for measures including mask-wearing and voters bringing their own pens to the polls. It says a ""comprehensive public information campaign"" will be launched soon. But Labour is warning of ""dangerously crowded polling stations"" and ""long queues"" on election day. Rayner says ministers have ""once again been too slow to act"", saying it is ""completely inexplicable"" they are not urging people to sign up to vote from home. ""With 10 weeks to go, we are yet to see a proper plan from the government setting out how these elections will be run safely while councils face shortages of electoral staff, lack of venues and funding uncertainty,"" she says. Voting on 6 May will include polls for district and county councils in England, for police and crime commissioners and for city mayors, including in London. An Electoral Commission spokeswoman says voters have a range of options including voting in person, by post or by proxy. David Pearson, deputy lieutenant for West Yorkshire, left a floral tribute in Keighley Moving tributes have been paid to Captain Sir Tom Moore by his closest family at a private service in Bedfordshire where the veteran fundraiser was honoured with a flypast, a gun volley and The Last Post. But it is not only in his home village of Marston Moretaine where the 100-year-old, who raised almost Â£33m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, is being remembered. Floral tributes have been left at a memorial to him in Keighley where the ""proud Yorkshireman"" was born. On the day of his funeral, David Pearson, deputy lieutenant for West Yorkshire laid a wreath of 200 white roses, alongside floral posies left by members of the public at the plaque which recognises ""the high esteem in which he is held by his fellow citizens"".  GardaÃ­ (Irish police) in Dublin have been attacked after hundreds of people protesting against Covid-19 restrictions were prevented from gathering in St Stephen's Green. Irish broadcaster RTÃ reported that a number of arrests have been made. Police used batons to push demonstrators down Grafton Street but were attacked with fireworks, cans and bollards, RTÃ said. The Office of Public Works closed the park after orders from police. Read more here. A further 504,493 people in the UK have received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine and 32,773 have had their second dose. This brings the totals to 19,682,048 for first doses and 768,810 for second doses - a total of more than 20 million doses. And looking at the figures for cases and deaths we just brought you, both have fallen since the same time last week. Last Saturday there were 10,406 new cases and 445 further deaths.  More than 20 million vaccine doses have been given - and more than 19 million of those have been first jabs There have been a further 7,434 positive coronavirus tests recorded in the UK, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 4,170,519. The latest government figures also show there have been a further 290 deaths of people who had tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. It brings the total by that measure to 122,705. Police are carrying out spot checks in the hope of deterring people from driving to beauty spots in Wales over the weekend.

Jade Juckeston said there was insufficient support when she was having trouble breastfeeding First-time mothers have been calling for extra support for those going through pregnancy and labour in the pandemic. ZoÃ« O'Donnell, who is due to give birth in May, is planning a home birth after two friends shared their ""traumatic experiences"" of giving birth alone in hospital. One of those friends is Jade Juckeston, who says she believes the level of care she received following the birth of her daughter Hazel has contributed to long-term problems with breastfeeding. She spent two days in Bristol's Southmead Hospital after giving birth in June - with her husband not allowed on the ward. She says there is not enough support from the midwives and nurses when she is having trouble breastfeeding. ""As a new mother you are in a vulnerable and emotional position. I felt really lonely and I know others in the ward did too,"" she adds. North Bristol NHS Trust has now increased some access for those attending maternity services with their pregnant partners. It says it has tried to balance partners' support with protecting people from Covid-19. Read more here.  This video can not be played Golden Globes: Celebrity make-up artists on their job in the pandemic The film award season kicks off in Hollywood tomorrow, with this year's Golden Globes being celebrated in a largely virtual ceremony. A-list glamour will be in short supply - with no red carpet and nominees appearing from home. It highlights the impact of the pandemic on make-up artists, as well as hair and wardrobe stylists. Many have seen long stretches of downtime as the film industry has been temporarily shuttered. When they do work, it's nearly impossible to maintain social distance, so they must wear masks and get tested regularly. ""I love doing red carpet,"" says make-up artist Kimberley Bosso. ""It sucks that we can't do it and things are virtual now, but slowly we will get back to normal - we just have to be patient.""

The couple had been due to celebrate their golden wedding anniversary this year A daughter has describedthe ""horrific"" anguish of losing both parents to Covid, just two weeks apart. Ray and Rosemary Scovell, from Sandown, on the Isle of Wight, had been looking forward to their golden wedding anniversary when Ray, 76, fell ill. Claire Apsey and grandson, Simon, says the family's grief has been compounded by lockdown. She says she felt ""guilty"" for being unable to give her parents the send-off they deserved, describing the funeral arrangements as ""clinical"". Mr and Mrs Scovell were well known for their work in the community. Her father was responsible for bringing sporting events, such as Parkrun, to the island - and was ably supported by his wife. When Mr Scovell was admitted to hospital in early January, Claire and her son moved in with her mum, who had developed short-term memory loss. ""When Dad died she would forget, so we would have to explain again,"" says daughter Claire, adding: ""She was heartbroken."" Barely more than a week after her husband's death, Mrs Scovell suffered a fall and, while in hospital, tested positive for the virus. She died five days later. ""It's been horrific really... The hardest thing is not being able to share the grief."" A woman who is deaf blind says she's been left feeling alone after giving birth during the pandemic. Bethany Fanthom, 27, gave birth to son Freddie on 11 March last year. She's calling for more support for disabled people's mental health and says she has felt isolated, with Covid restrictions cutting off most of her support. Ms Fanthom, from Halesowen, West Midlands, communicates with sign language and has tunnel vision - a loss of her peripheral view that makes it hard to watch her baby son while doing household jobs such as cooking and cleaning. While she lives with her fiancÃ©, his work keeps him away from the home most of the day. She says she has no one to speak to who's in a similar situation. ""I've not been able to meet any other moms with disabilities, nor have I been able to take my son on any play dates or outings,"" she says. ""Feeling isolated has had a huge impact on my mental health and physical health as I am forever reliant on my family for all my social needs."" The Sense charity is calling on the government to do more to support disabled people who it says have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. If you're just joining us, we reported earlier on the funeral of Captain Sir Tom Moore, who helped raise more than Â£33m for NHS charities during lockdown last year.

You may be gone but your message and your spirit lives on."" You can read a fuller version of the day's events here. Relatives of Captain Sir Tom Moore have spoken of their ""pride"" during his funeral. The service for the 100-year-old, who raised almost Â£33m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, began with him being honoured by the military. Six Yorkshire Regiment members carried his coffin, draped in the union jack, and an honour guard fired volleys. Below are some images from the day.

In early February, physicians in Amravati district, some 700km (435 miles) from India's commercial capital, Mumbai, noticed a sudden surge in the number of people suffering from Covid-19. Life in this cotton-growing district in the western state of Maharashtra had almost returned to normal after the first wave of infections last summer. The ICUs of the 1,600-bed state-run hospital and half-a-dozen private hospitals were nearly empty. ""But everything changed in February,"" says Anil Jadhav, a local journalist. ""And now there's panic in the district."" Since the beginning of February, Amravati has recorded more than 10,000 cases, and there has been a similar rise in neighbouring districts. Maharashtra recorded nearly 9,000 cases on Thursday, the largest single-day spike in four months. ""People here have been not wearing masks. They have been attending unregulated mass gatherings such as marriages and campaigns for local elections. ""There is free intermingling of people, carriers are not getting isolated, and testing and tracking is low. This has led to this situation,"" Dr Sanjay Oak, a member of the state's Covid task force, tells the BBC. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Arfon Jones is stepping down as North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner at May's election A police and crime commissioner wants prisoners to be given cannabis behind bars in a bid to tackle addiction and curb violence. Arfon Jones said he wanted to see a trial commissioned and introduced to see if the measure could work. He is standing down from his role overseeing North Wales Police after elections for a new commissioner in May. The Prison Service said it had a zero-tolerance approach to drugs. According to a recent report by Swansea University'sGlobal Drug Policy Observatory,external, officials in UK prisons found13% of men ""reported that they had developed a problem with illicit drugs"" since being locked up,external. It also highlighted a spot check by prison inspectors in Cardiff, who found 52% of prisoners said it was easy to get illegal drugs. The report pointed to concerns raised by HM Inspectorate for Prisons, which described the rise in the use of synthetic psychoactive drugs such as Spice as""now the most serious threat to the safety and security of the prison system"",external. Mr Jones said authorities needed to be ""addressing the causes"" of addiction and violence in prisons - especially the abundance of drugs such as Spice. The dangers of the synthetic drugs was highlighted by the case of 22-year-old prisoner Luke Morris Jones, from Blaenau Ffestiniog in Gwynedd, who died at HMP Berwyn in Wrexham in 2018. An inquest jury later foundthere had been a ""systemic failure"" in stopping drugs from entering the prison, contributing to his death. Luke Jones died at HMP Berwyn in Wrexham in 2018 after taking Spice Mr Jones, the Plaid Cymru police and crime commissioner (PCC), said he was also concerned about the levels of prescription painkillers given to prisoners, especially opioid-based drugs. ""If they are on opioids, why can't they be prescribed cannabis?"" he asked. ""Opioids are a damn sight more dangerous than cannabis. Let's supply cannabis in controlled conditions and see if offences reduce."" Drug overdoes spray trialled by North Wales Police Behind bars and addicted to Spice Mr Jones has been a long-time campaigner on the issues surrounding drug use and prohibition, andhas often backed calls for heroin injection schemesto provide safe, controlled environments for addicts. He previously saidit was a ""national scandal"" that people were ""dying needlessly""because governments had refused to acknowledge a radical new approach to drug policy was needed. Both the Welsh Conservative and Labour candidates vying for votes to take over his post in May have been critical of his latest idea. Tory PCC candidate for north Wales, Pat Astbury, said: ""There may be other ways to treat prisoners, using alternative medicines which are legal and mimic illegal drugs. ""One can't be seen to break the law at the expense of the force you are representing."" The HM Inspectorate of Prisons warned that psychoactive drugs such as Spice posed a ""serious threat"" behind bars Labour's Andy Dunbobbin added: ""There are lots of ways to prevent problematic drug use but this isn't one of them - prevention and treatment programmes in and out of prison should be strengthened and I'll work with partners, if elected, to do so."" He said the biggest issue was ""not drugs in prisons - it is drugs in society"" and called for ""decimated"" drug, alcohol and mental health service cuts to be rolled-back. Ann Griffith, Plaid Cymru's choice to replace Mr Jones, said a cannabis trial was ""something I would be willing to cautiously explore"" with criminal justice partners. ""Any such initiative would need to consider any unintended consequences and would need to be based on sound evidence and robust evaluation,"" she added. A Prison Service official said: ""We have a zero-tolerance approach to drugs and work closely with healthcare to support offenders through treatment and recovery.""

"A mortgage guarantee scheme to help people with small deposits get on the property ladder is set to be announced at next week's Budget. The government will offer incentives to lenders, bringing back 95% mortgages which have ""virtually disappeared"" during the pandemic, the Treasury says. Chancellor Rishi Sunak says public finances are facing a ""challenge"" from the pandemic's impact on the economy. The government has borrowed Â£271bn this financial year - up Â£222bn on 2019-20. This has pushed the national debt to Â£2.13 trillion. Explaining the government's economic response to the pandemic, Mr Sunaktold the Financial Times,external: ""We went big, we went early, but there is more to come and there will be more to come in the Budget. But there is a challenge [in the public finances] and I want to level with people about the challenge."" He added: ""I will do whatever it takes to protect the British people through this crisis and I remain committed to that."" Former Conservative chancellor Lord Clarke called for Mr Sunak to raise taxes in order to bring the UK's finances under control, and warned ""if we don't get it under control before inflation comes back then we will face a financial crisis"". What is the Budget and when will it happen? 'Furlough is a lifeline, I hope they extend it' Sunak injecting Â£126m to boost traineeship scheme The question of tax rises is one the chancellor will need to address when he unveils his Budget in a Commons speech on Wednesday. In the run-up to the 2019 election, the Conservatives promised not to increase income tax, National Insurance Contributions or VAT - but Mr Sunak could argue circumstances have changed. Carlisle MP John Stevenson, of the Conservative Northern Research Group, said it was ""too early"" for tax rises, saying UK still had a few months of the pandemic to get through and he wanted to see continuing support. But Lord Clarke said the pandemic had been ""unfair financially"" on ""the poor, the young, the low-paid, the vulnerable"" and suggested making people who continue in full-time work after the age of 65 pay the same taxes as younger people. Labour has criticised the government for a ""stop, start"" approach to support measures during the pandemic. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Doddstold the Times,externalher party did not support an ""immediate"" increase in corporation tax but would welcome longer-term rises and said she wanted a ""more progressive tax system"". The chancellor is also expected to announce anÂ£126m scheme for traineeships in England. It will include a new ""flexi-job"" apprenticeship, enabling apprentices to work with different employers in one sector. With unemployment at its highest level for almost five years, Mr Sunak said this was ""vital"" support for getting people back into work. Mortgage providers will only lend to those with a regular income, irrespective of any government incentive. But young adults' finances, and their employment prospects, have been hit hard by this pandemic. It was the same in the financial crisis of a decade ago. That is why jobs will be central to this Budget - both protecting them now and creating them in the future to aid an economic recovery. While the chancellor may be able to borrow fairly cheaply now to pay for that support, the prospect of future tax rises to foot the bill will no doubt be addressed too. Covid has led everyone to face the realities of home, work, and working from home. On Wednesday, many will be looking to Mr Sunak to save their jobs and keep a roof over their heads - whether they own it, or not. The new mortgage scheme is not restricted to first-time buyers or new-build homes, but there will be a Â£600,000 limit. The coronavirus pandemic has meant there are now few low-deposit mortgages available, the Treasury said, with just eight on the market in January. They are often seen as riskier by banks as they are more vulnerable to negative changes in property prices - meaning people hold more debt than their home is worth. Under the scheme, which will launch across the UK in April, the government will offer to take on some of this risk. It is based on the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme, whichclosed to new loans at the end of 2016, a policy the Treasury said ""reinvigorated the market for high loan-to-value lending after the 2008 financial crisis"". But housing charity Shelter said that schemeincreased house prices,externalby 1.4%. Shadow housing secretary Thangam Debbonaire also raised concerns, saying young people needed ""genuinely affordable"" new houses to be built and did not want to go ""back to the days of sky-high mortgages"". The new scheme could coincide with the expected end of a stamp duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland on 31 March - though this may yet be extended. 4 ways it may get harder for first-time buyers Help to Buy deadline extended amid Covid delays Did Help to Buy help first-time buyers? Next week's announcement is also expected to include a new Â£100m taskforce to crack down on fraudsters who have exploited support schemes, such as furlough. Tax officials have opened about 10,000 inquiries into suspected fraudulent activity, the government said. THAT PETER CROUCH PODCAST:What does a young player go through in order to make it to the top?

Sloan hopes lupus can benefit from the type of support that is emerging for ""long Covid"" patients and believes they share similar life-changing symptoms such as severe fatigue and pain. Read what three patients had to sayabout their experience of living with lupus during lockdown. The Durham Miners' Gala, one of the largest trade union-organised events in Europe,has been cancelled for the second year running because of coronavirus. The first gala was hosted in 1871 and the 150th anniversary event was due to take place on 10 July. Only world wars and strikes - the General Strike in 1926 and Miners' Strike in 1984 - have previously stopped the gathering from taking place. Easington's Labour MP Graeme Morris says the Durham Miners' Association feels there is not enough time to organise the event, assuming the roadmap for easing lockdown stays as it is. ""Reluctantly, they had to take this decision rather than commit time and resources. It's disappointing but I think it's wise,"" he says. ""A gala of 100,000 people would be terrible if it put people at risk."" A German radio host hasapologised after comparing K-pop group BTS to the coronavirus. Matthias Matuschik said he didn't intend to ""racially insult"" BTS - one of the biggest groups in the world - adding that making a connection between the band and Covid was ""completely wrong"". On Wednesday, during his show on Bayern3, Matuschik played the group's cover of Coldplay's ""Fix You"" on his show, calling it ""blasphemy"". ""For this you will be vacationing in North Korea for the next 20 years!"" he added. Matuschik then described BTS as ""some crappy virus that hopefully there will be a vaccine for soon as well"". Many took to social media to share their outrage at the comments. The station said the presenter ""overshot the mark in his choice of words"" and he did not intend to hurt the feelings of BTS fans. Matuschik said he accepted ""I could have racially insulted many of you, especially the Asian community, with my words"". ""That was never my intention, but I know that in the end it is how the words are received by the recipients - and not how they were meant,"" he added. Labour is accusing the government of ""burying their heads in the sand"" over May's local elections and warns there could be a major disenfranchisement of voters without further action. Deputy leader Angela Rayner says the government has to set out a ""proper plan"" to run the elections safely and is calling for a drive to boost postal voting. The government has already set out guidance for measures including mask-wearing and voters bringing their own pens to the polls. It says a ""comprehensive public information campaign"" will be launched soon. But Labour is warning of ""dangerously crowded polling stations"" and ""long queues"" on election day. Rayner says ministers have ""once again been too slow to act"", saying it is ""completely inexplicable"" they are not urging people to sign up to vote from home. ""With 10 weeks to go, we are yet to see a proper plan from the government setting out how these elections will be run safely while councils face shortages of electoral staff, lack of venues and funding uncertainty,"" she says. Voting on 6 May will include polls for district and county councils in England, for police and crime commissioners and for city mayors, including in London. An Electoral Commission spokeswoman says voters have a range of options including voting in person, by post or by proxy. David Pearson, deputy lieutenant for West Yorkshire, left a floral tribute in Keighley Moving tributes have been paid to Captain Sir Tom Moore by his closest family at a private service in Bedfordshire where the veteran fundraiser was honoured with a flypast, a gun volley and The Last Post. But it is not only in his home village of Marston Moretaine where the 100-year-old, who raised almost Â£33m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, is being remembered. Floral tributes have been left at a memorial to him in Keighley where the ""proud Yorkshireman"" was born. On the day of his funeral, David Pearson, deputy lieutenant for West Yorkshire laid a wreath of 200 white roses, alongside floral posies left by members of the public at the plaque which recognises ""the high esteem in which he is held by his fellow citizens"".  GardaÃ­ (Irish police) in Dublin have been attacked after hundreds of people protesting against Covid-19 restrictions were prevented from gathering in St Stephen's Green. Irish broadcaster RTÃ reported that a number of arrests have been made. Police used batons to push demonstrators down Grafton Street but were attacked with fireworks, cans and bollards, RTÃ said. The Office of Public Works closed the park after orders from police. Read more here.

Jade Juckeston said there was insufficient support when she was having trouble breastfeeding First-time mothers have been calling for extra support for those going through pregnancy and labour in the pandemic. ZoÃ« O'Donnell, who is due to give birth in May, is planning a home birth after two friends shared their ""traumatic experiences"" of giving birth alone in hospital. One of those friends is Jade Juckeston, who says she believes the level of care she received following the birth of her daughter Hazel has contributed to long-term problems with breastfeeding. She spent two days in Bristol's Southmead Hospital after giving birth in June - with her husband not allowed on the ward. She says there is not enough support from the midwives and nurses when she is having trouble breastfeeding. ""As a new mother you are in a vulnerable and emotional position. I felt really lonely and I know others in the ward did too,"" she adds. North Bristol NHS Trust has now increased some access for those attending maternity services with their pregnant partners. It says it has tried to balance partners' support with protecting people from Covid-19. Read more here.

A-list glamour will be in short supply - with no red carpet and nominees appearing from home. It highlights the impact of the pandemic on make-up artists, as well as hair and wardrobe stylists. Many have seen long stretches of downtime as the film industry has been temporarily shuttered. When they do work, it's nearly impossible to maintain social distance, so they must wear masks and get tested regularly. ""I love doing red carpet,"" says make-up artist Kimberley Bosso. ""It sucks that we can't do it and things are virtual now, but slowly we will get back to normal - we just have to be patient.""

The couple had been due to celebrate their golden wedding anniversary this year A daughter has describedthe ""horrific"" anguish of losing both parents to Covid, just two weeks apart. Ray and Rosemary Scovell, from Sandown, on the Isle of Wight, had been looking forward to their golden wedding anniversary when Ray, 76, fell ill. Claire Apsey and grandson, Simon, says the family's grief has been compounded by lockdown. She says she felt ""guilty"" for being unable to give her parents the send-off they deserved, describing the funeral arrangements as ""clinical"". Mr and Mrs Scovell were well known for their work in the community. Her father was responsible for bringing sporting events, such as Parkrun, to the island - and was ably supported by his wife. When Mr Scovell was admitted to hospital in early January, Claire and her son moved in with her mum, who had developed short-term memory loss. ""When Dad died she would forget, so we would have to explain again,"" says daughter Claire, adding: ""She was heartbroken."" Barely more than a week after her husband's death, Mrs Scovell suffered a fall and, while in hospital, tested positive for the virus. She died five days later. ""It's been horrific really... The hardest thing is not being able to share the grief."" A woman who is deaf blind says she's been left feeling alone after giving birth during the pandemic. Bethany Fanthom, 27, gave birth to son Freddie on 11 March last year. She's calling for more support for disabled people's mental health and says she has felt isolated, with Covid restrictions cutting off most of her support. Ms Fanthom, from Halesowen, West Midlands, communicates with sign language and has tunnel vision - a loss of her peripheral view that makes it hard to watch her baby son while doing household jobs such as cooking and cleaning. While she lives with her fiancÃ©, his work keeps him away from the home most of the day. She says she has no one to speak to who's in a similar situation. ""I've not been able to meet any other moms with disabilities, nor have I been able to take my son on any play dates or outings,"" she says. ""Feeling isolated has had a huge impact on my mental health and physical health as I am forever reliant on my family for all my social needs."" The Sense charity is calling on the government to do more to support disabled people who it says have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. If you're just joining us, we reported earlier on the funeral of Captain Sir Tom Moore, who helped raise more than Â£33m for NHS charities during lockdown last year.

In early February, physicians in Amravati district, some 700km (435 miles) from India's commercial capital, Mumbai, noticed a sudden surge in the number of people suffering from Covid-19. Life in this cotton-growing district in the western state of Maharashtra had almost returned to normal after the first wave of infections last summer. The ICUs of the 1,600-bed state-run hospital and half-a-dozen private hospitals were nearly empty. ""But everything changed in February,"" says Anil Jadhav, a local journalist. ""And now there's panic in the district."" Since the beginning of February, Amravati has recorded more than 10,000 cases, and there has been a similar rise in neighbouring districts. Maharashtra recorded nearly 9,000 cases on Thursday, the largest single-day spike in four months. ""People here have been not wearing masks. They have been attending unregulated mass gatherings such as marriages and campaigns for local elections. ""There is free intermingling of people, carriers are not getting isolated, and testing and tracking is low.

"Fewer investigations into loan sharks have started during the coronavirus crisis despite violent threats against borrowers struggling to repay. The pandemic has left people exposed to illegal money lending, but has also created practical difficulties for investigators. Figures show falling numbers of new investigations compared with previous years in parts of the UK. It comes as criminal lenders have been shaming non-payers on social media. Each nation of the UK has specialist teams of investigators looking at illegal money lending. They have warned that the financial uncertainty for individuals during Covid, as well as less appetite among traditional providers such as banks to lend, have led to loans sharks attempting to fill the gaps. Drops in income have led to some people missing repayments, and facing resulting threats of violence, intimidation, and sexual coercion. A major report into the lending sector found that many loan sharks had moved online, using social media and online chatrooms to identify victims. Nine million forced to borrow to cope with virus Investigators cannot always be so nimble, and coronavirus restrictions have caused practical issues such as difficulties in serving warrants. As a result, the number of new investigations dropped during 2020 - with only 95 getting underway between April and November, according to figures released after Freedom of Information requests. In England, in the seven months from April, 87 investigations were started, compared with 239 for the whole of the previous year, and 301 in the year before that. In Scotland, trading standards said ""due to Covid-19 restrictions, no investigations have commenced however there are some live enquiries still ongoing"". There were two the previous year, and 10 the year before that. In Northern Ireland, there were also no new inquiries, and there were 8 in Wales - both broadly in line with previous years, as Northern Ireland has not started any new investigations since 2015. Jason Wassell, chief executive of the Consumer Credit Trade Association, which represents non-mainstream authorised lenders, said: ""We know this been a difficult time to investigate and bring prosecutions but these figures are worrying. ""Loan sharks mustn't be allowed to get away with their illegal and dangerous activities, and investigators need our full support and sufficient funding to do their important work."" He said the authorities needed to ""keep the pressure on"". One victim borrowed about Â£450 and when she lost her job and found it hard to repay the money, she was threatened with violence. ""I didn't have enough, I couldn't eat properly, couldn't clothe my children properly,"" said the woman, who asked not to be identified. ""If I couldn't pay, they threatened to beat me up in front of my children. ""If the door knocked I'd be petrified, I constantly had my phone by my side and I'd lock the windows and doors. I had no confidence, I was so scared."" The recently-published Woolard Review for the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, found that loan sharks were ""innovating"" by moving online. It recommended that moves were made to remove these lenders from internet search results. Tony Quigley, head of the England Illegal Money Lending Team, said that the criminals were shaming people for non-payment on social media, as well as coercing them into sexual acts in lieu of cash. ""With more of our lives moving online, the opportunities for loan sharks to exploit vulnerable people are increasing,"" he said. ""We know people contact the team when they have reached crisis point, but we would urge people to contact us sooner as we will support them and we can intervene to stop the loan shark."" A spokeswoman for debt charity StepChange said: ""The post-Covid landscape is, unfortunately, one that is ripe for exploitative and unscrupulous operators to take advantage of people in debt. ""But there are better ways of dealing with debt problems than resorting to illegal money lenders. Free, confidential advice from reputable organisations can help people avoid getting trapped in a spiral of ever more expensive borrowing.""

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak is set to announce a Â£126m boost for traineeships in England in his Budget on Wednesday. The scheme will include a new ""flexi-job"" apprenticeship that will enable apprentices to work with a number of different employers in one sector. Unemployment is at its highest level in almost five years, with younger and typically lower-paid workers bearing the brunt of job losses. Mr Sunak said it was ""vital"" support continued to get people back into work. The chancellor's boost to existing apprenticeship and traineeship programmes will include playing up to double the current cash incentive to firms who take on an apprentice, regardless of age. It comes as a new government guarantee for low-deposit mortgagesis announced as part of next week's measures. 'We'd just begun our careers when the pandemic hit' 'Furlough is a lifeline, I hope they extend it' Apprentice redundancies rise: 'I was devastated' Traineeships are intended to get people into their first job after education. They last from six weeks to six months and they are open to people aged between 16 and 24. Currently, firms in England are given Â£2,000 for every new apprentice they take on under the age of 25, and Â£1,500 for those over 25, in addition to a Â£1,000 grant they are already getting under another project. Mr Sunak will promise to increase the cash incentives for employers who take on an apprentice to Â£3,000 - regardless of age. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is warning the UK's finances are ""exposed"" So the government says the planned Â£126m investment could enable 40,000 more traineeships. While he is committed to helping jobseekers and employers, Mr Sunak warned in an interview withthe Financial Times,externalthat the UK's finances were now ""exposed"". ""Because we now have far more debt than we used to and because interest ratesâ.â.â.âat least a month or two ago were exceptionally low, that means we remain exposed to changes in those rates,"" he said. ""That why I talk about levelling with people about the public finances [challenges] and our plans to address them."" He added that the UK's exposure to a rise of one percentage point across all interest rates meant adding Â£25bn a year to the government's cost of servicing its debt. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), which represents HR professionals, welcomed the move, but said it would like to see reform of the apprenticeships system to make it more flexible. ""Changing the apprenticeship levy to make it a flexible training levy would achieve a bigger boost to skills development than incentives alone,"" said Lizzie Crowley, skills adviser for the CIPD. She stressed that awareness of traineeships is very low: ""Besides providing additional funding for placements, the government will have to do much more to market them to employers to boost uptake."" The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), which had previously called for flexi-job apprenticeships, said the increase in incentives for employers was ""important"", because the current level of support ""is not leading to enough starts"". ""It will be important in the budget to take wider action to support jobs, including on employers national insurance and reintroducing the jobs retention bonus,"" said the FSB's national chairman Mike Cherry. ""Going forward, the government should consider changing the timings of apprenticeship incentives.""

"George North scores against England in 2019 with Alun Wyn Jones celebrating Six Nations 2021: Wales v England Venue:Principality Stadium, CardiffDate:Saturday, 27 FebruaryKick-off:16:45 GMT Coverage:Live on BBC One, BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru, BBC Sounds, BBC iPlayer & Radio 5 Live, BBC Sport website and app, S4C If you want to know what it is like to play in the heat of a Wales v England international, ask Alun Wyn Jones. The Wales captain will lead his side into Saturday's Principality Stadium showdown having featured in more encounters with England than he has against any other opponent during his record 154 Test appearances. The 35-year-old has made no fewer than 22 successive starts against England since he first lined up against them in 2007. Won nine, lost 13 if you were wondering. Jones has seen pretty much everything this famous fixture has to offer. Yet there will be something new even for him this weekend as Wales aim to complete a Triple Crown. There will be no Principality Stadium capacity crowd creating the cauldron of tension between rival supporters and players. England captain Owen Farrell and Wales skipper Alun Wyn Jones have been team-mates on two British and Irish Lions tours There will be no Welsh singing reverberating around the ground punctuated by choruses of Swing Low, Sweet Chariot in response. Rugby Union Weekly on the Six Nations showdown in Cardiff Fit-again North to win 100th Wales cap Instead, the sides will be greeted by an empty stadium. ""It's a very different one,"" said Jones. ""I know we've already played against England once without a crowd in the Autumn Nations Cup (in Llanelli). ""That was everyone getting through the midst of the pandemic, but this one in the Six Nations is definitely heightened with the excitement that goes around it. ""To be involved is as good as it gets from domestic to international rugby."" Jones' stock remains high, especially among opponents. England coach Eddie Jones has remained remarkably quiet this week in the pre-match build-up. Unnervingly so, for a man who has not been averse to throwing a few verbal grenades to try to unsettle Wales before recent matches. But he has reserved his few words of conflict for his namesake Alun Wyn by warning his players about the prospect of being targeted with wind-ups by the Ospreys second-row. England bring in George and Wilson to face Wales England coach expects Wales captain to 'target' his players Wales skipper Jones repeatedly niggled Kyle Sinckler in the 2019 Six Nations game in Cardiff. The provocation had the desired effect as Sinckler conceded two penalties in quick succession, leading to a pivotal shift in momentum and the red rose prop's substitution on the hour mark in the 21-13 defeat. So Eddie has made a point of it, but Wales' wily leader has seen and heard it all before. He has refused to rise to the bait. ""Our focus is us and that's what we'll maintain going into this game,"" was his only offering in response to media enquiries about Eddie Jones' comments. Next question please. George North with fellow Llandovery College old boys and Wales internationals Alun Wyn Jones and Andy Powell He was more forthcoming on George North becoming just the sixth Welshman to win 100 caps for his country. Jones is the only current Wales player who was involved in North's debut against South Africa in 2010 and they are both former Llandovery College pupils. ""To share someone's first cap is pretty special, to share their 100th is as special, if not more,"" he said. ""It's hard to put into words, but testament to his hard work and the things you don't see. ""It's not just the 80 minutes or the nine-to-five, it's the things people do when they're coming back from injury, facing criticism and going through the mire. ""Those are the things you respect as a fellow professional and George has done them in abundance. To see him leading us out on Saturday will be a special moment for him, his family and for us to be a part of. ""Any professional can keep going through two reasons - selection or desire. George has the second in abundance and that leads onto the first. I'm sure he's got plenty more in there.""

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak is set to announce a Â£126m boost for traineeships in England in his Budget on Wednesday. The scheme will include a new ""flexi-job"" apprenticeship that will enable apprentices to work with a number of different employers in one sector. Unemployment is at its highest level in almost five years, with younger and typically lower-paid workers bearing the brunt of job losses. Mr Sunak said it was ""vital"" support continued to get people back into work. The chancellor's boost to existing apprenticeship and traineeship programmes will include playing up to double the current cash incentive to firms who take on an apprentice, regardless of age. It comes as a new government guarantee for low-deposit mortgagesis announced as part of next week's measures.

"Demonstrators are calling for a rise in the US minimum wage - but it will be difficult to get through Congress President Joe Biden's $1.9tn (Â£1.4tn) relief plan to help Americans during the Covid pandemic has been approved in the House of Representatives. The vote was along partisan lines. Two Democrats joined Republicans - who see it as too expensive - in opposing it. The bill must now go to the evenly-divided Senate, which has already blocked a key element - doubling the US minimum wage to $15 an hour. The package seeks to boost vaccinations and testing, and stabilise the economy. Biden's Covid stimulus plan: It costs $1.9tn but what's in it? Can Biden succeed in economic rescue mission? How the pandemic has changed the world economy The cash would be extended as emergency financial aid to households, small businesses and state governments. Unemployment is close to 10%, with some 10 million jobs lost in the pandemic. The vote comes in the same week the US passed 500,000 coronavirus-related deaths - the largest figure of any nation in the world. In brief remarks at the White House on Saturday, President Biden hailed the House's approval of the plan, saying he hoped it would receive ""quick action"" at the Senate. ""We have no time to waste,"" he said. ""If we act now, decisively, quickly and boldly we can finally get ahead of this virus, we can finally get our economy moving again. And the people in this country have suffered far too much for too long. We need to relieve that suffering."" Joe Biden had appealed for bipartisan unity when he took office last month, but there was little on show in the early hours of Saturday when the Democrats scraped the bill through on a 219 to 212 vote. President Biden has championedwhat he calls the American Rescue Plan,externalas a way to help struggling Americans through Covid-19. But Republicans say the plan is unnecessarily large and stuffed with Democratic priorities unrelated to the pandemic. The divisions were reflected by the representatives. Democrat Brendan Boyle said: ""After 12 months of death and despair, the American recovery begins tonight."" The leader of the Republicans in the House, Kevin McCarthy, said: ""Democrats are so embarrassed by all the non-Covid waste in this bill that they are jamming it through in the dead of night."" This video can not be played The 'colourful' lives lost to Covid - how obituaries are helping us all mourn It is the third major US spending package of the pandemic, and actually not quite as big as Donald Trump's $2tn last March. The key elements include: A $1,400 cheque per person, although payments phase out for higher incomes Extending jobless benefits until the end of August to help the more than 11 million long-term unemployed Parents of children under the age of 18 to get a year of monthly benefits $70bn to boost Covid testing and vaccinations Financial support for schools and universities to help them reopen Grants for small businesses and other targeted industries Funds for local government One of the other major elements is the increase of the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour - where it has been since 2009 - to $15. But on Thursday, Elizabeth MacDonough, the non-partisan Senate parliamentarian - who interprets its rules - said that raising the minimum wage would violate the budgetary limits allowed in this kind of measure. Unemployed in the US: 'I don't know what to do The bill that passed in the House does still include the increase and it remains unclear how the issue can be resolved. The minimum wage rise remains a key Democrat goal, particularly for the party's progressive wing, and some top Democrats are considering a measure to penalise employers who pay less than $15 an hour. Republicans argue the minimum wage increase would be too heavy a toll on firms struggling to rebuild following the Covid-19 outbreak. Mr McCarthy has said the only way out of Covid is to ""fully reopen our economy"". The package goes to the Senate - spilt evenly between Democrats and Republicans 50-50 - probably next week. The rules of the Senate do allow a reconciliation bill like this to be passed on a simple majority, rather than 60-40. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said it would be ""catastrophic"" if no bill were passed In the event of a tie, Democrat Vice-President Kamala Harris gets the deciding vote. Traditionally, the text the Senate agrees then has to be reconciled with the House bill. The single bill is voted on again and passed to the president for signing. Democrats are confident a bill will go through, but the minimum wage issue is problematic. Senator Bernie Sanders was among those angry that ""archaic"" procedural rules were blocking the increase. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said a bill will still pass, even if this section is taken out by the Senate. Work will still need to be done with lawmakers to get a version of the bill over the line. The Democrats want it done by 14 March at the latest. How are other economies dealing with the downturn? Covid vaccine tracker: How's my country doing?

"A private family funeral has been held for Captain Sir Tom Moore, who raised more than Â£33m for NHS charities during lockdown last year ""You may be gone but your message and spirit lives on,"" Capt Sir Tom's daughter says at the 100-year-old's funeral Capt Sir Tom was ""a remarkable man who truly represented the best of us"", Sir Tim Exton, Commanding Officer of the Yorkshire Regiment, says A further 290 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus case, and there are 7,434 new cases More than 20 million doses of Covid vaccines have been administered in the UK - and more than 19.6m people have had their first jab UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak says he'll use the Budget to level with people about the state of the economy in the wake of the coronavirus crisis President Joe Biden's $1.9tn (Â£1.4tn) relief plan to help Americans during the pandemic is approved in the House of Representatives Auckland, New Zealand's biggest city, will go into a seven-day lockdown from Sunday after one new case of coronavirus is detected The lockdown impacts the England women's cricket team's tour of NZ, with the next three matches now to be played behind closed doors Edited by James Clarke We're bringing our live page coverage to a close shortly. Before we do, here are some of the main stories we've been covering today: Today's live page team has been: James Clarke, Victoria Lindrea, Hamish Mackay and Lauren Turner. We'll be back with more tomorrow. Katy PrickettBBC News Shanise Fowler was so frustrated at delays in her care that she paid for a private consultation Some people living with the incurable autoimmune disease lupus have had treatments delayed or cancelled during the coronavirus pandemic. But they also told Cambridge University researchers they now feel more understood by society because ""there is a lot more awareness of vulnerable people who need to shield"", as one patient put it. Melanie Sloan isleading the research team,external, which includes rheumatologists, behavioural scientists, expert patients and the charity Lupus UK. She also has lupus herself. Sloan hopes lupus can benefit from the type of support that is emerging for ""long Covid"" patients and believes they share similar life-changing symptoms such as severe fatigue and pain. Read what three patients had to sayabout their experience of living with lupus during lockdown. The Durham Miners' Gala, one of the largest trade union-organised events in Europe,has been cancelled for the second year running because of coronavirus. The first gala was hosted in 1871 and the 150th anniversary event was due to take place on 10 July. Only world wars and strikes - the General Strike in 1926 and Miners' Strike in 1984 - have previously stopped the gathering from taking place. Easington's Labour MP Graeme Morris says the Durham Miners' Association feels there is not enough time to organise the event, assuming the roadmap for easing lockdown stays as it is. ""Reluctantly, they had to take this decision rather than commit time and resources. It's disappointing but I think it's wise,"" he says. ""A gala of 100,000 people would be terrible if it put people at risk."" A German radio host hasapologised after comparing K-pop group BTS to the coronavirus. Matthias Matuschik said he didn't intend to ""racially insult"" BTS - one of the biggest groups in the world - adding that making a connection between the band and Covid was ""completely wrong"". On Wednesday, during his show on Bayern3, Matuschik played the group's cover of Coldplay's ""Fix You"" on his show, calling it ""blasphemy"". ""For this you will be vacationing in North Korea for the next 20 years!"" he added. Matuschik then described BTS as ""some crappy virus that hopefully there will be a vaccine for soon as well"". Many took to social media to share their outrage at the comments. The station said the presenter ""overshot the mark in his choice of words"" and he did not intend to hurt the feelings of BTS fans. Matuschik said he accepted ""I could have racially insulted many of you, especially the Asian community, with my words"". ""That was never my intention, but I know that in the end it is how the words are received by the recipients - and not how they were meant,"" he added. Labour is accusing the government of ""burying their heads in the sand"" over May's local elections and warns there could be a major disenfranchisement of voters without further action. Deputy leader Angela Rayner says the government has to set out a ""proper plan"" to run the elections safely and is calling for a drive to boost postal voting. The government has already set out guidance for measures including mask-wearing and voters bringing their own pens to the polls. It says a ""comprehensive public information campaign"" will be launched soon. But Labour is warning of ""dangerously crowded polling stations"" and ""long queues"" on election day. Rayner says ministers have ""once again been too slow to act"", saying it is ""completely inexplicable"" they are not urging people to sign up to vote from home. ""With 10 weeks to go, we are yet to see a proper plan from the government setting out how these elections will be run safely while councils face shortages of electoral staff, lack of venues and funding uncertainty,"" she says. Voting on 6 May will include polls for district and county councils in England, for police and crime commissioners and for city mayors, including in London. An Electoral Commission spokeswoman says voters have a range of options including voting in person, by post or by proxy. David Pearson, deputy lieutenant for West Yorkshire, left a floral tribute in Keighley Moving tributes have been paid to Captain Sir Tom Moore by his closest family at a private service in Bedfordshire where the veteran fundraiser was honoured with a flypast, a gun volley and The Last Post. But it is not only in his home village of Marston Moretaine where the 100-year-old, who raised almost Â£33m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, is being remembered. Floral tributes have been left at a memorial to him in Keighley where the ""proud Yorkshireman"" was born. On the day of his funeral, David Pearson, deputy lieutenant for West Yorkshire laid a wreath of 200 white roses, alongside floral posies left by members of the public at the plaque which recognises ""the high esteem in which he is held by his fellow citizens"".  GardaÃ­ (Irish police) in Dublin have been attacked after hundreds of people protesting against Covid-19 restrictions were prevented from gathering in St Stephen's Green. Irish broadcaster RTÃ reported that a number of arrests have been made. Police used batons to push demonstrators down Grafton Street but were attacked with fireworks, cans and bollards, RTÃ said. The Office of Public Works closed the park after orders from police. Read more here. A further 504,493 people in the UK have received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine and 32,773 have had their second dose. This brings the totals to 19,682,048 for first doses and 768,810 for second doses - a total of more than 20 million doses. And looking at the figures for cases and deaths we just brought you, both have fallen since the same time last week. Last Saturday there were 10,406 new cases and 445 further deaths.  More than 20 million vaccine doses have been given - and more than 19 million of those have been first jabs There have been a further 7,434 positive coronavirus tests recorded in the UK, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 4,170,519. The latest government figures also show there have been a further 290 deaths of people who had tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. It brings the total by that measure to 122,705. Police are carrying out spot checks in the hope of deterring people from driving to beauty spots in Wales over the weekend.

Jade Juckeston said there was insufficient support when she was having trouble breastfeeding First-time mothers have been calling for extra support for those going through pregnancy and labour in the pandemic. ZoÃ« O'Donnell, who is due to give birth in May, is planning a home birth after two friends shared their ""traumatic experiences"" of giving birth alone in hospital. One of those friends is Jade Juckeston, who says she believes the level of care she received following the birth of her daughter Hazel has contributed to long-term problems with breastfeeding. She spent two days in Bristol's Southmead Hospital after giving birth in June - with her husband not allowed on the ward. She says there is not enough support from the midwives and nurses when she is having trouble breastfeeding. ""As a new mother you are in a vulnerable and emotional position. I felt really lonely and I know others in the ward did too,"" she adds. North Bristol NHS Trust has now increased some access for those attending maternity services with their pregnant partners. It says it has tried to balance partners' support with protecting people from Covid-19. Read more here.  This video can not be played Golden Globes: Celebrity make-up artists on their job in the pandemic The film award season kicks off in Hollywood tomorrow, with this year's Golden Globes being celebrated in a largely virtual ceremony. A-list glamour will be in short supply - with no red carpet and nominees appearing from home. It highlights the impact of the pandemic on make-up artists, as well as hair and wardrobe stylists. Many have seen long stretches of downtime as the film industry has been temporarily shuttered. When they do work, it's nearly impossible to maintain social distance, so they must wear masks and get tested regularly. ""I love doing red carpet,"" says make-up artist Kimberley Bosso. ""It sucks that we can't do it and things are virtual now, but slowly we will get back to normal - we just have to be patient."" By Dominic Bailey ""I've tried to make a routine for myself as much as possible,"" Samantha says A Â£1,750 all-inclusive
break, with food delivered to your hotel door, plus round-the-clock TV might
sound appealing to some. But the reality is
something far less glamorous -hotel quarantine near some of England's busiest
international airports. The enforced
quarantine applies to those who have visited or transited through countries on
the UK's ""red list"". âComing
from Dubai which is a very sociable place and having been a cabin crew manager...

During the service, his daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore described her father as ""a beacon of light and hope to the world"". His other daughter Lucy Teixeira said: ""Daddy, I am so proud of you. You may be gone but your message and your spirit lives on."" Read more here. The couple had been due to celebrate their golden wedding anniversary this year A daughter has describedthe ""horrific"" anguish of losing both parents to Covid, just two weeks apart. Ray and Rosemary Scovell, from Sandown, on the Isle of Wight, had been looking forward to their golden wedding anniversary when Ray, 76, fell ill. Claire Apsey and grandson, Simon, says the family's grief has been compounded by lockdown. She says she felt ""guilty"" for being unable to give her parents the send-off they deserved, describing the funeral arrangements as ""clinical"". Mr and Mrs Scovell were well known for their work in the community. Her father was responsible for bringing sporting events, such as Parkrun, to the island - and was ably supported by his wife. When Mr Scovell was admitted to hospital in early January, Claire and her son moved in with her mum, who had developed short-term memory loss. ""When Dad died she would forget, so we would have to explain again,"" says daughter Claire, adding: ""She was heartbroken."" Barely more than a week after her husband's death, Mrs Scovell suffered a fall and, while in hospital, tested positive for the virus. She died five days later. ""It's been horrific really... The hardest thing is not being able to share the grief."" A woman who is deaf blind says she's been left feeling alone after giving birth during the pandemic. Bethany Fanthom, 27, gave birth to son Freddie on 11 March last year. She's calling for more support for disabled people's mental health and says she has felt isolated, with Covid restrictions cutting off most of her support. Ms Fanthom, from Halesowen, West Midlands, communicates with sign language and has tunnel vision - a loss of her peripheral view that makes it hard to watch her baby son while doing household jobs such as cooking and cleaning. While she lives with her fiancÃ©, his work keeps him away from the home most of the day. She says she has no one to speak to who's in a similar situation. ""I've not been able to meet any other moms with disabilities, nor have I been able to take my son on any play dates or outings,"" she says. ""Feeling isolated has had a huge impact on my mental health and physical health as I am forever reliant on my family for all my social needs."" The Sense charity is calling on the government to do more to support disabled people who it says have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. If you're just joining us, we reported earlier on the funeral of Captain Sir Tom Moore, who helped raise more than Â£33m for NHS charities during lockdown last year. Hannah Ingram-Moore described her father as ""a beacon of light and hope to the world"". His other daughter, Lucy Teixeira, said: ""Daddy, I am so proud of you. You may be gone but your message and your spirit lives on."" You can read a fuller version of the day's events here. Relatives of Captain Sir Tom Moore have spoken of their ""pride"" during his funeral. The service for the 100-year-old, who raised almost Â£33m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, began with him being honoured by the military. Six Yorkshire Regiment members carried his coffin, draped in the union jack, and an honour guard fired volleys. Below are some images from the day. There was a flypast ahead of the funeral service Eight members of Capt Sir Tom's family attended the service Members of the Yorkshire Regiment took part in the ceremony By Vikas Pandey and Soutik Biswas Social distancing measures are not being strictly followed After reporting a significant drop in the number of Covid-19 cases for months, some Indian states have seen a sharp uptick in infections in February. In early February, physicians in Amravati district, some 700km (435 miles) from India's commercial capital, Mumbai, noticed a sudden surge in the number of people suffering from Covid-19. Life in this cotton-growing district in the western state of Maharashtra had almost returned to normal after the first wave of infections last summer. The ICUs of the 1,600-bed state-run hospital and half-a-dozen private hospitals were nearly empty. ""But everything changed in February,"" says Anil Jadhav, a local journalist. ""And now there's panic in the district."" Since the beginning of February, Amravati has recorded more than 10,000 cases, and there has been a similar rise in neighbouring districts. Maharashtra recorded nearly 9,000 cases on Thursday, the largest single-day spike in four months. ""People here have been not wearing masks. They have been attending unregulated mass gatherings such as marriages and campaigns for local elections. ""There is free intermingling of people, carriers are not getting isolated, and testing and tracking is low. This has led to this situation,"" Dr Sanjay Oak, a member of the state's Covid task force, tells the BBC. Â© 2025 BBC.

"NI has remained part of the EU's single market for goods and continues to enforce EU customs rules at its ports Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) agriculture minister has ordered officials to stop work on new permanent border control posts (BCPs). These are used to check food products from GB. Existing temporary BCPs are continuing to operate. The minister, Gordon Lyons, said he had also asked officials to stop recruiting BCP staff. Three Stormont ministers have formally requested an emergency meeting of the NI Executive over the move. It is understood officials are seeking legal advice on whether they can follow Mr Lyons' orders. The BCPs are a requirement of the Brexit deal between the UK and EU. Mr Lyons said he was responding to ""practical difficulties"" caused by the Northern Ireland Protocol. Gordon Lyons has been accused of doing ""a solo run"" He said there was too much uncertainty around the end of the protocol grace periods. ""It's a real nightmare for us and it's going to be causing us an awful lot of problems."" The Northern Ireland Protocol is the part of the Brexit deal that prevents a hardening of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods. That has created a new trade border with Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. What are Brexit border controls between GB and NI? Currently, there are grace periods in place that mean checks and controls on goods going from GB to NI are not yet fully implemented. The first of the grace periods, which covers food and parcels, is due to end in April. Mr Lyons' predecessor as agriculture minister, Edwin Poots, had sought legal advice on whether he could instruct his officials not to operate the BCPs but was told that would be unlawful. Infrastructure Minister Nicola Mallon, of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), Finance Minister Conor Murphy, of Sinn FÃ©in, and Justice Minister Naomi Long, of the Alliance Party, wrote to ministerial colleagues, calling for an urgent meeting of the Northern Ireland Executive on Friday evening. ""This controversial and cross-cutting matter requires the executive to meet as a matter of urgency,"" they said. Alliance MP Stephen Farry said the move was ""illegal"" and ""self-defeating"". ""Focus has to be on achieving agreed practical solutions,"" he wrote on social media. Ms Mallon told BBC News NI the Mr Lyons' decision ""is clearly controversial, it is clearly cross cutting and it clearly can't have any effect without the executive agreement and that's why it's essential that we meet tonight and that we take action on this unilateral solo run by the DUP minister"".

Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said the DUP ""must own the consequences of Brexit"" and the Northern Ireland Protocol is a ""direct consequence of Brexit"". She added that the ""solo run by DUP Minister for Agriculture Gordon Lyons instructing his officials to halt work on further infrastructure, and charging at the ports is clearly a stunt"". Ms O'Neill said that there was no alternative to the Northern Ireland Protocol. Sinn FÃ©in MLA Declan McAleer, who is chair of Stormont's agriculture committee, said he has sought an urgent meeting with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs' permanent secretary. Responding to Mr Lyons' decision, the Labour Party's Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Louise Haigh MP said the unilateral action would ""only cause further uncertainty"" and it was ""uncertainty businesses and communities cannot afford"". She said: ""We need to see joint, workable solutions that reduce checks and red tape for businesses across the Irish Sea. That must be the focus, not further instability. ""The UK has responsibilities under the protocol that cannot be ignored."" A UK Government spokesperson said: ""This is a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive.

"A mortgage guarantee scheme to help people with small deposits get on the property ladder is set to be announced at next week's Budget. The government will offer incentives to lenders, bringing back 95% mortgages which have ""virtually disappeared"" during the pandemic, the Treasury says. Chancellor Rishi Sunak says public finances are facing a ""challenge"" from the pandemic's impact on the economy. The government has borrowed Â£271bn this financial year - up Â£222bn on 2019-20. This has pushed the national debt to Â£2.13 trillion. Explaining the government's economic response to the pandemic, Mr Sunaktold the Financial Times,external: ""We went big, we went early, but there is more to come and there will be more to come in the Budget. But there is a challenge [in the public finances] and I want to level with people about the challenge."" He added: ""I will do whatever it takes to protect the British people through this crisis and I remain committed to that."" Former Conservative chancellor Lord Clarke called for Mr Sunak to raise taxes in order to bring the UK's finances under control, and warned ""if we don't get it under control before inflation comes back then we will face a financial crisis"". What is the Budget and when will it happen? 'Furlough is a lifeline, I hope they extend it' Sunak injecting Â£126m to boost traineeship scheme The question of tax rises is one the chancellor will need to address when he unveils his Budget in a Commons speech on Wednesday. In the run-up to the 2019 election, the Conservatives promised not to increase income tax, National Insurance Contributions or VAT - but Mr Sunak could argue circumstances have changed. Carlisle MP John Stevenson, of the Conservative Northern Research Group, said it was ""too early"" for tax rises, saying UK still had a few months of the pandemic to get through and he wanted to see continuing support. But Lord Clarke said the pandemic had been ""unfair financially"" on ""the poor, the young, the low-paid, the vulnerable"" and suggested making people who continue in full-time work after the age of 65 pay the same taxes as younger people. Labour has criticised the government for a ""stop, start"" approach to support measures during the pandemic. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Doddstold the Times,externalher party did not support an ""immediate"" increase in corporation tax but would welcome longer-term rises and said she wanted a ""more progressive tax system"". The chancellor is also expected to announce anÂ£126m scheme for traineeships in England. It will include a new ""flexi-job"" apprenticeship, enabling apprentices to work with different employers in one sector. With unemployment at its highest level for almost five years, Mr Sunak said this was ""vital"" support for getting people back into work. Mortgage providers will only lend to those with a regular income, irrespective of any government incentive. But young adults' finances, and their employment prospects, have been hit hard by this pandemic. It was the same in the financial crisis of a decade ago. That is why jobs will be central to this Budget - both protecting them now and creating them in the future to aid an economic recovery. While the chancellor may be able to borrow fairly cheaply now to pay for that support, the prospect of future tax rises to foot the bill will no doubt be addressed too. Covid has led everyone to face the realities of home, work, and working from home. On Wednesday, many will be looking to Mr Sunak to save their jobs and keep a roof over their heads - whether they own it, or not. The new mortgage scheme is not restricted to first-time buyers or new-build homes, but there will be a Â£600,000 limit. The coronavirus pandemic has meant there are now few low-deposit mortgages available, the Treasury said, with just eight on the market in January. They are often seen as riskier by banks as they are more vulnerable to negative changes in property prices - meaning people hold more debt than their home is worth. Under the scheme, which will launch across the UK in April, the government will offer to take on some of this risk. It is based on the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme, whichclosed to new loans at the end of 2016, a policy the Treasury said ""reinvigorated the market for high loan-to-value lending after the 2008 financial crisis"". But housing charity Shelter said that schemeincreased house prices,externalby 1.4%. Shadow housing secretary Thangam Debbonaire also raised concerns, saying young people needed ""genuinely affordable"" new houses to be built and did not want to go ""back to the days of sky-high mortgages"". The new scheme could coincide with the expected end of a stamp duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland on 31 March - though this may yet be extended. 4 ways it may get harder for first-time buyers Help to Buy deadline extended amid Covid delays Did Help to Buy help first-time buyers? Next week's announcement is also expected to include a new Â£100m taskforce to crack down on fraudsters who have exploited support schemes, such as furlough. Tax officials have opened about 10,000 inquiries into suspected fraudulent activity, the government said. THAT PETER CROUCH PODCAST:What does a young player go through in order to make it to the top?
