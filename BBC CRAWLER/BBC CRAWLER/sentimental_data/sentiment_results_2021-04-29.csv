"The 14-day average of deaths has been falling though the number remains high The number of deaths related to Covid-19 has passed 400,000 in Brazil, the second-highest in the world, as the country continues to struggle with its vaccination programme. There were 3,001 deaths in 24 hours, after a peak of more than 4,000 was reached at the start of April. The 14-day average of deaths and cases remains high but has seen a slight fall. Congress has opened an inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic. President Jair Bolsonaro, who has frequently spoken out against lockdowns, masks and defended unproved drugs as treatment, is facing widespread criticism and his support has plummeted. The outbreak has been fuelled by more transmissible variants of the virus and a lack of co-ordinated national measures. The situation has improved in many areas, including where the health system was on the brink of collapse, after states and cities imposed restrictions, but they are already being eased. Why are so many babies dying of Covid-19 in Brazil? Hunger hits Brazil's slums amid Covid surge Covid - what's gone wrong in Brazil? The rate of occupancy of intensive care unit beds remains at or above 90% in more than a third of the states, according to the health institute Fiocruz, which said the scenario remained ""critical"". ""[There's] a tendency of a slight fall but not yet of containment of the epidemic,"",externalthe institute said in a report (in Portuguese), warning that the daily number of deaths is likely to remain high. Brazil recorded 100,000 deaths in just 37 days, between March and April, which were the worst months in the country. Only the US has a higher death toll. Since the start of the pandemic, Brazil has had more than 14.5 million cases. Meanwhile, some cities have had to temporarily halt their vaccination programmes amid a shortage of doses.About 13% of the population of 212 million has received at least one dose,,externalaccording to the Our World in Data tracker. By Mark Lowen, BBC News, SÃ£o Paulo It is a horrific toll that Brazil may not have reached if vaccines had been bought more quickly and lockdowns imposed. But President Bolsonaro has been reluctant to act - and Brazil is now mourning more than 400,000 dead. Only around 13% of Brazilians have received one vaccine dose and 6% both shots: slow procurement is one of the issues a senate inquiry will now examine, since the government turned down offers of tens of millions of shots from Pfizer last year. The parliamentary commission could recommend the president's impeachment or even criminal charges. Mr Bolsonaro has been bullish as ever, threatening to send in the army to stop states locking down. And his supporters claim the government could not have purchased vaccine doses sooner, since it was waiting for approval from Brazil's health regulator. The pandemic has fed Brazil's deep political polarisation. Mr Bolsonaro is playing to his conservative support base - but polls show it is shrinking as Brazil continues to count its dead. On Tuesday,a Senate commission started an official inquiryinto the Bolsonaro government's response to Covid-19. They have the power to demand documents and call on witnesses to testify, and the findings can be submitted to authorities with the ability to prosecute. The commission will investigate a number of actions, including slow vaccine procurement by the president, his repeated statements downplaying the severity of the virus, and the promotion of scientifically unproven drugs such as hydroxychloroquine. It will also analyse whether the government was negligent in the oxygen crisis in Amazonas state, which was ravaged by a more infectious variant earlier this year, and if indigenous communities in the Amazon were left without assistance, in what critics have described as possible genocide. This video can not be played Looking after the babies and children in Brazil's Covid ICU The inquiry could add to calls for impeachment of the president, though analysts say that is unlikely to happen. But the proceedings and possible revelations can cause serious damage to President Bolsonaro, who is almost certain to run for re-election next year, whenhis main rival could be former leftist President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva. President Bolsonaro said he was ""not worried"" by the inquiry. Since the start of the pandemic, he has opposed any lockdown measures arguing that the damage to the economy would be worse than the effects of the virus itself, a position shared by many of his supporters. In a separate development,the Russian developer of the Sputnik V vaccine has said it will sue,externalBrazil's health regulator Anvisa for defamation in a row over the product. Anvisa has denied state requests to approve the vaccine for import, and raised concerns about the make up of Sputnik V. At a press conference on Thursday, officials from the regulator condemned the Russian developer's ""grave accusation"".

"France entered a third national lockdown on 3 April France will allow cafes, bars and restaurants to serve outside and relax a nightly curfew in a planned easing of lockdown measures starting next month. The four-stage plan outlined by President Emmanuel Macron aims to largely reopen the country by 30 June. Foreign tourists with a Covid-19 ""health pass"" will be allowed to visit France again from 9 June. France's infection rate has fallen since introducing a third lockdown, but numbers remain high in some areas. Detailing his much-anticipated plans to a group of French newspapers, Mr Macron said he wanted ease France's restrictions in four stages: On 3 May, secondary-school and high-school pupils will start returning to in-person classes. Rules on travelling will end On 19 May, a current 19:00 (17:00 GMT) nightly curfew will be pushed back to 21:00. Cafes and restaurants will be able to reopen outside. Non-essential shops, cinemas, museums and theatres will be able to open, with restrictions on visitors. On 9 June, the curfew will pushed back again to 23:00. A ""health pass"" will be introduced for those attending stadiums and large events, and for foreign tourists entering the country On 30 June, the curfew will be lifted completely but nightclubs will remain shut While Mr Macron said he hoped the measures would ease across the whole country, an ""emergency brake"" could be used ""in territories where the virus is too present"".

But they will need to show apass sanitaire- or health pass - the details of which have not yet been revealed. A pass will also be needed to attend large events. ""The health pass should not be mandatory for access to everyday things such as restaurants, theatres and cinemas or to go see friends,"" Mr Macron said. ""But for places with big crowds, such as stadiums, festivals, trade fairs or exhibitions, it would be absurd not to use it"". How is Europe dealing with the third wave? Can I go on a foreign holiday this summer? Spain plans to welcome tourists under EU scheme France entered a third national lockdown on 3 April, as it battled a surge in cases that threatened to overwhelm hospitals. The daily number of new cases has fallen since then, from around 40,000 to 27,000 on average over the past week. A further 324 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours. The total number killed by the pandemic in France is now at least 104,079, Johns Hopkins University estimates. The president was strongly criticised for rejecting calls to order a third national lockdown earlier to bring down a spike in infections. Mr Macron said it was time to start ""resuming our French-style way of life"", and people needed ""conviviality"", culture and sport. But he added that people needed to remain ""careful and responsible"".

"Bethan Rhys Roberts and Nick Servini presented 90 minutes of debate ahead of next week's Senedd election The first hour featured leaders of Labour, the Conservatives, Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and Abolish the Welsh Assembly Reform UK, UKIP and the Green Party took part in the second part of the programme The Senedd election takes place on Thursday 6 May Rachel Flint and Andy Roberts Thanks for joining us for our live coverage of the BBC Wales Election 2021 Leaders' Debate. If you missed any of it, or want to watch it again, the programme will be available on demand via theBBC iPlayervery shortly, or via the video link at the top of this page. We'll have more live page coverage next week of the final week of the Senedd election campaign and results day next Friday 7 May. Good night and sleep well. The BBC Wales Election 2021 Leaders' Debate is now over, withpandemic support for businessbeing one of the main points of contention. Labour's Mark Drakeford said Â£200m was waiting to be spent by the next first minister after the election to give firms hit by the pandemic more help. But Plaid Cymru's Adam Price questioned why it could not have been spent before the vote. Conservative Andrew RT Davies said there was unallocated cash in Welsh government coffers. Jane Dodds said the Welsh Liberal Democrats would support medium, small and micro-businesses. Meanwhile Abolish the Welsh Assembly's Richard Suchorzewski said control of the NHS should be returned to the UK government. Read more here. In his closing remarks, Jamie Jenkins of Reform UK said people tell him
âthey donât trust politiciansâ. But he added voters put their trust in Reform UK when it was
the Brexit Party by giving them an âoverwhelming majorityâ of the UK's MEPs in the 2019 European Parliament election. He said, as a result, they delivered Brexit ""for the people"". Mr Jenkins added that next week is another opportunity for
voters to put their trust in Reform UK to deliver once again. âWe want to reform the Senedd - we donât want to abolish, we
donât want independence, we just want to make Wales a better placeâ, he said. In his closing contribution, UKIP's Neil Hamilton said: âThe idea that the Senedd in any way
represents ordinary people in Wales is nonsense, and itâs proved by the
reaction of Welsh politicians in the Senedd to Brexit. ""53% of the people of
Wales voted for Brexit but 80% of the members of the Senedd voted to remain,"" he said. ""The Welsh Government, aided and abetted by Plaid Cymru and the LibDems in
the last four and a half years, did their best to frustrate the result of the
referendum which was your decision as to the future of Wales. ""Wales is the
poorest part of the UK, weâre poorer today than 22 years ago. Weâve had a
permanent Labour government and weâre going to get a Labour government again
after the 6th of May, because Plaid Cymru are already cosying up to
Mark Drakeford.â In her closing remarks Amelia Womack asked electors to âvote Greenâ so as not to âwaste your vote.â She said the election was happening at a âcritical point in our
history"" and that ""Green scrutiny is essential to a post-pandemic recoveryâ. Ms Womack said mental health should have âparity with physical healthâ with
an increase in funding for services and staff. She said the underlying causes of mental health
should also be addressed âsuch as unpredictable housing, unpredictable jobs.â On waiting lists, Ms Womack said a âholistic approachâ was
needed for health and social care. Reform UK believes âthe Senedd has its placeâ,
according to Jamie Jenkins. He said his party does not want to give powers back to
Westminster. But he added Reform would campaign to stay in the UK should there be a referendum on independence. One viewer claims that a range of Abolish and UKIP policies could be introduced by a Senedd they want to get rid of. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Jamie Jenkins for Reform UK said his party supports the
development of tidal lagoons. The party also wants to cut business rates and âget Wales
open for businessâ. Mr Jenkins added Reform UK is also in favour of the development
of the M4 relief road. âPeople arenât going to invest in Wales if they think youâre
going to be stuck in a car parkâ, he said. UKIP's Neil Hamilton has argued people must be given the option to scrap the Senedd if an independence referendum is held. He said: âIâm very happy to go with a referendum on
Welsh independence so long as it includes an option that we get rid of the
Senedd, and we move to a system where we transfer power not from one set of
politicians from Cardiff to Westminster or vice versa but we actually transfer
power to the people.â The Green Party would âsupport a referendum and we would
support an independence vote in that referendumâ, according to its deputy leader in England and Wales. âIt's clear that there's been a poverty of ambition from
Westminster,"" said Amelia Womack. âI want to bring steel into this actually, because we know
that during the Brexit negotiations that steel wasn't considered important by
Westminster - but that's jobs and lives in Wales not considered important."" On the finances of an independent Wales, Ms Womack said the
UK was already in debt and that green investment could be harnessed in Wales. âIt is how we invest in a future that isn't hampered by the
lack of ambition from Westminster.â Speaking
on the climate emergency, UKIP's Neil Hamilton said: âRenewable energy is much more
expensive than conventional fuel. ""Weâre actually burdening the poorest people
in the UK (in Wales) with extra costs for fuel.â However, Amelia Womack of the Greens denied an accusation by Mr Hamilton that green issues are âa middle class obsession.â Ms Womack said that the âpoorest communities will be harmed
most by these issues.â In his opening statement, Jamie Jenkins for Reform UK drew on
his experience of growing up on a council estate. He said 22 years of devolution has brought inequality and
the life expectancy gap for newborns between England and Wales has doubled. Mr Jenkins added that under Reform UKâs previous guise as the
Brexit Party, voters delivered them a majority of UK MEPs in the 2019 European elections. He said voting for Reform UK next week âcan deliver and reform
the Seneddâ. Amelia Womack from the Green Party says that a vote for green
jobs is a vote to ârebuild a post-pandemic Wales fit for the 21st Century.â Asked how she would rebuild the economy while guarding the
environment, Ms Womack said: ""All of our recovery should have the
environment at the heart of it, because it means jobs and opportunities, it
means training and education, and it means that we're tackling the biggest
problems of our time.â Ms Womack said that Wales could not ignore the âclimate
emergency when people around Wales are experiencing flooding, coastal towns are
potentially at risk of being destroyed due to rising sea levelsâ. She also said that it was âsimply not trueâ that jobs would
be lost due to her partyâs green targets, and that âgreen steelâ would be a key
part of the future, ""Steel isnât at risk,"" Ms Womack insisted. UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton said: âDevolution has failed Wales. ""Itâs
the poorest part of the United Kingdom, and weâre poorer today relative to the
rest of the country than we were twenty years ago, despite 22 years of
Labour government propped up as necessary by Plaid and the LibDems. ""Welsh government doesnât have the money for major infrastructure improvements like
the M4, it doesnât have the money to provide us with decent public services
like health and education. ""The NHS is a shambles with 5 of the 7 health boards
in special measuresâ¦ our school results are the worst in the United Kingdom, we
have a housing crisis and yet the Welsh Government grandstands by saying we are
a nation of sanctuary.â With the first part of the programme over, three other parties begin to air their views with presenter Nick Servini moderating. The participants are Jamie Jenkins of Reform UK, Amelia Womack of the Green Party and Neil Hamilton of UKIP.  In
his closing remarks seeking votes for the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew RT Davies said: âWhen the Welsh rugby team doesnât perform on the pitch, we donât scrap the
Welsh Rugby Union or cancel the team playing in the Six Nations. ""We change the
coaching staffâ¦ letâs run with it, letâs get back playing this game so Wales is
at the top of the league table, not at the bottom.â In her closing statement, Jane Dodds called on voters to
âimagineâ a better Wales. The Welsh Lib Dem leader outlined some of her partyâs key policies on reforming
the high street, improving mental health services and delivering greener homes. Ms Dodds added that the Liberal Democrats wanted to âput the
climate at the heart of everything we didâ. âThatâs the sort of Wales that we wantâ, she said. In his closing
statement, Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford said people had told him over the last month they were glad to have lived in Wales during the pandemic. âAnd thatâs
because Labour values are your values too,"" he said. âI am asking for
your vote so I can help finish the job and guide Wales on to that brighter
future.â Richard
Suchorzewski, the leader of the Abolish The Welsh Assembly Party, said people needed âto
wake upâ and vote for his party to âsave Wales and save the unionâ. He said it
was time to stop Wales âsleep walking to independenceâ. In his closing statement, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price says there is  âhope of a new
beginning"" with a spring election. âThe future is in our hands in seven daysâ time,"" he said. ""We can
write this future together, we can right all the wrongs of all the years - a
future without poverty, without homelessness, without hunger â a future that
will be better than the past, because we will build it together.â Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.96948135

"Edinson Cavani has scored 10 goals in 13 appearances against Roma Bruno Fernandes and Edinson Cavani both scored twice as Manchester United came from behind to take a major step towards sealing a place in next month's Europa League final. Fernandes gave United a perfect start in their semi-final with Italian side Roma when he swept home Cavani's first-time lay-off. Paul Pogba's handball allowed Lorenzo Pellegrini to equalise before the Roma skipper's pass allowed former Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko to score his sixth goal in five Old Trafford appearances to turn the tie on its head by half-time. But United rallied after the break. Cavani levelled with a superb first-time effort before tapping the hosts back in front when substitute keeper Antonio Mirante pushed Aaron Wan-Bissaka's angled shot into his path. Relive the action from Manchester United v Roma in the Europa League Solskjaer wants Cavani to stay at Man Utd Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men were in no mood to let their advantage slip a second time, although it took a fortunate penalty for what seemed to be an innocuous Chris Smalling tackle on Cavani to give Fernandes the chance add a fourth from the spot. Pogba then powered home a precise header from Fernandes' cross before Greenwood ran on to Cavani's pass and drove home United's sixth, making them the first side to score six goals in a major European semi-final since Real Madrid in the 1964 European Cup. Manchester United scored six goals in a single match in European competition for the first time since netting seven against Roma in April 2007 The final scoreline did not quite match United's epic 7-1 Champions League triumph against the same opponents in 2007 but for Solskjaer, a substitute on that famous night, it was just as sweet. After four successive semi-final defeats in 15 months, the Norwegian really needs to get beyond that stage to silence his doubters, some of whom were never convinced he should have succeeded Jose Mourinho as United boss and point to an absence of silverware that both his predecessor and Louis van Gaal delivered in shorter reigns at the club. Solskjaer's double fist-pump reaction to Cavani's equaliser underlined the importance of the Uruguayan's superb effort, swept into the top corner and part of a two-goal, three-assist contribution from the striker, whose contract expires in the summer. For once, it meant Fernandes had to share top billing as he claimed two assists to go with his brace - although after a below-par couple of months, the Portuguese seems to have recovered his form at the right time. Pogba is United's other big-name player and the midfielder ended an up-and-down night very much on the positive side, celebrating his header in style as the pressure was released. Greenwood's effort means only a catastrophe in the second leg can prevent United reaching their eighth European final. If there is one doubt over United's ability to lift their first silverware under Solskjaer in Poland next month, it comes from the goals they conceded. There has been a long-standing feeling that the bare statistics around United's defence do not portray a true picture of their abilities. They had conceded just one goal in six Europa League knockout ties prior to this evening - but it cannot be forgotten one of those that landed them in the competition in the first place was the ridiculous non-marking of Demba Ba during the shock Champions League defeat by Istanbul Basaksehir. There was nothing on that scale - but in the modern era, Pogba was never going to get away with the ball hitting an outstretched, raised arm as he slid in to tackle Rick Karsdorp. And the way Pellegrini was allowed so much space to drift into before supplying the low cross that invited Dzeko's finish highlighted a total lack of awareness on Fred's part. Having let Pellegrini run free to devastating effect once, United should not have allowed it again after the break. They were fortunate the Roma skipper elected to pass rather than shoot from inside the box, just as David de Gea got lucky when the rebound flew to safety when he cannoned a clearance downfield straight into Dzeko, who was on his own on the edge of the area. In the end though, the Italians simply did not have the quality needed to get a result that would give them a chance in next week's return, although they were hardly helped by having to make three injury-related substitutions before half-time. Manchester United's next game is in the Premier League against Liverpool at Old Trafford on Sunday, 2 May (16:30 BST). This video can not be played I'm doing my best to keep Cavani - Solskjaer Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer told BT Sport:""No, I don't feel the job is done but it was a good job done. We did well but we know they have quality - the second half was very good. ""It's easy thinking who should play, but who should not play? ""That's a very good team, it worked really good against Tottenham. Mason Greenwood should be disappointed not to be playing but it's about balance. We know we have got creative players who can create big moments. Paul Pogba's position today was very good in that position, he's allowed some freedom. He's got the foundation behind him. The difference today is we took most of our chances. ""The character showed that they came back and didn't lose their heads. Maybe five or 10 minutes at the end of the first half we didn't look great, but we got ourselves together. The two goals are junior, schoolboy errors that shouldn't happen at this level."" Manchester United are the first side to score six in the semi-final of a major European competition since May 1964 when Real Madrid beat FC Zurich 6-0 in the European Cup second leg. Roma are the first Italian side to ship six goals in the semi-final of a European competition. Roma became the first side to make three substitutions in the first-half of a Europa League game (since 2009). Bruno Fernandes (20) is only the third player in Manchester United's history to score 20+ penalties, after Ruud van Nistelrooy (28) and Wayne Rooney (27). Three of the past four penalties Manchester United have conceded in all competitions have been given away by Paul Pogba, while the Frenchman has conceded four of their past six at Old Trafford. Edinson Cavani made it 50 goals in major European competition (15 in the Europa League, 35 in the Champions League), with the Manchester United attacker, at 34 years and 74 days, the oldest player to score a brace at the semi-final stage or beyond in major European competition since Philip Cocu (34y 187d) for PSV Eindhoven vs AC Milan in the Champions League semi-finals in 2004-05. Mason Greenwood has scored 27 goals for Manchester United in all competitions, the third-most of any player in the club's history before turning 20 after Norman Whiteside (39) and George Best (37).

"New laws that could leave flat owners facing bills for fire safety measures are ""indefensible"", say Grenfell Tower survivors and bereaved relatives. The Fire Safety Act is aimed at making homes saferfollowing the 2017 blaze, in which 72 people died. But a push to include more financial protections for leaseholders was defeated in a Parliamentary vote, despite a large Tory rebellion. The government has made a Â£5bn fund available to remove cladding. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the government was paying for remedial work to ""thousands of buildings around the country"". She said the act would ""actually help to save lives by changing some of these awful regulations and guidelines that existed previously"". Government defeated again on fire safety measures What makes cladding unsafe and what are your rights? Grenfell Tower management 'was a mini-mafia' After the Grenfell tragedy, thousands of blocks of flats were found to be covered in similar cladding. Other defects were also discovered, leaving leaseholders facing large bills to pay for protective measures such as fire breaks, balconies, safer doors and sprinkler systems. Ministers say a loan scheme will ensure costs are capped at Â£50 a month for safety works and that residents in the tallest tower blocks in England will not have to pay to have cladding removed. Leaseholders have described being trapped in homes they cannot sell, with their lives on hold potentially for years, because lenders will not offer mortgages until the cladding is removed. Reports of the toll on residents' mental health have been widespread. Campaigners say leaseholders should be protected from all remediation costs that have arisen through no fault of their own. Critics, including some Conservative MPs, had argued the government should meet all the costs upfront and then recoup them from property developers. The Grenfell United group, which was set up after the tragedy in west London, said it was ""deeply disappointed that ministers have broken their promises to leaseholders who have done absolutely nothing wrong"". It described the government's position as ""indefensible"", saying it was a ""grave injustice that many innocent leaseholders will be financially ruined over fire safety issues that were not of their own making"", and it accused ministers of ""letting those responsible continue to get off scot-free"". This video can not be played ""It could be anything from bankruptcy to a life of crippling loans"" Lawyer Steph Pike, a leaseholder of a one-bedroom flat in Bristol, said she could be facing a Â£70,000 bill next year to cover the cost of improvement work to her building. She told the BBC the situation was ""completely unbelievable"" and said some days she asked herself: ""Is this even happening?"" ""I'm a lawyer, so I've got a professional qualification that I need to protect and if I have to declare myself bankrupt I'll lose that, so I'll also lose my career."" Rachael Teebay says she has ""spent days and weeks crying"" about the situation Leaseholder Rachael Teebay bought her first home together with her partner in Manchester, but now she is among thousands facing huge bills. ""I have spent days and weeks crying about it and worrying about our future,"" she told the BBC. ""Declaring bankruptcy at this age, what does that do for our future? It decimates it. It's terrifying."" Stephen Squires, a leaseholder who lives in a tower block in Manchester bearing dangerous cladding, said ministers' reluctance to compromise was ""hugely disappointing and really makes us feel like the government do not grasp the severity of the situation we all find ourselves in through no fault of our own"". He added: ""Our service charge account is running out of money, whilst the freeholder delays things. Eventually we could end up with having the lifts switched off or the electric being cut off to a 20-storey building, which would make it uninhabitable."" The campaigning group End Our Cladding Scandal said the legislation had passed unchanged, ""much to the horror of hundreds of thousands of innocent people across the country whose lives are being ruined by the buildings safety crisis"". It said the government had ""fought hard"" against changes that would have saved leaseholders from ""widespread bankruptcy and financial ruin caused by bad regulations, corporate malfeasance and shoddy building work"". ""This [act] pulls the rug out from under a generation of homeowners"" whose lives were still at risk from unsafe buildings, it added. The group has vowed to continue opposing the reforms, tweeting: ""We have the right to be angry. But the fight isn't over yet."" The new legislation modifies a previous law to clarify that building owners must manage and reduce the risk of fire in their properties. The government was under pressure to get it passed before the end of the parliamentary session on Thursday. It said it struck ""the right balance in protecting leaseholders and being fair to taxpayers"". A Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said ministers were prioritising making the tallest buildings with the most dangerous cladding safer, backed by Â£5bn in funding. ""We have been clear throughout that owners and industry should make buildings safe without passing on costs to leaseholders - and we will ensure they pay for the mistakes of the past with a new levy and tax to contribute to the costs of remediation,"" they added. ""For lower-rise buildings which have a lower risk, our generous capped finance scheme will ensure bills are a maximum of Â£50 per month.""

"Actor and director Noel Clarke has been suspended by Bafta after allegations of sexual harassment, weeks after he received one of its top awards. In a statement, Bafta said it made the decision ""in light of the allegations of serious misconduct""in the Guardian,external. The Kidulthood and Doctor Who actor, 45, was given the outstanding British contribution to cinema prize at a ceremony on 10 April. Clarke has said he ""vehemently"" denies ""any sexual misconduct or wrongdoing"". In a statement he said he intended to ""defend myself against these false allegations"". He added: ""In a 20-year career, I have put inclusivity and diversity at the forefront of my work and never had a complaint made against me. ""If anyone who has worked with me has ever felt uncomfortable or disrespected, I sincerely apologise."" The Guardian reported allegations from 20 women, all of whom knew Clarke in a professional capacity. Bafta said it was suspending his membership and the recently awarded honour ""immediately and until further notice"". Clarke plays the lead role in ITV police drama Viewpoint, which is scheduled to conclude on Friday night Clarke is currently appearing in the successful ITV police drama Viewpoint, a five-part series with episodes airing each evening this week. Its finale is scheduled to be broadcast later. He wrote and starred in the acclaimed film trilogy Kidulthood, Adulthood and Brotherhood - which offered an uncompromising depiction of teenage life on the streets of west London - and directed two of them. The actor and producer, from London, was first recognised by Bafta in 2009, when he won the rising star prize. His first major on-screen role was in Channel 4 drama-comedy Metrosexuality in 2001. In Doctor Who, Clarke played Mickey Smith, the series' first-ever black companion, to the 10th doctor, played by David Tennant. Clarke co-created and starred in the Sky police procedural drama Bulletproof with actor Ashley Walters. He is married to Iris Da Silva, a cosmetic designer, and the couple have three sons. When approached for comment, management and production company 42 M&P said it no longer represented Clarke. Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

"Amy says her flat isn't worth anything until it is made safe The government's fund to pay for the removal of dangerous cladding is woefully inadequate, oversubscribed and taking too long to make buildings safe, campaigners say. More than three and a half years since the Grenfell Tower fire which killed 72 people, an estimated 700,000 people are still living in high-rise blocks with flammable cladding. The Â£1.6bn Building Safety Programme was set up in 2019. Concerns have emerged about the contract that the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government requires applicants to the fund, usually managing agents or building owners, to sign. A clause in the contract, seen by the BBC, indicates applicants will be financially liable for any repair work not covered by the fund. The BBC has learnt that some managing agents are refusing to sign the document, further delaying the repair work, and have written to the government asking ministers to clarify the position. Christian Hansen, a solicitor at Bindmans LLP specialising in housing law and fire safety claims, said the contract showed that ""there's going to be a significant shortfall between the costs of the [repair] works that are required and the funding provided under the scheme"". ""Someone is going to need to pick up the bill and pay the difference. This contract makes clear it's going to be the leaseholders and for many, this could be tens of thousands of pounds, potentially ruinous costs,"" he warned. Mr Hansen said that leaseholders wanted the focus of government action ""to be on the manufacturers of the defective materials and construction companies who built these buildings"". ""At the moment, they are the ones profiting from putting people's lives at risk."" ""It is absolutely terrifying knowing that you are stuck here,"" says Amy First-time buyer Amy Cottenden, who is 28, bought a one-bed flat in Metis Tower in the centre of Sheffield for Â£85,000 in 2017. Inspections of the 14-storey building in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy revealed it had the same type of flammable ACM cladding and other safety faults. Work to remove the cladding started last month, but Ms Cottenden, who is a frontline NHS health worker, is frustrated at what she describes as a lack of progress. ""The pace of work is extremely slow. So far, they've put scaffolding up and removed three panels. They have told us it's going to take between 12 and 24 months just to take the cladding off,"" she said. ""It is absolutely terrifying knowing that you are stuck here. With lockdown, they are saying not to go out, but you are in a building where all you want to do is not be in it. You can't leave. You can't sell. My flat isn't worth anything until it is made safe."" While the government's Building Safety Fund is paying for the Grenfell-style cladding to be removed, the building has other fire safety faults, including missing fire breaks, that aren't covered by the scheme. It could cost up to Â£6m to fix. Flat owners fear they may face huge bills of up to Â£50,000 each. ""We can't pay it and we shouldn't have to pay it. It is not our fault. We could all go bankrupt because of this,"" Ms Cottenden said. Metis Tower is in Sheffield's city centre A spokesperson for Rendall & Rittner, the company which manages Metis Tower, said government funding to remove ACM cladding had been approved totalling Â£6.3m. However, an application to the same fund to pay for the removal of other types of unsafe cladding was rejected and the company has appealed against that decision. The company added: ""We understand and sympathise with residents and owners about the uncertainty that this situation is causing and will do all we can to assist."" The Â£1.6bn Building Safety Programme was set up to remove Grenfell-style cladding, known as ACM cladding Ministers say the cladding has been removed or repairs have started on 95% of affected blocks But analysis ofdata released this week,externalshows that work has been fully completed on just 58% of social housing blocks Meanwhile, in the private sector, cladding repairs have been finished on 30% of blocks. What started as a cladding scandal has now become a much wider building safety crisis, exposing decades of regulatory failure. Safety inspections have revealed that many buildings have other serious faults, including missing fire breaks, flammable balconies and defective insulation. None of that is covered by the government's Building Safety Fund. Dr Nigel Glen, the chief executive of ARMA, the trade association for residential leasehold management, said the additional costs that leaseholders were currently facing for non-cladding-related issues remained a huge concern. ""In the longer term, the draining of reserve funds will also mean that in the years to come, any major works that were being saved up for, such as a new roof or lift repairs, will have to be funded anew by the leaseholders,"" he added. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said that despite the pandemic, significant progress had been made to remove dangerous cladding, but ""building safety remains the responsibility of the building owner and we expect them to ensure any necessary work is carried out safely and effectively"". ""All applicants to the Building Safety Fund are told the amount of funding they have been awarded before being asked to sign contracts - this is clearly explained in the guidance,"" the spokesperson added.

"Sir Simon Stevens stayed in the job to oversee the NHS rollout of Covid vaccinations Sir Simon Stevens is to step down as head of NHS England and become a peer, the government has announced. After seven years in the job, he will leave his role at the end of July after having overseen the Covid vaccination rollout to all adults. Sir Simon had intended to leave sooner but agreed to stay on through last winter. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had ""led the NHS with great distinction"". ""I want to thank him for his dedicated service throughout - but especially when facing the extraordinary pressures of the past year, and for his huge contribution to our vaccine rollout,"" Mr Johnson said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Sir Simon had been ""a steadfast and sage leader for our National Health Service, and that has been especially true during this most testing period in NHS history"". This video can not be played Jonathan Van-Tam vaccinates Health Secretary Matt Hancock He added: ""His leadership has helped NHS staff to overcome unprecedented adversity and keep services open for millions of patients in the face of this global pandemic."" In December, on the first day of the NHS's largest vaccination campaign in the fight against Covid-19,Sir Simon told the BBC it would mark ""a decisive turning point""in the UK epidemic. How old do I have to be to get my vaccine? First vaccine patient praises 'incredible' rollout In January, on the anniversary of the UK's first Covid cases,he thanked all NHS workerswho had cared for more than 300,000 seriously ill coronavirus patients. Since Covid vaccines started to be offered, more than 28 million people have been vaccinated with a first dose in England - two-thirds of the total population of adults over 18. Sir Simon Stevens arrived at NHS England in 2014 after heading up an American private health corporation - and there was suspicion in some quarters about his long term agenda. But Sir Simon had begun his career as an NHS graduate and then worked as an adviser to Labour health secretaries and then Tony Blair. He knew the politics of the NHS inside out. His understanding of the workings of Whitehall were useful in negotiating long-term NHS financial settlements with successive chancellors. He called for more joined-up working between councils running social care and their local NHS counterparts, which has resulted in the creation of so-called integrated care systems in England. Much of the credit for the rollout of the vaccination programme in England must go to Sir Simon and NHS colleagues - his departure at the end of the July, as it happens, is the time by which the government has said all adults in the UK will have been offered a first dose. NHS staff have also administered more than 10 million second doses, which give people maximum protection against becoming ill with Covid. Across the four nations of the UK, more than half the adult population - 34 million people - have received a first dose. Sir Simon first joined the NHS in 1988 through its graduate management programme before working in international health care, frontline NHS services and at 10 Downing Street, before becoming chief executive of NHS England in 2014. He was knighted in 2020 for services to health and the NHS, and will now join the House of Lords. NHS England said a successor would be appointed before Sir Simon steps down on 31 July.

"France entered a third national lockdown on 3 April France will allow cafes, bars and restaurants to serve outside and relax a nightly curfew in a planned easing of lockdown measures starting next month. The four-stage plan outlined by President Emmanuel Macron aims to largely reopen the country by 30 June. Foreign tourists with a Covid-19 ""health pass"" will be allowed to visit France again from 9 June. France's infection rate has fallen since introducing a third lockdown, but numbers remain high in some areas. Detailing his much-anticipated plans to a group of French newspapers, Mr Macron said he wanted ease France's restrictions in four stages: On 3 May, secondary-school and high-school pupils will start returning to in-person classes. Rules on travelling will end On 19 May, a current 19:00 (17:00 GMT) nightly curfew will be pushed back to 21:00. Cafes and restaurants will be able to reopen outside. Non-essential shops, cinemas, museums and theatres will be able to open, with restrictions on visitors. On 9 June, the curfew will pushed back again to 23:00. A ""health pass"" will be introduced for those attending stadiums and large events, and for foreign tourists entering the country On 30 June, the curfew will be lifted completely but nightclubs will remain shut While Mr Macron said he hoped the measures would ease across the whole country, an ""emergency brake"" could be used ""in territories where the virus is too present"".

""The health pass should not be mandatory for access to everyday things such as restaurants, theatres and cinemas or to go see friends,"" Mr Macron said.

The total number killed by the pandemic in France is now at least 104,079, Johns Hopkins University estimates. The president was strongly criticised for rejecting calls to order a third national lockdown earlier to bring down a spike in infections.

If you missed any of it, or want to watch it again, the programme will be available on demand via theBBC iPlayervery shortly, or via the video link at the top of this page.

The BBC Wales Election 2021 Leaders' Debate is now over, withpandemic support for businessbeing one of the main points of contention. Labour's Mark Drakeford said Â£200m was waiting to be spent by the next first minister after the election to give firms hit by the pandemic more help. But Plaid Cymru's Adam Price questioned why it could not have been spent before the vote. Conservative Andrew RT Davies said there was unallocated cash in Welsh government coffers. Jane Dodds said the Welsh Liberal Democrats would support medium, small and micro-businesses. Meanwhile Abolish the Welsh Assembly's Richard Suchorzewski said control of the NHS should be returned to the UK government. Read more here. In his closing remarks, Jamie Jenkins of Reform UK said people tell him
âthey donât trust politiciansâ. But he added voters put their trust in Reform UK when it was
the Brexit Party by giving them an âoverwhelming majorityâ of the UK's MEPs in the 2019 European Parliament election. He said, as a result, they delivered Brexit ""for the people"". Mr Jenkins added that next week is another opportunity for
voters to put their trust in Reform UK to deliver once again. âWe want to reform the Senedd - we donât want to abolish, we
donât want independence, we just want to make Wales a better placeâ, he said. In his closing contribution, UKIP's Neil Hamilton said: âThe idea that the Senedd in any way
represents ordinary people in Wales is nonsense, and itâs proved by the
reaction of Welsh politicians in the Senedd to Brexit. ""53% of the people of
Wales voted for Brexit but 80% of the members of the Senedd voted to remain,"" he said. ""The Welsh Government, aided and abetted by Plaid Cymru and the LibDems in
the last four and a half years, did their best to frustrate the result of the
referendum which was your decision as to the future of Wales. ""Wales is the
poorest part of the UK, weâre poorer today than 22 years ago. Weâve had a
permanent Labour government and weâre going to get a Labour government again
after the 6th of May, because Plaid Cymru are already cosying up to
Mark Drakeford.â In her closing remarks Amelia Womack asked electors to âvote Greenâ so as not to âwaste your vote.â She said the election was happening at a âcritical point in our

Senedd, and we move to a system where we transfer power not from one set of
politicians from Cardiff to Westminster or vice versa but we actually transfer
power to the people.â The Green Party would âsupport a referendum and we would
support an independence vote in that referendumâ, according to its deputy leader in England and Wales. âIt's clear that there's been a poverty of ambition from
Westminster,"" said Amelia Womack. âI want to bring steel into this actually, because we know

UK was already in debt and that green investment could be harnessed in Wales. âIt is how we invest in a future that isn't hampered by the
lack of ambition from Westminster.â Speaking
on the climate emergency, UKIP's Neil Hamilton said: âRenewable energy is much more
expensive than conventional fuel. ""Weâre actually burdening the poorest people
in the UK (in Wales) with extra costs for fuel.â However, Amelia Womack of the Greens denied an accusation by Mr Hamilton that green issues are âa middle class obsession.â Ms Womack said that the âpoorest communities will be harmed
most by these issues.â In his opening statement, Jamie Jenkins for Reform UK drew on
his experience of growing up on a council estate. He said 22 years of devolution has brought inequality and
the life expectancy gap for newborns between England and Wales has doubled. Mr Jenkins added that under Reform UKâs previous guise as the
Brexit Party, voters delivered them a majority of UK MEPs in the 2019 European elections. He said voting for Reform UK next week âcan deliver and reform
the Seneddâ. Amelia Womack from the Green Party says that a vote for green
jobs is a vote to ârebuild a post-pandemic Wales fit for the 21st Century.â Asked how she would rebuild the economy while guarding the
environment, Ms Womack said: ""All of our recovery should have the
environment at the heart of it, because it means jobs and opportunities, it
means training and education, and it means that we're tackling the biggest
problems of our time.â Ms Womack said that Wales could not ignore the âclimate
emergency when people around Wales are experiencing flooding, coastal towns are
potentially at risk of being destroyed due to rising sea levelsâ. She also said that it was âsimply not trueâ that jobs would
be lost due to her partyâs green targets, and that âgreen steelâ would be a key
part of the future, ""Steel isnât at risk,"" Ms Womack insisted. UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton said: âDevolution has failed Wales. ""Itâs
the poorest part of the United Kingdom, and weâre poorer today relative to the
rest of the country than we were twenty years ago, despite 22 years of
Labour government propped up as necessary by Plaid and the LibDems. ""Welsh government doesnât have the money for major infrastructure improvements like
the M4, it doesnât have the money to provide us with decent public services

have a housing crisis and yet the Welsh Government grandstands by saying we are
a nation of sanctuary.â With the first part of the programme over, three other parties begin to air their views with presenter Nick Servini moderating. The participants are Jamie Jenkins of Reform UK, Amelia Womack of the Green Party and Neil Hamilton of UKIP.  In
his closing remarks seeking votes for the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew RT Davies said: âWhen the Welsh rugby team doesnât perform on the pitch, we donât scrap the
Welsh Rugby Union or cancel the team playing in the Six Nations. ""We change the
coaching staffâ¦ letâs run with it, letâs get back playing this game so Wales is
at the top of the league table, not at the bottom.â In her closing statement, Jane Dodds called on voters to
âimagineâ a better Wales. The Welsh Lib Dem leader outlined some of her partyâs key policies on reforming
the high street, improving mental health services and delivering greener homes. Ms Dodds added that the Liberal Democrats wanted to âput the
climate at the heart of everything we didâ. âThatâs the sort of Wales that we wantâ, she said. In his closing
statement, Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford said people had told him over the last month they were glad to have lived in Wales during the pandemic. âAnd thatâs
because Labour values are your values too,"" he said. âI am asking for
your vote so I can help finish the job and guide Wales on to that brighter

"Sir Simon Stevens stayed in the job to oversee the NHS rollout of Covid vaccinations Sir Simon Stevens is to step down as head of NHS England and become a peer, the government has announced. After seven years in the job, he will leave his role at the end of July after having overseen the Covid vaccination rollout to all adults. Sir Simon had intended to leave sooner but agreed to stay on through last winter. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had ""led the NHS with great distinction"". ""I want to thank him for his dedicated service throughout - but especially when facing the extraordinary pressures of the past year, and for his huge contribution to our vaccine rollout,"" Mr Johnson said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Sir Simon had been ""a steadfast and sage leader for our National Health Service, and that has been especially true during this most testing period in NHS history"". This video can not be played Jonathan Van-Tam vaccinates Health Secretary Matt Hancock He added: ""His leadership has helped NHS staff to overcome unprecedented adversity and keep services open for millions of patients in the face of this global pandemic."" In December, on the first day of the NHS's largest vaccination campaign in the fight against Covid-19,Sir Simon told the BBC it would mark ""a decisive turning point""in the UK epidemic. How old do I have to be to get my vaccine? First vaccine patient praises 'incredible' rollout In January, on the anniversary of the UK's first Covid cases,he thanked all NHS workerswho had cared for more than 300,000 seriously ill coronavirus patients. Since Covid vaccines started to be offered, more than 28 million people have been vaccinated with a first dose in England - two-thirds of the total population of adults over 18. Sir Simon Stevens arrived at NHS England in 2014 after heading up an American private health corporation - and there was suspicion in some quarters about his long term agenda. But Sir Simon had begun his career as an NHS graduate and then worked as an adviser to Labour health secretaries and then Tony Blair. He knew the politics of the NHS inside out. His understanding of the workings of Whitehall were useful in negotiating long-term NHS financial settlements with successive chancellors. He called for more joined-up working between councils running social care and their local NHS counterparts, which has resulted in the creation of so-called integrated care systems in England. Much of the credit for the rollout of the vaccination programme in England must go to Sir Simon and NHS colleagues - his departure at the end of the July, as it happens, is the time by which the government has said all adults in the UK will have been offered a first dose. NHS staff have also administered more than 10 million second doses, which give people maximum protection against becoming ill with Covid. Across the four nations of the UK, more than half the adult population - 34 million people - have received a first dose. Sir Simon first joined the NHS in 1988 through its graduate management programme before working in international health care, frontline NHS services and at 10 Downing Street, before becoming chief executive of NHS England in 2014. He was knighted in 2020 for services to health and the NHS, and will now join the House of Lords. NHS England said a successor would be appointed before Sir Simon steps down on 31 July.

The BBC Wales Election 2021 Leaders' Debate is now over, withpandemic support for businessbeing one of the main points of contention. Labour's Mark Drakeford said Â£200m was waiting to be spent by the next first minister after the election to give firms hit by the pandemic more help. But Plaid Cymru's Adam Price questioned why it could not have been spent before the vote. Conservative Andrew RT Davies said there was unallocated cash in Welsh government coffers. Jane Dodds said the Welsh Liberal Democrats would support medium, small and micro-businesses. Meanwhile Abolish the Welsh Assembly's Richard Suchorzewski said control of the NHS should be returned to the UK government. Read more here. In his closing remarks, Jamie Jenkins of Reform UK said people tell him
âthey donât trust politiciansâ. But he added voters put their trust in Reform UK when it was
the Brexit Party by giving them an âoverwhelming majorityâ of the UK's MEPs in the 2019 European Parliament election. He said, as a result, they delivered Brexit ""for the people"". Mr Jenkins added that next week is another opportunity for
voters to put their trust in Reform UK to deliver once again. âWe want to reform the Senedd - we donât want to abolish, we
donât want independence, we just want to make Wales a better placeâ, he said. In his closing contribution, UKIP's Neil Hamilton said: âThe idea that the Senedd in any way

Senedd, and we move to a system where we transfer power not from one set of
politicians from Cardiff to Westminster or vice versa but we actually transfer
power to the people.â The Green Party would âsupport a referendum and we would
support an independence vote in that referendumâ, according to its deputy leader in England and Wales. âIt's clear that there's been a poverty of ambition from
Westminster,"" said Amelia Womack. âI want to bring steel into this actually, because we know
that during the Brexit negotiations that steel wasn't considered important by
Westminster - but that's jobs and lives in Wales not considered important."" On the finances of an independent Wales, Ms Womack said the
UK was already in debt and that green investment could be harnessed in Wales. âIt is how we invest in a future that isn't hampered by the
lack of ambition from Westminster.â Speaking
on the climate emergency, UKIP's Neil Hamilton said: âRenewable energy is much more
expensive than conventional fuel. ""Weâre actually burdening the poorest people
in the UK (in Wales) with extra costs for fuel.â However, Amelia Womack of the Greens denied an accusation by Mr Hamilton that green issues are âa middle class obsession.â Ms Womack said that the âpoorest communities will be harmed
most by these issues.â In his opening statement, Jamie Jenkins for Reform UK drew on
his experience of growing up on a council estate. He said 22 years of devolution has brought inequality and
the life expectancy gap for newborns between England and Wales has doubled. Mr Jenkins added that under Reform UKâs previous guise as the
Brexit Party, voters delivered them a majority of UK MEPs in the 2019 European elections. He said voting for Reform UK next week âcan deliver and reform
the Seneddâ. Amelia Womack from the Green Party says that a vote for green
jobs is a vote to ârebuild a post-pandemic Wales fit for the 21st Century.â Asked how she would rebuild the economy while guarding the
environment, Ms Womack said: ""All of our recovery should have the
environment at the heart of it, because it means jobs and opportunities, it
means training and education, and it means that we're tackling the biggest
problems of our time.â Ms Womack said that Wales could not ignore the âclimate
emergency when people around Wales are experiencing flooding, coastal towns are
potentially at risk of being destroyed due to rising sea levelsâ. She also said that it was âsimply not trueâ that jobs would
be lost due to her partyâs green targets, and that âgreen steelâ would be a key
part of the future, ""Steel isnât at risk,"" Ms Womack insisted. UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton said: âDevolution has failed Wales. ""Itâs
the poorest part of the United Kingdom, and weâre poorer today relative to the
rest of the country than we were twenty years ago, despite 22 years of
Labour government propped up as necessary by Plaid and the LibDems. ""Welsh government doesnât have the money for major infrastructure improvements like
the M4, it doesnât have the money to provide us with decent public services
like health and education. ""The NHS is a shambles with 5 of the 7 health boards
in special measuresâ¦ our school results are the worst in the United Kingdom, we
have a housing crisis and yet the Welsh Government grandstands by saying we are
a nation of sanctuary.â With the first part of the programme over, three other parties begin to air their views with presenter Nick Servini moderating. The participants are Jamie Jenkins of Reform UK, Amelia Womack of the Green Party and Neil Hamilton of UKIP.  In
his closing remarks seeking votes for the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew RT Davies said: âWhen the Welsh rugby team doesnât perform on the pitch, we donât scrap the
Welsh Rugby Union or cancel the team playing in the Six Nations. ""We change the
coaching staffâ¦ letâs run with it, letâs get back playing this game so Wales is
at the top of the league table, not at the bottom.â In her closing statement, Jane Dodds called on voters to
âimagineâ a better Wales. The Welsh Lib Dem leader outlined some of her partyâs key policies on reforming
the high street, improving mental health services and delivering greener homes. Ms Dodds added that the Liberal Democrats wanted to âput the
climate at the heart of everything we didâ. âThatâs the sort of Wales that we wantâ, she said. In his closing
statement, Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford said people had told him over the last month they were glad to have lived in Wales during the pandemic. âAnd thatâs
because Labour values are your values too,"" he said. âI am asking for
your vote so I can help finish the job and guide Wales on to that brighter
future.â Richard
Suchorzewski, the leader of the Abolish The Welsh Assembly Party, said people needed âto
wake upâ and vote for his party to âsave Wales and save the unionâ. He said it
was time to stop Wales âsleep walking to independenceâ. In his closing statement, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price says there is  âhope of a new
beginning"" with a spring election. âThe future is in our hands in seven daysâ time,"" he said. ""We can
write this future together, we can right all the wrongs of all the years - a
future without poverty, without homelessness, without hunger â a future that
will be better than the past, because we will build it together.â Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9992968
"Actor and director Noel Clarke has been suspended by Bafta after allegations of sexual harassment, weeks after he received one of its top awards. In a statement, Bafta said it made the decision ""in light of the allegations of serious misconduct""in the Guardian,external. The Kidulthood and Doctor Who actor, 45, was given the outstanding British contribution to cinema prize at a ceremony on 10 April. Clarke has said he ""vehemently"" denies ""any sexual misconduct or wrongdoing"". In a statement he said he intended to ""defend myself against these false allegations"". He added: ""In a 20-year career, I have put inclusivity and diversity at the forefront of my work and never had a complaint made against me. ""If anyone who has worked with me has ever felt uncomfortable or disrespected, I sincerely apologise."" The Guardian reported allegations from 20 women, all of whom knew Clarke in a professional capacity. Bafta said it was suspending his membership and the recently awarded honour ""immediately and until further notice"". Clarke plays the lead role in ITV police drama Viewpoint, which is scheduled to conclude on Friday night Clarke is currently appearing in the successful ITV police drama Viewpoint, a five-part series with episodes airing each evening this week. Its finale is scheduled to be broadcast later. He wrote and starred in the acclaimed film trilogy Kidulthood, Adulthood and Brotherhood - which offered an uncompromising depiction of teenage life on the streets of west London - and directed two of them. The actor and producer, from London, was first recognised by Bafta in 2009, when he won the rising star prize. His first major on-screen role was in Channel 4 drama-comedy Metrosexuality in 2001. In Doctor Who, Clarke played Mickey Smith, the series' first-ever black companion, to the 10th doctor, played by David Tennant. Clarke co-created and starred in the Sky police procedural drama Bulletproof with actor Ashley Walters. He is married to Iris Da Silva, a cosmetic designer, and the couple have three sons. When approached for comment, management and production company 42 M&P said it no longer represented Clarke. Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

"Bethan Rhys Roberts and Nick Servini presented 90 minutes of debate ahead of next week's Senedd election The first hour featured leaders of Labour, the Conservatives, Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and Abolish the Welsh Assembly Reform UK, UKIP and the Green Party took part in the second part of the programme The Senedd election takes place on Thursday 6 May Rachel Flint and Andy Roberts Thanks for joining us for our live coverage of the BBC Wales Election 2021 Leaders' Debate. If you missed any of it, or want to watch it again, the programme will be available on demand via theBBC iPlayervery shortly, or via the video link at the top of this page. We'll have more live page coverage next week of the final week of the Senedd election campaign and results day next Friday 7 May. Good night and sleep well. The BBC Wales Election 2021 Leaders' Debate is now over, withpandemic support for businessbeing one of the main points of contention. Labour's Mark Drakeford said Â£200m was waiting to be spent by the next first minister after the election to give firms hit by the pandemic more help. But Plaid Cymru's Adam Price questioned why it could not have been spent before the vote. Conservative Andrew RT Davies said there was unallocated cash in Welsh government coffers. Jane Dodds said the Welsh Liberal Democrats would support medium, small and micro-businesses. Meanwhile Abolish the Welsh Assembly's Richard Suchorzewski said control of the NHS should be returned to the UK government. Read more here. In his closing remarks, Jamie Jenkins of Reform UK said people tell him
âthey donât trust politiciansâ. But he added voters put their trust in Reform UK when it was
the Brexit Party by giving them an âoverwhelming majorityâ of the UK's MEPs in the 2019 European Parliament election. He said, as a result, they delivered Brexit ""for the people"". Mr Jenkins added that next week is another opportunity for
voters to put their trust in Reform UK to deliver once again. âWe want to reform the Senedd - we donât want to abolish, we
donât want independence, we just want to make Wales a better placeâ, he said. In his closing contribution, UKIP's Neil Hamilton said: âThe idea that the Senedd in any way
represents ordinary people in Wales is nonsense, and itâs proved by the
reaction of Welsh politicians in the Senedd to Brexit. ""53% of the people of
Wales voted for Brexit but 80% of the members of the Senedd voted to remain,"" he said. ""The Welsh Government, aided and abetted by Plaid Cymru and the LibDems in
the last four and a half years, did their best to frustrate the result of the
referendum which was your decision as to the future of Wales. ""Wales is the
poorest part of the UK, weâre poorer today than 22 years ago. Weâve had a
permanent Labour government and weâre going to get a Labour government again
after the 6th of May, because Plaid Cymru are already cosying up to
Mark Drakeford.â In her closing remarks Amelia Womack asked electors to âvote Greenâ so as not to âwaste your vote.â She said the election was happening at a âcritical point in our
history"" and that ""Green scrutiny is essential to a post-pandemic recoveryâ. Ms Womack said mental health should have âparity with physical healthâ with
an increase in funding for services and staff. She said the underlying causes of mental health
should also be addressed âsuch as unpredictable housing, unpredictable jobs.â On waiting lists, Ms Womack said a âholistic approachâ was
needed for health and social care. Reform UK believes âthe Senedd has its placeâ,
according to Jamie Jenkins. He said his party does not want to give powers back to
Westminster. But he added Reform would campaign to stay in the UK should there be a referendum on independence.

Jamie Jenkins for Reform UK said his party supports the
development of tidal lagoons. The party also wants to cut business rates and âget Wales
open for businessâ. Mr Jenkins added Reform UK is also in favour of the development
of the M4 relief road. âPeople arenât going to invest in Wales if they think youâre
going to be stuck in a car parkâ, he said. UKIP's Neil Hamilton has argued people must be given the option to scrap the Senedd if an independence referendum is held. He said: âIâm very happy to go with a referendum on

"Betsi Cadwaladr health board has vaccinated a higher proportion of 18 to 29-year-olds than those aged in their 30s A higher proportion of younger people have had a Covid jab in north Wales than those who are older, figures show. Betsi Cadwaladr health board said,external14% of people aged 18 to 29 had been vaccinated, compared to 9% of those between the ages of 30 and 39. It is operating two ""streams"" of vaccination - one for those aged 30 to 49, and another for 18 to 29-year-olds. The Oxford jab is being used for older people, with the younger group receiving a Pfizer dose. It follows a review by the UK drugs regulator into the link between the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots. As a result, the UK government's vaccine advisory group, the JCVI,recommended people aged 18 to 29 be offered an alternative vaccine where available. How does the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine work? Covid vaccines: Those that work - and the others on the way One dose of Covid vaccine halves transmission - study ""This week, to ensure our vaccine supply is administered as quickly as it is received, we will continue to run two streams for those aged 18-49,"" Gill Harris, executive director of nursing and midwifery at Betsi Cadwaladr health board, said last week. ""One will deliver the Pfizer vaccine to those under the age of 30, and one will deliver the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine to those aged between 30 and 49. ""We are adopting this pragmatic approach to ensure vaccines are not left for long periods unused.""

The BBC Wales Leaders' Debate will host Labour, the Conservatives, Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and Abolish the Welsh Assembly in the first hour. Reform UK, the Green Party and UKIP will take part in the second, 30-minute, part of the programme. The debate will be on BBC One Wales andthe BBC iPlayerfrom 20:30 BST. The first such debate to be broadcast from BBC Wales' new headquarters in Cardiff's Central Square will include questions from a virtual audience, with Bethan Rhys Roberts presenting part one. SIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage Going head-to-head will be Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford, Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies and Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price. Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds and Richard Suchorzewski, who leads the Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party, will complete the line-up for the first part of the programme. Jamie Jenkins of Reform UK, Amelia Womack of the Green Party and Neil Hamilton from UKIP will also appear in the programme Nick Servini will then take over presenting duties and be joined by Green Party England and Wales deputy leader Amelia Womack, UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton and Jamie Jenkins from Reform UK. All the leaders will be invited to give short opening and closing statements, with coronavirus and how Wales recovers from the pandemic expected to feature strongly throughout the 90 minutes on air. Laura McAllister, professor of governance at Cardiff University, said that with ""very little on-the-ground action"" due to Covid restrictions the televised leaders' debate takes on added significance. ""Labour's election strategy has had to change least off the back of the pandemic,"" she said. ""It's been all about Mark Drakeford as a reassuring presence, a safe pair of hands, with Welsh Labour looking to bank his Covid-handling approval. ""Labour's campaign has been understandably defensive as a result and so Drakeford doesn't need to push hard in this debate. Meanwhile, Adam Price does. This wasn't how it was meant to be."" ""Covid messed up all of Plaid's best laid plans to make this a presidential-style contest,"" Prof McAllister said. ""The pandemic has realigned public opinion and Plaid has struggled to get much traction. ""Price needs a big performance, delicately balancing an appeal to the emotions and clear credibility on economic recovery. He needs to convince the electorate that this is a time for change not continuity."" Andrew RT Davies for the Welsh Conservatives, said Prof McAllister, would ""continue with his straightforward appeal to Tory voters of 2019 in the so-called 'red wall' seats with attacks on the Welsh government's record but maybe feeling slightly less bullish after events at Westminster over the past week"". ""It's sure to be a busy and fast-moving hour and the Welsh Liberal Democrat leader, Jane Dodds and Richard Suchorzewski from Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party will be hoping to get some traction for their messages too,"" she added.

"France entered a third national lockdown on 3 April France will allow cafes, bars and restaurants to serve outside and relax a nightly curfew in a planned easing of lockdown measures starting next month. The four-stage plan outlined by President Emmanuel Macron aims to largely reopen the country by 30 June. Foreign tourists with a Covid-19 ""health pass"" will be allowed to visit France again from 9 June. France's infection rate has fallen since introducing a third lockdown, but numbers remain high in some areas. Detailing his much-anticipated plans to a group of French newspapers, Mr Macron said he wanted ease France's restrictions in four stages: On 3 May, secondary-school and high-school pupils will start returning to in-person classes.

Non-essential shops, cinemas, museums and theatres will be able to open, with restrictions on visitors. On 9 June, the curfew will pushed back again to 23:00. A ""health pass"" will be introduced for those attending stadiums and large events, and for foreign tourists entering the country On 30 June, the curfew will be lifted completely but nightclubs will remain shut While Mr Macron said he hoped the measures would ease across the whole country, an ""emergency brake"" could be used ""in territories where the virus is too present"".

But they will need to show apass sanitaire- or health pass - the details of which have not yet been revealed. A pass will also be needed to attend large events. ""The health pass should not be mandatory for access to everyday things such as restaurants, theatres and cinemas or to go see friends,"" Mr Macron said. ""But for places with big crowds, such as stadiums, festivals, trade fairs or exhibitions, it would be absurd not to use it"". How is Europe dealing with the third wave? Can I go on a foreign holiday this summer? Spain plans to welcome tourists under EU scheme France entered a third national lockdown on 3 April, as it battled a surge in cases that threatened to overwhelm hospitals. The daily number of new cases has fallen since then, from around 40,000 to 27,000 on average over the past week. A further 324 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours. The total number killed by the pandemic in France is now at least 104,079, Johns Hopkins University estimates. The president was strongly criticised for rejecting calls to order a third national lockdown earlier to bring down a spike in infections. Mr Macron said it was time to start ""resuming our French-style way of life"", and people needed ""conviviality"", culture and sport. But he added that people needed to remain ""careful and responsible"".

People posed by cherry trees in Greenwich Park, London as lockdown easing means groups can meet outside We are going to be bringing our coronavirus updates to a close soon, so here's a recap of the stories we've been covering from the UK and around the world. New York's mayor has said the city will ""full reopen"" on 1 July. ""We are ready for stores to open, for businesses to open, offices, theatres, full strength,"" Bill de Blasio told MSNBC. However he said there is still work to be done and the focus now is to get everyone vaccinated. On Thursday, all state-run mass vaccine sites were open for those aged 16 and above to walk-in for their jab. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The mayor also did not specify how restrictions will be lifted, which is actually a decision for New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, with whom he has a strained relationship. Mr Cuomo has already relaxed a number of restrictions including allowing restaurants, stadiums, cinemas and performance venues to reopen with limited capacity. In the US, it is largely up to state and local officials to decide what restrictions, if any, are put in place. This has resulted in vast differences in rules - for example wearing masks - in different parts of the country.  New York was hit hard by the pandemic in March last year. Early on it became the epicentre in the US, and the city has been under various restrictions since.  Ireland has been at its highest level of lockdown since Christmas The government in the Republic of Ireland has agreed a phased relaxation of its Covid-19 lockdown rules - currently at the highest level - over the coming weeks and months. The country has been at Level Five restrictions since Christmas. From 10 May, hairdressers, barbers and other close-contact services can resume. Click-and-collect retail can also restart, with all shops reopening on 17 May. To allow grandparents meet their grandchildren and extended families, a vaccinated household can meet indoors with an unvaccinated one. Hotels and guest houses will be permitted to trade from 2 June. All pubs and restaurants are set to open up for outdoor service five days later, on 7 June. Find out all the details on the relaxation of restrictionshere. Just over four in five people in England aged 70 and over are now fully vaccinated against Covid-19, figures suggest. An estimated 82.3% of people in this age group had received both doses of the vaccine as of 25 April. For people aged 80 and over, the figure is 87.1%, while for 75 to 79-year-olds the estimate is 91.8%. Some 70.8% of 70 to 74-year-olds are also likely to have had both doses. The figures for vaccinations were published by NHS England, and have been combined with population estimates from the Office for National Statistics. More people in Europe have had a Covid-19 vaccine than have been infected with the virus, according to the World Health Organization. Based on numbers of confirmed cases, 5.5% of the entire European
population has now had COVID-19, while 7% has completed a full vaccination
series, WHO's Regional Director for Europe says. But Dr Hans Henri P Kluge adds: ""To date, some
215 million doses of vaccine have been administered. Approximately 16% of
the regionâs population has had a first vaccine dose, and 81% of health workers
in 28 countries in the region have had a first dose,"" he says. But as our chart shows, vaccine rollouts in the EU are some way behind those in UK and the US. The United States has told its citizens to leave India as soon as possible, as the country battles a devastating coronavirus wave. The Level 4 ""do not travel"" advisory,externalis the highest of its kind issued by the US Department of State. It warns that ""access to all types of medical care is becoming severely limited"" and US citizens in India should leave ""as soon as it is safe to do so"". India's official death toll passed 200,000 on Wednesday, although it is believed the real number is far higher. Hospitals continue to be overwhelmed, oxygen supplies remain critically low, and crematoriums are working non-stop to try and keep up with the number of bodies arriving. Read morehere. One health board in Wales has vaccinated a higher proportion 18 to 29-year-olds than those in their 30s - why? Betsi Cadwaladr health board said,external14% of people aged 18 to 29 had been vaccinated, compared to 9% of those between the ages of 30 and 39. It is operating two ""streams"" of vaccination - one for those aged 30 to 49, and another for 18 to 29-year-olds. Older people are getting the AstraZeneca jab and the younger group a Pfizer dose, following theJCVI's advice regarding rare blood clots. Gill Harris, executive director of nursing and midwifery at Betsi Cadwaladr health board, says: ""We are adopting this pragmatic approach to ensure vaccines are not left for long periods unused."" Here's the full story. Patricia OyellaBBC News, Kampala Uganda's vaccination campaign is moving slowly Uganda has reported its first case of
the Indian variant of Covid-19 A sample from the infected person, who is receiving
treatment at the Mulago National Referral Hospital in the capital Kampala, was taken on 26 March. The country has also recorded variants from the UK, South Africa and Nigeria. Uganda rolled out the first phase of its  vaccination campaign in March after
receiving 864,000 doses of the AstraZeneca jab through the global-sharing Covax scheme, and an additional 100,000
from India. Just 304,000 people have so far taken their first dose. The first phase is aimed at front-line workers - including those in the health and education sectors, the elderly and adults with with underlying health conditions. The country began a phased easing of lockdown
restrictions in May last year.  Preventative steps, like the wearing
of masks and social distancing, are now
largely being ignored. Read more: More than a quarter of all adults have had both coronavirus vaccines - and these graphs show how the focus has shifted from first to second doses. These new graphs show that the number of new Covid-19 cases in the UK have levelled off - while the death rate, which has plummeted since Janaury, remains low. Hundreds of people in the Australian state of Victoria have been told to get a coronavirus test after âstrong and unexpectedâ viral fragments were detected in wastewater. The health department said,external246 people in parts of the state's capital, Melbourne, had been contacted on Thursday and advised to get a test. Authorities said it is most likely the viral fragments are from people shedding the virus after the infection period. ""However, it could also be due to a person living in or travelling through the area in the early active infectious phase"". Authorities are using ""an abundance of caution"" because a known positive Covid-19 case was on board a flight that arrived in the state in the past 14 days. Australia has fared much better than most other nations during the pandemic, with fewer than 30,000 cases and 910 deaths. It has imposed some of the strictest snap lockdowns and the international borders remain closed. However, frustration has grown over the slow pace of the vaccination rollout. The programme has been beset by delays and the country has one of the world's lowest Covid vaccination rates. Read morehere.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, China Media Analyst In Hong Kong - which reported no new local Covid-19 cases today - bars and karaoke lounges have been allowed to open, and restaurants have been allowed to ease dine-in restrictions under a âvaccine bubbleâ scheme. Businesses that register with the governmentâsLeaveHomeSafe app,external-which launched today and is similar to the UKâs NHS Covid-19 track-and-trace app - will be able to relax their social distancing measures and open at larger capacity for longer hours.

The Hong Kong Free Press news website says that restaurants under this scheme can operate until 2am, at 75% capacity, with eight people per table. Those that do not participate in the scheme can only operate until 6pm, with two people per table.They can extend their hours to 10pm and sit four people per table if employees get tested every 14 days.,external The lengthy rules attached to the scheme meant that the local South China Morning Post newspaper yesterday predicted that it would face aâchaotic startâ.,external And today, the paper says that âhosts of businessesâ have chosen not to join the scheme, âto avoid burdening staff and customers, amid confusion over the rules and the post-launch release ofofficial documents and tools underpinning the systemâ.,external For some businesses, however, it may simply be a case of taking a bit more time to adjust.

Yorkshire and the Humber currently has the highest rate in England Earlier data from Public Health England shows case rates in all regions of England have either fallen very slightly or remain broadly unchanged. The highest rate in the week to 25 April was Yorkshire and the Humber, with 44.7 cases per 100,000 - down slightly from 46 cases the previous week. And south-west England had the lowest rate, with 14.2 cases per 100,000 people. It had been 14.4 the week before. Here's how the other regions of England stack up, from lowest to highest:  PHE also said case rates had fallen slightly among most age groups - with a slight rise in some groups. Those recording a slight rise are 10 to 19-year-olds, with 45.5 cases per 100,000 people up week-on-week from 44.0; five to nine-year-olds, up from 13.6 to 13.9; those aged four and under, up from 8.4 to 8.9; and 60 to 69-year-olds, up from 12.3 to 12.6. Today's UK Covid figures show there have been 15,811 new positive tests recorded in the last seven days - that's a decrease of 1,485, or 8.6%, from the previous week, 16 April to 22 April. And there were 157 deaths in the past week. That's up by 1 - or 0.6% - from the week before.

"Julia James was a serving PCSO with Kent Police A serving police community support officer found dead in woodland was last seen taking her dog for a walk, the BBC has been told. A murder investigation was launched after the body of Julia James, 53, was found in Akholt Wood, Snowdown, near Dover, just after 16:00 BST on Tuesday. Ms James had been off duty at the time, Kent Police said. Police have been carrying out searches of woodland and nearby fields, and Ms James's home has been cordoned off. Police erected a white tent on the edge of a field at Akholt Wood A white police tent which was erected after Ms James's body was discovered is still in place in the woods, which is a popular spot for dog walkers. A few hundred metres away a house with a car and a van parked on the driveway was under police guard. Officers in vans have also been posted at the start of footpaths leading off Holt Street where portable facilities have been erected. Floral tributes have been left close to the scene with one saying: ""Dearest Julia RIP you made [me] laugh! The kindest person I ever met."" The main road between Aylesham and Snowdown remains closed off. Police have cordoned off Julia James's home in The Crescent in Snowdown Kent Police colleagues confirmed Ms James had served on the force as a PCSO and said they were pursuing ""a number of lines of inquiry"" into her death. Home Secretary Priti Patel said she had been ""so saddened"" to learn of the death. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Speaking to 5 News, Ms James's nephew Karl James described his aunt as ""just a lovely person"". He said: ""Obviously it's been a real shock. I work away, but my wife is here - heavily pregnant - and with young kids, so she's on edge at the moment too. ""So I've come home and just waiting for answers - that's the worst bit really."" Detectives have appealed for anybody who was in the area on Monday or Tuesday to come forward. The hunt for Julia James's killer is continuing. It's a fast-moving investigation but also a difficult investigation for Kent Police officers because, of course, they are looking into the murder of one of their own officers. She was last seen by a neighbour leaving her home on Tuesday afternoon as she went to walk her dog. We've seen a lot of searches of fields - this is a very rural area and a lot of places are cordoned off as officers carried out fingertip searches. Assistant Chief Constable Peter Ayling said it had been ""a tough day for many"" on the force. There were ""some shattered people today following the loss of one of our own,"" he said. Matthew Scott, the Kent police and crime commissioner, said his thoughts were with Ms James's family and friends. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Amy says her flat isn't worth anything until it is made safe The government's fund to pay for the removal of dangerous cladding is woefully inadequate, oversubscribed and taking too long to make buildings safe, campaigners say. More than three and a half years since the Grenfell Tower fire which killed 72 people, an estimated 700,000 people are still living in high-rise blocks with flammable cladding. The Â£1.6bn Building Safety Programme was set up in 2019. Concerns have emerged about the contract that the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government requires applicants to the fund, usually managing agents or building owners, to sign. A clause in the contract, seen by the BBC, indicates applicants will be financially liable for any repair work not covered by the fund. The BBC has learnt that some managing agents are refusing to sign the document, further delaying the repair work, and have written to the government asking ministers to clarify the position. Christian Hansen, a solicitor at Bindmans LLP specialising in housing law and fire safety claims, said the contract showed that ""there's going to be a significant shortfall between the costs of the [repair] works that are required and the funding provided under the scheme"". ""Someone is going to need to pick up the bill and pay the difference. This contract makes clear it's going to be the leaseholders and for many, this could be tens of thousands of pounds, potentially ruinous costs,"" he warned. Mr Hansen said that leaseholders wanted the focus of government action ""to be on the manufacturers of the defective materials and construction companies who built these buildings"". ""At the moment, they are the ones profiting from putting people's lives at risk."" ""It is absolutely terrifying knowing that you are stuck here,"" says Amy First-time buyer Amy Cottenden, who is 28, bought a one-bed flat in Metis Tower in the centre of Sheffield for Â£85,000 in 2017. Inspections of the 14-storey building in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy revealed it had the same type of flammable ACM cladding and other safety faults. Work to remove the cladding started last month, but Ms Cottenden, who is a frontline NHS health worker, is frustrated at what she describes as a lack of progress. ""The pace of work is extremely slow. So far, they've put scaffolding up and removed three panels. They have told us it's going to take between 12 and 24 months just to take the cladding off,"" she said. ""It is absolutely terrifying knowing that you are stuck here. With lockdown, they are saying not to go out, but you are in a building where all you want to do is not be in it. You can't leave. You can't sell. My flat isn't worth anything until it is made safe."" While the government's Building Safety Fund is paying for the Grenfell-style cladding to be removed, the building has other fire safety faults, including missing fire breaks, that aren't covered by the scheme. It could cost up to Â£6m to fix. Flat owners fear they may face huge bills of up to Â£50,000 each. ""We can't pay it and we shouldn't have to pay it. It is not our fault. We could all go bankrupt because of this,"" Ms Cottenden said. Metis Tower is in Sheffield's city centre A spokesperson for Rendall & Rittner, the company which manages Metis Tower, said government funding to remove ACM cladding had been approved totalling Â£6.3m. However, an application to the same fund to pay for the removal of other types of unsafe cladding was rejected and the company has appealed against that decision. The company added: ""We understand and sympathise with residents and owners about the uncertainty that this situation is causing and will do all we can to assist."" The Â£1.6bn Building Safety Programme was set up to remove Grenfell-style cladding, known as ACM cladding Ministers say the cladding has been removed or repairs have started on 95% of affected blocks But analysis ofdata released this week,externalshows that work has been fully completed on just 58% of social housing blocks Meanwhile, in the private sector, cladding repairs have been finished on 30% of blocks. What started as a cladding scandal has now become a much wider building safety crisis, exposing decades of regulatory failure. Safety inspections have revealed that many buildings have other serious faults, including missing fire breaks, flammable balconies and defective insulation. None of that is covered by the government's Building Safety Fund. Dr Nigel Glen, the chief executive of ARMA, the trade association for residential leasehold management, said the additional costs that leaseholders were currently facing for non-cladding-related issues remained a huge concern. ""In the longer term, the draining of reserve funds will also mean that in the years to come, any major works that were being saved up for, such as a new roof or lift repairs, will have to be funded anew by the leaseholders,"" he added. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said that despite the pandemic, significant progress had been made to remove dangerous cladding, but ""building safety remains the responsibility of the building owner and we expect them to ensure any necessary work is carried out safely and effectively"". ""All applicants to the Building Safety Fund are told the amount of funding they have been awarded before being asked to sign contracts - this is clearly explained in the guidance,"" the spokesperson added.

"Sir Simon Stevens stayed in the job to oversee the NHS rollout of Covid vaccinations Sir Simon Stevens is to step down as head of NHS England and become a peer, the government has announced. After seven years in the job, he will leave his role at the end of July after having overseen the Covid vaccination rollout to all adults. Sir Simon had intended to leave sooner but agreed to stay on through last winter. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had ""led the NHS with great distinction"". ""I want to thank him for his dedicated service throughout - but especially when facing the extraordinary pressures of the past year, and for his huge contribution to our vaccine rollout,"" Mr Johnson said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Sir Simon had been ""a steadfast and sage leader for our National Health Service, and that has been especially true during this most testing period in NHS history"". This video can not be played Jonathan Van-Tam vaccinates Health Secretary Matt Hancock He added: ""His leadership has helped NHS staff to overcome unprecedented adversity and keep services open for millions of patients in the face of this global pandemic."" In December, on the first day of the NHS's largest vaccination campaign in the fight against Covid-19,Sir Simon told the BBC it would mark ""a decisive turning point""in the UK epidemic. How old do I have to be to get my vaccine? First vaccine patient praises 'incredible' rollout In January, on the anniversary of the UK's first Covid cases,he thanked all NHS workerswho had cared for more than 300,000 seriously ill coronavirus patients. Since Covid vaccines started to be offered, more than 28 million people have been vaccinated with a first dose in England - two-thirds of the total population of adults over 18. Sir Simon Stevens arrived at NHS England in 2014 after heading up an American private health corporation - and there was suspicion in some quarters about his long term agenda. But Sir Simon had begun his career as an NHS graduate and then worked as an adviser to Labour health secretaries and then Tony Blair. He knew the politics of the NHS inside out. His understanding of the workings of Whitehall were useful in negotiating long-term NHS financial settlements with successive chancellors. He called for more joined-up working between councils running social care and their local NHS counterparts, which has resulted in the creation of so-called integrated care systems in England. Much of the credit for the rollout of the vaccination programme in England must go to Sir Simon and NHS colleagues - his departure at the end of the July, as it happens, is the time by which the government has said all adults in the UK will have been offered a first dose.

"This video can not be played The first time 'Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President' were said US President Joe Biden has laid out a sweeping investment plan for jobs, education and social care in his first speech to a joint session of Congress. Delivered on the eve of his 100th day in office, the Democrat pitched some $4 trillion (Â£2.9tn) in spending - the largest overhaul of US benefits since the 1960s, analysts say. He called it a ""once in a generation investment in America itself"". But the plans face a battle in Congress before they can become law. There has been widespread opposition to the proposals from the Republican Party, which is unlikely to back tax increases and more government spending. And while there is a slim Democratic majority in both houses, there has been division among the party over how far to go with the plans. Five key moments from Biden's speech to Congress What we all got wrong about Biden The biggest obstacle to Biden getting his way In a historic moment, US Vice-President Kamala Harris - the first woman to hold that office - and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi both sat behind Mr Biden during Wednesday night's address. It was the first time two women appeared behind the president during a speech to Congress. After addressing Ms Harris in his opening remarks as Madam Vice-President, Mr Biden added: ""No president has ever said those words from this podium. And it's about time."" The 78-year-old president, buoyed by solid approval ratings, presented theAmerican Jobs Plan,externaland theAmerican Families Plan,external. The White House said the proposals would be funded by tax raises on corporations and the wealthiest Americans. ""It's time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1%... to pay their fair share,"" Mr Biden said at an event that was scaled back due to the pandemic. What Americans think of Joe Biden so far Biden's first 100 days fact-checked He described the American Jobs Plan as ""a blue-collar blueprint to build America"" that would boost investment in public transport, high-speed broadband and roads and bridges. He added that the plan would be guided by the fight against climate change. ""When I think climate change I think jobs,"" he said. ""There's no reason why American workers can't lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries."" He said the $1.8tn American Families Plan, meanwhile, would focus on children and seek to provide: Free pre-school for children aged three to four Paid family and medical leave as well as health insurance subsidies Tuition-free community college for all An extension of key tax breaks that have been expanded during the pandemic The proposal follows the so-called American Rescue Plan, a $1.9tn coronavirus stimulus package that included direct cheques to most Americans, which Mr Biden signed into law last month. On Wednesday, he framed these latest proposals in the context of foreign policy and said the US was ""in a competition with China and other countries to win the 21st century"". He also called for politicians from both parties to back his plans and said he was willing to work with both sides. Joe Biden's speech to Congress started as a victory lap and ended with a warning. He began by touting what has been by all accounts a very successful rollout of vaccinations in the US, paving the way for a return to some semblance of normalcy in the months ahead. He boasted of hundreds of thousands of new jobs created in his first 100 days and a growing economy. He touted recently passed funding that will help cut child poverty in the US in half. That was all a set-up, however, for the president's pitch for more - more spending and more action from Congress. He proposed a trillion-dollar package of universal pre-kindergarten, two years of free college education, family leave and childcare funding. He called for legislation on gun control, immigration, criminal justice reform and voting rights. He concluded, however, by turning to the 6 January attack on the US Capitol and the threat posed to democracy by the world's autocratic nations. He assured the nation that the US will prevail. His ending, however, seemed designed to create a sense of urgency - one that, perhaps, he can harness to achieve the ambitious agenda he set out on Wednesday night. What has Biden done in 100 days? Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Mr Biden's first 100 days in office were ""an unqualified failure"", accusing him and his party of ""hyper-partisanship"". ""In his inaugural address, Biden called for unity. That was a lie, and our nation is worse-off and more divided thanks to Joe Biden,"" her statement read. The top Republican in the House, Kevin McCarthy, was more concise. ""This whole thing could have just been an email,"" he wrote on Twitter. Who is Republican Senator Tim Scott? Biden unveils 'once in a generation' spending plan Is the US more or less unified under Joe Biden? Senator Tim Scott - a possible contender for the White House in 2024 and the only black Republican senator - followed Mr Biden's speech with the traditional rebuttal from the opposition party. He said the proposals would ""lower wages of the average American worker"" and dismissed them as a ""liberal wish list of big government waste"". Mr Scott then discussed racism in America, accusing Democrats of wanting ""the issue more than they want the solution"". ""America is not a racist country. It's backwards to fight discrimination with different types of discrimination and it's wrong to try to use our painful past to dishonestly shut down debates in the present,"" he said.

"There were heated exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday as Boris Johnson and the Labour leader Keir Starmer clashed over the controversial refurbishment of the Downing Street flat - among other issues. The prime minister insisted that he paid for work on No 11 Downing Street (where he lives) ""personally"" - but would not be drawn on whether someone else had funded it first. The Electoral Commission has announcedthat it is launching an investigation,because there are ""reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence or offences may have occurred"". We've looked at some of the claims made in Parliament: The figures for annual spending appear in aparliamentary answer,externalfrom a Cabinet Office minister. The Â£500,000 figure is what you get if you adjust for inflation (ie rising prices) and add up all the spending over the period of Labour governments between 1997 and 2010. If you take the amount of money actually spent at the time, to reflect the annual Â£30,000 allowance, there were several years when the spending was over that level. But the total spending over 13 years was Â£370,000, which is just under Â£30,000 a year. What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat about? Five questions for the PM and why the answers matter We do not yet have the figure for 2020-21, so we do not know whether Mr Johnson took the full Â£30,000 contribution of public money towards the refurbishment of the Downing Street flat. If the prime minister is referring to the vote in the House of Commons that followed the deal then this claim is not correct. The Labour leader voted in favour of the legislation on the agreement, as did the vast majority of Labour MPs. MPs overwhelmingly back post-Brexit deal with EU European Parliament backs Brexit trade deal Mr Starmer had said a ""thin deal was better than no deal"". He had criticised a number of aspects of the deal. The vote took place on 30 December and was backed by the Commons by 521 to 73 votes after Parliament was recalled. The prime minister was referring to an exchange in February - over the UK's vaccine rollout - when he said that the Labour leader backed the UK staying in the European Medicines Agency (EMA). This is the EU body which evaluates new medicines and authorises the use of vaccines. Mr Starmer vehemently denied this claim at the time. But as we pointed out back in February,he had actually spoken in favour of staying in the EMA in 2017 on two occasions, in the context of the ongoing Brexit debate back then. Mr Starmer later admitted that he was ""wrong"" to call the prime minister's claim ""complete nonsense"" and acknowledged he had previously expressed support for the EMA. According to thegovernment figures,externalfrom 27 April, more than 33.8 million people in the UK  have had the first dose of the vaccine. That is indeed about half of the population. And on Tuesday, the Department of Health said more than a quarter of adults in the UK - 13.2 million - had been vaccinated with both doses of a Covid-19 jab. So, these figures are correct. The most recent figure for the number of homes built in England was 148,620 for the whole of 2020. The figure of 244,000 is forthe number of net additional dwellings,externalin England between April 2019 and March 2020. That was a record for the last 30 years. But that's not just homes built - net additional dwellings is a broad definition reflecting new houses completed, plus gains or losses from conversions, changes of use and demolitions and even some caravans and house boats. It should also be said that very few of the new homes are being built by government - 82% of the completions were from private enterprise, 17% from housing associations and 1% from local authorities.

"Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds moved into No 11 Downing Street in July 2019 Further questions have been asked about the funding of home improvements at the prime minister's Downing Street flat, following the release of an exchange of letters with his standards adviser. Lord Geidt complained about not having been shown WhatsApp messages between Boris Johnson and Tory donor Lord Brownlow, which talked about the refurbishment. Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds had work carried out on their private residence, the flat above 11 Downing Street. The prime minister receives an annual public grant of Â£30,000 to spend on his living quarters. But the work cost considerably more than that - at least Â£112,000 based on the amount we know Lord Brownlow contributed. The work was initially paid for by the Cabinet Office, but Â£52,000 was given to the Conservative Party by Lord Brownlow to cover the bills. Mr Johnson says he has now covered all the costs out of his own pocket. The Conservative Partywas fined Â£17,800after the Electoral Commission found it had failed to accurately declare all of Lord Brownlow's donations towards the renovation. Lord Brownlow was asked in May 2020 to set up a Downing Street trust that would fund renovations to the flat above 11 Downing Street, but that trust was never established. In November 2020, the prime minister approached Lord Brownlow by WhatsApp message to approve payments to the interior designer carrying out the work. The Electoral Commission found in December 2021 that the subsequent Â£52,000 payment from Huntswood Associates Ltd, whose director is Lord Brownlow, had not been properly recorded and that it should not have been described as a loan or as part of a trust. But it said that separate payments of almost Â£60,000 for the refurbishments made by Lord Brownlow directly to suppliers, did not need to be declared. TheElectoral Commission report,externalled to further controversy because it referred to an exchange of WhatsApp messages between the prime minister and Lord Brownlow, which had not been seen by the adviser on standards, Lord Geidt, when he had reported on the case earlier in the year. The prime minister lives in a flat above 11 Downing Street Lord Geidt's report in May hadconcluded,externalthat Mr Johnson did not break the ministerial code over the funding of the renovations. But he said: ""The prime minister - unwisely, in my view - allowed the refurbishment of the apartment at No 11 Downing Street to proceed without more rigorous regard for how this would be funded."" Lord Geidt added: ""The record shows no evidence that the prime minister had been informed"" about the payments. His report says that when he found out in February 2021, Mr Johnson ""settled the full amount himself"". But when Lord Geidt found out about the messages to Lord Brownlow, hewrote to the prime minister,externalsaying that while his overall conclusions about the ministerial code were unchanged, had he seen the messages, ""I doubt whether I would have concluded, without qualification... that 'at the point when the prime minister became aware, he took steps to make the relevant declaration and to seek advice'."" Mr Johnson replied, offering a ""humble and sincere apology"" for not giving him the messages, blaming security issues which had forced him to change his phone. If a politician accepts money from a donor - either as a gift or as a loan - they are expected to make that information public, normally within 28 days. The concern is that if a financial gift is kept secret, it might be used to gain favours or political influence. This is the exchange of messages between Mr Johnson and Lord Brownlow: At the end of his message, Mr Johnson refers to the ""great exhibition plan"", which was a proposal for a cultural festival, which Lord Brownlow was involved with as a trustee of London's Albert Hall. Lord Brownlow met Oliver Dowden, who was then culture secretary, to discuss the event six weeks after the text exchange with the prime minister, according tothe meeting log,external. In the end, the exhibition did not happen, but Labour says Lord Brownlow's November 2020 text exchanges with the PM are still important. ""Lord Brownlow appears to have access to the prime minister because he was paying for the flat renovations. If that is the case, that is corruption,"" the party said. The BBC has approached Lord Brownlow for comment but he has not yet responded. Business Minister Paul Scully denied that the prime minister was linking support for a Great Exhibition with financial support for flat renovations in his messages. He said the Great Exhibition plan was passed to ""the right channels"" at the culture department and that Mr Johnson ""had no idea"" who would be paying for the flat refurbishments, believing the funding would come through a blind trust. Like several of his recent predecessors, Mr Johnson and Ms Symonds are living at No 11 because the four-bedroom flat there is much larger than the one above No 10. Tony Blair was the first prime minister to live at No 11 - he and his wife Cherie turned the space into a family home. The Grade 1-listed flatwas then extensively refurbished by David and Samantha Cameron in 2011at a cost of Â£30,000. Michelle Obama and Samantha Cameron pictured in the flat at 11 Downing St The latest upgrade for the flat was carried out by interior designer Lulu Lytle. Mr Johnson and his wife wanted to transform the flat from previous Prime Minister Theresa May's ""John Lewis furniture nightmare"" into a ""high society haven"",according to the society magazine Tatler.,external PM covered flat costs out of own pocket - minister Explain PM flat funding to MPs, says Labour Dominic Cummings launches attack on PM's integrity Plan to fund Downing Street makeover 'speculation' Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction UK has enough gas, says No.10 after supply warning UK records coldest night of winter as freeze to last into weekend 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 Weekly quiz: Zendaya looked happy but who else sparkled at the Golden Globes?

"New laws that could leave flat owners facing bills for fire safety measures are ""indefensible"", say Grenfell Tower survivors and bereaved relatives. The Fire Safety Act is aimed at making homes saferfollowing the 2017 blaze, in which 72 people died. But a push to include more financial protections for leaseholders was defeated in a Parliamentary vote, despite a large Tory rebellion. The government has made a Â£5bn fund available to remove cladding. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the government was paying for remedial work to ""thousands of buildings around the country"". She said the act would ""actually help to save lives by changing some of these awful regulations and guidelines that existed previously"". Government defeated again on fire safety measures What makes cladding unsafe and what are your rights? Grenfell Tower management 'was a mini-mafia' After the Grenfell tragedy, thousands of blocks of flats were found to be covered in similar cladding. Other defects were also discovered, leaving leaseholders facing large bills to pay for protective measures such as fire breaks, balconies, safer doors and sprinkler systems. Ministers say a loan scheme will ensure costs are capped at Â£50 a month for safety works and that residents in the tallest tower blocks in England will not have to pay to have cladding removed. Leaseholders have described being trapped in homes they cannot sell, with their lives on hold potentially for years, because lenders will not offer mortgages until the cladding is removed. Reports of the toll on residents' mental health have been widespread. Campaigners say leaseholders should be protected from all remediation costs that have arisen through no fault of their own. Critics, including some Conservative MPs, had argued the government should meet all the costs upfront and then recoup them from property developers. The Grenfell United group, which was set up after the tragedy in west London, said it was ""deeply disappointed that ministers have broken their promises to leaseholders who have done absolutely nothing wrong"". It described the government's position as ""indefensible"", saying it was a ""grave injustice that many innocent leaseholders will be financially ruined over fire safety issues that were not of their own making"", and it accused ministers of ""letting those responsible continue to get off scot-free"". This video can not be played ""It could be anything from bankruptcy to a life of crippling loans"" Lawyer Steph Pike, a leaseholder of a one-bedroom flat in Bristol, said she could be facing a Â£70,000 bill next year to cover the cost of improvement work to her building. She told the BBC the situation was ""completely unbelievable"" and said some days she asked herself: ""Is this even happening?"" ""I'm a lawyer, so I've got a professional qualification that I need to protect and if I have to declare myself bankrupt I'll lose that, so I'll also lose my career."" Rachael Teebay says she has ""spent days and weeks crying"" about the situation Leaseholder Rachael Teebay bought her first home together with her partner in Manchester, but now she is among thousands facing huge bills. ""I have spent days and weeks crying about it and worrying about our future,"" she told the BBC. ""Declaring bankruptcy at this age, what does that do for our future? It decimates it. It's terrifying."" Stephen Squires, a leaseholder who lives in a tower block in Manchester bearing dangerous cladding, said ministers' reluctance to compromise was ""hugely disappointing and really makes us feel like the government do not grasp the severity of the situation we all find ourselves in through no fault of our own"". He added: ""Our service charge account is running out of money, whilst the freeholder delays things. Eventually we could end up with having the lifts switched off or the electric being cut off to a 20-storey building, which would make it uninhabitable."" The campaigning group End Our Cladding Scandal said the legislation had passed unchanged, ""much to the horror of hundreds of thousands of innocent people across the country whose lives are being ruined by the buildings safety crisis"". It said the government had ""fought hard"" against changes that would have saved leaseholders from ""widespread bankruptcy and financial ruin caused by bad regulations, corporate malfeasance and shoddy building work"". ""This [act] pulls the rug out from under a generation of homeowners"" whose lives were still at risk from unsafe buildings, it added. The group has vowed to continue opposing the reforms, tweeting: ""We have the right to be angry. But the fight isn't over yet."" The new legislation modifies a previous law to clarify that building owners must manage and reduce the risk of fire in their properties. The government was under pressure to get it passed before the end of the parliamentary session on Thursday. It said it struck ""the right balance in protecting leaseholders and being fair to taxpayers"". A Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said ministers were prioritising making the tallest buildings with the most dangerous cladding safer, backed by Â£5bn in funding. ""We have been clear throughout that owners and industry should make buildings safe without passing on costs to leaseholders - and we will ensure they pay for the mistakes of the past with a new levy and tax to contribute to the costs of remediation,"" they added. ""For lower-rise buildings which have a lower risk, our generous capped finance scheme will ensure bills are a maximum of Â£50 per month.""

"Voters in the Indian state of West Bengal go to the polls People in the Indian state of West Bengal are voting in the final phase of elections despite soaring Covid cases. Long queues were seen outside polling booths, raising concerns about further spread of the virus amidst a deadly second wave. Experts fear West Bengal could be the next epicentre. Cases rose by 17,000 on Wednesday - a state record. In total, India reported 379,257 new infections on Thursday, the world's highest single-day total. The country also reported 3,645 deaths from coronavirus - another unwanted record, in this case the highest number of fatalities in a single day since the start of the pandemic. West Bengal has already seen seven phases of voting.  The state is one of the few where Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not have a majority of parliamentary seats. There has been a lot of criticism that he continued to hold large rallies there even as the virus began overwhelming the country. The BBC's correspondent in the area, Amitabha Bhattasali, says some of the biggest rallies, including those attended by Mr Modi, saw throngs of people not wearing masks or maintaining social distancing. This video can not be played Fears run high amid West Bengal election Hospitals have been overwhelmed, oxygen is in critically low supply and crematoriums are operating non-stop. The overall death toll officially surpassed 200,000 on Wednesday, though experts believe the actual number could be much higher.

India's round-the-clock mass cremations Crematoriums are working throughout the night and using empty spaces like parks and car parks to build makeshift funeral pyres The government had said that all adults will be eligible for Covid-19 vaccinations from 1 May, with online registration opening from 28 April. But people on social media complained that they were not able to get slots because the website crashed soon after it opened. Can India make enough vaccines to meet demand? How is India's vaccination drive going? Why India's Covid crisis matters to the whole world So far, India has been vaccinating health workers, front line workers and adults over the age of 45. But less than 10% of the population has received an initial jab and there are concerns about meeting demand. Although India is one of the world's biggest producers of vaccines, it does not yet have the stocks for the roughly 600 million people who will be eligible from 1 May. The White House says the United States is redirecting its own order of AstraZeneca manufacturing supplies to India, allowing it to make more than 20 million doses of the vaccine. Epidemiologist Bhramar Mukherjee says India must combine the immunisation drive with a widespread lockdown to slow the spread of the virus. Allow Twitter content?

"BT has confirmed it is in talks with several companies about the future of its sports broadcasting arm. The group says it is exploring ""ways to generate investment, strengthen our sports business"" to ""help take it to the next stage in its growth"". BT said early talks were being held ""with a number of select strategic partners"". It is not clear if this means selling a stake in BT Sport or a full sale of the division, which was launched in 2013. BT added that the discussions were confidential and ""may or may not lead to an outcome"". The Daily Telegraph reported,externalon Wednesday that Amazon, Disney and Dazn were in talks with BT, but that an unnamed British broadcaster might also be in the running to buy the sports business. The telecoms giant did not confirm which firms are involved. Amazon and Dazn declined to comment, while Disney did not immediately respond to the BBC's request. Talks have emerged as thePremier League has held discussionswith broadcasters, including BT, Sky and Amazon, about scrapping its next domestic media rights auction. The government is now considering whether to approve a rollover of the current Â£4.7bn deal, which was secured in 2018. That sale represented a 10% drop in value and some clubs are concerned there could be another fall if the usual open-market auction begins as planned next month for the three-year cycle between 2022 and 2025. Jerry Dellis, an analyst with stockbrokers Jefferies, said BT Sport costs the company about Â£800m a year, mainly due to football rights, including Â£400m for the Champions League. He said that since its launch, BT Sport has struggled to define how it adds value to the business. ""BT Sport was initially pivotal to stabilising the consumer retail business... Sky was overwhelmingly the favourite destination for consumer lines migrating away from BT. ""BT consumer retail line loss more than halved as soon as BT Sport launched, and dropped to zero when the Champions League was added in 2015."" However, Mr Dellis suggested, that may no longer be needed as other BT products improve. The company has revamped its customer service, introducing face-to-face support in stores, and is focusing on replacing copper telephone wires with fibre-optic broadband lines across Britain. BT's Openreach subsidiary lays down and maintains the cables for ""full-fibre"" internet connections, as well as as operating the associated telephone exchanges. It then sells use of these services to individual internet service providers, who sell access to the public. The business recently confirmed plans to build fibre-to-the-premises connections to 20 million homes and offices by the mid-to late-2020s. It currently reaches 4.6 million homes. BT said it would ""build like fury"" after the UK's telecoms regulatorOfcom decided not to impose price capson full-fibre connections provided by Openreach. Last May, BT announced it would scrap its dividend payment to shareholders until 2022, when it will be reduced by 50% from 2019 levels, to free up cash for investing in broadband projects after the pandemic.

"Sir Simon Stevens stayed in the job to oversee the NHS rollout of Covid vaccinations Sir Simon Stevens is to step down as head of NHS England and become a peer, the government has announced. After seven years in the job, he will leave his role at the end of July after having overseen the Covid vaccination rollout to all adults. Sir Simon had intended to leave sooner but agreed to stay on through last winter. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had ""led the NHS with great distinction"". ""I want to thank him for his dedicated service throughout - but especially when facing the extraordinary pressures of the past year, and for his huge contribution to our vaccine rollout,"" Mr Johnson said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Sir Simon had been ""a steadfast and sage leader for our National Health Service, and that has been especially true during this most testing period in NHS history"". This video can not be played Jonathan Van-Tam vaccinates Health Secretary Matt Hancock He added: ""His leadership has helped NHS staff to overcome unprecedented adversity and keep services open for millions of patients in the face of this global pandemic."" In December, on the first day of the NHS's largest vaccination campaign in the fight against Covid-19,Sir Simon told the BBC it would mark ""a decisive turning point""in the UK epidemic. How old do I have to be to get my vaccine? First vaccine patient praises 'incredible' rollout In January, on the anniversary of the UK's first Covid cases,he thanked all NHS workerswho had cared for more than 300,000 seriously ill coronavirus patients. Since Covid vaccines started to be offered, more than 28 million people have been vaccinated with a first dose in England - two-thirds of the total population of adults over 18. Sir Simon Stevens arrived at NHS England in 2014 after heading up an American private health corporation - and there was suspicion in some quarters about his long term agenda. But Sir Simon had begun his career as an NHS graduate and then worked as an adviser to Labour health secretaries and then Tony Blair. He knew the politics of the NHS inside out. His understanding of the workings of Whitehall were useful in negotiating long-term NHS financial settlements with successive chancellors. He called for more joined-up working between councils running social care and their local NHS counterparts, which has resulted in the creation of so-called integrated care systems in England. Much of the credit for the rollout of the vaccination programme in England must go to Sir Simon and NHS colleagues - his departure at the end of the July, as it happens, is the time by which the government has said all adults in the UK will have been offered a first dose. NHS staff have also administered more than 10 million second doses, which give people maximum protection against becoming ill with Covid. Across the four nations of the UK, more than half the adult population - 34 million people - have received a first dose. Sir Simon first joined the NHS in 1988 through its graduate management programme before working in international health care, frontline NHS services and at 10 Downing Street, before becoming chief executive of NHS England in 2014. He was knighted in 2020 for services to health and the NHS, and will now join the House of Lords. NHS England said a successor would be appointed before Sir Simon steps down on 31 July.

"Voters in the Indian state of West Bengal go to the polls People in the Indian state of West Bengal are voting in the final phase of elections despite soaring Covid cases. Long queues were seen outside polling booths, raising concerns about further spread of the virus amidst a deadly second wave. Experts fear West Bengal could be the next epicentre. Cases rose by 17,000 on Wednesday - a state record. In total, India reported 379,257 new infections on Thursday, the world's highest single-day total. The country also reported 3,645 deaths from coronavirus - another unwanted record, in this case the highest number of fatalities in a single day since the start of the pandemic. West Bengal has already seen seven phases of voting.  The state is one of the few where Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not have a majority of parliamentary seats. There has been a lot of criticism that he continued to hold large rallies there even as the virus began overwhelming the country. The BBC's correspondent in the area, Amitabha Bhattasali, says some of the biggest rallies, including those attended by Mr Modi, saw throngs of people not wearing masks or maintaining social distancing. This video can not be played Fears run high amid West Bengal election Hospitals have been overwhelmed, oxygen is in critically low supply and crematoriums are operating non-stop. The overall death toll officially surpassed 200,000 on Wednesday, though experts believe the actual number could be much higher. Deadly Covid wave rips through small-town India As it happened: BBC's live coverage on India's Covid surge Have India's rallies helped spread coronavirus? India's round-the-clock mass cremations Crematoriums are working throughout the night and using empty spaces like parks and car parks to build makeshift funeral pyres The government had said that all adults will be eligible for Covid-19 vaccinations from 1 May, with online registration opening from 28 April. But people on social media complained that they were not able to get slots because the website crashed soon after it opened. Can India make enough vaccines to meet demand? How is India's vaccination drive going? Why India's Covid crisis matters to the whole world So far, India has been vaccinating health workers, front line workers and adults over the age of 45. But less than 10% of the population has received an initial jab and there are concerns about meeting demand. Although India is one of the world's biggest producers of vaccines, it does not yet have the stocks for the roughly 600 million people who will be eligible from 1 May. The White House says the United States is redirecting its own order of AstraZeneca manufacturing supplies to India, allowing it to make more than 20 million doses of the vaccine. Epidemiologist Bhramar Mukherjee says India must combine the immunisation drive with a widespread lockdown to slow the spread of the virus. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played The first time 'Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President' were said US President Joe Biden has laid out a sweeping investment plan for jobs, education and social care in his first speech to a joint session of Congress. Delivered on the eve of his 100th day in office, the Democrat pitched some $4 trillion (Â£2.9tn) in spending - the largest overhaul of US benefits since the 1960s, analysts say. He called it a ""once in a generation investment in America itself"". But the plans face a battle in Congress before they can become law. There has been widespread opposition to the proposals from the Republican Party, which is unlikely to back tax increases and more government spending. And while there is a slim Democratic majority in both houses, there has been division among the party over how far to go with the plans. Five key moments from Biden's speech to Congress What we all got wrong about Biden The biggest obstacle to Biden getting his way In a historic moment, US Vice-President Kamala Harris - the first woman to hold that office - and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi both sat behind Mr Biden during Wednesday night's address. It was the first time two women appeared behind the president during a speech to Congress. After addressing Ms Harris in his opening remarks as Madam Vice-President, Mr Biden added: ""No president has ever said those words from this podium. And it's about time."" The 78-year-old president, buoyed by solid approval ratings, presented theAmerican Jobs Plan,externaland theAmerican Families Plan,external. The White House said the proposals would be funded by tax raises on corporations and the wealthiest Americans. ""It's time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1%... to pay their fair share,"" Mr Biden said at an event that was scaled back due to the pandemic. What Americans think of Joe Biden so far Biden's first 100 days fact-checked He described the American Jobs Plan as ""a blue-collar blueprint to build America"" that would boost investment in public transport, high-speed broadband and roads and bridges. He added that the plan would be guided by the fight against climate change. ""When I think climate change I think jobs,"" he said. ""There's no reason why American workers can't lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries."" He said the $1.8tn American Families Plan, meanwhile, would focus on children and seek to provide: Free pre-school for children aged three to four Paid family and medical leave as well as health insurance subsidies Tuition-free community college for all An extension of key tax breaks that have been expanded during the pandemic The proposal follows the so-called American Rescue Plan, a $1.9tn coronavirus stimulus package that included direct cheques to most Americans, which Mr Biden signed into law last month. On Wednesday, he framed these latest proposals in the context of foreign policy and said the US was ""in a competition with China and other countries to win the 21st century"". He also called for politicians from both parties to back his plans and said he was willing to work with both sides. Joe Biden's speech to Congress started as a victory lap and ended with a warning. He began by touting what has been by all accounts a very successful rollout of vaccinations in the US, paving the way for a return to some semblance of normalcy in the months ahead. He boasted of hundreds of thousands of new jobs created in his first 100 days and a growing economy. He touted recently passed funding that will help cut child poverty in the US in half. That was all a set-up, however, for the president's pitch for more - more spending and more action from Congress. He proposed a trillion-dollar package of universal pre-kindergarten, two years of free college education, family leave and childcare funding. He called for legislation on gun control, immigration, criminal justice reform and voting rights. He concluded, however, by turning to the 6 January attack on the US Capitol and the threat posed to democracy by the world's autocratic nations. He assured the nation that the US will prevail. His ending, however, seemed designed to create a sense of urgency - one that, perhaps, he can harness to achieve the ambitious agenda he set out on Wednesday night. What has Biden done in 100 days? Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Mr Biden's first 100 days in office were ""an unqualified failure"", accusing him and his party of ""hyper-partisanship"". ""In his inaugural address, Biden called for unity. That was a lie, and our nation is worse-off and more divided thanks to Joe Biden,"" her statement read. The top Republican in the House, Kevin McCarthy, was more concise. ""This whole thing could have just been an email,"" he wrote on Twitter. Who is Republican Senator Tim Scott? Biden unveils 'once in a generation' spending plan Is the US more or less unified under Joe Biden? Senator Tim Scott - a possible contender for the White House in 2024 and the only black Republican senator - followed Mr Biden's speech with the traditional rebuttal from the opposition party. He said the proposals would ""lower wages of the average American worker"" and dismissed them as a ""liberal wish list of big government waste"". Mr Scott then discussed racism in America, accusing Democrats of wanting ""the issue more than they want the solution"". ""America is not a racist country. It's backwards to fight discrimination with different types of discrimination and it's wrong to try to use our painful past to dishonestly shut down debates in the present,"" he said.

"New laws that could leave flat owners facing bills for fire safety measures are ""indefensible"", say Grenfell Tower survivors and bereaved relatives. The Fire Safety Act is aimed at making homes saferfollowing the 2017 blaze, in which 72 people died. But a push to include more financial protections for leaseholders was defeated in a Parliamentary vote, despite a large Tory rebellion. The government has made a Â£5bn fund available to remove cladding. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the government was paying for remedial work to ""thousands of buildings around the country"". She said the act would ""actually help to save lives by changing some of these awful regulations and guidelines that existed previously"". Government defeated again on fire safety measures What makes cladding unsafe and what are your rights? Grenfell Tower management 'was a mini-mafia' After the Grenfell tragedy, thousands of blocks of flats were found to be covered in similar cladding. Other defects were also discovered, leaving leaseholders facing large bills to pay for protective measures such as fire breaks, balconies, safer doors and sprinkler systems. Ministers say a loan scheme will ensure costs are capped at Â£50 a month for safety works and that residents in the tallest tower blocks in England will not have to pay to have cladding removed. Leaseholders have described being trapped in homes they cannot sell, with their lives on hold potentially for years, because lenders will not offer mortgages until the cladding is removed. Reports of the toll on residents' mental health have been widespread. Campaigners say leaseholders should be protected from all remediation costs that have arisen through no fault of their own. Critics, including some Conservative MPs, had argued the government should meet all the costs upfront and then recoup them from property developers. The Grenfell United group, which was set up after the tragedy in west London, said it was ""deeply disappointed that ministers have broken their promises to leaseholders who have done absolutely nothing wrong"". It described the government's position as ""indefensible"", saying it was a ""grave injustice that many innocent leaseholders will be financially ruined over fire safety issues that were not of their own making"", and it accused ministers of ""letting those responsible continue to get off scot-free"". This video can not be played ""It could be anything from bankruptcy to a life of crippling loans"" Lawyer Steph Pike, a leaseholder of a one-bedroom flat in Bristol, said she could be facing a Â£70,000 bill next year to cover the cost of improvement work to her building. She told the BBC the situation was ""completely unbelievable"" and said some days she asked herself: ""Is this even happening?"" ""I'm a lawyer, so I've got a professional qualification that I need to protect and if I have to declare myself bankrupt I'll lose that, so I'll also lose my career."" Rachael Teebay says she has ""spent days and weeks crying"" about the situation Leaseholder Rachael Teebay bought her first home together with her partner in Manchester, but now she is among thousands facing huge bills. ""I have spent days and weeks crying about it and worrying about our future,"" she told the BBC. ""Declaring bankruptcy at this age, what does that do for our future? It decimates it. It's terrifying."" Stephen Squires, a leaseholder who lives in a tower block in Manchester bearing dangerous cladding, said ministers' reluctance to compromise was ""hugely disappointing and really makes us feel like the government do not grasp the severity of the situation we all find ourselves in through no fault of our own"". He added: ""Our service charge account is running out of money, whilst the freeholder delays things. Eventually we could end up with having the lifts switched off or the electric being cut off to a 20-storey building, which would make it uninhabitable."" The campaigning group End Our Cladding Scandal said the legislation had passed unchanged, ""much to the horror of hundreds of thousands of innocent people across the country whose lives are being ruined by the buildings safety crisis"". It said the government had ""fought hard"" against changes that would have saved leaseholders from ""widespread bankruptcy and financial ruin caused by bad regulations, corporate malfeasance and shoddy building work"". ""This [act] pulls the rug out from under a generation of homeowners"" whose lives were still at risk from unsafe buildings, it added. The group has vowed to continue opposing the reforms, tweeting: ""We have the right to be angry. But the fight isn't over yet."" The new legislation modifies a previous law to clarify that building owners must manage and reduce the risk of fire in their properties. The government was under pressure to get it passed before the end of the parliamentary session on Thursday. It said it struck ""the right balance in protecting leaseholders and being fair to taxpayers"". A Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said ministers were prioritising making the tallest buildings with the most dangerous cladding safer, backed by Â£5bn in funding. ""We have been clear throughout that owners and industry should make buildings safe without passing on costs to leaseholders - and we will ensure they pay for the mistakes of the past with a new levy and tax to contribute to the costs of remediation,"" they added. ""For lower-rise buildings which have a lower risk, our generous capped finance scheme will ensure bills are a maximum of Â£50 per month.""

"Public transport was busy in Istanbul on Thursday as Turks queued to get home ahead of the lockdown The streets were crowded, the shopping centres busy and the traffic heavy. Some flocked to the main bus terminal to get out of Istanbul, while others tried to stockpile alcohol amid news of a ""booze ban"". This was the mood in the hours before Turkey went into its first full pandemic lockdown, to curb a surge in infections and deaths. WhatsApp groups have been dominated by messages about how life will be in the coming days. This time last year, Turkey was seen as a success story for its early combative action and was even praised by the WHO. One year on, it is among the countries worst affected by Covid, with the highest infection rate in Europe. Ankara is still proud of its relatively low total number of deaths, at around 39,000, and authorities say the pandemic is still under control, thanks to the country's strong healthcare system. But the spike in the number of cases is worrying. Infection rates have surged this month and more than 300 deaths have been reported every day Following a second period of restrictions starting last November, the number of daily cases fell to around 6,000 at one point in mid-February. But as soon as the government started to ease the restrictions in March, a new wave struck Turkey. The government then U-turned to re-impose restrictions at the beginning of April. However, that was not enough to curb the spread of infections. At its height in April, there were more than 60,000 new cases a day and more than 300 deaths. According to critics, the government lifted restrictions too early and the vaccination process has not been fast enough. More than 22 million vaccinations have been carried out, with 13.6 million people having received at least one dose in this country of 82 million. Turkey mainly uses the Chinese Sinovac vaccine, as well as lower numbers of Pfizer-Biontech. Medical workers travelled to the remote village of Guneyyamac in eastern Turkey to carry out vaccinations for the elderly Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said recently: ""We have sped up vaccine diplomacy for the injections including Sinovac, Pfizer-Biontech and (Russia's) Sputnik V"". Another criticism was that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling AK Party organised packed congresses in March while many social gatherings, public protests were banned. Scientists also say the new variants, especially the UK (Kent) strain, have accelerated the infection rate. Whatever the reason for the new wave, Mr Erdogan finally announced a full lockdown effective from Thursday evening until 17 May. People will have to stay at home except for essential shopping trips and urgent medical treatment All travel between cities will require official approval Schools will close and strict capacity limits will be imposed on users of public transport Alcohol sales are being limited Some businesses are exempt from the new restrictions. Many experts are happy with the new lockdown as they say it is necessary. However, some argue that the lockdown will not last long enough to combat the rise in cases and that it may not be very effective if it is not supported by a faster vaccination programme. Any measures should also provide economic support for low-income people, they believe. Across Turkish society there is a determination to see the back of this most recent wave, and the government has a clear target. President Erdogan has said: ""At a time when Europe is entering a phase of reopening, we must rapidly reduce our number of cases to fewer than 5,000, not to be left behind"". The measures last throughout the rest of Ramadan and the Eid festival that follows it. Last year Turkey saw a 70% fall in foreign visitors. The tourist industry hopes the lockdown will help enable a reopening in time for the summer season.

"Half a century after he entered Congress as a senator, Joe Biden returned to deliver his first address as the 46th US President. Here are the key moments. For the first time in US history, the two people seated behind the president as he delivered his address were women. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, and Vice-President Kamala Harris, who served as a California senator before Mr Biden made her his running mate, flanked the president throughout the speech, looking over Mr Biden's shoulders. As he greeted the two as ""Madam Vice-President, Madam Speaker,"" Mr Biden added: ""No president has ever said those words from this podium - no president has ever said those words, and it's about time!"" This video can not be played The first time 'Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President' were said Mr Biden began his address to Congress with a not-so-subtle dig at his predecessor, Donald Trump. Mr Biden said he ""inherited a nation in crisis"" - describing America as a ""house on fire"". ""Now, after just 100 days, I can report to the nation: America is on the move again,"" he said, adding that America never stays down. ""America is rising anew. Choosing hope over fear. Truth over lies. Light over darkness. After 100 days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for take off. We are working again. Dreaming again. Discovering again. Leading the world again."" Biden's first 100 days fact-checked What Americans think of Joe Biden so far What has Biden done in 100 days? Racial tensions have been at new highs in the past year following the May 2020 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Mr Biden referred in his address to Mr Floyd's murder at the hands of an officer, saying: ""We have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black America."" ""We won't ignore what our own intelligence agencies have determined - the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today is from white supremacist terrorism."" This video can not be played Watch: Biden urges reform in George Floyd's name The president did defend police, too, garnering applause, saying that ""most men and women in uniform wear their badge and serve their communities honourably"". But he said work must be done ""to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve, to root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system"". Much of Mr Biden's speech focused on selling his big-budget plans for overhauling US infrastructure and social programmes - all of which would rely on hiking taxes on the rich. The president insisted on Wednesday night that this was fair play. What we all got wrong about Biden ""It's time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1% of Americans to pay their fair share. Just pay their fair share,"" he said. A lot of companies evade taxes through tax havens from Switzerland to Bermuda to the Cayman Islands, and they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions that allow for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas. That's not right."" Mr Biden emphasised his proposed tax reforms would help ""reward work, not wealth"" and affect ""three tenths of 1% of all Americans"". The government would also ""crack down"" on the millionaires and billionaires who cheat on taxes. ""Look, I'm not out to punish anyone - but I will not add to the tax burden of the middle class of this country,"" Mr Biden said. ""What I've proposed is fair."" Mr Biden closed the evening by recalling the events of 6 January when Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, and asked lawmakers to prove democracy can rise above such actions. At the start of his speech, he called this riot ""the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War"". ""Can our democracy deliver on the most pressing needs of our people? Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate and fears that have pulled us apart? America's adversaries - the autocrats of the world - are betting it can't,"" he said. ""They believe we are too full of anger and division and rage. They look at the images of the mob that assaulted this Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy. ""They are wrong. And we have to prove them wrong. We have to prove democracy still works."" What Americans think of Joe Biden so far Biden's first 100 days - in six charts Do Americans give Biden thumbs up or down?

"Queues at Heathrow Airport last month The boss of Heathrow Airport has told the Home Office to ""get a grip"" on bottlenecks still causing long delays getting people through border control. John Holland-Kaye said he was not confident Border Force was ready to cope if travel restrictions are eased on 17 May. Some passengers have faced six-hour delays, but it's a ""completely fixable problem"", he told the BBC. The Home Office said paperwork and health checks would mean more delays. But Mr Holland-Kaye said that despite Heathrow seeing only 10% of normal traffic passing through the airport, Border Force still had the same staffing levels. Last month, there were reports of passengers at the UK's biggest airport having to wait seven hours to pass through immigration control, and three-hour waits were commonplace. On Thursday, Mr Holland-Kaye told the BBC that six-hour queues were still ""not uncommon"". ""We have less than 10% of our normal passengers, but they [Border Force] have no fewer staff than they have before the crisis. So, this is entirely manageable by BF if only they man their desks properly."" International travel restrictions are not due to be eased until 17 May at the earliest, but there are fears that border control delays could worsen when measures are relaxed. Heathrow loses bid to raise airport charges by 10% Heathrow border queues at 'unacceptable level' ""We have not seen quite enough action to ensure we are confident that Border Force can cope on 17 May,"" Mr Holland-Kaye said. The Heathrow chief executive said the Home Office must ""get a grip on this to make sure that the Border Force does not become the choke on the UK economic recovery"". A Home Office spokesperson said: ""We are in a global health pandemic, and people should not be travelling unless absolutely necessary. ""Queues and wait times will be longer if passengers have not completed the necessary requirements to enter the UK. Airlines are responsible for making sure that their passengers have completed all the necessary requirements, and airports have a crucial responsibility for ensuring travellers can social distance at passport control. ""Border Force is checking that every passenger has complied with current health measures when arriving at the border. Passengers should currently expect queues and wait times to be longer than normal."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, promised delays will ease once paperwork starts to be automated at border controls. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps pledged travel delays will ease ""As we move towards the unlock of international travel we will be addressing this issue, not least through beginning to automate the electronic e-gates with the pre-departure form,"" he told the House of Commons. Confusion over use of NHS App as Covid passport On Thursday, the airport revealed it had sunk a further Â£329m into the red in the first three months of the year, bringing total losses since the start of the pandemic to Â£2.4bn. Just 1.7 million passengers travelled through the airport during the quarter, down 91% on the period in 2019. Mr Holland-Kaye said the figures revealed the scale of the Covid hit. Cargo volumes are also down 23% on 2019, underlining how a lack of flights affects UK trade with the rest of the world, he said. But Mr Holland-Kaye hoped this was as bad as it gets now that lockdown restrictions are easing and economies are opening up. ""These results show how Covid has devastated the aviation sector and British trade,"" he said. ""Restarting international travel from May 17 will help to kick-start the economic recovery, allowing exporters to get their goods to market, as well as reuniting families who have been separated for over a year."" However, he anticipated it would be a long time before travel returned to pre-pandemic levels because of uncertainty over government policy. Despite saying there was strong underlying demand for travel, the airport said it had cut its passenger forecast for the year to between 13 and 36 million. In 2019, 81 million people passed through Heathrow, which is owned by investors including Spain's Ferrovial, the Qatar Investment Authority, and China Investment Corp. Mr Holland-Kaye said that cost-cutting to preserve cash had put the airport in a strong position to benefit from a recovery in air travel when it comes. The aviation industry is hoping that process will start next month if travel restrictions are eased as planned. However, uncertainty remains about where people will be able to go, and how digital vaccine passports will work. Mr Shapps has said he will chair a meeting of G7 transport ministers next week to discuss vaccine passports before announcing which countries would be open to Britons for travel in early May. The pandemic has hit airlines across the world - with an estimated 50 companies gone out of business - as well as commercial plane-makers Airbus and Boeing. On Thursday, Airbus posted a 2% fall in revenues to â¬10.4bn (Â£9bn) for the first three months of 2021, although it expects deliveries of aircraft to customers to pick up during the year. ""The first quarter shows that the crisis is not yet over for our industry and that the market remains uncertain,"" said Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury.

"New laws that could leave flat owners facing bills for fire safety measures are ""indefensible"", say Grenfell Tower survivors and bereaved relatives. The Fire Safety Act is aimed at making homes saferfollowing the 2017 blaze, in which 72 people died. But a push to include more financial protections for leaseholders was defeated in a Parliamentary vote, despite a large Tory rebellion. The government has made a Â£5bn fund available to remove cladding. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the government was paying for remedial work to ""thousands of buildings around the country"". She said the act would ""actually help to save lives by changing some of these awful regulations and guidelines that existed previously"". Government defeated again on fire safety measures What makes cladding unsafe and what are your rights? Grenfell Tower management 'was a mini-mafia' After the Grenfell tragedy, thousands of blocks of flats were found to be covered in similar cladding. Other defects were also discovered, leaving leaseholders facing large bills to pay for protective measures such as fire breaks, balconies, safer doors and sprinkler systems. Ministers say a loan scheme will ensure costs are capped at Â£50 a month for safety works and that residents in the tallest tower blocks in England will not have to pay to have cladding removed. Leaseholders have described being trapped in homes they cannot sell, with their lives on hold potentially for years, because lenders will not offer mortgages until the cladding is removed. Reports of the toll on residents' mental health have been widespread. Campaigners say leaseholders should be protected from all remediation costs that have arisen through no fault of their own. Critics, including some Conservative MPs, had argued the government should meet all the costs upfront and then recoup them from property developers. The Grenfell United group, which was set up after the tragedy in west London, said it was ""deeply disappointed that ministers have broken their promises to leaseholders who have done absolutely nothing wrong"". It described the government's position as ""indefensible"", saying it was a ""grave injustice that many innocent leaseholders will be financially ruined over fire safety issues that were not of their own making"", and it accused ministers of ""letting those responsible continue to get off scot-free"". This video can not be played ""It could be anything from bankruptcy to a life of crippling loans"" Lawyer Steph Pike, a leaseholder of a one-bedroom flat in Bristol, said she could be facing a Â£70,000 bill next year to cover the cost of improvement work to her building. She told the BBC the situation was ""completely unbelievable"" and said some days she asked herself: ""Is this even happening?"" ""I'm a lawyer, so I've got a professional qualification that I need to protect and if I have to declare myself bankrupt I'll lose that, so I'll also lose my career."" Rachael Teebay says she has ""spent days and weeks crying"" about the situation Leaseholder Rachael Teebay bought her first home together with her partner in Manchester, but now she is among thousands facing huge bills. ""I have spent days and weeks crying about it and worrying about our future,"" she told the BBC. ""Declaring bankruptcy at this age, what does that do for our future? It decimates it. It's terrifying."" Stephen Squires, a leaseholder who lives in a tower block in Manchester bearing dangerous cladding, said ministers' reluctance to compromise was ""hugely disappointing and really makes us feel like the government do not grasp the severity of the situation we all find ourselves in through no fault of our own"". He added: ""Our service charge account is running out of money, whilst the freeholder delays things. Eventually we could end up with having the lifts switched off or the electric being cut off to a 20-storey building, which would make it uninhabitable."" The campaigning group End Our Cladding Scandal said the legislation had passed unchanged, ""much to the horror of hundreds of thousands of innocent people across the country whose lives are being ruined by the buildings safety crisis"". It said the government had ""fought hard"" against changes that would have saved leaseholders from ""widespread bankruptcy and financial ruin caused by bad regulations, corporate malfeasance and shoddy building work"". ""This [act] pulls the rug out from under a generation of homeowners"" whose lives were still at risk from unsafe buildings, it added. The group has vowed to continue opposing the reforms, tweeting: ""We have the right to be angry. But the fight isn't over yet."" The new legislation modifies a previous law to clarify that building owners must manage and reduce the risk of fire in their properties. The government was under pressure to get it passed before the end of the parliamentary session on Thursday. It said it struck ""the right balance in protecting leaseholders and being fair to taxpayers"". A Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said ministers were prioritising making the tallest buildings with the most dangerous cladding safer, backed by Â£5bn in funding. ""We have been clear throughout that owners and industry should make buildings safe without passing on costs to leaseholders - and we will ensure they pay for the mistakes of the past with a new levy and tax to contribute to the costs of remediation,"" they added. ""For lower-rise buildings which have a lower risk, our generous capped finance scheme will ensure bills are a maximum of Â£50 per month.""

"Ella Baxendale said the help from the hospice allowed their family to enjoy her mother's later life Three Welsh hospices have warned they face having to cut services unless they receive a large increase in funding from their local health board. It costs about Â£14m a year to meet the running costs of St David's Hospice in Llandudno, Nightingale House Hospice in Wrexham and St Kentigern in St Asaph. They provide end-of-life and respite care to about 600 patients a year. Betsi Cadwaladr health board said it had provided above-inflation increases to the hospices for the past two years. The hospices have argued only 16% of their income is provided by the health board but similar organisations in south Wales and England receive about 30% from their respective health boards. Bev Parsons at the wedding of her daughter Ella Baxendale Ella Baxendale from Anglesey, whose mother Bev Parsons died at St David's Hospice in 2018 after being diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour, is one of those backing the call. ""The fact that it was round-the-clock care by experts, not just professionals, was a massive help,"" she said. ""Even the tiniest adjustment of pain relief - they were able to do them at the drop of a hat. Whereas, at home, it was a much more complicated process to change anything medication-wise. Palliative care support 'a struggle' to access Children's hospices want same money as rest of UK ""But they looked after us as a family as well. There was always a gentle pat on the shoulder. ""We got my mum back. I could go back to being just her daughter. My dad - he bore the brunt of most of the caring. ""He got to go back to being her husband and they could actually enjoy the time they had left and that's just something you can't put a price on really."" Trystan Pritchard says the funding model is unsustainable Trystan Pritchard, chief executive of St David's Hospice in Llandudno, which also provides services in Bangor and Holyhead, said there was ""an over-dependence"" on fundraising to keep the three hospices running. ""There is no doubt the Welsh government and health board have said on many occasions that hospice services are essential to their end-of-life care strategies,"" said Mr Pritchard, who was speaking on behalf of all three hospices. ""If we can't improve the situation, if the NHS doesn't play its part, then we have no choice but to look at how we deliver services and that might mean having to reduce them. ""It's a real threat. ""We would do everything in our power not to reduce services, of course, because we have such a bond with our communities. ""But this level of funding has gone on too long and the model is becoming unsustainable in the way that the NHS is contributing towards it."" He said the contribution of the health board to an end-of-life care bed ""equates to how much you might pay for a budget hotel"".

""However, the services that we provide directly to the public also require significant additional funding, such as funds to support efforts to reduce the backlog of patients waiting for treatment due to Covid-19.

"Julia James was a serving PCSO with Kent Police A serving police community support officer found dead in woodland was last seen taking her dog for a walk, the BBC has been told. A murder investigation was launched after the body of Julia James, 53, was found in Akholt Wood, Snowdown, near Dover, just after 16:00 BST on Tuesday. Ms James had been off duty at the time, Kent Police said. Police have been carrying out searches of woodland and nearby fields, and Ms James's home has been cordoned off. Police erected a white tent on the edge of a field at Akholt Wood A white police tent which was erected after Ms James's body was discovered is still in place in the woods, which is a popular spot for dog walkers. A few hundred metres away a house with a car and a van parked on the driveway was under police guard. Officers in vans have also been posted at the start of footpaths leading off Holt Street where portable facilities have been erected. Floral tributes have been left close to the scene with one saying: ""Dearest Julia RIP you made [me] laugh! The kindest person I ever met."" The main road between Aylesham and Snowdown remains closed off. Police have cordoned off Julia James's home in The Crescent in Snowdown Kent Police colleagues confirmed Ms James had served on the force as a PCSO and said they were pursuing ""a number of lines of inquiry"" into her death.

Detectives have appealed for anybody who was in the area on Monday or Tuesday to come forward. The hunt for Julia James's killer is continuing. It's a fast-moving investigation but also a difficult investigation for Kent Police officers because, of course, they are looking into the murder of one of their own officers. She was last seen by a neighbour leaving her home on Tuesday afternoon as she went to walk her dog. We've seen a lot of searches of fields - this is a very rural area and a lot of places are cordoned off as officers carried out fingertip searches. Assistant Chief Constable Peter Ayling said it had been ""a tough day for many"" on the force. There were ""some shattered people today following the loss of one of our own,"" he said. Matthew Scott, the Kent police and crime commissioner, said his thoughts were with Ms James's family and friends. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

St Peter's Church in Aylesham opened for prayers on Thursday morning, with flowers laid on the village green, including one that appeared to be from police colleagues. The vicar, the Reverend Nick Ratcliffe, said: ""There's been shock and disbelief that this could happen so close to home in a quiet area of Kent. ""People are coming to terms with what's happened and they need to come somewhere and just sit quietly and reflect, say a prayer and just have time to do something to show their grief."" Flowers have been left on the village green in Aylesham One of the floral tributes appears to be from police colleagues Dover MP Natalie Elphicke praised Ms James and urged the public to be vigilant. On Twitter she said: ""Julia James was a popular pillar of our community. ""My thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends. Kent Police have advised local people to be vigilant.

The mayor also did not specify how restrictions will be lifted, which is actually a decision for New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, with whom he has a strained relationship. Mr Cuomo has already relaxed a number of restrictions including allowing restaurants, stadiums, cinemas and performance venues to reopen with limited capacity. In the US, it is largely up to state and local officials to decide what restrictions, if any, are put in place. This has resulted in vast differences in rules - for example wearing masks - in different parts of the country.  New York was hit hard by the pandemic in March last year. Early on it became the epicentre in the US, and the city has been under various restrictions since.  Ireland has been at its highest level of lockdown since Christmas The government in the Republic of Ireland has agreed a phased relaxation of its Covid-19 lockdown rules - currently at the highest level - over the coming weeks and months. The country has been at Level Five restrictions since Christmas. From 10 May, hairdressers, barbers and other close-contact services can resume. Click-and-collect retail can also restart, with all shops reopening on 17 May. To allow grandparents meet their grandchildren and extended families, a vaccinated household can meet indoors with an unvaccinated one. Hotels and guest houses will be permitted to trade from 2 June. All pubs and restaurants are set to open up for outdoor service five days later, on 7 June. Find out all the details on the relaxation of restrictionshere. Just over four in five people in England aged 70 and over are now fully vaccinated against Covid-19, figures suggest. An estimated 82.3% of people in this age group had received both doses of the vaccine as of 25 April. For people aged 80 and over, the figure is 87.1%, while for 75 to 79-year-olds the estimate is 91.8%. Some 70.8% of 70 to 74-year-olds are also likely to have had both doses. The figures for vaccinations were published by NHS England, and have been combined with population estimates from the Office for National Statistics. More people in Europe have had a Covid-19 vaccine than have been infected with the virus, according to the World Health Organization. Based on numbers of confirmed cases, 5.5% of the entire European
population has now had COVID-19, while 7% has completed a full vaccination
series, WHO's Regional Director for Europe says. But Dr Hans Henri P Kluge adds: ""To date, some
215 million doses of vaccine have been administered. Approximately 16% of
the regionâs population has had a first vaccine dose, and 81% of health workers
in 28 countries in the region have had a first dose,"" he says. But as our chart shows, vaccine rollouts in the EU are some way behind those in UK and the US. The United States has told its citizens to leave India as soon as possible, as the country battles a devastating coronavirus wave. The Level 4 ""do not travel"" advisory,externalis the highest of its kind issued by the US Department of State. It warns that ""access to all types of medical care is becoming severely limited"" and US citizens in India should leave ""as soon as it is safe to do so"". India's official death toll passed 200,000 on Wednesday, although it is believed the real number is far higher. Hospitals continue to be overwhelmed, oxygen supplies remain critically low, and crematoriums are working non-stop to try and keep up with the number of bodies arriving. Read morehere. One health board in Wales has vaccinated a higher proportion 18 to 29-year-olds than those in their 30s - why? Betsi Cadwaladr health board said,external14% of people aged 18 to 29 had been vaccinated, compared to 9% of those between the ages of 30 and 39. It is operating two ""streams"" of vaccination - one for those aged 30 to 49, and another for 18 to 29-year-olds. Older people are getting the AstraZeneca jab and the younger group a Pfizer dose, following theJCVI's advice regarding rare blood clots. Gill Harris, executive director of nursing and midwifery at Betsi Cadwaladr health board, says: ""We are adopting this pragmatic approach to ensure vaccines are not left for long periods unused."" Here's the full story. Patricia OyellaBBC News, Kampala Uganda's vaccination campaign is moving slowly Uganda has reported its first case of
the Indian variant of Covid-19 A sample from the infected person, who is receiving
treatment at the Mulago National Referral Hospital in the capital Kampala, was taken on 26 March. The country has also recorded variants from the UK, South Africa and Nigeria. Uganda rolled out the first phase of its  vaccination campaign in March after
receiving 864,000 doses of the AstraZeneca jab through the global-sharing Covax scheme, and an additional 100,000
from India. Just 304,000 people have so far taken their first dose. The first phase is aimed at front-line workers - including those in the health and education sectors, the elderly and adults with with underlying health conditions. The country began a phased easing of lockdown
restrictions in May last year.  Preventative steps, like the wearing
of masks and social distancing, are now
largely being ignored. Read more: More than a quarter of all adults have had both coronavirus vaccines - and these graphs show how the focus has shifted from first to second doses. These new graphs show that the number of new Covid-19 cases in the UK have levelled off - while the death rate, which has plummeted since Janaury, remains low. Hundreds of people in the Australian state of Victoria have been told to get a coronavirus test after âstrong and unexpectedâ viral fragments were detected in wastewater. The health department said,external246 people in parts of the state's capital, Melbourne, had been contacted on Thursday and advised to get a test. Authorities said it is most likely the viral fragments are from people shedding the virus after the infection period. ""However, it could also be due to a person living in or travelling through the area in the early active infectious phase"". Authorities are using ""an abundance of caution"" because a known positive Covid-19 case was on board a flight that arrived in the state in the past 14 days. Australia has fared much better than most other nations during the pandemic, with fewer than 30,000 cases and 910 deaths. It has imposed some of the strictest snap lockdowns and the international borders remain closed. However, frustration has grown over the slow pace of the vaccination rollout. The programme has been beset by delays and the country has one of the world's lowest Covid vaccination rates. Read morehere.

Yorkshire and the Humber currently has the highest rate in England Earlier data from Public Health England shows case rates in all regions of England have either fallen very slightly or remain broadly unchanged. The highest rate in the week to 25 April was Yorkshire and the Humber, with 44.7 cases per 100,000 - down slightly from 46 cases the previous week. And south-west England had the lowest rate, with 14.2 cases per 100,000 people. It had been 14.4 the week before. Here's how the other regions of England stack up, from lowest to highest:  PHE also said case rates had fallen slightly among most age groups - with a slight rise in some groups. Those recording a slight rise are 10 to 19-year-olds, with 45.5 cases per 100,000 people up week-on-week from 44.0; five to nine-year-olds, up from 13.6 to 13.9; those aged four and under, up from 8.4 to 8.9; and 60 to 69-year-olds, up from 12.3 to 12.6.

They were brought to you by Alex Therrien, Hazel Shearing, Jennifer Meierhans, Lauren Turner, Owen Amos and Tiffany Wertheimer. We will have more rolling news tomorrow. People posed by cherry trees in Greenwich Park, London as lockdown easing means groups can meet outside We are going to be bringing our coronavirus updates to a close soon, so here's a recap of the stories we've been covering from the UK and around the world. New York's mayor has said the city will ""full reopen"" on 1 July. ""We are ready for stores to open, for businesses to open, offices, theatres, full strength,"" Bill de Blasio told MSNBC. However he said there is still work to be done and the focus now is to get everyone vaccinated. On Thursday, all state-run mass vaccine sites were open for those aged 16 and above to walk-in for their jab. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The mayor also did not specify how restrictions will be lifted, which is actually a decision for New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, with whom he has a strained relationship. Mr Cuomo has already relaxed a number of restrictions including allowing restaurants, stadiums, cinemas and performance venues to reopen with limited capacity. In the US, it is largely up to state and local officials to decide what restrictions, if any, are put in place. This has resulted in vast differences in rules - for example wearing masks - in different parts of the country.  New York was hit hard by the pandemic in March last year. Early on it became the epicentre in the US, and the city has been under various restrictions since.  Ireland has been at its highest level of lockdown since Christmas The government in the Republic of Ireland has agreed a phased relaxation of its Covid-19 lockdown rules - currently at the highest level - over the coming weeks and months. The country has been at Level Five restrictions since Christmas. From 10 May, hairdressers, barbers and other close-contact services can resume. Click-and-collect retail can also restart, with all shops reopening on 17 May. To allow grandparents meet their grandchildren and extended families, a vaccinated household can meet indoors with an unvaccinated one. Hotels and guest houses will be permitted to trade from 2 June. All pubs and restaurants are set to open up for outdoor service five days later, on 7 June. Find out all the details on the relaxation of restrictionshere. Just over four in five people in England aged 70 and over are now fully vaccinated against Covid-19, figures suggest. An estimated 82.3% of people in this age group had received both doses of the vaccine as of 25 April. For people aged 80 and over, the figure is 87.1%, while for 75 to 79-year-olds the estimate is 91.8%. Some 70.8% of 70 to 74-year-olds are also likely to have had both doses. The figures for vaccinations were published by NHS England, and have been combined with population estimates from the Office for National Statistics. More people in Europe have had a Covid-19 vaccine than have been infected with the virus, according to the World Health Organization. Based on numbers of confirmed cases, 5.5% of the entire European
population has now had COVID-19, while 7% has completed a full vaccination
series, WHO's Regional Director for Europe says. But Dr Hans Henri P Kluge adds: ""To date, some
215 million doses of vaccine have been administered. Approximately 16% of
the regionâs population has had a first vaccine dose, and 81% of health workers
in 28 countries in the region have had a first dose,"" he says. But as our chart shows, vaccine rollouts in the EU are some way behind those in UK and the US. The United States has told its citizens to leave India as soon as possible, as the country battles a devastating coronavirus wave. The Level 4 ""do not travel"" advisory,externalis the highest of its kind issued by the US Department of State. It warns that ""access to all types of medical care is becoming severely limited"" and US citizens in India should leave ""as soon as it is safe to do so"". India's official death toll passed 200,000 on Wednesday, although it is believed the real number is far higher. Hospitals continue to be overwhelmed, oxygen supplies remain critically low, and crematoriums are working non-stop to try and keep up with the number of bodies arriving. Read morehere. One health board in Wales has vaccinated a higher proportion 18 to 29-year-olds than those in their 30s - why? Betsi Cadwaladr health board said,external14% of people aged 18 to 29 had been vaccinated, compared to 9% of those between the ages of 30 and 39. It is operating two ""streams"" of vaccination - one for those aged 30 to 49, and another for 18 to 29-year-olds. Older people are getting the AstraZeneca jab and the younger group a Pfizer dose, following theJCVI's advice regarding rare blood clots. Gill Harris, executive director of nursing and midwifery at Betsi Cadwaladr health board, says: ""We are adopting this pragmatic approach to ensure vaccines are not left for long periods unused."" Here's the full story. Patricia OyellaBBC News, Kampala Uganda's vaccination campaign is moving slowly Uganda has reported its first case of
the Indian variant of Covid-19 A sample from the infected person, who is receiving
treatment at the Mulago National Referral Hospital in the capital Kampala, was taken on 26 March. The country has also recorded variants from the UK, South Africa and Nigeria. Uganda rolled out the first phase of its  vaccination campaign in March after
receiving 864,000 doses of the AstraZeneca jab through the global-sharing Covax scheme, and an additional 100,000
from India. Just 304,000 people have so far taken their first dose. The first phase is aimed at front-line workers - including those in the health and education sectors, the elderly and adults with with underlying health conditions. The country began a phased easing of lockdown
restrictions in May last year.  Preventative steps, like the wearing
of masks and social distancing, are now
largely being ignored. Read more: More than a quarter of all adults have had both coronavirus vaccines - and these graphs show how the focus has shifted from first to second doses. These new graphs show that the number of new Covid-19 cases in the UK have levelled off - while the death rate, which has plummeted since Janaury, remains low. Hundreds of people in the Australian state of Victoria have been told to get a coronavirus test after âstrong and unexpectedâ viral fragments were detected in wastewater. The health department said,external246 people in parts of the state's capital, Melbourne, had been contacted on Thursday and advised to get a test. Authorities said it is most likely the viral fragments are from people shedding the virus after the infection period. ""However, it could also be due to a person living in or travelling through the area in the early active infectious phase"". Authorities are using ""an abundance of caution"" because a known positive Covid-19 case was on board a flight that arrived in the state in the past 14 days. Australia has fared much better than most other nations during the pandemic, with fewer than 30,000 cases and 910 deaths. It has imposed some of the strictest snap lockdowns and the international borders remain closed. However, frustration has grown over the slow pace of the vaccination rollout. The programme has been beset by delays and the country has one of the world's lowest Covid vaccination rates. Read morehere.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, China Media Analyst In Hong Kong - which reported no new local Covid-19 cases today - bars and karaoke lounges have been allowed to open, and restaurants have been allowed to ease dine-in restrictions under a âvaccine bubbleâ scheme.

Yorkshire and the Humber currently has the highest rate in England Earlier data from Public Health England shows case rates in all regions of England have either fallen very slightly or remain broadly unchanged. The highest rate in the week to 25 April was Yorkshire and the Humber, with 44.7 cases per 100,000 - down slightly from 46 cases the previous week. And south-west England had the lowest rate, with 14.2 cases per 100,000 people. It had been 14.4 the week before. Here's how the other regions of England stack up, from lowest to highest:  PHE also said case rates had fallen slightly among most age groups - with a slight rise in some groups. Those recording a slight rise are 10 to 19-year-olds, with 45.5 cases per 100,000 people up week-on-week from 44.0; five to nine-year-olds, up from 13.6 to 13.9; those aged four and under, up from 8.4 to 8.9; and 60 to 69-year-olds, up from 12.3 to 12.6. Today's UK Covid figures show there have been 15,811 new positive tests recorded in the last seven days - that's a decrease of 1,485, or 8.6%, from the previous week, 16 April to 22 April. And there were 157 deaths in the past week. That's up by 1 - or 0.6% - from the week before. Another 2,445 positive coronavirus tests have been recorded in the UK, along with 22 deaths of patients who'd tested positive in the previous 28 days.

"New laws that could leave flat owners facing bills for fire safety measures are ""indefensible"", say Grenfell Tower survivors and bereaved relatives. The Fire Safety Act is aimed at making homes saferfollowing the 2017 blaze, in which 72 people died. But a push to include more financial protections for leaseholders was defeated in a Parliamentary vote, despite a large Tory rebellion. The government has made a Â£5bn fund available to remove cladding. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the government was paying for remedial work to ""thousands of buildings around the country"". She said the act would ""actually help to save lives by changing some of these awful regulations and guidelines that existed previously"". Government defeated again on fire safety measures What makes cladding unsafe and what are your rights? Grenfell Tower management 'was a mini-mafia' After the Grenfell tragedy, thousands of blocks of flats were found to be covered in similar cladding. Other defects were also discovered, leaving leaseholders facing large bills to pay for protective measures such as fire breaks, balconies, safer doors and sprinkler systems. Ministers say a loan scheme will ensure costs are capped at Â£50 a month for safety works and that residents in the tallest tower blocks in England will not have to pay to have cladding removed. Leaseholders have described being trapped in homes they cannot sell, with their lives on hold potentially for years, because lenders will not offer mortgages until the cladding is removed. Reports of the toll on residents' mental health have been widespread. Campaigners say leaseholders should be protected from all remediation costs that have arisen through no fault of their own. Critics, including some Conservative MPs, had argued the government should meet all the costs upfront and then recoup them from property developers. The Grenfell United group, which was set up after the tragedy in west London, said it was ""deeply disappointed that ministers have broken their promises to leaseholders who have done absolutely nothing wrong"". It described the government's position as ""indefensible"", saying it was a ""grave injustice that many innocent leaseholders will be financially ruined over fire safety issues that were not of their own making"", and it accused ministers of ""letting those responsible continue to get off scot-free"". This video can not be played ""It could be anything from bankruptcy to a life of crippling loans"" Lawyer Steph Pike, a leaseholder of a one-bedroom flat in Bristol, said she could be facing a Â£70,000 bill next year to cover the cost of improvement work to her building. She told the BBC the situation was ""completely unbelievable"" and said some days she asked herself: ""Is this even happening?"" ""I'm a lawyer, so I've got a professional qualification that I need to protect and if I have to declare myself bankrupt I'll lose that, so I'll also lose my career."" Rachael Teebay says she has ""spent days and weeks crying"" about the situation Leaseholder Rachael Teebay bought her first home together with her partner in Manchester, but now she is among thousands facing huge bills. ""I have spent days and weeks crying about it and worrying about our future,"" she told the BBC. ""Declaring bankruptcy at this age, what does that do for our future? It decimates it. It's terrifying."" Stephen Squires, a leaseholder who lives in a tower block in Manchester bearing dangerous cladding, said ministers' reluctance to compromise was ""hugely disappointing and really makes us feel like the government do not grasp the severity of the situation we all find ourselves in through no fault of our own"". He added: ""Our service charge account is running out of money, whilst the freeholder delays things. Eventually we could end up with having the lifts switched off or the electric being cut off to a 20-storey building, which would make it uninhabitable."" The campaigning group End Our Cladding Scandal said the legislation had passed unchanged, ""much to the horror of hundreds of thousands of innocent people across the country whose lives are being ruined by the buildings safety crisis"". It said the government had ""fought hard"" against changes that would have saved leaseholders from ""widespread bankruptcy and financial ruin caused by bad regulations, corporate malfeasance and shoddy building work"". ""This [act] pulls the rug out from under a generation of homeowners"" whose lives were still at risk from unsafe buildings, it added. The group has vowed to continue opposing the reforms, tweeting: ""We have the right to be angry. But the fight isn't over yet."" The new legislation modifies a previous law to clarify that building owners must manage and reduce the risk of fire in their properties. The government was under pressure to get it passed before the end of the parliamentary session on Thursday. It said it struck ""the right balance in protecting leaseholders and being fair to taxpayers"". A Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said ministers were prioritising making the tallest buildings with the most dangerous cladding safer, backed by Â£5bn in funding. ""We have been clear throughout that owners and industry should make buildings safe without passing on costs to leaseholders - and we will ensure they pay for the mistakes of the past with a new levy and tax to contribute to the costs of remediation,"" they added. ""For lower-rise buildings which have a lower risk, our generous capped finance scheme will ensure bills are a maximum of Â£50 per month.""

"Samsung Electronics has announced its strongest first quarter profits since 2018 on the back of strong mobile sales led by its flagship Galaxy S21 line. The Korean giant's net profits rose 46.3% compared to the same quarter in 2020 to 7.1tn won ($6.4bn; Â£4.6bn). Sales of television and home appliances saw strong growth, buoyed by continued stay-at-home demand. However, the company's profits were dented by disappointing results for its chips business. Samsung heirs to pay record inheritance tax Chip shortage: Samsung warns of 'serious imbalance' Apple profits double as it squares up to Facebook ""Solid sales of smartphones and consumer electronics outweighed lower earnings from semiconductors and displays,"" the company said in an earnings report. Its main competitor for premium phones Apple also posted bumper results on Tuesday, with iPhone sales in China helping to double the company's profits since the start of the pandemic. Both companies have done well during the pandemic, as many customers chose to upgrade their phones, laptops and other devices to work from home. Samsung is tipping a slightly lacklustre second quarter followed by stronger results in the second half, as the economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic gathers pace and more consumers look to upgrade to 5G mobile services. Despite high demand due to a global shortage, Samsung's chips business was hit by the cost of ramping up production domestically and a storm-related stoppage at its Texas factory in February. However, the factory has resumed full production and the world's largest chipmaker is expecting stronger results for its semiconductor business in the second quarter. The electronics giant warned that this could be offset by a decline in flagship smartphone sales and continuing supply issues with some components. The figures came a day after the family of Samsung's late chairman Lee Kun-hee announced plans to pay more than 12trn won ($10.78bn) in inheritance taxes on his estate. The tax issue has been closely watched, as it could impact the Lee family's stake in Samsung. However, the announcement provided little clarity about whether or not the Lee family would sell any shares to pay the tax.

"This video can not be played The first time 'Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President' were said US President Joe Biden has laid out a sweeping investment plan for jobs, education and social care in his first speech to a joint session of Congress. Delivered on the eve of his 100th day in office, the Democrat pitched some $4 trillion (Â£2.9tn) in spending - the largest overhaul of US benefits since the 1960s, analysts say. He called it a ""once in a generation investment in America itself"". But the plans face a battle in Congress before they can become law. There has been widespread opposition to the proposals from the Republican Party, which is unlikely to back tax increases and more government spending. And while there is a slim Democratic majority in both houses, there has been division among the party over how far to go with the plans. Five key moments from Biden's speech to Congress What we all got wrong about Biden The biggest obstacle to Biden getting his way In a historic moment, US Vice-President Kamala Harris - the first woman to hold that office - and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi both sat behind Mr Biden during Wednesday night's address. It was the first time two women appeared behind the president during a speech to Congress. After addressing Ms Harris in his opening remarks as Madam Vice-President, Mr Biden added: ""No president has ever said those words from this podium. And it's about time."" The 78-year-old president, buoyed by solid approval ratings, presented theAmerican Jobs Plan,externaland theAmerican Families Plan,external. The White House said the proposals would be funded by tax raises on corporations and the wealthiest Americans. ""It's time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1%... to pay their fair share,"" Mr Biden said at an event that was scaled back due to the pandemic. What Americans think of Joe Biden so far Biden's first 100 days fact-checked He described the American Jobs Plan as ""a blue-collar blueprint to build America"" that would boost investment in public transport, high-speed broadband and roads and bridges. He added that the plan would be guided by the fight against climate change. ""When I think climate change I think jobs,"" he said. ""There's no reason why American workers can't lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries."" He said the $1.8tn American Families Plan, meanwhile, would focus on children and seek to provide: Free pre-school for children aged three to four Paid family and medical leave as well as health insurance subsidies Tuition-free community college for all An extension of key tax breaks that have been expanded during the pandemic The proposal follows the so-called American Rescue Plan, a $1.9tn coronavirus stimulus package that included direct cheques to most Americans, which Mr Biden signed into law last month. On Wednesday, he framed these latest proposals in the context of foreign policy and said the US was ""in a competition with China and other countries to win the 21st century"". He also called for politicians from both parties to back his plans and said he was willing to work with both sides. Joe Biden's speech to Congress started as a victory lap and ended with a warning. He began by touting what has been by all accounts a very successful rollout of vaccinations in the US, paving the way for a return to some semblance of normalcy in the months ahead. He boasted of hundreds of thousands of new jobs created in his first 100 days and a growing economy. He touted recently passed funding that will help cut child poverty in the US in half. That was all a set-up, however, for the president's pitch for more - more spending and more action from Congress. He proposed a trillion-dollar package of universal pre-kindergarten, two years of free college education, family leave and childcare funding. He called for legislation on gun control, immigration, criminal justice reform and voting rights. He concluded, however, by turning to the 6 January attack on the US Capitol and the threat posed to democracy by the world's autocratic nations. He assured the nation that the US will prevail. His ending, however, seemed designed to create a sense of urgency - one that, perhaps, he can harness to achieve the ambitious agenda he set out on Wednesday night. What has Biden done in 100 days? Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Mr Biden's first 100 days in office were ""an unqualified failure"", accusing him and his party of ""hyper-partisanship"". ""In his inaugural address, Biden called for unity. That was a lie, and our nation is worse-off and more divided thanks to Joe Biden,"" her statement read. The top Republican in the House, Kevin McCarthy, was more concise. ""This whole thing could have just been an email,"" he wrote on Twitter. Who is Republican Senator Tim Scott? Biden unveils 'once in a generation' spending plan Is the US more or less unified under Joe Biden? Senator Tim Scott - a possible contender for the White House in 2024 and the only black Republican senator - followed Mr Biden's speech with the traditional rebuttal from the opposition party. He said the proposals would ""lower wages of the average American worker"" and dismissed them as a ""liberal wish list of big government waste"". Mr Scott then discussed racism in America, accusing Democrats of wanting ""the issue more than they want the solution"". ""America is not a racist country. It's backwards to fight discrimination with different types of discrimination and it's wrong to try to use our painful past to dishonestly shut down debates in the present,"" he said.

He said the $1.8tn American Families Plan, meanwhile, would focus on children and seek to provide: Free pre-school for children aged three to four Paid family and medical leave as well as health insurance subsidies Tuition-free community college for all An extension of key tax breaks that have been expanded during the pandemic The proposal follows the so-called American Rescue Plan, a $1.9tn coronavirus stimulus package that included direct cheques to most Americans, which Mr Biden signed into law last month. On Wednesday, he framed these latest proposals in the context of foreign policy and said the US was ""in a competition with China and other countries to win the 21st century"". He also called for politicians from both parties to back his plans and said he was willing to work with both sides. Joe Biden's speech to Congress started as a victory lap and ended with a warning. He began by touting what has been by all accounts a very successful rollout of vaccinations in the US, paving the way for a return to some semblance of normalcy in the months ahead. He boasted of hundreds of thousands of new jobs created in his first 100 days and a growing economy. He touted recently passed funding that will help cut child poverty in the US in half. That was all a set-up, however, for the president's pitch for more - more spending and more action from Congress. He proposed a trillion-dollar package of universal pre-kindergarten, two years of free college education, family leave and childcare funding. He called for legislation on gun control, immigration, criminal justice reform and voting rights. He concluded, however, by turning to the 6 January attack on the US Capitol and the threat posed to democracy by the world's autocratic nations. He assured the nation that the US will prevail. His ending, however, seemed designed to create a sense of urgency - one that, perhaps, he can harness to achieve the ambitious agenda he set out on Wednesday night. What has Biden done in 100 days? Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Mr Biden's first 100 days in office were ""an unqualified failure"", accusing him and his party of ""hyper-partisanship"". ""In his inaugural address, Biden called for unity. That was a lie, and our nation is worse-off and more divided thanks to Joe Biden,"" her statement read. The top Republican in the House, Kevin McCarthy, was more concise. ""This whole thing could have just been an email,"" he wrote on Twitter. Who is Republican Senator Tim Scott? Biden unveils 'once in a generation' spending plan Is the US more or less unified under Joe Biden? Senator Tim Scott - a possible contender for the White House in 2024 and the only black Republican senator - followed Mr Biden's speech with the traditional rebuttal from the opposition party. He said the proposals would ""lower wages of the average American worker"" and dismissed them as a ""liberal wish list of big government waste"". Mr Scott then discussed racism in America, accusing Democrats of wanting ""the issue more than they want the solution"". ""America is not a racist country. It's backwards to fight discrimination with different types of discrimination and it's wrong to try to use our painful past to dishonestly shut down debates in the present,"" he said.

"Samsung Electronics has announced its strongest first quarter profits since 2018 on the back of strong mobile sales led by its flagship Galaxy S21 line. The Korean giant's net profits rose 46.3% compared to the same quarter in 2020 to 7.1tn won ($6.4bn; Â£4.6bn). Sales of television and home appliances saw strong growth, buoyed by continued stay-at-home demand. However, the company's profits were dented by disappointing results for its chips business. Samsung heirs to pay record inheritance tax Chip shortage: Samsung warns of 'serious imbalance' Apple profits double as it squares up to Facebook ""Solid sales of smartphones and consumer electronics outweighed lower earnings from semiconductors and displays,"" the company said in an earnings report. Its main competitor for premium phones Apple also posted bumper results on Tuesday, with iPhone sales in China helping to double the company's profits since the start of the pandemic. Both companies have done well during the pandemic, as many customers chose to upgrade their phones, laptops and other devices to work from home. Samsung is tipping a slightly lacklustre second quarter followed by stronger results in the second half, as the economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic gathers pace and more consumers look to upgrade to 5G mobile services. Despite high demand due to a global shortage, Samsung's chips business was hit by the cost of ramping up production domestically and a storm-related stoppage at its Texas factory in February. However, the factory has resumed full production and the world's largest chipmaker is expecting stronger results for its semiconductor business in the second quarter. The electronics giant warned that this could be offset by a decline in flagship smartphone sales and continuing supply issues with some components. The figures came a day after the family of Samsung's late chairman Lee Kun-hee announced plans to pay more than 12trn won ($10.78bn) in inheritance taxes on his estate. The tax issue has been closely watched, as it could impact the Lee family's stake in Samsung. However, the announcement provided little clarity about whether or not the Lee family would sell any shares to pay the tax.

"As President Joe Biden wraps up the first 100 days of his term, many public opinion polls show he has the support of a majority of the American public. Supporters have praised his efforts to combat the pandemic with a massive economic relief package and a speedy vaccine rollout. Others say the Democrat has shown little interest in garnering Republican support on his proposals. Mr Biden's performance report may guide how he governs in the rest of his term. What has Biden done in 100 days? What we all got wrong about Biden The biggest obstacle to Biden getting his way Three voters - a Democrat, a Republican and an independent - shared their thoughts with the BBC as the president reached the symbolic 100 day mark. A soon-to-be college graduate, Josh, a Democrat, voted for Joe Biden because he wanted an experienced politician in charge who was willing to compromise to get things done. Has Biden delivered? I'm very impressed. The biggest thing is the vaccine rollout. Here in California, if you want a vaccine, you can go out and get it. I was very satisfied with the speed with which it was done logistically and the messaging from the federal government. Right now, the momentum is going his way. Vaccines are getting through and people are getting their stimulus cheques, so I'm seeing a lot of hope. I'm really hoping to see him lead us out of the pandemic. What was the most consequential action of Biden's first 100 days? Recognising the Armenian genocide was big. Coming from a Jewish background, the Holocaust is top of mind and we are able to recognise it through Holocaust Day and museums. But for my Armenian brothers and friends, the atrocities were never recognised by the United States until now. What hopes or concerns do you have for the rest of his term? One reason I really wanted him in office was because he had experience working across the aisle with Republicans. I thought he could pass legislation with bipartisan consensus, but he's not getting Republican votes on the stuff that he's pushing through. From adding a seat to the Supreme Court to getting rid of the filibuster, those are things that need bipartisan agreement and you can't just shove through. Lesley is a self-employed financial advisor, Canadian immigrant and registered independent who voted for Joe Biden because she hoped he would get Covid under control and work with global allies. Has Biden delivered? I think he's accomplished a lot. He prioritised trying to get Covid under control and get people vaccinated. They didn't have a whole lot of cooperation from the previous administration so I really do commend him on what he's been able to do in a short time. The other thing is they were able to get additional stimulus money passed to address the people who really had needs. Joe Biden and a life in politics Three reasons Bidenâs Covid bill is a big deal Joe Biden's 'big problem' at the US border What was the most consequential action of Biden's first 100 days? On his very first day, he signed a bunch of executive orders. One of them had to do with anti-Asian hate.  One of them was getting back into the Paris climate accord. For four years prior, we had somebody in leadership who really didn't work for the people. I'm just grateful to have someone who can try to steer the ship back in the direction we need to be going. What hopes or concerns do you have for the rest of his term? I hope this administration will take some serious actions on police reform. ""Abolish the police"" does not in itself make sense, but there needs to be police reform. And I really hope it's a bipartisan step forward. My main concern is that there's so much work to be done I don't know how they prioritise what to do first. It's beyond cleaning up after the last administration. I hope all Americans will give Biden a fair chance. A fiscal conservative who did not vote for Joe Biden, Jim is glad there's less drama in this White House but fears his concerns of a liberal overreach are coming true. Has Biden delivered? What he's done well is Covid vaccine administration. It has gone fairly smoothly and 200 million doses is in line with his promises. The spending is a big concern. He's pushed through trillions of dollars in Covid relief and infrastructure spending which makes me fearful for the economy. In the short term, there's a lot of money out there, but that's going to change over time. I am concerned about the kind of country we're going to leave behind for my kids and grandkids. It's big government on steroids. What was the most consequential action of Biden's first 100 days? The consequential thing is the contrast from the previous president. Biden is very lowkey, stays on message, and there is not a lot of drama. Stylistically, he's vastly different from Donald Trump. But the most consequential thing in the first 100 days was probably the signing of the COVID relief bill. It put a lot of money into people's hands who needed it, and overall it rolled out fairly well. What hopes or concerns do you have for the rest of his term? Aside from the spending trend we're on, I'm concerned about the border crisis. I never believed the wall was an absolute necessity but, looking at what's going on down there, it seems almost out of control. Immigration is a big issue and I really don't see Biden addressing it. I'm hopeful that he will genuinely try to work with Republicans and meet people halfway instead of going all the way to the left. This video can not be played Has Biden unified the country? Watch as Americans weigh in. Biden's first 100 days - in six charts What we all got wrong about Biden The biggest obstacle to Biden getting his way Joe Biden and a life dogged by tragedy Three reasons Bidenâs Covid bill is a big deal Joe Biden's 'big problem' at the US border Do Americans give Biden thumbs up or down?

"Joe Biden has spent his first 100 days as US president focusing on a series of issues facing the country - from immigration and the economy to Covid and the climate. On Wednesday evening ahead of this milestone, the president addressed a joint session of Congress. We've fact-checked some of the claims he made during this speech and his first months in office. This target, given in his speech to Congress, is an increase on previous goals - and has been achieved. When he took office in January, President Biden pledged 100 million vaccine doses in his first 100 days. At the end of March he doubled that commitment. At the time he said: ""I know it's ambitious - twice our original goal. But no other country in the world has even come close, not even close, to what we are doing."" Mr Biden received his first vaccine dose in December The US has so far delivereda total of 235 million vaccine doses,externalaccording to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Around 16 million of these were given during the Trump administration, which means that around 220 million have been delivered during Mr Biden's first 100 days in in office. But the US still lags behind some other countries when comparing the number of jabs done relative to the size of the population. Israel leads in terms of vaccinating its population against the virus, followed by the United Kingdom and then the US. In his address to Congress, President Biden made the point that most of the undocumented people living in the US initially came into the country legally on visas, which have then expired. Mr Biden hasrecently faced criticismover a surge in illegal migration over the US southern border with Mexico. Although in some recent years more people have overstayed visas than have been apprehended crossing the southern border, it's not true that this is the case overall. Migrants crossing into the US are stopped by a border guard in Texas A study by the Center for Migration Studies of New York,externalfound that visa overstays ""significantly exceeded"" border-crossing migrations for between 2010-2017. But experts say this isn't the the trend over previous decades, and in 2019 (the latest data available)there were 676,422 people,externalwho overstayed their visas, compared with 977,509 people apprehended at the border. The number fluctuates widely - but there is not always a significant increase during the winter months. At a press conference in March, he said: ""There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. It happens every year."" The US Customs and Border Protection agencyreleases monthly figures,externalon the number of ""encounters"" at the south-west land border. In January and February 2021, 78,442 and 100,441 people were encountered - a significant increase on the figures for the same two months in the previous year, which were each just over 36,000. Since President Biden made the claim, the count for March has been released - 172,331, the highest in recent years. In 2020, encounters at the border fell slightly between January and March. In 2018, they remained relatively steady. This is another claim President Biden made during his address to Congress. Since January, the US economy has added 1,384,000 jobs,according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.,external It's true that's the most jobs created in the first 100 days of any presidency since records began. April's job numbers are yet to be published, so the number of jobs created in President Biden's first three months in office is likely to rise further. This year's job growth follows unemployment hitting the highest level since the Great Depression of the 1930s in April last year - when more than 22 million jobs were lost over two months. The economy has continued to bounce back from the pandemic under President Biden, having gained more than 13 million during Donald Trump's final nine months in office. This is correct in terms of carbon emissions - the US produces just under 15% of the global total. President Biden said this during his address to Congress as well as at the recent climate summit, where he encouraged the largest economies to work together to tackle global warming. China produces by far the most carbon emissions overall, following its rapid economic growth over the past couple of decades. The US is the next largest emitter, although its carbon emissions have been steadily declining in recent years. When you look at emissions per person, the US produces considerably more CO2 than China and many other rich countries, and well over the global average. It generates the most per head for a country of its population size. It is not true that voting now has to finish at 17:00, as stated on several occasions by President Biden. A controversial new election law in the US state of Georgia led to heated disagreement over its impact on voting,which we fact-checked previously. The law allows counties to set voting hours anywhere between 07:00 and 19:00 for early voting or on election day, as was the case previously. It stipulates the hours required as a minimum on election day, saying: ""Voting shall be conducted beginning at 09:00 and ending at 17:00"". That's pretty much unchanged because ""during normal business hours"" was the minimum requirement under the old law, widely interpreted as 9am-5pm. For early voting, the new law is similarly more explicit, with minimum voting hours up until 5pm set as the default position but with the flexibility of ending at 7pm. Critics have called the new language more restrictive. This is not right. Hispanic Americans actually represent the second fastest growing demographic over the past two decades, after Asian Americans. President Biden made this claim when addressing the Mexican president in March. The Asian American population grew 81% between 2000 and 2019, from about 10.5 million to almost 19 million,according to Pew Research Center analysis,externalof the latest US census data. The Hispanic American population grew by 70% during the same period, to more than 60 million. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"Voters in the Indian state of West Bengal go to the polls People in the Indian state of West Bengal are voting in the final phase of elections despite soaring Covid cases. Long queues were seen outside polling booths, raising concerns about further spread of the virus amidst a deadly second wave. Experts fear West Bengal could be the next epicentre. Cases rose by 17,000 on Wednesday - a state record. In total, India reported 379,257 new infections on Thursday, the world's highest single-day total. The country also reported 3,645 deaths from coronavirus - another unwanted record, in this case the highest number of fatalities in a single day since the start of the pandemic. West Bengal has already seen seven phases of voting.  The state is one of the few where Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not have a majority of parliamentary seats. There has been a lot of criticism that he continued to hold large rallies there even as the virus began overwhelming the country. The BBC's correspondent in the area, Amitabha Bhattasali, says some of the biggest rallies, including those attended by Mr Modi, saw throngs of people not wearing masks or maintaining social distancing. This video can not be played Fears run high amid West Bengal election Hospitals have been overwhelmed, oxygen is in critically low supply and crematoriums are operating non-stop. The overall death toll officially surpassed 200,000 on Wednesday, though experts believe the actual number could be much higher.

India's round-the-clock mass cremations Crematoriums are working throughout the night and using empty spaces like parks and car parks to build makeshift funeral pyres The government had said that all adults will be eligible for Covid-19 vaccinations from 1 May, with online registration opening from 28 April. But people on social media complained that they were not able to get slots because the website crashed soon after it opened. Can India make enough vaccines to meet demand? How is India's vaccination drive going? Why India's Covid crisis matters to the whole world So far, India has been vaccinating health workers, front line workers and adults over the age of 45. But less than 10% of the population has received an initial jab and there are concerns about meeting demand. Although India is one of the world's biggest producers of vaccines, it does not yet have the stocks for the roughly 600 million people who will be eligible from 1 May. The White House says the United States is redirecting its own order of AstraZeneca manufacturing supplies to India, allowing it to make more than 20 million doses of the vaccine. Epidemiologist Bhramar Mukherjee says India must combine the immunisation drive with a widespread lockdown to slow the spread of the virus. Allow Twitter content?

"For the White House press corps who've binged out for four years on the son et lumiÃ¨re of the Trump-show, the last three months have been a challenge. As I remarked, perhaps unwisely, to an audience the other night, the transition from Trump to Joe Biden has been like going from a daily crack pipe to a small bottle of low-alcohol beer once a week. The daily White House briefings now are a snoozefest. There are no fights, no name-calling. No middle-of-the-night Twitter storms, no payments to porn stars, no rollicking MAGA rallies. So does all this mean it's been a boring presidency? Absolutely not. This is a far more interesting presidency - so far - than I think any of us had imagined. I would go as far as to say it's fascinating. The sad thing, from a purely selfish point of view, is that what it isn't is a made-for-TV spectacular, which is what I have feasted on these past four years. Donald Trump always had an eye for the visual and outrageous. He knew how to make himself the centre of attention; Biden seems to relish the lack of histrionics, and seems to think it is important for people to focus on what he delivers, rather than what he says. Most strange. In freezing US, Biden seeks to cool down politics Rejoining Paris sets ambitious climate goal for Biden We reported that Joe Biden - all 78 years of him - would be a transitional president. He would be there to lower the political temperature; try to heal a divided nation. Take the absurd politics out of the response to Covid. Improve vaccine roll-out. Drain the poison from the body politic. But that aside, not do too much. He appointed a largely technocratic cabinet, presumably to perform managerial functions. Maybe make the trains run on time a bit better, but not change all the rolling stock, let alone alter the gauge of the railway. A fitting ambition for Amtrak Joe. But maybe we've got that all wrong. Is it possible that far from being transitional, he's transformational? And that word is not freighted with a positive or negative connotation - it is merely a statement based on the ambition of what we've seen so far. Voters will soon decide whether it's for better or worse. Let's start with the $1.9 trillion (Â£1.35tn) stimulus package. The headline from the passing of this humungous piece of legislation was that nearly all adult Americans would receive a cheque for $1,400 to help them cope with the hardships brought about by the pandemic. It was cash in hand to a lot of Americans, and won massive approval - from Democratic and Republican voters alike - although not a single Republican lawmaker would back the proposal. This video can not be played Five ways President Biden plans to tackle coronavirus in his first 100 days But look beyond the headline and lift the lid on this policy a little further. There is a lot to see. Perhaps most significant is the extension of child tax credits. Poorer families could soon be receiving up to $3,000 per child per annum. It is estimated this one measure will lift literally millions of youngsters out of poverty. As things stand, this measure is for 2021 only - but it is clear within the White House that Joe Biden wants to make this permanent. It is a major piece of social policy. It is big potatoes. With the passing of the stimulus package - or the American Rescue Package, as it is more properly called - Biden wanted to correct something he felt that Barack Obama had got wrong when he came to power and inherited the mess of the financial crisis in 2009. Yes, Obama passed a variety of measures - but with hindsight they were seen as too cautious; not ambitious enough. The biggest obstacle to Biden getting his way Five takeaways from Biden's White House cabinet One insight that Biden has borrowed from his time as vice-president to America's first African-American president, is do not let a good crisis go to waste. The urgency of the pandemic has given Biden the excuse he needed to push for a massive plan. And he got it through. Now look at what he's planning on rebuilding America's infrastructure. Again, the price tag will be in the trillions. Again, the ambition will be immense - not just the staid repairing of bridges and roads (important and vital though that is); it is about making digital access more equitable - but it goes wider than that. Way wider. ""It is not a plan that tinkers around the edges,"" the president told an audience outside Pittsburgh. ""It is a once-in-a-generation investment in America."" For Republicans it's typical government overreach and smacks more of social engineering than the civic kind usually associated with highway repairs. US roads and bridges are in desperate need The wish-list of what Biden hopes to achieve from this infrastructure plan goes on and on. It aspires to create millions of jobs in the short term and strengthen American competitiveness in the long. It hopes to lead to greater racial equality. The focus on new, cleaner energy sources promises to help the nation fight climate change. On the subject of which, look too at the ambitious goals he's set for climate change with the virtual summit he held last week in Washington. These are not the actions of a steady-as-you-go president. A 52% cut in emissions by the end of the decade is BIG. Who knows whether he'll achieve it - it's going to require Americans to change the way they drive; the way they heat and cool their homes. The way industry functions. But if the ambition is to show American ambition, it is, umm, ambitious. Now obviously there is an element of motherhood and apple pie in this shopping list. And the measure needs to pass through Congress, and that hasn't happened. And whilst I am in the business of saying ""and"", let me add thisâ¦. and there is something slightly ridiculous on the focus of the first 100 days. The first 100 days is a statement of intent, a down payment on what you might do with the rest of your term. But frankly, who cares if you have a sparkling first 100 days if the subsequent 1,360 stink and sink? This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career All that said, the statement of intent is big, and this is what makes boring old Joe Biden so interesting. This is a blog column and not a book, but arguably the dominant idea in American politics for the past 40 years has been the low-taxing, economy-deregulating, budget-balancing, competition-encouraging, union-limiting small government of Ronald Reagan. The same is true of the influence of Thatcherism in the UK - yes, there have been 13 years of Labour government since Maggie's demise, just as here there have been the Clinton and Obama terms since Reagan. But arguably they operated within, and were defined by, the orthodoxy of the monetarist economists who've held such intellectual sway on both sides of the Atlantic: Milton Friedman, the Chicago school, Laffer curves, Sir Alan Walters. The impact of Reagan and Thatcher has been felt for decades If Obama's rescue package didn't go far enough (as Biden believes), surely that was because he was looking at the disruptive and growing power of the conservative Tea Party movement. Both Clinton and Blair saw their paths to victory through the elusive ""third way"": free-market economic liberalism with a big dollop of concern for the least well off. After the morale-sapping defeats of the 1980s-  both for Labour in the UK and Democrats in the US - the head-scratching was intense on what they needed to do to win. Both Bill Clinton and Tony Blair came to believe firmly that tax-raising and big government pledges would not reverse that trend. But Biden - for better or worse - looks like he is using the pandemic and the woeful state of America's infrastructure to unapologetically say to the American people ""yep, big government is back"". It is territory that Republican opponents - still trying to sort out their post-Trumpian identity - will be keen to fight on. This video can not be played Can the next generation unify America? Joe Biden's former pollster is even more bullish, arguing the president should be more direct about the need to raise taxes on the wealthiest to pay for this ambition. Make no mistake: this is a big break and a mighty gamble. So far, his approval ratings on the ground where he has chosen to fight - handling of coronavirus, the economic stimulus, his plans for infrastructure - have been really positive. Less so over the chaos at the southern border; something the president now acknowledges is a crisis. And the perennial issue of gun control is going to lead to a lot of huffing and puffing, but it's hard to see what he will be able to achieve through legislation, given the fine balance of the Senate. Joe Biden has been a stickler for sticking to social distancing and mask wearing, marking a big distinction with the freewheeling, coronavirus super-spreading White House of his predecessor. Meetings with the president are kept socially distanced; protocols strictly adhered to. But this time last month an interesting meeting took place in the East Room. Biden evoked FDR Presidential historian Jon Meacham brought in a number of his eminent colleagues for a sitdown that Joe Biden was anxious to host. At this stage, only around 60 days into his presidency, Biden was already thinking about his legacy and what he needed to do; what was the limit of presidential power; what lessons could he learn from his predecessors. At one point he turns to - perhaps - the most revered of these presidential scholars, Doris Kearns Goodwin, and says ""I'm no FDR, butâ¦ "" Perhaps Joe Biden is eyeing this as his moment to deliver a New Deal Ã  la Franklin Delano Roosevelt following the Great Depression, or the war on poverty and fight against racial inequality that was championed in the 1960s by Lyndon B Johnson. The taunt of Donald Trump during the campaign was that Biden may have been in politics for over four decades, but what did he have to show for it. It looks like in power he is trying to give a mighty clear answer to that question - even if it doesn't make for great theatre. Republicans defend - and some attack - Trump.

"President Joe Biden delivered his first address to a joint session of the US Congress Biden said: ""America is rising anew. Choosing hope over fear"" He cited the Capitol riot as ""the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War"" The Republican response from Senator Tim Scott repudiated ""Washington schemes or socialist dreams"" The Biden speech was held on the eve of the Democrat's 100th day in office In a historic first for the US, both people seated behind the president during the speech were women Mr Biden pitched two massive spending packages to overhaul the US social safety net Thanks for joining our live coverage of President Biden's first address to Congress. Read our roundup of the key moments from tonight. It's wheels up tomorrow morning as the president visits former president Jimmy Carter and ex-first lady Rosalynn in Georgia. Your live coverage was brought to you by Ritu Prasad, Sam Cabral, Anthony Zurcher and Tara McKelvey, and edited by Jude Sheerin. If Joe Biden runs for a second term in 2024, his potential Republican challengers will be ready. Chris Christie, who is rumoured to be considering another 2024 run, wasted no time sharing his reaction to the president's remarks. In his role as a regular contributor to ABC News, Christie commented: ""The words of this speech sounded like what you would hear from a 15 year old if you gave him a credit card with no credit limit on it."" ""Except the words came from an adult who should know better,"" he continued. A former governor of New Jersey and former federal prosecutor, Christie ran for president in 2016 but dropped out early and became a close ally of Donald Trump. He has disavowed the former president since the riot at the US Capitol in January. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy slammed the president's big spending proposals in a statement released shortly after his speech. Arguing the economy is ""on the verge
of an incredible comeback"", he says Biden is instead focused on ""the most
radical socialist agenda in American history"". McCarthy claims the White House will crush economic opportunity because it is intent on raising taxes, destroying jobs and indebting future generations. ""When you add it all up,
the cost of the Biden Spending Spree is astonishing: over $6,000,000,000,000 in
his first 100 days,"" he writes. ""Republicans will work
with anyone to rebuild America, restore our way of life, and renew the American
Dream,"" he goes on. ""But we cannot tax and spend our way out of our problems, and we cannot
allow the United States to go down the path of socialism."" Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly praised parts of Biden's first address - but says he was left wanting on immigration issues. ""While I share President Bidenâs urgency in fixing our broken immigration system, what I didnât hear tonight was a plan to address the immediate crisis at the border, and I will continue holding this administration accountable to deliver the resources and staffing necessary for a humane, orderly process as we work to improve border security, support local economies, and fix our immigration system."" Kelly's state is in the south-western US and lies along the border with Mexico, meaning many there have experienced the immigration crisis first hand. He is up for re-election next year. Here's the beginning of Biden's speech when he notes a historic first sitting right behind him. This video can not be played 'About time' for Madam Speaker, Madam Vice-President In his rebuttal, Republican Tim Scott is lashing out at the Democratic criticisms of the new Georgia election law. Democrats have said this new law aims to restrict voting in future elections, but Republicans who control the state's government say it expands access and increases election security. Defending Georgiaâs law, he says big majorities of voters support voter ID measures. Scott says it is a mainstream law that makes it easier to vote early than in Democratic New York. He says the president âabsurdly claims this is worse than Jim Crowâ, a reference to historic US racial segregation. ""This is not about civil rights or our racial past, it's about rigging elections in the future,"" Scott says. ""Race is not a political weapon to sell every issue the way one side wants,â he adds. Our Reality Check team took a look at what exactly is in this new election law. The Biden administration has been vocal about the need to follow Covid-19 restrictions, especially wearing a mask and standing at least 6ft apart. That makes the president and his team easy prey for critics when they are not following those rules themselves. During Biden's speech, lawmakers sat spaced apart inside the venue, with their masks on. But, with the speech ending, they gathered together to surround the president and hobnob with fellow legislators. Andrew Clark, an alumnus of the Trump administration, quickly called it out as ""asinine theater"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

South Carolinian Tim Scott, who is the only black Republican senator (Democrats have two), is now addressing issues of racism in America. ""I know what it feels like to be pulled over for no reason, to be followed around a store for no reason,"" he says. He adds that his grandfather never learned to read, but would hold up the newspaper to set the right example at the breakfast table He says he gets called horrible racial slurs by liberals and progressives. ""Believe me, I know first-hand our healing is not finished."" He accuses Democrats of wanting ""the issue more than they want the solution"". ""America is not a racist country. It's backwards to fight discrimination with different types of discrimination and it's wrong to try to use our painful past to dishonestly shut down debates in the present."" Scott critiques the American Jobs Plan as the ""most liberal"" in history. ""Republicans support everything you think of when you think of infrastructure,"" Scott tells viewers. ""But again - Democrats want a partisan wishlist. They won't even build bridges to build bridges."" He says Biden's plan is a waste of money and a job-killer that would ""lower wages of the average American worker"". House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office has quickly released a statement praising her party's leader for his speech. âTonight,
the American people heard President Joe Biden deliver a unifying message of
resilience, resolve and hope,"" it reads. Touting ""extraordinary progress"" and the president's ""ambitious, transformative vision"", Pelosi calls the moment a once-in-a-century opportunity for the US economy. âThe
Democratic Congress looks forward to working with the Biden-Harris
Administration to enact this historic vision for lower healthcare costs, for
bigger paychecks, for cleaner government, For The People,â it ends. Karishma VaswaniAsia business correspondent This was a speech to show the world that America is back - and here to stay - in President Bidenâs words. It was also a reminder to strategic competitors like China that the US wonât sit back and let Beijing advance economically or in the key future industries of technology and artificial intelligence. Biden talked about China and Chinese President Xi at least four times during his speech, highlighting the importance of this relationship. He referenced how much time he has spent with the Chinese leader - explaining how President Xi is âdeadly earnestâ about becoming the most consequential nation in the world. Biden said he doesnât want a conflict with the worldâs second largest economy but that the US will stand up for its fundamental trade rights, and fight back against the theft of intellectual property, and subsidies to state owned enterprises. These are consistently the complaints the US has had about the way China and Chinese companies operate, which it says threatens the livelihoods of American workers. He also talked about the need for more investment in American research and development, which has fallen behind other countries like China in recent decades. Just ahead of the customary Republican rebuttal, the head of the party's national committee weighed in. Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called Biden's first 100 days ""an unqualified failure"", with ""attacks on energy workers, a humanitarian crisis at the border and an America-last foreign policy agenda"". She also criticised Democratic attempts to end the filibuster (read our North America reporter's analysis on that here) and ""pack"" the nation's top court. ""In his inaugural address, Biden called for unity. That was a lie, and our nation is worse off and more divided thanks to Joe Biden."" South Carolina Senator Tim Scott begins the Republican rebuttal to Bidenâs speech. âOur nation is starving for more than empty platitudes,â he says of the presidentâs remarks. ""Three months in, the actions of the president and his party are pulling us further apart."" Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Joe Biden's speech to Congress started as a victory lap and ended with a warning. He began by touting what has been by all accounts a very successful rollout of vaccinations in the US, paving the way for a return to some semblance of normalcy in the months ahead. He boasted of hundreds of thousands of new jobs created in his first 100 days and a growing economy. He touted recently passed funding that will help cut child poverty in the US in half. That was all a set-up, however, for the presidentâs pitch for more â more spending and more action from Congress. He proposed a trillion-dollar package of universal pre-kindergarten, two years of free college education, family leave and childcare funding. He called for legislation on gun control, immigration, criminal justice reform and voting rights. He concluded, however, by turning to the 6 January attack on the US Capitol and the threat posed to democracy by the worldâs autocratic nations. He assured the nation that the US will prevail. His ending, however, seemed designed to create a sense of urgency â one that, perhaps, he can harness to achieve the ambitious agenda he set out on Wednesday night. ""We have stared into an abyss of insurrection and autocracy â of pandemic and pain â and 'We the People' did not flinch,"" says Biden. ""At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail. We came together. United. With light and hope, we summoned new strength and new resolve."" So, after about 65 minutes and 6,000-plus words, concludes the president's first speech to Congress. He's now chatting with lawmakers in the chamber (masks abound, but the social distancing measures that were the rationale for the scaled-down audience have been abandoned). Reality Check President Biden has faced criticism over the increased numbers of migrants crossing into the US over its southern border with Mexico. At a news conference in March, he said: ""There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. It happens every year."" The US Customs and Border Protection agency releases monthly figures on the number of ""encounters"" at the south-west land border. The number fluctuates widely - but there is not always a significant increase during the winter months. In January and February 2021, 78,442 and 100,441 people were encountered - a significant increase on the figures for the same two months in the previous year, which were each just over 36,000. Since President Biden made the claim, the count for March has been released - 172,331, the highest in recent years. In 2020, encounters at the border fell slightly between January and March. In 2018, they remained relatively steady. Read Reality Check's full fact-check here. Biden tells lawmakers they should take action on - or at least debate -  immigration reform because it would be popular with the American public. ""Letâs end our exhausting war over immigration,"" he says. The administration has struggled with the influx of migrants at the US-Mexico border, turning back adults based on Trump-era policies but taking in record numbers of unaccompanied adults. It has separately proposed a comprehensive immigration overhaul, which would include giving about 11 million undocumented people a legal pathway to US citizenship. The president also makes mention of his deputy, Kamala Harris, who he has asked to address the root causes of the border crisis. He says he has ""absolute confidence she will get the job done"". ""The country supports immigration reform,"" says Biden. ""Congress should act."" Biden's speech draws to a close. He recalls the events of 6 January, when Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, and asks lawmakers to prove democracy can rise above such actions. ""Can our democracy deliver on the most pressing needs of our people? Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate and fears that have pulled us apart? Americaâs adversaries â the autocrats of the world â are betting it canât,"" he says. ""They believe we are too full of anger and division and rage. They look at the images of the mob that assaulted this Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy. ""They are wrong. And we have to prove them wrong. We have to prove democracy still works."" Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Biden said last year that, if elected, heâd address the issue of police brutality, with a national commission on policing, and âreal actionâ. Weeks passed, and no action. Then, the verdict in Derek Chauvinâs trial focused the nationâs attention on police violence, once again. In terms of action, the president is calling for legislation in his speech, rather than a national commission on policing. Yet it remains unclear whether he has enough political power to usher in new laws on policing, or bring about the broad changes that heâd once promised. Biden says: ""We wonât ignore what our own intelligence agencies have determined â the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today is from white supremacist terrorism."" ""We have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black America,"" he continues, referring to George Floyd's murder. On police he says: ""Most men and women in uniform wear their badge and serve their communities honorably."" But he says work must be done ""to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve"". ""To root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played The first time 'Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President' were said US President Joe Biden has laid out a sweeping investment plan for jobs, education and social care in his first speech to a joint session of Congress. Delivered on the eve of his 100th day in office, the Democrat pitched some $4 trillion (Â£2.9tn) in spending - the largest overhaul of US benefits since the 1960s, analysts say. He called it a ""once in a generation investment in America itself"". But the plans face a battle in Congress before they can become law. There has been widespread opposition to the proposals from the Republican Party, which is unlikely to back tax increases and more government spending. And while there is a slim Democratic majority in both houses, there has been division among the party over how far to go with the plans. Five key moments from Biden's speech to Congress What we all got wrong about Biden The biggest obstacle to Biden getting his way In a historic moment, US Vice-President Kamala Harris - the first woman to hold that office - and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi both sat behind Mr Biden during Wednesday night's address. It was the first time two women appeared behind the president during a speech to Congress. After addressing Ms Harris in his opening remarks as Madam Vice-President, Mr Biden added: ""No president has ever said those words from this podium. And it's about time."" The 78-year-old president, buoyed by solid approval ratings, presented theAmerican Jobs Plan,externaland theAmerican Families Plan,external. The White House said the proposals would be funded by tax raises on corporations and the wealthiest Americans. ""It's time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1%... to pay their fair share,"" Mr Biden said at an event that was scaled back due to the pandemic. What Americans think of Joe Biden so far Biden's first 100 days fact-checked He described the American Jobs Plan as ""a blue-collar blueprint to build America"" that would boost investment in public transport, high-speed broadband and roads and bridges. He added that the plan would be guided by the fight against climate change. ""When I think climate change I think jobs,"" he said. ""There's no reason why American workers can't lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries."" He said the $1.8tn American Families Plan, meanwhile, would focus on children and seek to provide: Free pre-school for children aged three to four Paid family and medical leave as well as health insurance subsidies Tuition-free community college for all An extension of key tax breaks that have been expanded during the pandemic The proposal follows the so-called American Rescue Plan, a $1.9tn coronavirus stimulus package that included direct cheques to most Americans, which Mr Biden signed into law last month. On Wednesday, he framed these latest proposals in the context of foreign policy and said the US was ""in a competition with China and other countries to win the 21st century"". He also called for politicians from both parties to back his plans and said he was willing to work with both sides. Joe Biden's speech to Congress started as a victory lap and ended with a warning. He began by touting what has been by all accounts a very successful rollout of vaccinations in the US, paving the way for a return to some semblance of normalcy in the months ahead.

His ending, however, seemed designed to create a sense of urgency - one that, perhaps, he can harness to achieve the ambitious agenda he set out on Wednesday night. What has Biden done in 100 days? Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Mr Biden's first 100 days in office were ""an unqualified failure"", accusing him and his party of ""hyper-partisanship"". ""In his inaugural address, Biden called for unity. That was a lie, and our nation is worse-off and more divided thanks to Joe Biden,"" her statement read. The top Republican in the House, Kevin McCarthy, was more concise. ""This whole thing could have just been an email,"" he wrote on Twitter. Who is Republican Senator Tim Scott? Biden unveils 'once in a generation' spending plan Is the US more or less unified under Joe Biden? Senator Tim Scott - a possible contender for the White House in 2024 and the only black Republican senator - followed Mr Biden's speech with the traditional rebuttal from the opposition party. He said the proposals would ""lower wages of the average American worker"" and dismissed them as a ""liberal wish list of big government waste"". Mr Scott then discussed racism in America, accusing Democrats of wanting ""the issue more than they want the solution"". ""America is not a racist country. It's backwards to fight discrimination with different types of discrimination and it's wrong to try to use our painful past to dishonestly shut down debates in the present,"" he said.

"Botswana is home to the world's largest population of elephants Footage has emerged of the head of the US National Rifle Association (NRA) repeatedly shooting an elephant in Botswana, sparking outrage. First published bythe New Yorker,externalandThe Trace,externalon Tuesday, the 2013 video shows Wayne LaPierre firing at the animal from point-blank range. After Mr LaPierre struggles to kill it, another hunter takes the fatal shot. It has led to an outcry from animal rights groups and questions about Mr LaPierre's bungled efforts. At the time it was not illegal to hunt elephants in Botswana, though it has since been restricted. In November last year the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Endangered Specieslisted the species of elephant killed as endangered,external. Ingrid Newkirk, president of animal rights group Peta condemned the footage and called for Congress to cut ties with the NRA. ""Behind the NRA's macho posturing are scared little men who pay tens of thousands of dollars for someone else to track elephants so that they can shoot them ineptly at close range,""she said in a statement,external. But the NRA has defended the footage.

The NRA head is seen shooting the elephant from range, wounding it. Realising he has not killed the animal, the guides take him in close and show him exactly where to shoot to kill it. But Mr LaPierre repeatedly fails to finish off the elephant. He grows frustrated, asking the guides, ""Where are you telling me to shoot?"" Why is US gun lobby NRA so controversial? America's gun culture in charts After his third shot, Tony Makris - an adviser to Mr LaPierre and the host of Under Wild Skies - lifts his rifle and kills the animal. He then turns to congratulate the NRA head. Later in the footage, Mr LaPierre's wife Susan kills another elephant herself, cutting off its tail and holding it in the air saying ""Victory"". Botswana has more than 130,000 elephants, the world's largest population. Officials banned the right to hunt elephants in 2014 but this was then revoked in May 2019, andlast year the government auctioned off hunting permits.

"Marc Toone now suffers from panic attacks and has flashbacks of the attack A man has been sentenced after blinding a motorcyclist in one eye by throwing an egg at him from a car. Marc Toone, 33, was hit by the missile while travelling home from work in Wigston, Leicestershire in January 2020. He was taken to hospital but doctors were unable to save his right eye. Thomas Connor, 18, was given a 12-month training and detention order after pleading guilty to multiple offences at Leicester Magistrates' Court. Leicestershire Police said Connors was driving a car that was linked to several reports of egg throwing on the day Mr Toone was injured. People and vehicles in the Market Harborough area were hit but no other serious injuries were reported, the force said. Mr Toone was riding home on his motorcycle when he was hit in the face in Newton Lane. Mr Toone was hit by the egg in Newton Lane He had lifted up the visor on his helmet as the cold weather had made it steam up. He spent a week in hospital and underwent two operations but the sight in his right eye could not be saved. ""I have got used to what has happened but every day I get up and I look in the mirror and it is there,"" he said. ""It's a permanent reminder of what has happened and something I have to see every day."" Latest news and stories from the East Midlands He has returned to work as a chef but says his loss of sight had made once simple tasks much more challenging. He has also struggled to sleep due to panic attacks and flashbacks. Leicestershire Police said a month earlier, Connors had also thrown eggs at a woman walking her dog in Whetstone, leaving her with facial swelling and eye pain.

"President Joe Biden delivered his first address to a joint session of the US Congress Biden said: ""America is rising anew. Choosing hope over fear"" He cited the Capitol riot as ""the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War"" The Republican response from Senator Tim Scott repudiated ""Washington schemes or socialist dreams"" The Biden speech was held on the eve of the Democrat's 100th day in office In a historic first for the US, both people seated behind the president during the speech were women Mr Biden pitched two massive spending packages to overhaul the US social safety net Thanks for joining our live coverage of President Biden's first address to Congress. Read our roundup of the key moments from tonight. It's wheels up tomorrow morning as the president visits former president Jimmy Carter and ex-first lady Rosalynn in Georgia. Your live coverage was brought to you by Ritu Prasad, Sam Cabral, Anthony Zurcher and Tara McKelvey, and edited by Jude Sheerin. If Joe Biden runs for a second term in 2024, his potential Republican challengers will be ready. Chris Christie, who is rumoured to be considering another 2024 run, wasted no time sharing his reaction to the president's remarks. In his role as a regular contributor to ABC News, Christie commented: ""The words of this speech sounded like what you would hear from a 15 year old if you gave him a credit card with no credit limit on it."" ""Except the words came from an adult who should know better,"" he continued. A former governor of New Jersey and former federal prosecutor, Christie ran for president in 2016 but dropped out early and became a close ally of Donald Trump. He has disavowed the former president since the riot at the US Capitol in January. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy slammed the president's big spending proposals in a statement released shortly after his speech. Arguing the economy is ""on the verge
of an incredible comeback"", he says Biden is instead focused on ""the most
radical socialist agenda in American history"". McCarthy claims the White House will crush economic opportunity because it is intent on raising taxes, destroying jobs and indebting future generations. ""When you add it all up,
the cost of the Biden Spending Spree is astonishing: over $6,000,000,000,000 in
his first 100 days,"" he writes. ""Republicans will work
with anyone to rebuild America, restore our way of life, and renew the American
Dream,"" he goes on. ""But we cannot tax and spend our way out of our problems, and we cannot
allow the United States to go down the path of socialism."" Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly praised parts of Biden's first address - but says he was left wanting on immigration issues. ""While I share President Bidenâs urgency in fixing our broken immigration system, what I didnât hear tonight was a plan to address the immediate crisis at the border, and I will continue holding this administration accountable to deliver the resources and staffing necessary for a humane, orderly process as we work to improve border security, support local economies, and fix our immigration system."" Kelly's state is in the south-western US and lies along the border with Mexico, meaning many there have experienced the immigration crisis first hand. He is up for re-election next year. Here's the beginning of Biden's speech when he notes a historic first sitting right behind him. This video can not be played 'About time' for Madam Speaker, Madam Vice-President In his rebuttal, Republican Tim Scott is lashing out at the Democratic criticisms of the new Georgia election law. Democrats have said this new law aims to restrict voting in future elections, but Republicans who control the state's government say it expands access and increases election security. Defending Georgiaâs law, he says big majorities of voters support voter ID measures. Scott says it is a mainstream law that makes it easier to vote early than in Democratic New York. He says the president âabsurdly claims this is worse than Jim Crowâ, a reference to historic US racial segregation. ""This is not about civil rights or our racial past, it's about rigging elections in the future,"" Scott says. ""Race is not a political weapon to sell every issue the way one side wants,â he adds. Our Reality Check team took a look at what exactly is in this new election law. The Biden administration has been vocal about the need to follow Covid-19 restrictions, especially wearing a mask and standing at least 6ft apart. That makes the president and his team easy prey for critics when they are not following those rules themselves. During Biden's speech, lawmakers sat spaced apart inside the venue, with their masks on. But, with the speech ending, they gathered together to surround the president and hobnob with fellow legislators. Andrew Clark, an alumnus of the Trump administration, quickly called it out as ""asinine theater"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

South Carolinian Tim Scott, who is the only black Republican senator (Democrats have two), is now addressing issues of racism in America. ""I know what it feels like to be pulled over for no reason, to be followed around a store for no reason,"" he says. He adds that his grandfather never learned to read, but would hold up the newspaper to set the right example at the breakfast table He says he gets called horrible racial slurs by liberals and progressives. ""Believe me, I know first-hand our healing is not finished."" He accuses Democrats of wanting ""the issue more than they want the solution"". ""America is not a racist country. It's backwards to fight discrimination with different types of discrimination and it's wrong to try to use our painful past to dishonestly shut down debates in the present."" Scott critiques the American Jobs Plan as the ""most liberal"" in history. ""Republicans support everything you think of when you think of infrastructure,"" Scott tells viewers. ""But again - Democrats want a partisan wishlist. They won't even build bridges to build bridges."" He says Biden's plan is a waste of money and a job-killer that would ""lower wages of the average American worker"". House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office has quickly released a statement praising her party's leader for his speech. âTonight,
the American people heard President Joe Biden deliver a unifying message of
resilience, resolve and hope,"" it reads. Touting ""extraordinary progress"" and the president's ""ambitious, transformative vision"", Pelosi calls the moment a once-in-a-century opportunity for the US economy. âThe
Democratic Congress looks forward to working with the Biden-Harris
Administration to enact this historic vision for lower healthcare costs, for
bigger paychecks, for cleaner government, For The People,â it ends. Karishma VaswaniAsia business correspondent This was a speech to show the world that America is back - and here to stay - in President Bidenâs words. It was also a reminder to strategic competitors like China that the US wonât sit back and let Beijing advance economically or in the key future industries of technology and artificial intelligence. Biden talked about China and Chinese President Xi at least four times during his speech, highlighting the importance of this relationship. He referenced how much time he has spent with the Chinese leader - explaining how President Xi is âdeadly earnestâ about becoming the most consequential nation in the world. Biden said he doesnât want a conflict with the worldâs second largest economy but that the US will stand up for its fundamental trade rights, and fight back against the theft of intellectual property, and subsidies to state owned enterprises. These are consistently the complaints the US has had about the way China and Chinese companies operate, which it says threatens the livelihoods of American workers. He also talked about the need for more investment in American research and development, which has fallen behind other countries like China in recent decades. Just ahead of the customary Republican rebuttal, the head of the party's national committee weighed in. Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called Biden's first 100 days ""an unqualified failure"", with ""attacks on energy workers, a humanitarian crisis at the border and an America-last foreign policy agenda"". She also criticised Democratic attempts to end the filibuster (read our North America reporter's analysis on that here) and ""pack"" the nation's top court. ""In his inaugural address, Biden called for unity. That was a lie, and our nation is worse off and more divided thanks to Joe Biden."" South Carolina Senator Tim Scott begins the Republican rebuttal to Bidenâs speech. âOur nation is starving for more than empty platitudes,â he says of the presidentâs remarks. ""Three months in, the actions of the president and his party are pulling us further apart."" Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Joe Biden's speech to Congress started as a victory lap and ended with a warning. He began by touting what has been by all accounts a very successful rollout of vaccinations in the US, paving the way for a return to some semblance of normalcy in the months ahead. He boasted of hundreds of thousands of new jobs created in his first 100 days and a growing economy. He touted recently passed funding that will help cut child poverty in the US in half. That was all a set-up, however, for the presidentâs pitch for more â more spending and more action from Congress. He proposed a trillion-dollar package of universal pre-kindergarten, two years of free college education, family leave and childcare funding. He called for legislation on gun control, immigration, criminal justice reform and voting rights. He concluded, however, by turning to the 6 January attack on the US Capitol and the threat posed to democracy by the worldâs autocratic nations. He assured the nation that the US will prevail. His ending, however, seemed designed to create a sense of urgency â one that, perhaps, he can harness to achieve the ambitious agenda he set out on Wednesday night. ""We have stared into an abyss of insurrection and autocracy â of pandemic and pain â and 'We the People' did not flinch,"" says Biden. ""At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail. We came together. United. With light and hope, we summoned new strength and new resolve."" So, after about 65 minutes and 6,000-plus words, concludes the president's first speech to Congress. He's now chatting with lawmakers in the chamber (masks abound, but the social distancing measures that were the rationale for the scaled-down audience have been abandoned). Reality Check President Biden has faced criticism over the increased numbers of migrants crossing into the US over its southern border with Mexico. At a news conference in March, he said: ""There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. It happens every year."" The US Customs and Border Protection agency releases monthly figures on the number of ""encounters"" at the south-west land border. The number fluctuates widely - but there is not always a significant increase during the winter months. In January and February 2021, 78,442 and 100,441 people were encountered - a significant increase on the figures for the same two months in the previous year, which were each just over 36,000. Since President Biden made the claim, the count for March has been released - 172,331, the highest in recent years. In 2020, encounters at the border fell slightly between January and March. In 2018, they remained relatively steady. Read Reality Check's full fact-check here. Biden tells lawmakers they should take action on - or at least debate -  immigration reform because it would be popular with the American public. ""Letâs end our exhausting war over immigration,"" he says. The administration has struggled with the influx of migrants at the US-Mexico border, turning back adults based on Trump-era policies but taking in record numbers of unaccompanied adults. It has separately proposed a comprehensive immigration overhaul, which would include giving about 11 million undocumented people a legal pathway to US citizenship. The president also makes mention of his deputy, Kamala Harris, who he has asked to address the root causes of the border crisis. He says he has ""absolute confidence she will get the job done"". ""The country supports immigration reform,"" says Biden. ""Congress should act."" Biden's speech draws to a close. He recalls the events of 6 January, when Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, and asks lawmakers to prove democracy can rise above such actions. ""Can our democracy deliver on the most pressing needs of our people? Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate and fears that have pulled us apart? Americaâs adversaries â the autocrats of the world â are betting it canât,"" he says. ""They believe we are too full of anger and division and rage. They look at the images of the mob that assaulted this Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy. ""They are wrong. And we have to prove them wrong. We have to prove democracy still works."" Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Biden said last year that, if elected, heâd address the issue of police brutality, with a national commission on policing, and âreal actionâ. Weeks passed, and no action. Then, the verdict in Derek Chauvinâs trial focused the nationâs attention on police violence, once again. In terms of action, the president is calling for legislation in his speech, rather than a national commission on policing. Yet it remains unclear whether he has enough political power to usher in new laws on policing, or bring about the broad changes that heâd once promised. Biden says: ""We wonât ignore what our own intelligence agencies have determined â the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today is from white supremacist terrorism."" ""We have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black America,"" he continues, referring to George Floyd's murder. On police he says: ""Most men and women in uniform wear their badge and serve their communities honorably."" But he says work must be done ""to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve"". ""To root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played ""It has been the privilege of my life to serve the people of Northern Ireland"" Arlene Foster has announced her resignation as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party and as NI first minister after an internal revolt. Mrs Foster, 50, said she would step down as DUP leader on 28 May and as first minister at the end of June. More than 20 DUP NI Assembly members and four MPs signed a letter voicing no-confidence in the leadership. Mrs Foster said it had been the privilege of her life to serve the people of Northern Ireland. She became leader of the party in December 2015 and, the following month as leader of Stormont's largest party, she was appointed first minister of Northern Ireland. She was the first woman and the youngest person to hold both jobs. Follow live reaction to resignation Read Mrs Foster's full statementhere,external. Mrs Foster said it had been the privilege of her life to ""serve the people of Northern Ireland as their first minister and to represent my home constituency of Fermanagh/South Tyrone"". ""My election as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party broke a glass ceiling and I am glad to have inspired other women to enter politics and spurred them on to take up elected office,"" Mrs Foster said. ""I understand the misogynistic criticisms that female public figures have to take and sadly it's the same for all women in public life. ""I want to encourage you to keep going and don't let the online lynch mobs get you down."" This video can not be played A look back at Arlene Foster's political career It is understood there is majority support among the party's Stormont and Westminster ranks - about 80% -  for a change in leadership. It is believed 22 of the DUP's 27 MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly) and four MPs signed a letter of no confidence in Mrs Foster and the party leadership. Only a small number of the DUP membership - MLAs and MPs - will get to vote in a leadership contest. If there is a leadership contest, it will be the first in the DUP's 50-year history. Mrs Foster said it was important to give space over the coming weeks for the party officers to make arrangements for the election of a new leader. From trailblazing leader to party civil war Why did the DUP move against Arlene Foster? 'The DUP has lost touch with ordinary unionists' Mrs Foster has endured a turbulent time as DUP leader and the fall-out from Brexit - which the party supported - has put particular pressure on the party's top brass as it faces having to weather the storm caused bythe Northern Ireland Protocol, which imposed a border down the Irish Sea. It has also been suggested recent changes to NI's abortion laws and the commitment to implement an Irish language act were causing concerns with some elected DUP representatives ahead of next year's assembly election. This was inevitable. It was just a question of time. With those numbers against her, there was no way Arlene Foster could hang on. She did not want to go, and if there was a way she could have stayed, she would have stayed. But I imagine she is pretty sad tonight. I know Arlene Foster well. She loved being party leader, she loved being first minister. It's been bruising at times, it's been tough. The DUP, at the minute, looks like a very difficult party to lead. Whoever takes over has a Herculean task to get things back on track. Mrs Foster said she was ""the first to recognise there have been ups and downs over the last five and a half years"" of her leadership. ""The 2016 assembly election result and our party's best ever Westminster result in 2017 stand out among the high points when the electorate sent a clear message that they wanted to keep Northern Ireland moving forward,"" she said. Mrs Foster added that as she prepared to ""depart the political stage"", Northern Ireland would only prosper if built on the ""foundations of successful and durable devolution"". In a social media post, Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked Arlene Foster for her ""dedication to the people of Northern Ireland"" and said he hoped she stayed in public service ""for years to come"".

In November 2018, Mr Johnson gave the keynote speech at the DUP's annual conference, in which he said the UK must""junk the backstop"", referring to efforts in the Brexit negotiations to avoid a hard Irish border. This was met with rapturous applause, however, relations would later sour between Mr Johnson and Mrs Foster after he became prime minister when the Brexit deal imposed checks and restrictions to Irish Sea trade. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis also paid tribute to Mrs Foster as a ""truly dedicated public servant"" and said young women in particular would be inspired by her example to follow a path into politics. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - the joint head of the Northern Ireland government along with Mrs Foster - said the incoming DUP leader should recognise that the political landscape across the island had changed. ""The broad community are impatient for social reform and political change which reflects a modern and progressive society where everyone can feel that they belong on an equal basis,"" she said. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she had a decent if challenging relationship with Mrs Foster Ms O'Neill said she and Mrs Foster had a decent if challenging relationship. She said they had worked well together through the Covid pandemic. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney tweeted his best wishes to Mrs Foster. Allow Twitter content?

SDLP leader Colum Eastwood also extended his best wishes to the outgoing first minister. ""We disagree on almost everything but she has clearly been a committed servant to her party for a long time,"" he said. Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken said her departure demonstrated how difficult a life in politics could be. He said there was now a place for a ""progressive and modern approach to unionism"". Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister said it was a difficult day for Mrs Foster, adding he had found her ""straightforward"" in his dealings with her. Mrs Foster waselected as the first female leader of the DUP in December 2015, taking over from Peter Robinson. She was the only candidate. Her time at the helm has been seen many challenges, having faced Brexit, a botched green energy scandal which subsequently led to the collapse of Stormont for three years and Covid-19. The aftermath of Brexit has also caused friction both internally and between the party and some of its core voters who are unhappy at the deal which led to the Irish Sea border. DUP councillors had called for the resignation of both Mrs Foster and party deputy leader Lord Dodds (pictured right) The DUP has argued that it has never supported the Northern Ireland protocol and has actively tried to have it overthrown. It was not just MLAs and MPs that voiced their discontent in Mrs Foster. Letters from a number of party councillors were also written, calling for Mrs Foster and deputy leader Lord Dodds to resign. A number of issues of concern were listed, ranging from the NI Protocol, abortion legislation, same sex marriage, policing and the recent gay conversion debate at Stormont. Possible contenders to replace Mrs Foster include NI Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots, Lagan Valley MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson. There has been speculation of a split role, with one person for first minister and then a party leader at Westminster. Mr Poots tweeted that he wanted to thank Mrs Foster for her ""service, sacrifice and commitment to the DUP and country"". Gavin Robinson thanked Mrs Foster for her ""dedicated service to Northern Ireland"" and said there would be ""more to say about what lies ahead in the days to come"". DUP rules say a leadership election should be called by 30 April. Normally this is simply a formality and the existing leader continues in their role, but other candidates are free to challenge them. Only a small number of party members are eligible to vote in such a contest - MPs and NI Assembly members (MLAs). There are 27 MLAs that hold the party whip - including Mrs Foster - and eight MPs. Party rules currently state the leader of the party must be an MLA, but there has been talk of changing this rule to allow an MP to hold the role. Boris Johnson and then NI Secretary Julian Smith visited Stormont in January 2020 to mark the restoration of devolution The role of first minister is separate, but as the largest party from the largest grouping (unionism) in the assembly, the DUP is entitled to nominate someone to hold the post of first minister. Once Mrs Foster steps down as first minister, the DUP would then be asked to nominate a replacement within seven days and a vote would be held in the assembly. If a replacement is not nominated, then the Northern Ireland secretary is obliged to call an assembly election. TheNew Decade, New Approach deal,external, which was signed in January 2020 and restored the NI Assembly after a three-year hiatus, included a commitment to extend the time to appoint a new first or deputy first minister after a resignation from seven days to six weeks. However, this has not yet been legislated for. A UK government spokesperson told the BBC that ""good progress"" was being made with the legislation and it would be brought forward during the second parliamentary session.
