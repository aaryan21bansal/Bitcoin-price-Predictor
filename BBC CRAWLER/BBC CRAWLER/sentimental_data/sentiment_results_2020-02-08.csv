"The group shared this chalet in the French Alpine ski resort of Contamines-Montjoie Five Britons have tested positive for coronavirus in eastern France, the French health minister has confirmed. Four adults and a child were diagnosed with the virus after coming into contact with a British national who recently returned from Singapore. The man returned to the UK on 28 January before being diagnosed with the virus himself on Thursday. Meanwhile, a final UK repatriation flight with over 200 passengers has left Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak. The flight is due to land in the UK in the early hours of Sunday morning, when passengers will be taken to a conference centre in Milton Keynes for a 14-day quarantine. In France, the five Britons with the coronavirus - who were staying in the same ski chalet - are not in a serious condition, French officials said. But the authorities are closing two schools next week, both of which are attended by the child with the virus, a nine-year-old boy who lives in the ski resort of Contamines-Montjoie with his family. There have been almost 35,000 cases of the coronavirus globally, mostly in China. The latest infection is thought to stem from a man who becamethe UK's third confirmed casewhen he tested positive on his return to Brighton.

On his return to the UK, he is thought to have isolated himself at his Brighton home and called the NHS 111 number. After a positive test, he was taken to St Thomas' Hospital in London where he is being treated. Public Health England also advised a student at Portslade Aldridge Community Academy in Brighton to self-isolate for 14 days, as part of their investigation into the same case of coronavirus.

The chalet has two apartments where two families were staying. A British couple and their three children, who are now resident in France, lived in one. The mother is in the UK at the moment and has been contacted. Seven of their friends were staying in the other apartment.

"Harry arrived in Canada to join his wife Meghan last month The Duke and Duchess of Sussex attended a JP Morgan event in Miami on Thursday, a palace source has said. Prince Harry spoke at the event but it is unclear whether he was paid to appear. It comes after the couple said they would step back as ""senior royals"" and work to become financially independent. They intend to split their time between the UK and North America and, from the spring, will no longer be full-time working royals. They will stop using their HRH titles, no longer carry out royal duties or military appointments and no longer formally represent the Queen. The New York Post's Page Six,which first reported the story,external, said the Sussexes were ""keynote speakers"" as they made their first appearance together since the Queen granted their wish to step back as full-time royals. BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond says the ""presumption has to be that they weren't paid"" for the event because, for now, they are still working members of the Royal Family. CBS News host Gayle King introduced Meghan, who spoke of her love for her husband, before introducing him at 1 Hotel in Miami's South Beach, Page Six reported. He is said to have talked about his mental health, something he has spoken about many times in the past. In 2017,the duke revealed he sought counsellingafter ""shutting down"" his emotions for almost 20 years following the death of his mother. In an ITV documentary last year, Prince Harry described his mental health and the way he deals with the pressures of his life as a matter of ""constant management"". How might Harry and Meghan make money? Does a milk advert show Harry and Meghan's future? Prince Harry arrived in Vancouver Island last month, where his wife Meghan had been staying with their nine-month-old son Archie. The couple briefly returned to the UK in January following an extended six-week Christmas break there. Since the couple announced their desire to become financially independent there has been speculation about how they might make money. Public speaking, TV production and book deals have been touted as possible income sources for the couple. They also plan to launch a charitable foundation. Currently, 95% of the couple's income comes from Prince Charles's income fromthe Duchy of Cornwall,external, a vast portfolio of property and financial investments, which brought in Â£21.6m last year. It is believed the couple will continue to receive money from Prince Harry's father under the new agreement, although it is unclear whether this will come from the Duchy, his personal wealth, or a combination of the two. However, the Sussexes will stop receiving money from the taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant, which makes up the other 5% of their income. Does a milk advert show Harry and Meghan's future?

"By Saturday morning very few people were arriving from mainland China to Hong Kong Hong Kong has begun a mandatory two-week quarantine for anyone arriving from mainland China, in a fresh effort to contain the deadly new coronavirus. Visitors must isolate themselves in hotel rooms or government-run centres. Residents must stay inside their homes. Anyone caught flouting the new rules faces a fine and a prison sentence. Meanwhile, 723 deaths have been recorded in China, including one American. A Japanese man also died with symptoms consistent with the virus. A visual guide to the outbreak The Chinese doctor who tried to warn others In pictures: South Korea mass wedding defies virus fears The 60-year-old US citizen, the first confirmed non-Chinese victim of the illness, died on Thursday at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, according to a US embassy spokesman in Beijing, who did not give details. Separately, the Japanese foreign ministry said a man in his 60s died, also in Wuhan, from what was suspected to be a case of coronavirus. However, it said it could not confirm the diagnosis, and that Chinese officials said the cause of death was viral pneumonia. The city is opening its second makeshift hospital since the outbreak began. Leishenshan hospital was built in two weeks and will be able to accommodate 1,500 patients. This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor on what we know about the virus The number of confirmed cases in China stands at 34,598. Outside China, 288 cases have been confirmed in 24 countries, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), with one fatality in the Philippines. On Saturday, France confirmed five new cases in its Haute-Savoie region, including a nine-year-old boy and bringing the total of infected in the country to 11. French Health Minister AgnÃ¨s Buzyn said all of the five new cases were British nationals staying in the same chalet, which had also housed a Briton who had been in Singapore. Their condition is not said to be serious. A further six people who stayed at the chalet are under observation. Two schools - one the nine-year-old boy has been attending, along with another school where he has French classes - have been closed as a precaution. Nurse describes 'heartbreaking' job Diary of a life in locked-down Wuhan In Hong Kong, there have been 26 confirmed cases. Tens of thousands of travellers queued at the Chinese border city of Shenzhen to beat the Friday midnight deadline. But by Saturday morning, only a trickle of people were arriving via the Shenzhen Bay Port crossing. In a press conference, Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam said the territory's government only has 12 million face masks, which she expects to be used up within one month. She appealed for anyone with resources to buy masks to ""donate them to people in need"". Meanwhile, three more people have tested positive for the virus on a quarantined cruise ship in Yokohama harbour, bringing the total number of cases on board to 64. There was some positive news on Friday when the WHO said there had been fewer reported infections in China in the past two days. However, its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, cautioned against reading too much into those figures. This video can not be played Footage appearing to show people held in quarantine in a makeshift facility in Wuhan, has been shared across social media He also told reporters that the outbreak had caused a global shortage of protective medical equipment such as gowns, masks and gloves. ""When supply is short, and demand is high then there could be bad practices like hoarding in order to sell them at higher prices,"" he warned, urging suppliers to ""uphold the protection of humanity"" rather than looking to increase profits. The WHO also released new data from 17,000 patients that suggested 82% had a mild form of the disease, with 15% considered severe cases and 3% critical. This is the clearest detail we have had on the spectrum of disease this coronavirus can cause. It is good news for most people and emphasises that for more than four-in-five, this is a mild infection. However, that sheer volume of mild cases raises important questions about stopping this epidemic. The Sars outbreak was relatively easy to stop because patients were often severely ill and easily identified. Mild cases - which could be mistaken for any other winter bug - are naturally harder to spot. What we do not know is how easily people with mild symptoms can spread the new coronavirus. If mild cases are capable of sustaining this epidemic, then it will be much harder to contain. It is also worth remembering we still do not know the true number of cases, with some analysts saying there could be 10 times more than official figures suggest. There has been widespread anger and grief across China over the death of Li Wenliang, a doctor who tried to warn about the new coronavirus. He contracted the virus while treating patients in Wuhan, in Hubei province. A vigil for Li Wenliang, who died on Friday morning, was held in Hong Kong In December, he sent a message to fellow medics warning of a virus he thought looked like Sars - another deadly coronavirus. But he was told by police to ""stop making false comments"" and was investigated for ""spreading rumours"". China's anti-corruption body said it would open an investigation into ""issues involving Dr Li"". Analysts say it is hard to recall an event in recent years that has triggered as much online grief, rage and mistrust against the Chinese government. News of Dr Li's death became the top trending topic on Chinese social media, garnering an estimated 1.5 billion views. China's leadership had already faced accusations of downplaying the severity of the virus - and initially trying to keep it secret. The government has admitted ""shortcomings and deficiencies"" in its response to the virus. This video can not be played Passenger David Abel: ""In addition to the face masks, we've now been given gloves"" Chinese President Xi Jinping has told his US counterpart Donald Trump that China was ""fully confident and capable of defeating the epidemic"". The country has introduced more restrictive measures to try to control the outbreak: The capital, Beijing, has banned group dining for events such as birthdays. Cities including Hangzhou and Nanchang are limiting how many family members can leave home each day Hubei province has switched off lifts in high-rise buildings to discourage residents from going outside.

"Thailand is the only country in South East Asia to have escaped colonial rule. Buddhist religion, the monarchy and the military have helped to shape its society and politics. The military has ruled for most of the period since 1947, with a few interludes in which the country had a democratically elected government. Since 2001, Thai politics have been dominated by the deep split between supporters and detractors of Thaksin Shinawatra, who served as prime minister until he was ousted by the military in 2006. In 2023, Thailand's opposition parties secured by far the largest number of votes in national elections, as voters delivered a significant rebuke to the military-backed government that had ruled since the 2014 coup. Read morecountry profiles,external- Profiles byBBC Monitoring,external Capital:Bangkok Area:513,120 sq km Population:65.9 million Language:Thai Life expectancy:75 years (men) 83 years (women) Head of state: King Maha Vajiralongkorn Thailand is a constitutional monarchy. Maha Vajiralongkorn, the 10th Thai monarch of the Chakri dynasty, was proclaimed king in December 2016. He succeeded his father King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest reigning monarch at the time, who died in October that year. Prime minister: Paetongtarn Shinawatra Thailand's parliament picked Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the daughter of billionaire tycoon and former leader Thaksin, as prime minister in August 2024. At 37, she is the country's youngest PM and the second woman in the post, after her aunt Yingluck. Her selection came just two days after former PM Srettha Thavisin was dismissed by a constitutional court. Both are from the Pheu Thai Party, which came second at the 2023 election but formed a ruling coalition. Ms Paetongtarn faces the difficult task of reviving Thailand's stalled economy and avoiding the military coups and court interventions which have deposed four previous administrations led by her party. ""I really hope that I can make people feel confident that we can build opportunities and to improve the qualify of life and to empower all Thais,"" Ms Paetongtarn told reporters after the vote. Ms Paetongtarn is the fourth member of the Shinawatra clan to become prime minister in the past two decades. The other three, including her father Thaksin and aunt Yingluck, were deposed by military coups or constitutional court rulings. Under Thailand's constitution drafted under military rule, both houses of parliament must vote to select a new prime minister. Thailand's military has a seized power 12 times since the end of the absolute monarchy in 1932. The government and military control nearly all the national terrestrial television networks, and operate many of Thailand's radio networks. The media are free to criticise government policies, and cover instances of corruption and human rights abuses. However, a strict lese majeste law prohibits media in Thailand from reporting anything that could be deemed critical of the royal family, and journalists tend to exercise self-censorship regarding the military, the judiciary and other sensitive issues.

"Former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith wants the UK to rethink its decision Senior Conservatives have written to Tory MPs to raise concerns about the government's decision to allow Huawei to play a role in the UK's 5G network. In a letter, the group - which includes four ex-cabinet ministers - said there were alternatives to the Chinese firm. They want ""high-risk"" vendors to be ruled out now, or phased out over time. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the decision followed a ""rigorous"" review by security experts and that Huawei's involvement would be restricted. What is Huawei and how could it be a security threat? Where is Huawei 5G being blocked? The letter comes as US vice-president Mike Pence said the US was ""profoundly disappointed"" with the UK's decision. The letter from Sir Iain Duncan Smith, Owen Paterson, David Davis, Damian Green, Tobias Ellwood and Bob Seely, which has been seen by the BBC, says some MPs were ""working to find a better solution"". ""We are seeking to identify a means by which we ensure that only trusted vendors are allowed as primary contractors into our critical national infrastructure,"" it says. ""Trusted vendors would be companies from countries that have fair market competition, rule of law, respect human rights, data privacy and non-coercive government agencies."" The men say they want the government to ""rule out hi-tech from untrusted, high-risk vendors"" in the UK's infrastructure, or to ensure future legislation includes ""sunset clauses"" to limit the length of time such companies can be used. The UK government has saidrestrictions would be in place on Huawei's rolein the 5G network. These include: banning Huawei from supplying kit to ""sensitive parts"" of the network, only allowing it to account for 35% of the kit in a network's periphery, and excluding the firm's equipment from areas near military bases and nuclear sites. But Sir Iain told the BBC giving Huawei any stake at all was too much of a risk. He said: ""You have an organisation from a country that is an aggressor in terms of cyber warfare and a company that is clearly totally and utterly in the hands of the Chinese government who demand absolute obedience on these matters."" He added it is ""simply not manageable to have an organisation like that inside your important network"" and Huawei's involvement should therefore be ""zero"". Sir Iain and the other men behind the letter have also cited examples of other countries which they said had already rejected using Huawei in their 5G networks at all, including Australia, the US and Japan. This video can not be played How will the Huawei 5G deal affect me? Mr Pence told CNBC that the US did not believe that using Huawei's technology was ""consistent with the security or privacy interests of the UK, of the United States and it remains a real issue between our two countries"". He said he had told Prime Minister Boris Johnson in September that they were willing to begin to negotiate a free trade arrangement after Brexit but, when asked if the Huawei decision could be a problem, he replied: ""We'll see. We'll see if it is."" He added: ""We're anxious to build our economic ties, but we have made it clear to Prime Minister Johnson and to officials in the UK, that as we expand opportunities to build out 5G across this country... we want to see our companies meet the needs in the United States and UK and among all our allies without the compromise of privacy and the compromise of security that necessarily comes with Huawei and control by the Chinese Communist Party."" And speaking at an event in London last week, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeosaid his country considered that using the Huawei's technology was ""very difficult to mitigate"". Huawei has always denied that it would help the Chinese government attack one of its clients. The firm's founder has said he would ""shut the company down"" rather than aid ""any spying activities"". By BBC Political Correspondent Matt Cole These are not the first MPs to raise worries about Huawei's involvement in the 5G network. And the arguments they make were well-aired before the government decided to give the Chinese company up to a 35% share of the infrastructure project. But the fact the six politicians - including four former cabinet ministers and the chair of the Commons defence committee - are continuing to battle against the plan, underscores that this remains a live issue. So does the comment from the US vice president, Mike Pence, who told a US broadcaster he is ""profoundly"" disappointed with the decision to proceed with Huawei. His ""we'll see"" answer to questioning on whether a UK-US trade deal will be jeopardised will also not go unnoticed by British officials. But Downing Street doesn't wish to respond to the letter, save only to remind that Boris Johnson said on Wednesday he does want to reduce Huawei's involvement. He didn't say by how much - and the government looks somewhat hamstrung by what it says is a lack of other companies able to step in to the breach.

"You don't get many movies like Parasite, nowadays. In a celluloid landscape dominated by comic-book blockbusters, re-booted franchises, and opulent Netflix Originals, small-scale domestic social satires about class and inequality are a rarity. That's because the modern movie mogul thinks films like Parasite don't belong on the silver screen. They're better suited to the home cinema and one of those massive, incongruous TVs that make it look as if someone's parked the family SUV in the front room. Meanwhile, the modern television mogul thinks films like Parasite should be stretched out beyond two hours into an Emmy-winning 10-season box set. And so, in the end, movies like Parasite don't get made at all. And that's why they are a rarity. It's also why critics take to films like Parasite with all the fervour of my wife knocking back a double gin after Dry January. Dulled senses tingle once more, an idling brain sparks; you succumb to the old-fashioned power of story-telling. The Kim family is struggling when we first meet them, before they start to put their ""plan"" in place There are no car chases in Parasite, nor are there any CGI intergalactic battles. Instead, director Bong Joon Ho transports you into the seemingly mundane lives of two Korean families who, through happenstance, become ever more entwined. The Park's luxury home is in stark contrast to the Kim family's basic dwelling needing fumigation In the unwritten rules of social engagement, as decreed by the pitiless market economics of capitalism, they should never cross paths. One family lives in poverty in a squalid subterranean flat at the wrong end of the wrong end of town. The other lot enjoy the life of Riley in their architect-designed modernist mansion, the sort of glass and concrete statement property that attracts new money like an auction of really bad contemporary art. Kim Ki-taek (Song Kang Ho) is the patriarch of the have-not household. He can look back on a 20-year business career notable for its remarkable consistency: whatever he runs always goes bust. Ki-woo finds himself ""tutoring"" the Park's daughter Da-hye under the watchful eye of the housekeeper Moon-gwang His wife, Chung-sook (Chang Hyae Jin), is a former hammer-throwing track and field national medallist, who can still crush you with a look, but is otherwise unemployed like her husband. As is their arty daughter Ki-jung (Park So Dam) and her geeky younger brother Ki-woo (Choi Woo Shik). Both kids flunked their university entrance exams. This is a family who really didn't expect much from life, but even that turned out to be a pipe dream. To make matters worse, a local drunk has identified their basement window as his go-to alfresco urinal. Meanwhile, over on easy street, the freshly minted, slightly younger Park family are having a lovely time. Mr Park (Lee Sun Kyun) is as good at business as Ki-Taek is bad. Ki-jung prepares for her role as ""art tutor"" to the Park's son His IT firm hasn't gone bust, it's gone global! The money is coming in faster than a Bondi Beach surfer pursued by a shark. His beautiful wife (Cho Yeo Jeong) flits in and out of their beautiful house while their two beautiful kids are looked after by a loyal housekeeper (Lee Jung Eun) in a beautifully ironed uniform. And there you have it, a picture of polarisation, where two families of the same size, living in the same city, are worlds apart. Until, that is, a friend of Ki-Woo's pops over to his dingy dwelling and suggests he take over his holiday job tutoring the Park's spoilt teenage daughter. Ki-Woo thinks it highly unlikely he'd get the gig. But then, he hadn't taken into account Mrs Park's naivety, his mother's eye for the main chance, and the possibility of repurposing his sister's artistic talents as a manufacturer of fake degree certificates. The wealthy Park couple (Sun-kyun Lee and Yeo-jeong Jo), who don't like their staff ""crossing the line"" Before he knows it, Ki-woo is upstairs in the eerily spotless big house going beyond his strict academic brief with the stroppy daughter Da-hye (Jung Ziso), while his crafty sister, who has also inveigled her way into this nouveau-rich sanctum, teaches art to the Park's hyper-active son in the kitchen. I will say no more about the plot, other than it thickens in ways you can't imagine but are always believable. It is no surprise that director Bong Joon Ho has been lauded and awarded for Parasite. His script draws you into this darkest of comedies so completely you start to smell Ki-Taek's stale onion-scented sweat. This is not your average social drama film. It goes further than the likes of Revolutionary Road or Shoplifters, moving into the realms of a thriller, and at times, touching on the sensibilities of a zombie flick. It's weird and potent and well directed. The camera is frequently allowed to linger to the point of awkwardness, challenging the characters to maintain their composure as the tangled web of deceit starts to fray at the seams. Ki-jung (So-dam Park) and Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi) try to get internet connection from someone else's wifi It is a distinctly Korean film, but the themes and characters are universal and timeless. Dickens knew them, as did Shakespeare. And so do you. The movie's title conveys the humiliation endured by the poor forced to live off the wealthy, for whom the word parasite is equally applicable. It is also questioning the political, economic and commercial philosophies upon which we build our lives. For the most part, the film does this with incisiveness and intelligence. Bong Joon Ho does not judge his characters, there is no pity or resentment - this isn't a Korean Downton Abbey, playing on established rules of a class system. It is a reflection on how people act and react, are seen and not seen, depending on their financial status. It asks us what we would do if desperate. You'd probably leach off someone else's internet connection. But would you fumigate your kitchen by opening the basement window when a lorry passed by spraying insect-killer? Probably not, but then you might not share Ki-Taek's enterprising spirit. Parasite is a beautifully shot, sympathetically told, intimate social drama, which is paced to perfection until the end when what was a subtle, nuanced work of art lurches into the melodramatic, like a bloke who has been told he smells of old radishes once too often. Maybe that is because Bong Joon Ho refuses to play by the rules, and the clashing of genres is an echo of his two families brought together from opposite ends of the social spectrum, each accentuating the reality of the other.

"Jonathan Ashworth: 'I was correct - that was the irony of the phone call' Labour's ""devastating"" general election defeat could spell the end of the party, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has warned. The Labour MP told a BBC Radio 4 documentary the party had to change or face up to 15 years out of power. ""Unless we do something quick this could be the end of the Labour Party in this country"", he said. Senior Labour and Tory figures give frank assessments of the 2019 campaign in the programme to be aired on Sunday. Labour went down to its worst defeat, in terms of seats, since 1935, although its vote share was slightly higher than when it lost in 2010 and 2015. Johnson returns to power with big majority Labour facing long haul, warns McDonnell Mr Ashworthhad to apologise to his partytwo days before the election, after saying he did not believe it could win, blaming ""the combination of Corbyn and Brexit"". He said he was ""set up"" by a Tory friend, who secretly recorded his comments and released them to the media. ""I obviously regret that and I still think about it all time,"" he told The Inside Story of Election 19 documentary. But he added: ""I was correct - that was the irony of the phone call."" The Leicester South MP is critical of Labour's decision to focus on claims the Conservatives were plotting to put the NHS on the table in trade talks with America. ""It was a legitimate point to make, but I think, politically, voters didn't buy it,"" he said, because it did not directly affect their lives. Michael Gove: 'Boris would have done brilliantly' He also claims there was a lack of communication and planning at the heart of Labour's campaign. He said he was told about the party'sfree broadband pledgeby a BBC Newsnight producer while he was waiting to go on air to talk about Labour's NHS policies. ""I knew nothing about it,"" he said, adding that it ""was a week when we were trying to focus on the NHS and we were suddenly going off in another direction"". He added that he did not think Labour should assume it would automatically return to power - and it needed to change. ""We could be out for another five to 10, 15 years,"" he said. Layla Moran: Brexit policy 'made us look stupid' Jeremy Corbyn's former director of communications, James Schneider, also highlights a lack of trust between the key players in the campaign. ""John (McDonnell) and his shadow Treasury team did guard quite closely their big announcements,"" he told presenter Anne McElvoy. ""Over the course of 2019, and the disagreements on Brexit, the levels of trust within the operation had reduced very much and there was some operational scratchiness."" He said Labour's campaign slogan ""it's time for real change"" never ""took off"", adding ""we never filled it in with content or with other meaning"", giving the impression that the party was ""throwing things at the wall"". The Conservatives honed their social media messages during the campaign before unleashing a barrage of ""negative, nasty messages about Jeremy"" in the final days, says Mr Schneider. Les Miserables: Raising morale at Tory HQ Isaac Levido, the Australian strategist who ran the Conservative campaign, said he had no regrets about any of the party's messages. He describes a much-criticised social media video, edited to show Sir Keir Starmer apparently unable to answer a question on Labour's Brexit position, as ""a little bit of fun"". ""From time to time you need to do things that cut through,"" he added. He also revealed that he had tried to maintain morale at Tory HQ by playing music, including One Day More, from the musical Les Miserables, on the eve of polling day. ""I think there was a bit of a sing-a-long. People were quite delirious by that point,"" he added. Cabinet Minister Michael Gove is asked if it was a mistake for Boris Johnson not to be interviewed by the BBC's Andrew Neil. ""No, because we won,"" he replied. ""I'm sure Boris would have done brilliantly, but with the best will in the world and I am huge fan of Andrew Neil, the purpose of running an election campaign is to win so that you can govern the country well, not to agree to every broadcast bid."" Lib Dem leadership contender Layla Moran said her party failed to properly explain its policy of cancelling Brexit if it won the election. ""It made us look arrogant, and it made us look stupid,"" she says. The Inside Story of Election 19is on BBC Radio 4 at 1330 GMT, presented by Anne McElvoy and produced by Peter Snowdon.

"Former Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said current devolution rules were ""weak"" English votes for English laws makes Welsh MPs feel like ""second-class"" politicians, a former Welsh Secretary has said. Stephen Crabb said excluding MPs from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland from certain votes had not ""done anything"" to strengthen the UK. Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party protested after they were blocked from voting on an ""English-only"" NHS bill. Mr Crabb said the rule was ""bizarre"". The English votes for English laws convention wasintroduced in Parliament following the Scottish independence referendum in 2014. It means politicians from devolved nations, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, are not allowed to vote on proposed legislation thought to apply only to constituencies in England. On Tuesday, Plaid Cymru MPs and SNP MEPs wereaccused of a parliamentary ""stunt""after they were blocked from voting on an ""English-only"" bill about the NHS. Plaid and SNP politicians staged a protest inside the House of Commons after not being allowed to vote They protested as they argued that due to funding formulas, any decision on the health service in England would ultimately have financial implications for the devolved nations. While health is devolved in Wales, any cuts or increases for the English NHS, will lead to more or less money being allocated to the Welsh Government to be spent here under theBarnett Formula. Conservative MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire Mr Crabb said that the whole convention was damaging to the United Kingdom. What are English votes for English laws? Mr Crabb, who was Welsh Secretary until 2016, said it was ""bizarre"", and one of the ""least useful constitutional things that's happened"". ""It makes Welsh, Northern Irish and Scottish MPs feel at times like they are almost second-class MPs,"" he told the BBC's Politics Wales programme. ""It hasn't really strengthened the glue that holds the United Kingdom together."" ""It was a constitutional and parliamentary innovation that, in my view, has done very little,"" he added. English votes for English laws was first used in 2016 for the Housing and Planning Bill Following the Scottish independence vote, the Conservative UK government,passed a law in 2017 that changed the powers of the Welsh Assembly. But Mr Crabb said he now thought that devolution arrangements were ""pretty weak, and unsatisfactory"". ""What is the answer? Nobody can quite put their finger on that just yet. So the danger is that we just muddle along, because there isn't a clear solution,"" he added. A YouGov opinion poll for Cardiff University and ITV Wales published earlier in the week suggested relatively similar levels of support for abolishing theWelsh Assembly and independence for Wales,external. Mr Crabb said that it suggested there was ""discontent at the current state of affairs, constitutionally and economically as well"". ""When the numbers go up for full abolition of devolution, it doesn't quite get the political attention, and if I were a decision maker in the Senedd, if I was part of Welsh Government,  I'd be very nervous about those figures because that's a dangerous signal for devolution,"" he added.

"Facebook's social media accounts were temporarily taken over by a group of hackers on Friday afternoon. The hacking group OurMine posted on the Twitter and Instagram accounts for Facebook and Messenger, writing ""even Facebook is hackable"". The accounts have now been restored. OurMine claims its attacks are an attempt to show cyber vulnerabilities. In January it hijacked over a dozen accounts for teams in the US National Football League. The group posted a statement on Facebook's Twitter account. ""Hi, we are OurMine. Well, even Facebook is hackable but at least their security is better then Twitter."" It also hijacked the Facebook and Messenger accounts on Instagram to post a photo of OurMine's logo. Facebook's own website was not hacked. Twitter confirmed that the hacking occurred via a third-party and that accounts were locked once it was alerted to the issue. ""As soon as we were made aware of the issue, we locked the compromised accounts and are working closely with our partners at Facebook to restore them,"" Twitter said in a statement. The attack on Facebook seems to have followed a similar hack on teams in the National Football League. The accounts appear to have been accessed via the third-party platform Khoros. Khoros is a marketing platform that businesses can use to manage their social media communications.  Typically these platforms manage or have access to the passwords and login details of their customers. Khoros did not respond to a BBC request for comment. OurMine is a Dubai-based hacking group that attacked the accounts of corporations and high-profile individuals in the past. In the past, it has temporality infiltrated the social media account of Twitter's founder Jack Dorsey, Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai, and the corporate accounts of Netflix and ESPN The group claims its attacks are designed to show a lack of security. But it also instructs victims to use its services to improve safeguards.

"The group shared this chalet in the French Alpine ski resort of Contamines-Montjoie Five Britons have tested positive for coronavirus in eastern France, the French health minister has confirmed. Four adults and a child were diagnosed with the virus after coming into contact with a British national who recently returned from Singapore. The man returned to the UK on 28 January before being diagnosed with the virus himself on Thursday. Meanwhile, a final UK repatriation flight with over 200 passengers has left Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak. The flight is due to land in the UK in the early hours of Sunday morning, when passengers will be taken to a conference centre in Milton Keynes for a 14-day quarantine. In France, the five Britons with the coronavirus - who were staying in the same ski chalet - are not in a serious condition, French officials said. But the authorities are closing two schools next week, both of which are attended by the child with the virus, a nine-year-old boy who lives in the ski resort of Contamines-Montjoie with his family. There have been almost 35,000 cases of the coronavirus globally, mostly in China. The latest infection is thought to stem from a man who becamethe UK's third confirmed casewhen he tested positive on his return to Brighton. Hong Kong imposes quarantine rules on mainland Chinese Man Utd striker misses training over coronavirus A visual guide to the coronavirus outbreak Coronavirus: Your travel rights explained The Briton had stayed in Singapore on a business trip from 20 to 23 January, the French health ministry said. He arrived at Contamines-Montjoie, in Haute-Savoie, on 24 January for a four-day stay, before returning to England on 28 January. On his return to the UK, he is thought to have isolated himself at his Brighton home and called the NHS 111 number. After a positive test, he was taken to St Thomas' Hospital in London where he is being treated. Public Health England also advised a student at Portslade Aldridge Community Academy in Brighton to self-isolate for 14 days, as part of their investigation into the same case of coronavirus. The school said it had been advised by health authorities that there was no need to close. 20 to 23 January:In Singapore on business 24 to 28 January: Stays in a chalet in Contamines-Montjoie, France 28 January:Returns to the UK 6 February:The Department of Health confirms he is the UK's third case of the virus, after testing positive in Brighton 7 February:A student at Portslade Aldridge Community Academy self-isolates on the advice of Public Health England, as a result of the investigation into this case The Brighton man told UK authorities that he had visited a chalet in Contamines-Montjoie, prompting French officials to take the 11 Britons staying there to hospitals in Lyon, Saint-Etienne and Grenoble on Friday night. The chalet has two apartments where two families were staying. A British couple and their three children, who are now resident in France, lived in one. The mother is in the UK at the moment and has been contacted. Seven of their friends were staying in the other apartment. Those with the virus are the father of the family resident in France and his nine-year-old son, as well as three members of the visiting family. The nine-year-old boy attends the local school and has French classes at another school in St-Gervais. Both schools will be shut next week, and parents are being asked to keep their children under observation. A crisis unit has been set up as a result of the new cases. It comes as four members of the same British family were admitted to hospital in Majorca after contact with a coronavirus carrier. They are being tested at the University Hospital of Son Espases in Palma. The British family said they hadbeen in contact with a person who recently tested positive,externalfor the virus in France, the government in Spain's Balearic Islands said. Meanwhile, a British man transferred from a cruise ship off the coast of Japan on Friday after testing positive for the virus is said to be feeling well and in good spirits. Alan Steele, from Wolverhampton, on his honeymoon with his wife Wendy, was among61 people to be taken off the ship for hospital treatment. She has been in telephone contact with her husband, and said in a Facebook post on Saturday that he was still feeling healthy. The majority of confirmed cases worldwide are in mainland China, where the total stands at 34,598. On Saturday, the death toll rose to 723 in China, including one American in Wuhan. A Japanese man also died in Wuhan with symptoms consistent with the virus. Outside China, 288 cases have been confirmed in 24 countries, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), with one fatality in the Philippines. The five new cases in France brings the total in the country to 11. Elsewhere, Hong Kong has begun amandatory two-week quarantinefor anyone arriving from mainland China after 26 cases were recorded in the territory. On Saturday WHOwarned that ""trolls and conspiracy theories""are undermining their response to the virus. This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor on what we know about the virus The Department of Health and Social Care said that 686 people in the UK have been tested for coronavirus as of Saturday afternoon, with three cases confirmed. The two other UK cases - both Chinese nationals - are being treated at the Royal Victoria Infirmary infectious diseases centre in Newcastle. UK citizens who travelled on two previous repatriation flights from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus, are in quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral. The Foreign & Commonwealth Office isadvising against all but essential travel,externalto mainland China and all travel to Hubei Province. UK nationals have also been advised to leave China where possible. Diary of a life in locked-down Wuhan Coronavirus: Your questions answered However, the government is not advising against travel to any other country or territory as a result of the virus. Some airlines, including British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, have suspended flights to and from China or revised their schedules. The coronavirus causes severe acute respiratory infection and symptoms usually start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. Most people infected are likely to fully recover - just as they would from a flu. Anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last 14 days and is experiencing cough or fever or shortness of breath, is advised to stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild.

"The US decision to ban its companies from using foreign telecoms providers regarded as a security risk is the latest salvo apparently directed against Chinese tech giant Huawei. The US has been at the forefront of an effort to restrict the use of Huawei equipment in 5G mobile networks, citing serious security issues. Huawei is now facing resistance from other governments over the risk that its technology could be used for espionage. So which other countries are blocking Huawei's 5G technology, and which are allowing it to operate? What is 5G? A simple guide to why Huawei is in trouble This is new technology, in its very early stages of implementation, and many countries are still deciding what role - if any - Huawei should play. But Huawei says it has now signed more than 40 commercial 5G contracts around the world, including in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Australiaeffectively banned Huawei and another Chinese telecom firm, ZTE, last year when it applied national security rules to companies supplying equipment to telecoms firms. New Zealandhas blocked Huawei from supplying one mobile network with 5G equipment, but has not yet ruled out all Huawei 5G contracts completely. These two countries, along with the UK and Canada, make up the so-called Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network with the US. The UKis still reviewing its 5G telecoms policy and may allow Huawei to supply ""non-core"" 5G components, such as antenna masts. Huawei role in UK 'an unnecessary risk' The story of a controversial company Canadais still weighing up its decision over Huawei. The United Stateshas effectively blocked all Huawei involvement in its 5G networks. So far, no European country has formally blocked Huawei, and the majority of the company's current global 5G contracts are with companies operating within Europe. The EU in March issued recommendations about 5G security, asking member states to review their networks by the end of June and report their findings to the EU Commission. Despite pressure from the United States,Germanyhas resisted a ban, andFrancehas not indicated it plans to follow a tough line against the Chinese company. The Netherlands'largest telecom firm, KPN, has already made clear that it would not allow Huawei to build its ""core"" 5G infrastructure, but it could supply other equipment considered less sensitive. The Dutch government is expected to make a decision on using Huawei equipment by the end of June. A telecoms firm inRussiasigned a deal with Huawei on 5G technology during a visit to the country in June by the Chinese president. South Korealaunched commercial 5G services last month, and one of its three carriers has used 5G equipment supplied by Huawei. 5G trials are due to be carried out inIndialater this year with Huawei one of the companies invited to take part. However, there are reports that India may limit Huawei's involvement in developing its 5G infrastructure. Malaysiahas already made clear that Huawei can be involved in developing its 5G networks, with the prime minister visiting the company's office in Beijing in April. South Korea now has a nationwide 5G network InIndonesia, the country's telecoms minister said earlier this year that it could not afford to be ""paranoid"" over using Huawei technology. InThailand, Huawei has already launched a 5G test project. Vietnam, which is developing a 5G network, has not officially banned Huawei, although one of the largest largest telecoms carriers is currently using Ericsson technology. Japanhas blocked the use of Huawei equipment for 5G over security fears, although as in other countries, Huawei kit is part of the existing 4G network. The growth of 5G is likely to lead to other opportunities for Huawei around the world. The company says it already has 10 confirmed 5G contracts in the Middle East. The African continent has not been in the forefront of early 5G adoption, but its more advanced economies provide potentially fertile markets. InSouth Africa, for example, Huawei has already announced its involvement in a commercial 5G network in Johannesburg with the mobile data provider, Rain. According to one industry-wide body,there were more than 200 operators in 85 countries investing in 5G networks in some form or another by March this year.,external Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter,external Trump declares emergency over IT threats Huawei willing to sign 'no-spy' agreements Locals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"By Saturday morning very few people were arriving from mainland China to Hong Kong Hong Kong has begun a mandatory two-week quarantine for anyone arriving from mainland China, in a fresh effort to contain the deadly new coronavirus. Visitors must isolate themselves in hotel rooms or government-run centres. Residents must stay inside their homes. Anyone caught flouting the new rules faces a fine and a prison sentence. Meanwhile, 723 deaths have been recorded in China, including one American. A Japanese man also died with symptoms consistent with the virus. A visual guide to the outbreak The Chinese doctor who tried to warn others In pictures: South Korea mass wedding defies virus fears The 60-year-old US citizen, the first confirmed non-Chinese victim of the illness, died on Thursday at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, according to a US embassy spokesman in Beijing, who did not give details. Separately, the Japanese foreign ministry said a man in his 60s died, also in Wuhan, from what was suspected to be a case of coronavirus. However, it said it could not confirm the diagnosis, and that Chinese officials said the cause of death was viral pneumonia. The city is opening its second makeshift hospital since the outbreak began. Leishenshan hospital was built in two weeks and will be able to accommodate 1,500 patients. This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor on what we know about the virus The number of confirmed cases in China stands at 34,598. Outside China, 288 cases have been confirmed in 24 countries, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), with one fatality in the Philippines. On Saturday, France confirmed five new cases in its Haute-Savoie region, including a nine-year-old boy and bringing the total of infected in the country to 11. French Health Minister AgnÃ¨s Buzyn said all of the five new cases were British nationals staying in the same chalet, which had also housed a Briton who had been in Singapore. Their condition is not said to be serious. A further six people who stayed at the chalet are under observation. Two schools - one the nine-year-old boy has been attending, along with another school where he has French classes - have been closed as a precaution. Nurse describes 'heartbreaking' job Diary of a life in locked-down Wuhan In Hong Kong, there have been 26 confirmed cases. Tens of thousands of travellers queued at the Chinese border city of Shenzhen to beat the Friday midnight deadline. But by Saturday morning, only a trickle of people were arriving via the Shenzhen Bay Port crossing. In a press conference, Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam said the territory's government only has 12 million face masks, which she expects to be used up within one month. She appealed for anyone with resources to buy masks to ""donate them to people in need"". Meanwhile, three more people have tested positive for the virus on a quarantined cruise ship in Yokohama harbour, bringing the total number of cases on board to 64. There was some positive news on Friday when the WHO said there had been fewer reported infections in China in the past two days. However, its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, cautioned against reading too much into those figures. This video can not be played Footage appearing to show people held in quarantine in a makeshift facility in Wuhan, has been shared across social media He also told reporters that the outbreak had caused a global shortage of protective medical equipment such as gowns, masks and gloves. ""When supply is short, and demand is high then there could be bad practices like hoarding in order to sell them at higher prices,"" he warned, urging suppliers to ""uphold the protection of humanity"" rather than looking to increase profits. The WHO also released new data from 17,000 patients that suggested 82% had a mild form of the disease, with 15% considered severe cases and 3% critical. This is the clearest detail we have had on the spectrum of disease this coronavirus can cause. It is good news for most people and emphasises that for more than four-in-five, this is a mild infection. However, that sheer volume of mild cases raises important questions about stopping this epidemic. The Sars outbreak was relatively easy to stop because patients were often severely ill and easily identified. Mild cases - which could be mistaken for any other winter bug - are naturally harder to spot. What we do not know is how easily people with mild symptoms can spread the new coronavirus. If mild cases are capable of sustaining this epidemic, then it will be much harder to contain. It is also worth remembering we still do not know the true number of cases, with some analysts saying there could be 10 times more than official figures suggest. There has been widespread anger and grief across China over the death of Li Wenliang, a doctor who tried to warn about the new coronavirus. He contracted the virus while treating patients in Wuhan, in Hubei province. A vigil for Li Wenliang, who died on Friday morning, was held in Hong Kong In December, he sent a message to fellow medics warning of a virus he thought looked like Sars - another deadly coronavirus. But he was told by police to ""stop making false comments"" and was investigated for ""spreading rumours"". China's anti-corruption body said it would open an investigation into ""issues involving Dr Li"". Analysts say it is hard to recall an event in recent years that has triggered as much online grief, rage and mistrust against the Chinese government. News of Dr Li's death became the top trending topic on Chinese social media, garnering an estimated 1.5 billion views. China's leadership had already faced accusations of downplaying the severity of the virus - and initially trying to keep it secret. The government has admitted ""shortcomings and deficiencies"" in its response to the virus. This video can not be played Passenger David Abel: ""In addition to the face masks, we've now been given gloves"" Chinese President Xi Jinping has told his US counterpart Donald Trump that China was ""fully confident and capable of defeating the epidemic"". The country has introduced more restrictive measures to try to control the outbreak: The capital, Beijing, has banned group dining for events such as birthdays. Cities including Hangzhou and Nanchang are limiting how many family members can leave home each day Hubei province has switched off lifts in high-rise buildings to discourage residents from going outside.

"Northern Ireland will not hit ambitious climate change targets unless it acts now to boost sales of electric vehicles, an industry body has warned. In 2019, only 427 Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) were sold here, up just 165 on 2015. This is despite the fact that they will bethe only type of new cars on sale in 15 years. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said the government must quickly spell out its plans. ""Ambitious targets must be matched by ambitious initiatives,"" said its chief executive, Mike Hawes. ""This includes a long-term government commitment to purchase incentives and substantial investment in infrastructure."" However, the BBC can also reveal that despitea commitment made in January 2014to bring the total number of public charge points across Northern Ireland to 500,six years on there are only 337 such points.,external A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said ""funding constraints across the public sector"" were to blame for the missed target, but added that 54 charge points had been installed at hospitals, health trusts, government department offices and local council offices. ""Depending on their location some of these charge points are available to staff and the public, however, they were not designed to form part of the public network,"" added the spokesman. ""Should public funding become available for the installation of additional charge point infrastructure, departmental officials will liaise closely with commercial providers and the Office for Low Emission Vehicles to ensure the charging infrastructure continues to remain fit for purpose."" At the time of the 2014 announcement, then Environment Minister Mark H Durkan said: ""There has never been a better time for drivers to consider switching to these cars of the future."" But one Northern Ireland dealership insisted Stormont is falling far short when it comes to the issue. Caroline Willis, finance director of Shelbourne Motors, said: ""We need the government to push harder to have sufficient charging points to cope with demand. ""Local government needs to add as many charging points and incentivise people to move from diesel to electric, perhaps with a swappage grant."" Asked if the government's 2035 target for BEV-only sales was still realistic, she added: ""It is achievable but needs action now. ""It comes down to cost and infrastructure but mainly the latter, we need the government to push harder to have sufficient charging points to cope with demand."" Mrs Willis pointed to the huge rise in sales of self-charging Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) as proof of changing customer attitudes, adding: ""More charging points could encourage the move to fully electric. Charge point on Adelaide Street in Belfast city centre Last month, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced thatfunding for on-street charge points would be doubled,externalto Â£10m ""to make electric cars the new normal"". The Department of Transport stated that the money could pay for up to 3,600 additional charging points for motorists, who do not have an off-street parking space. However, the Department for Infrastructure could not confirm how much of the funding would be spent in Northern Ireland. ""It is hoped that this will impact positively in relation to the Residential Charge Point Scheme,"" the department said. One of those who made the leap from petrol to battery power is Colm Heaney, a father of two who lives in Belfast's Four Winds. Colm Heaney charges his Nissan Leaf at home ""I bought a used Nissan Leaf in April 2017 and received a grant for installation of a charger at my house,"" he said. ""However, the existing infrastructure isn't great. There have been no public chargers added, at least around where I live, since I've owned the Leaf. ""I had hoped that private companies would pick up the slack, but with a few notable exceptions (CastleCourt and Lidl come to mind), Northern Ireland does really lag behind other places.""

"Facebook's social media accounts were temporarily taken over by a group of hackers on Friday afternoon. The hacking group OurMine posted on the Twitter and Instagram accounts for Facebook and Messenger, writing ""even Facebook is hackable"". The accounts have now been restored. OurMine claims its attacks are an attempt to show cyber vulnerabilities. In January it hijacked over a dozen accounts for teams in the US National Football League. The group posted a statement on Facebook's Twitter account. ""Hi, we are OurMine. Well, even Facebook is hackable but at least their security is better then Twitter."" It also hijacked the Facebook and Messenger accounts on Instagram to post a photo of OurMine's logo. Facebook's own website was not hacked. Twitter confirmed that the hacking occurred via a third-party and that accounts were locked once it was alerted to the issue. ""As soon as we were made aware of the issue, we locked the compromised accounts and are working closely with our partners at Facebook to restore them,"" Twitter said in a statement. The attack on Facebook seems to have followed a similar hack on teams in the National Football League. The accounts appear to have been accessed via the third-party platform Khoros. Khoros is a marketing platform that businesses can use to manage their social media communications.  Typically these platforms manage or have access to the passwords and login details of their customers. Khoros did not respond to a BBC request for comment. OurMine is a Dubai-based hacking group that attacked the accounts of corporations and high-profile individuals in the past. In the past, it has temporality infiltrated the social media account of Twitter's founder Jack Dorsey, Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai, and the corporate accounts of Netflix and ESPN The group claims its attacks are designed to show a lack of security. But it also instructs victims to use its services to improve safeguards.

"One in three board positions at the UK's biggest companies is now held by a woman, a government-backed review has found. The Hampton-Alexander Review latest report found 349 women currently sit on boards at FTSE 100 firms. The government said the review's ""fantastic work"" had seen it hit the target almost a year early. But the review also highlighted a lack of women in senior and executive roles - making up 15% of finance directors. That compared with women making up 66% of human resource directors, the report said. The review's chief executive, Denise Wilson, told the BBC that problems such as unconscious bias and gender stereotypes around what a leader should look like were preventing further progress. ""I think 33% is a very good start, but as we can see, we have a lot further to go before we see a good gender balance in the leadership of British business,"" she said. 'All the good women have been snapped up' UK's top firms fail to increase ethnic diversity - report Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said that businesses had achieved the one in three target voluntarily and without the need for legislation or fines but called on firms to do more. ""The Hampton-Alexander Review has done fantastic work but it's clear that women continue to face barriers to success, whether that's through promotion to key roles or how they are treated by colleagues,"" she added. The Institute of Directors welcomed the report as evidence that focusing the spotlight on diversity could change the behaviour of big companies. However, it cautioned that it was not a case of job done. Women on Boards UK chief executive Fiona Hathorn described progress outside the FTSE 350 - a longer list of leading firms - and in UK business as a whole, as glacial. She called for the lens to move from the board alone to improving representation at the top levels of company management. Francesca Ecsery, a director at an investment firm, says that men often still outnumber women in the boardroom because ""change is painful"". ""There is a huge value attributed to chemistry on the board, and of course chemistry you have, mainly, with people like you,"" she says. And that's not good for diversity, she adds. Ms Ecsery never felt held back in her management consultancy and marketing careers. ""I was always on the revenue side of a business, so provided I delivered, I was able to get ahead."" Later, she decided to seek non-executive director roles - and was astonished how hard they were to get. ""I found it surprisingly challenging. You read in the media that boards need women. I certainly thought that with my executive career and digital career, you know - I had big company and small company experience - but I could not get through."" Ms Ecsery attributes her breakthrough to targeting businesses which had followed good recruitment practices instead of ""tapping people on the shoulder on the golf course"". She now serves on the boards of a range of companies including Air France and FTSE 250-listed F&C Investment Trust. Trade union body the TUC has also called for further changes to the workplace to help boost female representation in top roles. ""Men are still seven times more likely to be finance directors than women,"" said TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady. ""The government won't be able to achieve gender equality unless it makes work more family-friendly, and unless it tackles sexist aggression towards women."" Since 2011, two government-backed reviews have focused on boosting women's representation on the boards of UK-listed companies. The Davies Review, which ran from 2011 to 2015, aimed to increase the proportion of women serving on FTSE 100 boards from 12% to 25%. The rise in the FTSE 250 was from 9% to 22%, still lagging the 33% target. Its successor, the Hampton-Alexander Review, encourages FTSE 350 companies to meet a 33% target by the end of 2020. Unlike countries including France which have introduced quotas, it is voluntary.

"Jonathan Ashworth: 'I was correct - that was the irony of the phone call' Labour's ""devastating"" general election defeat could spell the end of the party, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has warned. The Labour MP told a BBC Radio 4 documentary the party had to change or face up to 15 years out of power. ""Unless we do something quick this could be the end of the Labour Party in this country"", he said. Senior Labour and Tory figures give frank assessments of the 2019 campaign in the programme to be aired on Sunday. Labour went down to its worst defeat, in terms of seats, since 1935, although its vote share was slightly higher than when it lost in 2010 and 2015. Johnson returns to power with big majority Labour facing long haul, warns McDonnell Mr Ashworthhad to apologise to his partytwo days before the election, after saying he did not believe it could win, blaming ""the combination of Corbyn and Brexit"". He said he was ""set up"" by a Tory friend, who secretly recorded his comments and released them to the media. ""I obviously regret that and I still think about it all time,"" he told The Inside Story of Election 19 documentary. But he added: ""I was correct - that was the irony of the phone call."" The Leicester South MP is critical of Labour's decision to focus on claims the Conservatives were plotting to put the NHS on the table in trade talks with America. ""It was a legitimate point to make, but I think, politically, voters didn't buy it,"" he said, because it did not directly affect their lives. Michael Gove: 'Boris would have done brilliantly' He also claims there was a lack of communication and planning at the heart of Labour's campaign. He said he was told about the party'sfree broadband pledgeby a BBC Newsnight producer while he was waiting to go on air to talk about Labour's NHS policies. ""I knew nothing about it,"" he said, adding that it ""was a week when we were trying to focus on the NHS and we were suddenly going off in another direction"". He added that he did not think Labour should assume it would automatically return to power - and it needed to change. ""We could be out for another five to 10, 15 years,"" he said. Layla Moran: Brexit policy 'made us look stupid' Jeremy Corbyn's former director of communications, James Schneider, also highlights a lack of trust between the key players in the campaign. ""John (McDonnell) and his shadow Treasury team did guard quite closely their big announcements,"" he told presenter Anne McElvoy. ""Over the course of 2019, and the disagreements on Brexit, the levels of trust within the operation had reduced very much and there was some operational scratchiness."" He said Labour's campaign slogan ""it's time for real change"" never ""took off"", adding ""we never filled it in with content or with other meaning"", giving the impression that the party was ""throwing things at the wall"". The Conservatives honed their social media messages during the campaign before unleashing a barrage of ""negative, nasty messages about Jeremy"" in the final days, says Mr Schneider. Les Miserables: Raising morale at Tory HQ Isaac Levido, the Australian strategist who ran the Conservative campaign, said he had no regrets about any of the party's messages. He describes a much-criticised social media video, edited to show Sir Keir Starmer apparently unable to answer a question on Labour's Brexit position, as ""a little bit of fun"". ""From time to time you need to do things that cut through,"" he added. He also revealed that he had tried to maintain morale at Tory HQ by playing music, including One Day More, from the musical Les Miserables, on the eve of polling day. ""I think there was a bit of a sing-a-long. People were quite delirious by that point,"" he added. Cabinet Minister Michael Gove is asked if it was a mistake for Boris Johnson not to be interviewed by the BBC's Andrew Neil. ""No, because we won,"" he replied. ""I'm sure Boris would have done brilliantly, but with the best will in the world and I am huge fan of Andrew Neil, the purpose of running an election campaign is to win so that you can govern the country well, not to agree to every broadcast bid."" Lib Dem leadership contender Layla Moran said her party failed to properly explain its policy of cancelling Brexit if it won the election. ""It made us look arrogant, and it made us look stupid,"" she says. The Inside Story of Election 19is on BBC Radio 4 at 1330 GMT, presented by Anne McElvoy and produced by Peter Snowdon.

"Dr Li posted this picture of himself from a hospital bed on 31 January - a day before he was diagnosed with coronavirus Dr Li Wenliang, who was hailed a hero for raising the alarm about the coronavirus in the early days of the outbreak, has died of the infection. His death was confirmed by the Wuhan hospital where he worked and was being treated,following conflicting reports about his condition on state media. Dr Li, 34, tried to send a message to fellow medics about the outbreak at the end of December. Three days later police paid him a visit and told him to stop.  He returned to work and caught the virus from a patient. He had been in hospital for at least three weeks. He posted his story from his hospital bed last month on social media site Weibo. ""Hello everyone, this is Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital,"" the post begins. It was a stunning insight into the botched response by local authorities in Wuhan in the early weeks of the coronavirus outbreak. Dr Li was working at the centre of the outbreak in December when he noticed seven cases of a virus that he thought looked like Sars - the virus that led to a global epidemic in 2003. The cases were thought to come from the Huanan Seafood market in Wuhan and the patients were in quarantine in his hospital. US bars foreigners who recently visited China Coronavirus: How worried should we be? Coronavirus: A visual guide to the outbreak On 30 December he sent a message to fellow doctors in a chat group warning them about the outbreak and advising they wear protective clothing to avoid infection. What Dr Li didn't know then was that the disease that had been discovered was an entirely new coronavirus. After falling sick, Dr Li said on Weibo that he wondered why authorities were still saying no medical staff had been infected Four days later he was summoned to the Public Security Bureau where he was told to sign a letter. In the letter he was accused of ""making false comments"" that had ""severely disturbed the social order"". ""We solemnly warn you: If you keep being stubborn, with such impertinence, and continue this illegal activity, you will be brought to justice - is that understood?"" Underneath in Dr Li's handwriting is written: ""Yes, I do."" He was one of eight people who police said were being investigated for ""spreading rumours"". At the end of January, Dr Li published a copy of the letter on Weibo and explained what had happened. In the meantime, local authorities had apologised to him but that apology came too late. For the first few weeks of January officials in Wuhan were insisting that only those who came into contact with infected animals could catch the virus. No guidance was issued to protect doctors. But just a week after his visit from the police, Dr Li was treating a woman with glaucoma. He didn't know that she had been infected with the new coronavirus. ""We hope you can calm down and reflect on your behaviour,"" the letter police told him to sign says In his Weibo post he describes how on 10 January he started coughing, the next day he had a fever and two days later he was in hospital. His parents also fell ill and were taken to hospital. It was 10 days later - on 20 January - that China declared the outbreak an emergency. Dr Li says he was tested several times for coronavirus, all of them came back negative. Dr Li Wenliang was accused of spreading rumours On 30 January he posted again: ""Today nucleic acid testing came back with a positive result, the dust has settled, finally diagnosed."" He punctuated the short post with an emoji of a dog with its eyes rolled back, tongue hanging out. Not surprisingly the post received thousands of comments and words of support. ""Dr Li Wenliang is a hero,"" one user said, worrying about what his story says about their country. ""In the future, doctors will be more afraid to issue early warnings when they find signs of infectious diseases."" ""A safer public health environmentâ¦ requires tens of millions of Li Wenliang.""

"Health worker Yao (not pictured) said hospital staff are not allowed to eat, rest or use the toilet during their 10-hour shifts More than 600 people have been killed by a new strain of coronavirus since its outbreak began in China at the end of last year. But while infection numbers rise, information about conditions on the ground in China is limited. Initially, news organisations in the country were able to report on the epidemic in detail. In recent days, however, internet platforms have taken down several articles criticising the government's efforts to curb the virus. Officials have also sought to crack down on the warnings shared by a doctor when the coronavirus began to spread. In a rare occurrence, the BBC spoke with a health worker in Hubei, the province at the outbreak's epicentre. To protect her identity, she asked to be referred by her family name, Yao. Five need-to-know things about coronavirus A visual guide to the outbreak Diary of a life in locked-down Wuhan Yao is based at a hospital in Hubei's second-largest city, Xiangyang.  She works in what she describes as a ""fever clinic,"" where she analyses blood samples taken to diagnose anyone suspected of having coronavirus. Before the outbreak, Yao had planned to travel to Guangzhou to spend Chinese New Year with her family. Her child and mother travelled ahead of her, but when the epidemic broke out, Yao decided to volunteer in Xiangyang instead. ""It's true that we all live one life, but there was just this strong voice inside me saying 'you must go,'"" she told the BBC. At first she had to overcome her doubts about the decision. ""I told myself: be prepared and protect yourself well,"" Yao said. ""Even if there was no protective suit, I could always wear a raincoat. If there was no mask, I could ask friends all over China to send one to me. There is always a way."" Yao says she found that the hospital is better supplied than she expected. The government has delivered resources and private companies have donated equipment to help. There is still a shortage of protective masks and suits, however, and not every member of staff is properly protected. ""It's a difficult job, it's very sad and heart-breaking, and most of the time we just don't have time to think about our own safety,"" said Yao. ""We also have to treat the patients with tender care, because many people came to us with great fear, some of them were on the verge of a nervous breakdown"". To deal with the high number of incoming patients, staff at the hospital work in 10-hour shifts. Yao said that during these shifts no-one can eat, drink, take a break, or use the toilets. ""At the end of the shift, when we take off the suits, we'll find our clothes are completely wet with sweat,"" said Yao. ""Our forehead, nose, neck and face are left with deep marks by the tight masks and sometimes even cuts. ""Many of my colleagues just sleep on chairs after the shifts, because they're too tired to walk,"" she added. This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor on what we know about the virus But despite the hardship, Yao says none of the hospital's medical staff have been infected. She and her colleagues have also been boosted by warm messages from members of the public. Some people have even sent food and other daily necessities. ""I feel that even though they are quarantined at home, the virus brings our hearts together,"" said Yao. In all, she said China's government's response to the coronavirus outbreak has been ""fairly quick,"" and no other country could have given a better response. ""In the West, you talk more about freedom or human rights, but right now in China, we're talking about the matter of life or death,"" said Yao. ""We're talking about whether you might see the sunrise tomorrow. So all people can do is to cooperate with the government and support the medical staff"".

"Department store chain Beales is to close 12 of its shops in a bid to sell the rest. Efforts to sell all 23 outlets together have failed, the administrators KPMG said. The dozen being closed will trade for a few weeks to sell remaining stock, and staff will keep their jobs until then. The department store began trading in 1881 in Bournemouth, which is one of the stores that will close, the administrators confirmed. Beales had tried to secure rent reductions with landlords and was in negotiations with potential investors and buyers. ""There is currently no intention to implement closure plans for the remaining 11 stores, which will all continue to operate as usual until an outcome with regards to a sale of the business is clarified,"" said KPMG.

"This video can not be played Phillip Schofield on ITV's This Morning: ""Every person I tell, it gets a little lighter"" TV presenter Phillip Schofield has received an outpouring of support after revealing he is gay. The 57-year-old, who has two daughters with wife Stephanie Lowe, made the announcement via a statement on Instagram. ""Huge respect and admiration for our friend Schofe,""tweeted fellow ITV presenters Ant and Dec.,external""Sending love to you P, and your 3 lovely girls â¤ï¸."" Dermot O'Leary,external,David Walliams,externalandJames Corden,externalalso applauded him. ""Takes a lot of guts to do this, not least when you're a very public figure and know it will all be dissected in a very public way,""said Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan.,external""Sending my very best to Schofe and his family."" Schofield, who has been married to Lowe for 27 years, said in his statement: ""Today, quite rightly, being gay is a reason to celebrate and be proud. ""Yes, I am feeling pain and confusion, but that comes only from the hurt that I am causing to my family."" He later thanked fans for their support and urged others to reach out for help in a post on Instagram. ""Please please, no matter your age or your thoughts, TALK to someone, don't let your head beat you and hopefully you'll find out that your friends & family have a remarkable ability to surprise you with their love and understanding,"" he wrote. Schofield presents Dancing on Ice and This Morning with Willoughby Schofield presents ITV programmes including Dancing On Ice and This Morning, which won a National Television Award last week. The presenter was interviewed by his co-host Holly Willoughby on Friday's edition of This Morning. ""You know this has been bothering me for a very long time,"" he said. ""Everybody does this at their own speed when the time is right."" The presenter added his sexuality has recently ""become an issue in my head"". 'I came out at 68' What it's like when your parents comes out as LGBT ""All you can be in your life is honest with yourself and I was getting to the point where I knew I wasn't honest with myself. I was getting to the point where I didn't like myself very much because I wasn't being honest with myself. ""[Coming out] is my decision. This is absolutely my decision. It was something I knew that I had to do. I don't know what the world will be like now. I don't know how this will be taken or what people will think."" But Schofield said he is not ready yet for a relationship with a man. ""You never know what's going on in someone's seemingly perfect life, what issues they are struggling with, or the state of their wellbeing - and so you won't know what has been consuming me for the last few years. With the strength and support of my wife and my daughters, I have been coming to terms with the fact that I am gay. ""This is something that has caused many heart-breaking conversations at home. I have been married to Steph for nearly 27 years, and we have two beautiful grown-up daughters, Molly and Ruby. My family have held me so close - they have tried to cheer me up, to smother me with kindness and love, despite their own confusion. Yet still I can't sleep and there have been some very dark moments. ""My inner conflict contrasts with an outside world that has changed so very much for the better. Today, quite rightly, being gay is a reason to celebrate and be proud. Yes, I am feeling pain and confusion, but that comes only from the hurt that I am causing to my family. Phillip Schofield and wife Stephanie Lowe, pictured in November ""Steph has been incredible - I love her so very much. She is the kindest soul I have ever met. My girls have been astonishing in their love, hugs and encouraging words of comfort. Both my and Steph's entire families have stunned me with their love, instant acceptance and support. ""Of course they are worried about Steph, but I know they will scoop us both up. My friends are the best, especially Holly, who has been so kind and wise - and who has hugged me as I sobbed on her shoulder. At ITV, I couldn't hope to work with more wonderful, supportive teams. How the nation fell in love with This Morning ""Every day on This Morning, I sit in awe of those we meet who have been brave and open in confronting their truth - so now it's my turn to share mine. This will probably all come as something of a surprise and I understand, but only by facing this, by being honest, can I hope to find peace in my mind and a way forward. ""Please be kind, especially to my family."" Social media was filled with support for Schofield after his announcement on Friday morning. The BBC'sVictoria Derbyshire added:,external""So much love for Schofe for his open, honest, dignified statement."" Dancing on Ice star Ian H Watkins, who recently made history by dancing with his same-sex partner on the show,welcomed Schofield,externalto ""our beautiful rainbow family!"" Richard Osman of BBC One's Pointless said,external: ""When you create a new entertainment show and start discussing who should host, the first name on the list is always Phillip Schofield. That's a fact. ""He's just the very best at what he does, and the public adore him. Looking forward to many more years of his charm and brilliance."" Schofield found fame on children's TV in the 1980s alongside Gordon the Gopher in the BBC's Broom Cupboard, and on Saturday morning show Going Live! He has starred in the West End in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and Doctor Dolittle, and fronted TV game shows like Talking Telephone Numbers and Schofield's Quest before joining This Morning in 2002. The programme has won at the National Television Awards for 10 years in a row, including the prize for best live magazine show at last month's ceremony. Sarah Greene and Phillip Schofield presenting Going Live! in 1987 Schofield also presents a programme with his wife every December where they review Christmas gifts. Entertainment reporter Caroline Frost told BBC Radio 5 Live that stars from the previous generation were likely to have been told in the past that coming out as gay could damage their careers. ""You see all these young stars coming through and they don't have to think about it,"" she said. ""They're fluid. They just define their own terms. ""But a lot of those older entertainers are having to play catch-up. They branded themselves and were probably advised 'Don't come out because it will ruin your following'. ""So they are having to catch-up and climb back up the hill of enjoying the same privileges that have come very naturally to that new generation."" Analysis by Ben Hunte, LGBT correspondent ""Coming out"" is a moment which unites all LGBT people, whether they are eventually able to do it, or not. Some never will. Social media reactions show that this is being seen as an incredibly brave decision for Philip Schofield to make. Whilst Schofield is seen as a national treasure, and someone trusted with hearing deep and personal experiences on a daily basis, for him to become the story is wholly different. When someone with such a massive public platform comes out as LGBT, their entire life in the public eye is suddenly questioned, with some on-lookers inevitably claiming they ""knew all along"". In many cases, the person coming out may not have even known, let alone their family and friends. LGBT acceptance in the UK has changed dramatically over the past few decades. Whilst there are still issues, on the whole, people are much more free to be themselves than ever before. As a result, national LGBT charities such as the LGBT Foundation now offer tailored 'coming out' guidance to the growing numbers of LGBT people who are choosing to come out later in life, helping them navigate any barriers they may face. This huge moment for Phillip Schofield may just be the green light that others need to come out themselves.

"Apple has been fined 25 million euros (Â£21m, $27m) for deliberately slowing down older iPhone models without making it clear to consumers. The fine was imposed by France's competition and fraud watchdog DGCCRF, which said consumers were not warned. In 2017, Apple confirmed that it did slow down some iPhones, but said it only did so to ""prolong the life"" of the devices. Apple said in a statement that it had resolved the issue with the watchdog. Many customers had long suspected that Apple slowed down older iPhones to encourage people to upgrade when a new one was released. In 2017, the company confirmed it did slow down some models as they aged, but not to encourage people to upgrade. It said the lithium-ion batteries in the devices became less capable of supplying peak current demands, as they aged over time. That could result in an iPhone unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components. So, it released a software update for the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE which ""smoothed out"" battery performance. The practice was confirmed after a customer shared performance tests on Reddit, suggesting their iPhone 6S had slowed down considerably as it had aged, but had suddenly speeded up again after the battery had been replaced. The French watchdog said iPhone owners ""were not informed that installing iOS updates (10.2.1 and 11.2) could slow down their devices"". As part of the agreement, Apple must display a notice on its French-language website for a month. It says Apple ""committed the crime of deceptive commercial practice by omission"" and had agreed to pay the fine. Yes. Since Apple confirmed the practice in 2017, it hasimplemented it on several more iPhones,externalincluding: iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6S, 6S Plus iPhone SE iPhone 7 and 7 Plus iPhone 8 and 8 Plus running iOS 12.1 or higher iPhone X running iOS 12.1 or higher iPhone XS, XS Max and XR running iOS 13.1 or higher The setting is only enabled when the battery begins to degrade, and iOS now offers clearer information to consumers about when performance management has been switched on. ""The effects of performance management on these newer models may be less noticeable due to their more advanced hardware and software design,"" Apple said.

"Ed Woodward was not at home when his home came under attack Manchester United have accused the Sun newspaper of receiving advanced notice of an intended attack on the house of executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward. The club has filed a complaint to the press regulator regarding the Sun's coverage of the attack on 28 January. The newspaper confirmed a reporter attended ""following a tip-off that there was to be a protest"". But it added it was not made aware of ""what was to take place nor incited it or encouraged any criminal activity"". In a statement, Manchester United said: ""The Club believes that the Sun newspaper had received advance notice of the intended attack, which included criminal damage and intent to intimidate, and that the journalist was present as it happened. ""The quality of the images accompanying the story indicate that a photographer was also present. ""Not only did the journalist fail to discharge the basic duty of a responsible member of society to report an impending crime and avert potential danger and criminal damage, his presence both encouraged and rewarded the perpetrators."" In response, the Sun said it ""condemns fully"" the attack on Mr Woodward's home and that it was ""happy to cooperate fully with any police inquiry"". It added that it ""vigorously"" defended its right to report and that the article ""made it clear that the behaviour was criminal and unacceptable"". The attack on Mr Woodward's housein Cheshire saw a flare thrown and a group chanting that he was ""going to die"". Mr Woodward and his family were not at home at the time.

"Ben Leonard, 16, died on 26 August 2018 The Scout Association is ""putting lives of young people at risk"" following the death of a 16-year-old boy on a trip to north Wales, a report has said. Ben Leonard, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, died after falling from the Great Orme, Conwy, in August 2018. In a prevention of future deaths report, coroner David Pojur said none of the scout leaders on the trip knew where Ben was when he fell and died. The Scout Association said it had since strengthened its policies. In his report, Mr Pojur, assistant coroner for North Wales East and Central, said: ""The lives of young people are being put at risk by the Scout Association's failure to recognise the inadequacies of their operational practice and the part this has played in the death of Ben."" Ben was walking on the Great Orme when he fell to his death He added that the Reddish Explorer Scouts trip did not adhere to the Scout Association's own policies. The coroner said there was no list of participants on the trip, no risk assessment had been carried out and there was no full understanding of what a risk assessment was. He added that each of the three leaders on the trip - Sean Glaister, Gareth Williams and Mary Carr - assumed Ben and his friends were with another leader when the incident happened. The inquest jury at Ruthin County Court was discharged on Friday after new evidence was revealed. Mr Pojur was critical that the Scout Association failed to tell the inquest that the leaders had been placed on restricted duties after the death. He told the jury they had been ""misled"" by not being presented with the information about the leaders. Ben had camped at Betws-y-Coed the night before his death and the group had been due to climb Snowdon, but went to Llandudno instead because of the weather conditions. A statement from the Scout Association said: ""We were truly saddened by Ben's tragic death. This was a terrible event, and our deepest sympathies go out to his family and friends. ""We take this matter very seriously. We will be carefully considering the coroner's concerns and will respond in detail. ""The safety of young people is our number one priority. Following this tragic event, we have strengthened our policies and procedures to ensure young people can enjoy activities safely."" His mother, Jackie Leonard, told the inquest the teenager had received his GCSE results three days before his death and had enrolled to study film and television at a college in Media City, Salford. She said: ""He was a wonderful boy and a fantastic son and brother."" A second inquest, where the chief executive of the Scout Association is expected be called to give evidence, is due to take place on 13 July.
