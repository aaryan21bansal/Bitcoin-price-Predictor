"A passer-by in Tokyo looks at a TV screen reporting news about North Korea's missile launch North Korea has fired a ballistic missile across Japan, creating new tension in the region after its nuclear bomb test less than two weeks ago. The missile reached an altitude of about 770km (478 miles), travelling 3,700km before landing in the sea off Hokkaido, South Korea's military says. It flew higher and further than one fired over Japan late last month. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said his country would ""never tolerate"" such ""dangerous provocative action"". South Korea responded within minutes by firing two ballistic missiles into the sea in a simulated strike on the North. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also condemned the launch and the UN Security Council will meet later on Friday in New York at the request of the United States and Japan. Are Pyongyang's missiles a risk to planes? Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programme North Korea crisis in 300 words Special report: Korea crisis The launch took place from the Sunan district of the capital Pyongyang just before 07:00 local time (22:00 GMT on Thursday), South Korea's military says. Sunan is home to Pyongyang International Airport, 24km north of the city centre. This video can not be played North Korea missile triggers Japan warning alarms As withthe last test on 29 August, the missile flew over Japan's northern Hokkaido island before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. There were no immediate reports of damage to aircraft or ships. Sirens sounded across the region and text message alerts were sent out warning people to take cover. Observers say it is likely to have been an intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) though Japanese officials believe there is still a possibility it was an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). What is so alarming about the new launch is that the US Pacific territory of Guam, whichNorth Korea says it has plans to fire missiles towards, is 3,400km from Pyongyang, putting it within range of the latest missile. Sanctions on the North were tightened this week in response to its sixth nuclear test on 3 September, which reportedly involved a miniaturised hydrogen bomb that could be loaded on to a long-range missile. After the latest round of sanctions, it is not clear what other course of action is open to the UN Security Council. Only on Monday,the Security Council voted unanimously to restrict oil imports and ban textile exports, in an attempt to starve the North of fuel and income for its weapons programmes. Mr Tillerson put the burden of response to the latest test on China and Russia, the North's main economic partners. They ""must indicate their intolerance for these reckless missile launches by taking direct actions of their own"", he said. He said that China supplied North Korea with most of its oil, while Russia was the largest employer ofNorth Korean forced labour,external. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said her country was not the ""focal point of the conflict"". ""The various directly involved parties should take responsibility,"" she added, in remarks that appeared aimed at the US and South Korea. ""Any attempt to wash their hands of the issue is irresponsible."" Ms Hua called for a peaceful solution ""through formal diplomatic means"". Russia's foreign ministry condemned North Korea's ""illegal"" test, but added: ""Regrettably, aggressive rhetoric is the only thing coming from Washington."" Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? In South Korea, President Moon Jae-in held an emergency meeting of his national security council, where he said that dialogue with the North was ""impossible in a situation like this"". South Korea tested missiles in response to the North's new launch Officials have been ordered to prepare for possible North Korean chemical, biological and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attacks, a presidential spokesman said. North Korea has said it has bombs capable of sending EMP shock waves, which would disrupt power supplies, although the claim has been greeted with some scepticism. The country does have an extensive chemical arsenal and may also have biological weapons. What damage could North Korea do? Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? It insists it needs a nuclear-weapons programme to ensure its survival and there has been no let-up in its fiery rhetoric. On Thursday, it threatened to ""sink Japan and turn America to ashes"". North Korea said in early September that it had tested a ""missile-ready"" hydrogen bomb A commentary in North Korea's state-run Rodong Sinmun newspaper after the missile launch accuses the US and South Korea of conducting ""ceaseless"" exercises as a provocation. Watch:Was your T-shirt made in North Korea? What's life like on the border with North Korea? This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? Pyongyang has been developing weapons, initially based on the Soviet-developed Scud, for decades Conducted short and medium-range missile tests on many occasions, sometimes to mark domestic events or periods of regional tension Pace of tests has increased in recent months; experts say North Korea appears to be making significant advances towards building a reliable long-range nuclear-capable weapon On 3 September, North Korea said it tested a hydrogen bomb that could be miniaturised and loaded on a long-range missile Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, BBC News, Tokyo North Korea's rocket launch last month was described by Japan as an ""unprecedented threat"" This test came as a surprise to nobody. North Korea is steadily proceeding down the path to full ICBM capability. To do that, it needs to test-fire its projectiles - every other missile-armed nation has done the same. It started earlier this year by firing its new longer-range Hwasong missiles into the Sea of Japan, then flew one over Hokkaido in August. Next it tested a powerful nuclear device, which it claims it can put on a missile. Now it has tested another intermediate range missile at longer range and higher altitude. The next step will almost certainly be a test of the Hwasong-14 ICBM over Japan and far out into the Pacific. The aim of all this is to develop and deploy a reliable missile that can hit the mainland US. What missiles has North Korea been testing?

"This video can not be played Mark Carney suggests interest rates may change in the coming months The Bank of England has said that higher inflation and a pick up in growth could lead to a rate hike in ""the coming months"". Members of the Bank's nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee voted 7-2 to keep interest rates on hold at 0.25%. But the committee was talking in much stronger terms about an increase, analysts said. The pound climbed more than 1% against the dollar to $1.3363 after the Bank's announcement. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said: ""The majority of members of the Monetary Policy Committee, myself included, see that that balancing act is beginning to shift, and that in order to... return inflation to that 2% target in a sustainable manner, there may need to be some adjustment of interest rates in the coming months. ""Now, we'll take that decision based on the data. But yes that possibility has definitely increased."" 'Pay outpaces house prices' in many areas UK inflation rate rises to 2.9% Smaller banks 'offer best savings rates' In minutes of itslatest rates decision,external, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said there was a ""slightly stronger picture"" for the economy since its forecasts last month thanks to signs of a firmer housing market, stronger employment and a rebound in retail and new car sales. The nine policymakers on the panel believed ""some withdrawal of monetary stimulus was likely to be appropriate over the coming months"". The Bank reiterated that rates may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the MPC had ""ratcheted up"" its rhetoric surrounding a rate rise. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the MPC could increase interest rates in November. ""If the economy continues to hold up, and there are clearer signs that wage growth is building, then the first hike could come somewhat earlier than we had previously envisaged, possibly as soon as the next meeting in November alongside the Inflation Report,"" he said. However, some analysts were more sceptical. James Athey, investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said: ""There's some fairly strong rhetoric today implying that the Bank could raise rates earlier than people expected. ""They're doing this because they want financial markets to support sterling since this would help deal with the current bout of inflation. ""But the reality is that they aren't going to raise rates particularly soon. So they're playing a game of chicken with financial markets and will keep this up as long as they can."" At first blush the decision of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee could be construed as dull. Its members have now met 97 times since rates were cut to an 'emergency' low in March 2009. And 96 of those resulted in no change in interest rates. You can't even get excited by the number of votes in favour of raising rates: it was two, just like last time. But buried in the notes that accompanies their decision are two things that woke the currency markets up. One is that the Bank now judges that inflation will peak above 3% (it previously said below that figure). The other is the following, couched in tortuously cautious central banker's language: ""Monetary policy could need to be tightened by a somewhat greater extend over the forecast period than current market expectationsâ¦ some withdrawal of monetary stimulus is likely to be appropriate over the coming months."" In other words, the MPC does not agree with those economists who think rates don't need to rise until 2019 or 2020. This morning, traders in the City viewed a rate rise as more likely than not by February, now they expect it by December. Meanwhile, the inflation rate is rising faster than the Bank's policymakers had expected just a month ago. The inflation rate hit 2.9% last month, and the Bank expects it to rise above 3% in October, well above its 2% target level. Two members of the Bank's rate setting committee, Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders, voted for the third meeting in a row to increase rates, arguing that inflation would continue to overshoot the target and a move now would prevent a sharper rise. The rest of the nine-strong committee, including Mr Carney, voted to keep rates on hold, saying that business investment, consumer confidence and consumption remained weak. The Bank pinned the blame for the rise in inflation on the fall in sterling since the Brexit referendum, which has made imports more expensive. Since the MPC's last meeting, the Bank said the pound had fallen by 1% against the currencies of its main trading partners. The Bank also said the rising price of oil was adding to inflationary pressures.

"Michael Morell (left) said that Chelsea Manning's invitation was ""inappropriate"" Ex-acting CIA director Michael Morell has resigned from his post at Harvard over its hiring of Chelsea Manning. Announcing his resignation as a senior fellow, Mr Morell said he could not be part of an institution ""that honours a convicted felon and leaker of classified information"". Harvard later withdrew Ms Manning's invitation as a visiting fellow, but said she remained welcome as a speaker. She was convicted of espionage in 2013 after leaking secret documents. In his resignation letter, Mr Morell condemned Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, saying its ""decision will assist Ms Manning in her long-standing effort to legitimise the criminal path that she took to prominence"", and may serve to encourage other whistleblowers. He added: ""I fully support Ms Manning's rights as a transgender American, including the right to serve our country in the US military."" On her Twitter page, Ms Manning responded to Mr Morell's departure by writing ""good"", and said the debate around her appointment was ""nothing to do with trans rights"". The former Army private also retweeted a review of Mr Morell's2015 book,externalin which he defended the use of drone strikes and torture techniques against terror suspects. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Morell served in the CIA for 33 years, including three as deputy director under the Obama administration. He was acting director of the agency for several months in 2011, replacing Leon Panetta when he was named defence secretary, then again from November 2012 to March 2013, when Gen David Petraeusresigned over an extra-marital affair. Morell retired in 2013 and was named a senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Kennedy School. Ms Manning - who served seven years in a military prison after sharing US government documents with Wikileaks before her sentence was commuted by President Barack Obama - was initially named as a visiting fellow at the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School on Wednesday. But after a day of backlash, Harvardreleased a statement,externalsaying that designating her as a visiting fellow had been a ""mistake"". The Dean of the Harvard Kennedy School, Douglas Elmendorf, said the university ""did not intend to honor [Ms Manning] in any way or to endorse any of her words or deeds, as we do not honor or endorse any fellow"". However, he said, the title is viewed by some people as an honorific, ""so we should weigh that consideration when offering invitations"". Mr Elmendorf said the faculty's approach to visiting speakers is ""to invite some people who have significantly influenced events in the world, even if they do not share our values"". He apologised to Ms Manning, adding that she was still welcome ""to spend a day at the Kennedy School and speak in the Forum"".

"Rights groups say honour killings are on the rise in Pakistan The bodies of a teenage Pakistani couple feared murdered in an ""honour killing"" bear marks suggesting they were electrocuted, police say. Officials exhumed the bodies of Bakht Jan, 15, and her boyfriend Rehman, 17, a month after they were buried. Doctors, police and a magistrate were present at the graveside in Karachi. Post-mortem results are awaited. Police say the couple were planning to elope but their families found out and tribal elders ordered them killed. Death by electrocution is almost unheard of in so-called honour killings in Pakistan, says the BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad. The BBC reported a suspectedcase in the Indian capital Delhi in 2010. Four people, including the fathers of the dead Karachi couple, have been arrested. Police are trying to trace the whereabouts of the head of the tribal council (or jirga). District police head Rao Anwaar told the media that police had been alerted to the killings and burials by an ""informer"". He said the bodies exhumed at Mauladad graveyard in Sherpao Colony on Wednesday had marks on the arms, chest and legs that indicated electrocution. ""There were visible signs of electric shock and torture on both bodies,"" Civil Hospital Karachi Additional Police Surgeon Dr Qarar Ahmed Abbasi confirmed,Dawn newspaper,externalreports. Mother 'burnt her daughter to death' over marriage Elders 'ordered girl's killing' Pakistan 'honour killings' on the rise Human rights groups say so-called honour killings are on the rise in Pakistan. Most victims are women who are not allowed to liaise or contract marriage with a man without approval of their families. Police exhumed the bodies of the two teens to establish a cause of death Those involved in this case belong to the Pashtun Safi tribe from the north-western tribal region of Mohmand. Zia Ur Rehman, a reporter forThe News newspaper, which broke the story,externalon Saturday, told the BBC that the families had reached a settlement in accordance with their tribal traditions. ""Under the settlement, the couple were to wed and the boy's family would give the hand of two of its women in marriage to two men of the girl's family as the price of honour. ""But a jirga called to endorse this settlement on 15 August rejected it and ordered the couple to be killed as a lesson to others."" Police officer Aman Marwat told the BBC that the relatives arrested ""said that both the victims were drugged and then given electric shocks after being tied to a cot"". He said that Bakht Jan left her home secretly on 14 August, but the family found her hours later at a nearby house waiting for Rehman, who had not yet arrived. ""The girl was killed on 15 August, and the boy was killed the next day,"" police officer Marwat said. Members of the tribal council were not contactable. Most are thought to be in hiding. No family members were available to comment. Nearly 1,100 women were killed in Pakistan in 2015by relatives who believed they had dishonoured their families, according to an April 2016 report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.

"The Horrid Henry books have sold in their millions since 1994 Emmerdale actor Adam Thomas has banned his three-year-old son from watching Horrid Henry because he says Teddy has ""literally turned into"" the fictional character. Henry is a naughty prankster who bullies his little brother and causes chaos wherever he goes. Henry is just, well, horrid. But should parents be banishing him from their children's lives? Author Francesca Simon has defended her creation, telling the BBC that in the end ""he always obeys his parents"". Taking toTwitter,externalto vent his frustration, Thomas asked: ""Anyone else banned their kid from watching Horrid Henry or is it just us?"" Hundreds wrote back - with many admitting that they had switched off the programme due to copycat behaviour, or because they were ""simply fed up of getting called a worm"". But some mothers revealed that their children are allowed to watch the programme and read the books at school. Lisa Skelton, from Lincolnshire, said she had banned her daughter from watching, but added that ""to my amazement she replied with 'can I still watch it when my teacher puts it on in the classroom?'""

The Horrid Henry books by Ms Simon have sold millions of copies since the first book was published in 1994. The series spawned dozens more joke books, fact books, early readers and others, and in 2006 Horrid Henry was turned into a hit TV series and then into a feature film in 2011. Ms Simon told BBC News that the books and TV series are ""very different"" - pointing out that one of the examples mentioned by parents on Twitter does not happen in any of the books. ""So I can't really comment on the programme content,"" she said, before adding: ""The books are aimed at older children than three-year-olds - generally five to seven years old. And I should add Henry never plots - he's spontaneous. ""He never plans to be wicked, but he's tempted in the moment. And he always obeys his parents. They are in charge. ""He might go to his room reluctantly, but when he's sent there, he goes."" Novel Entertainment, which produces the TV series told BBC News that it takes ""great care"" to make sure Henry does not behave like a bully. Lucinda Whitley, the company's co-founder and creative director, said: ""Much of the humour of the shows comes from Henry not understanding, but learning about, the boundaries of the real world in which he lives."" Emmerdale actor Adam Thomas prompted a debate on Twitter Ms Simon has howeverpreviously admitted,externalthat ""as a parent, it's fair to say that you might not want your child to behave exactly like him"". Yet Henry pops up on children's recommended reading lists across the country and the TV series has been nominated twice for a Bafta. The Centre for Literacy in Primary Education (CLPE) includes Horrid Henry on its core book list for children in lower Key Stage 2 (ages seven to nine). Encouraging children to read for pleasure can be a tall order - but if they like the TV show, it can encourage them to pick up a book, the CLPE claims. Chief executive Louise Johns-Shepherd said: ""Love for a series, a character or a type of book is often what makes children realise that they are a reader and is the first step to them being enthusiastic about reading"". Just one in four 10-year-olds in England ""likes reading"", according to the National Literacy Trust. Ms Johns-Shepherds said that many children who do not enjoy reading either ""don't think it's cool"", or they find it difficult, see it as a chore, or cannot see what reading can offer them. Children need to be encouraged to read all kinds of books if they are going to develop their reading, she said. ""It's important that we don't label books as young, easy or difficult,"" she said, adding that Horrid Henry books are ""fabulous examples of using language to create and shape characters across a range of short stories"". Common Sense Media, a US-based non-profit organisation that advises on children's use of media and technology, puts the television viewing age for Horrid Henry at five upwards. For Common Sense, the appeal for children is obvious:  ""Despite his faults, Henry is a highly entertaining character, particularly for grade-schoolers who will appreciate his laundry list of complaints and the show's occasional gross-out humour"". TV programmes are often blamed for many of the problems children experience, says the NLT However its reviewer, Emily Ashby, noted: ""If Dennis the Menace set the bar for comical misbehaving, then Horrid Henry smashed it to smithereens and littered his neighbour's yard with it."" The way for parents to deal with Henry's bad behaviour is to talk to their child about it, she advises. Ask them what would happen if they acted that way in real life, or at school, she says. What would the repercussions be? How would people react? How would they react if Henry played a trick on them? How would they handle a situation like that? TV programmes are often blamed for many of the problems children experience, the National Literacy Trust (NLT) says, including poor communication skills. But the NLT also agrees that children are more likely to benefit from age-appropriate TV or DVDs when they talk about what they have watched with an adult. ""Where possible, try to watch together"", the NLT says, because like any technology it ""will work best when you and your child play together using it, just like a book"". Many people will not have time to sit down and watch TV with their children, in which case at least discuss what your child has watched, it says. ""When the programme has finished, switch off the TV and talk about what happened in the story or sing songs from the show,"" the NLT says. ""If your child has toys related to a programme, encourage imaginative play when the set is switched off"".

"This video can not be played Andrew Gosden was last seen on CCTV at King's Cross in London a decade ago On 14 September 2007, 14-year-old Andrew Gosden walked out of the family home in Doncaster, boarded a train to London with a one-way ticket and then simply vanished. A short sequence of CCTV stills captured that morning at King's Cross station represents the last certain sighting of the schoolboy. A decade on, his disappearance remains a mystery. The Gosden family - Kevin, Glenys, Charlotte and Andrew - were about to sit down for dinner on the evening of Friday 14 September. Charlotte was in her room on her new laptop, while Andrew was thought to be in the converted cellar of the Gosdens' house in the suburb of Balby, playing on his console, just as he usually did after school. But when the shout went out to come and eat, he didn't emerge. In Andrew's bedroom his family found his McAuley Catholic High School blazer and tie hanging neatly over the back of a chair. Later they discovered his shirt and trousers in the washing machine. After a series of increasingly frantic phone calls, they learned he had not been to school that day. Andrew pictured with sister Charlotte and father Kevin His sister Charlotte, now 26, said: ""It was just a complete panic. We initially thought something must have happened on the way to school. ""When we found that he hadn't even been to school - even tried to go to school - that was even more worrying."" It emerged Andrew had put on his uniform and left the house but then waited for his family to leave before returning home. He dressed in a pair of jeans and one of his favourite T-shirts and headed out the door. On the way to the railway station he withdrew just under Â£200 from his bank account and bought a one-way ticket to London. Missing person call every 90 seconds The mystery of the Milk Carton Kids New help for families of missing Later that morning, and hours before he was noticed missing, in the words of his father Kevin, ""he apparently just disappeared off the face of the Earth"". ""It's psychologically impossible to deal with,"" he said. ""You go round and round in circles thinking, 'Well probably they've been murdered, maybe they committed suicide, perhaps they are alive and well somewhere' and it might just depend on what day of the week it is."" Andrew has been described by his family as a quiet, gentle and extremely intelligent boy who took part in the government's Young, Gifted & Talented Programme for high-achieving students. He liked reading - well-thumbed copies of The Lord of the Rings and the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy still sit on a shelf in his room - he played computer games and he enjoyed his music: Slipknot, Muse and Funeral for a Friend were among his favourite bands. Andrew was part of a government scheme for the top 5% highest achieving school students Andrew was a ""home bird"", his family say, who rarely left the house, and never without saying where he was going. His father said they didn't have the slightest idea why he would want to leave. Andrew's sister said: ""If there were problems and he was running away from something, or experienced any kind of depression or anything like that, I would have really hoped he could have spoken to me at least out of everyone. ""So I do struggle with that because I feel like, in a way, if there was something and he couldn't tell me then I feel like I've let him down as a sister, really."" Kevin Gosden is supporting the Missing People charity's Find Every Child campaign Two images of how Andrew might appear aged 16 were released in 2009 Since Andrew's disappearance there have been dozens of unconfirmed sightings from across the UK. The family believe the most plausible place him at Pizza Hut on Oxford Street on the day he went missing and later in Covent Garden. He is currently the face of the Missing People charity's Find Every Child campaign, with his parents and sister appearing in countless TV and newspaper appeals. Andrew's father has described South Yorkshire Police's handling of the investigation as ""too slow, too chaotic and disorganised"". Mr Gosden said it was the family who found CCTV from a neighbour's house of Andrew walking towards the station on the morning he went missing. Andrew's room has since been redecorated, but still contains many of his personal belongings And it was the family, he said, who spoke to the rail employee at Doncaster station who sold Andrew his ticket, and a man who sat opposite him on the train as far as Peterborough. The CCTV footage of Andrew arriving at King's Cross was not located until 27 days after he went missing, Mr Gosden said. As a result, efforts to retrieve footage from the surrounding area were thwarted. The South Yorkshire force said it asked British Transport Police (BTP) to search the CCTV footage within two days of Andrew going missing, but BTP could not pick him out from the crowds. (The Met Police force was not involved in the inquiry.) An officer was later sent to London to review the footage, South Yorkshire Police said, and Andrew was then spotted. However, the Pizza Hut and Covent Garden sightings were not followed up, Mr Gosden said, adding that the woman who reported the latter was not spoken to for six weeks. After four years with no leads, in 2011 the family took the step of hiring specialists to carry out a sonar scan of the River Thames. But, even after 10 years, they still cling to the hope Andrew might one day walk through the front door. Andrew's bedroom, as it looked two years after his disappearance A gem collection remains on display in his room His bedroom has been repainted and the band posters have been taken down, but Andrew's T-shirts are still in the drawers and part of his rock and gem collection sits on a shelf. Sandy Murray, 24, a friend of Andrew's from the age of six, now works as an actor and splits his time between Yorkshire and London. He still keeps an eye out for his friend when he is in the capital. ""There's always that kind of little shadow, cloud, hanging on your shoulder, that this is where he was last seen. ""You see a face and you're like 'whoa, hang on is that?...' and then you sort of catch yourself."" More than 135,000 individuals were reported missing in England and Wales in 2015-16, some on more than one occasion. Nearly 80% of cases are resolved within 24 hours and the vast majority within seven days - only 2% of people go missing for longer than a week. Just over 50% of children go missing for less than eight hours, 81% for less than 24 hours, and 98% are found within seven days. There are currently about 3,000 people in the UK who have been missing for more than 10 years. Source: National Crime Agency/Missing People Andrew has a distinctive double ridge at the top of his right ear Andrew's family are haunted by thoughts of what might have happened to him after he arrived in London, with his father suffering from anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidal thoughts. Charlotte says she still talks about Andrew in the present tense, ""because that's the assumption until we know otherwise"", but admits it becomes harder with every passing year. She said: ""You've always got that nagging feeling of, 'Is he still around? What would he be like if we met him today? Would I walk past my own brother in the street and not even know?'"" The Gosdens say there's ""always a little hope"" and refuse to leave the family home to start afresh. Andrew, pictured with Charlotte, has been described as gentle and intelligent Andrew's father said: ""There's a voice in you that says, 'Just get out, be somewhere different, and then it won't feel so imminent.' ""[But] there's also a little voice in my head that says, 'He went off with your front door key and we haven't changed the locks' so, hey, in the hope that he's still alive and well somewhere, we're still here - he would know where to find us if he wanted to."" Initially, South Yorkshire Police refused to respond to requests by the BBC for details about the investigation. However, in a statement issued to coincide with the anniversary of Andrew going missing, the force said ""thorough and comprehensive"" leads had been examined, including lines of inquiry at several London tourist attractions he was familiar with. His DNA, fingerprints, dental and health records were circulated to various agencies, and a behavioural investigative analyst was employed ""in an attempt to shed light on his reasons for leaving home"". Det Ch Insp Joanne Bates said: ""I would ask anyone, maybe new friends, neighbours or workmates, who believe they know a 24-year-old man that could be Andrew, but aren't aware of his past beyond the last few years, to please come forward. ""And to Andrew, a personal appeal: please contact us, completely confidentially, and let us know you are safe and well and we can reassure your family you have come to no harm.""

"No 10 are remaining tight lipped about the PM's Florence speech No sooner had her next European adventure been confirmed than the speculation began. What message will Theresa May take with her to Italy next week? Inside Number 10, the view is not to spill a single fagiolo, a bean, before the words come out of her mouth. That's not just because they want the story to be told on her own terms in her own words, when she is ready to tell it. But also, perhaps, because I'm told that she is yet to have signed off the full contents with those members of the cabinet who might object to some of it. And frankly, at this stage, it is extremely difficult to get to the bottom of what the precise thinking in government really is, about the next move on Brexit. May to set out post-Brexit 'partnership' UK wants 'bespoke' EU deal to protect City And it is also very hard to understand exactly what the views really are from the different parts of the EU machine. In the coming days, I'm told Boris Johnson is likely to see the PM. She'll try to square him on her plans, with private suggestions that she has to persuade him to accept cash going to Brussels. That would go against, of course, what he suggested in the referendum campaign, and also how heevoked the memory of Margaret Thatcher earlier this year, by mentioning the ""illustrious precedent"" of Fontainebleau. Can the PM win over Boris Johnson to the idea of continued EU payments? I'm told Theresa May has not yet put a proposal to the foreign secretary that would involve continued payments to the EU during a transition period for a couple of years after the UK leaves the EU, or to other Brexiteers. ""She has yet to try it on for size with these people"", I was told. And sources suggest it will be hard for Mr Johnson to stomach in particular. ""I can't see him turning and agreeing that's palatable,"" one source said. The prevailing wind however in the cabinet, as the chancellor even said publicly this week, is for a transition period that looks rather similar to the status quo, and to retain some of those privileges -and burdens - would have to involve some payments. In fact, there are whispers that UK officials are ready to put just such an offer on the table. Previous speculation seems to be solidifying around a potential ""sensible offer"" where the UK would offer to pay Â£10bn a year for three years, in return for continuing access to the single market, while business disentangles itself from the EU and the final details of a permanent trading relationship are hammered out. That would seem a specific price for a specific outcome, a fee for access, rather than one enormous Brexit bill. Under this plan, the longer term liabilities of the UK to EU pensions, and other assets, would be settled over time by committees, with the political sting removed. Are the remaining EU countries totally united in their approach to Brexit? But it's not just confirmed Brexiteers who might find that hard to accept. Whispers suggest that while France and the EU Council would accept that broadly as a fair deal, Germany and the EU Commission see that as not good enough. A UK government source tells me that, on the issue of the bill, France and Germany are split. It's not clear however what the view is of the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. But remember his mandate comes from the member states, he is unable to make compromise decisions on his own. Divisions inside ""the 27"" are denied in Brussels, where they are described as ""wishful thinking"" by the UK. Here, the speech is so sensitive no one will be drawn on the record. But one former diplomat, familiar with the talks, told me there is a chance for the UK to throw the EU ""into disarray"" - put forward that ""sensible offer"" and destroy the unity the 27 other countries have worked so hard to preserve. That could in theory, in turn, crack open the impasse in the talks and give the UK the advantage. The Florence speech has the potential perhaps to be a game-changing moment in this vital process. But could Theresa May's cabinet stomach the offer that might finally open up a British advantage?

"This video can not be played Sampha said it 'felt like dreaming' to win the award Soul singer Sampha has been awarded the 2017 Hyundai Mercury Prize for his mournful and intimate album, Process. The singer, who for a long time was better known as a guest vocalist on other people's records, beat Ed Sheeran and Stormzy to win the Â£25,000 prize. ""I feel like I'm dreaming!"" said the south London singer, before thanking his parents for giving him and his family ""the best upbringing possible"". His album ruminates on the grief he felt after his mother died of cancer. It is best exemplified by the ballad (No One Knows Me) Like The Piano, which talks about the instrument his mother taught him to play in his childhood home. Mercury Prize; As it happened Bite-sized guide to the shortlist (BBC Music) Meet the nominees (BBC Two) Mercury Prize nominees see sales boost ""At the time... it was quite important for me to write music,"" Sampha told the BBC about the making of his debut record. ""It helped me through everything. So it's this weird kind of document. But it's nice, I guess, because I'll have it for the rest of my life."" This video can not be played Sampha discusses the recording of his album Process Born in London to Sierra Leonean parents in 1988, the singer's real name is Sampha Sissay. He emerged on MySpace almost a decade ago and was quickly sought out by dance producers for his honeyed, soulful vocals. After appearing on records by SBTRKT and Jessie Ware, he was sought out by US R&B royalty, and can be heard on Beyonce's Mine, Drake's Too Much and Solange's Don't Touch My Hair. His own debut took 10 years to appear, as he cared for his ailing mother and struggled with his self-confidence. ""It took me quite a while to feel like I was emotionally stable [enough] to write my own record,"" said the 28-year-old. Since it came out in February, the reaction, he said, had been ""lovely"". ""People have said it helped them... I can't really ask for anything more,"" he said. The other nominees for the prestigious album of the year award were: Kate Tempest's state-of-the-nation album Let Them Eat Chaos had been the favourite to win, although it was always a close contest between her, Sampha and art-rock band Glass Animals. Process was chosen as the victor by a panel of judges that included Marcus Mumford, Jessie Ware, Ella Eyre, Radio 1's Clara Amfo and jazz musician Jamie Cullum. They said the deliberation was the prize's ""longest ever"", even after last year's jury was split between David Bowie's swansong Blackstar and the eventual winner, Skepta. Full details of the judges' debate have yet to be revealed, but Mumford told the BBC: ""We were only allowed to talk about positive things. So I shut up quite a lot."" Sampha accepted his award from actor Idris Elba, and immediately dedicated it to his late parents. ""My mum would be very proud. My dad would probably be embarrassingly proud,"" he said afterwards. The Mercury Prize ceremony featured performances from all the nominated acts - including an incendiary performance from Stormzy - and was broadcast on BBC Four and BBC 6 Music.

"Grant Hart, the lead singer and drummer of the influential indie rock band Husker Du, has died after being diagnosed with liver cancer. The death of the 56-year-old Minnesota rocker was confirmed by his former band mate, Bob Mould, on Facebook on Thursday. Husker Du - Danish for ""Do you remember"" - rose to fame in the 1980s with their melodic take on punk rock. Mould recalled meeting Hart while studying at university in 1978. BBC Music: Husker Du The two men met at a local record shop in St Paul, Minnesota as punk music blared over the stereo system, Mould described on Facebook. ""The next nine years of my life was spent side-by-side with Grant. We made amazing music together,"" he said. ""The band was our life. It was an amazing decade,"" he added, saying that Hart ""was a gifted visual artist, a wonderful story teller, and a frighteningly talented musician"". ""Everyone touched by his spirit will always remember."" The band initially rose through the hardcore music scene, and gained international attention with the 1984 single ""Eight Miles High"".

Their 1985 album, Zen Arcade, was praised by Rolling Stone magazine as one of the greatest albums of the 1980s and one the best punk albums ever. Hart's contribution, ""Turn on the News"" has been listed on the 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

"Archaeologists believe the car had been dismantled for repair by a local soldier, and then seemingly abandoned The remains of a MG roadster have been unearthed by archaeologists excavating a former military site. The 1932 MG J2 was found within a World War Two artillery position during excavations at Larkhill on Salisbury Plain. It is believed to be a pool car used by troops training in the 1960s which was dumped in a disused weapons pit. Damien Campbell-Bell, of Wessex Archaeology, described the find as ""a real surprise"". ""This particular MG J2 is pretty rare and was one of only 2,083 of this model ever made,"" he said. ""We can tell from the tyre pattern the car was probably in use until the early 1960s, at which point it seems to have been placed in the artillery position."" Mr Campbell-Bell said he thinks the car had been dismantled for repair by a local soldier, but was then seemingly abandoned. When the car was new in 1932, it had a top speed of 65 mph and would have cost about Â£199 The Larkhill site is one of a number of areas on Salisbury Plain which will see troops re-accommodated in the UK from Germany under theArmy Basing Programme,external. Environmental consultancy WYG has been employed by the Defence Infrastructure Organisation to survey the development site as part of the planning process. WYG archaeologist Martin Brown said: ""The MG is a particularly exciting find in that it shows the unrecorded side to life on an army camp. ""As a buried artefact it almost conforms to the urban myths of buried tanks, aircraft and equipment one hears about.""

"A statement was read to the court from Eddie Redmayne, who described the distress caused to him and his family A woman has been handed a four-month suspended jail sentence after admitting stalking actor Eddie Redmayne. Gaby Stieger, 49, repeatedly loitered outside the Oscar winner's house in Southwark, south London, and sent him love letters over five years. She was also ordered not to have any contact with, or come within 200 metres of Mr Redmayne or his immediate family. The interpreter pleaded guilty to stalking at Camberwell Green Magistrates' Court on Wednesday. Stieger's prison sentence was suspended for two years. The mother-of-three from Colindale, north London, believed they had been married in a former life and her face would ""contort with rage"" when she spoke about his wife, Hannah Bagshawe. Gaby Stieger sent Eddie Redmayne love letters over and loitered outside his house Magistrate Novello Noades, chairwoman of the bench, said: ""This is a very serious offence - which took place over a period of five years. ""There was significant planning involved, you moved from Germany to London to be near the victim. ""You obtained work in the film industry and near the victim's home in order to be in proximity to him."" She added: ""He told you he was distressed but you ignored him."" On Wednesday, Mr Redmayne described the distress it caused him and his family in a statement read to the court. He said: ""I always try to be open and friendly as support (from fans) is what gives me a career. ""I deeply regret having met Gaby Stieger - she harassed myself and my family intermittently over five years, leaving us distressed, unsafe and deeply unsettled.""

"This video can not be played How FC Cologne fans (briefly) took over London Thousands of German football fans brought parts of central London to a standstill ahead of their team's Europa League match against Arsenal. Some 20,000 FC Cologne fans have come to London, and briefly brought the West End traffic to a halt as they marched down Oxford Street. The game was delayed by an hour, whichArsenal said was ""in the interests of crowd safety"". Police said they were dealing with disorder at the Emirates Stadium. More than a dozen police officers wearing helmets could be seen entering the ground as the game kicked off and riot police could be seen sitting outside the stadium. It is the first time in 25 years Cologne has played in an international club competition. The Metropolitan Police said in a statement: ""Officers are dealing with disorder at the Emirates Stadium where fans have gathered for the Arsenal v FC Cologne match. ""A policing plan is in place for the game and additional officers have been deployed."" Earlier, police said flares were let off and bottles thrown but reported no ""significant disorder"". The Bundesliga estimatedaround 20,000 fans had travelled to the capital,externalto support their team. It added only 2,900 tickets had been allocated to the away fans for the match. Earlier, the Met said: ""At around 15:00 BST on Thursday, 14 September a large group of football fans gathered in Oxford Street. ""The group was at the location for about 30 minutes whilst they boarded public transport to travel to a football match this evening.

"Ellen aspired to become a vet and ""made the world a better place"", her father said after sentencing A man who ""savagely"" murdered a college student at a beauty spot has been jailed for a minimum of 31 years. Mark Buckley, 52, killed 18-year-old Ellen Higginbottom in a ""chilling"" and ""sexually motivated pre-meditated"" attack in June at Orrell Water Park in Wigan, Greater Manchester. Buckley, of New Hall Lane, Preston,admitted the chargeat a previous hearing at Manchester Crown Court. Miss Higginbottom was planning to marry boyfriend Ryan Warren, the court heard. Judge David Stockdale QC described the murder as ""cowardly and callous"". The murder was sexually motivated, the court heard, but the victim was chosen at random, police said He said the facts of the case were ""frankly chilling"". Ellen was reported missing on 16 June after failing to return home from Winstanley College. A post-mortem examination confirmed she died from multiple wounds to the neck. Police said she was killed at about 14:00 BST. Her body was found the next day. Slightly-built Miss Higginbottom, who did not know her attacker, was not able to physically offer much resistance in the attack, the judge said. The Honorary Recorder of Manchester told the defendant: ""Despite that, her wounds indicated that she tried albeit in vain to defend herself."" He said Buckley who was armed with a knife subjected her to a ""savage and brutal attack"". ""She would have had no idea it was coming"" and was ""caught entirely off her guard"". ""She simply did not stand a chance. What must have been going through her mind is beyond imagining."" This video can not be played Body cam footage of the arrest of Mark Buckley for the murder of Ellen Higginbottom The court heard Buckley took the psychology student's laptop and mobile phone and fled. Buckley later returned to the park and moved her body which he then intended to bury when it was dark, the court heard. He was thwarted as a police helicopter with heat-seeking equipment hovered overhead and he made off, the court heard. Buckley was later arrested and admitted killing Miss Higginbottom but could offer no explanation for his actions. Neil Fryman, prosecuting, told the court at a previous hearing: ""There was a sexual motivation for this offence and also it was pre-meditated."" The court heard Miss Higginbottom was planning to marry her boyfriend. The judge said: ""Although they were young, the couple was already planning to marry and they were planning ahead to having children. ""All that is now lost to Ryan Warren."" Ellen's body was found at Orrell Water Park on 17 June Following sentencing, Ellen's father Mike Higginbottom said: ""There can never be anything even remotely approaching justice for what was done to Ellen."" He continued: ""We were tremendously lucky to have shared 18 years with her and everyone else who knew her will identify with that feeling. ""She made the world a better place with pretty much everything she said and everything she did."" He said having her taken away in such a ""pointless and idiotic fashion fills us with an anger and resentment that does not represent who we want to be"". Mr Higginbottom added: ""But we wrestle it under control and learn to be better at being people. Because that's what adults do."" ""So if there's anyone else out there thinking of doing anything even half this stupid, just take one piece of advice. Grow up."" David Graham from the Crown Prosecution Service said: ""Mark Buckley went out that day equipped with a knife to carry out a violent assault. ""He spent a number of hours that morning looking for a lone female to attack."" He said: ""We believe he selected his victim at random, and Ellen Higginbottom was simply walking through the park at the time he chose to attack, with tragic consequences."" Det Supt Howard Millington from Greater Manchester Police said: ""Buckley callously killed Ellen in broad daylight. ""He attacked her in the most brutal way as she was walking around Orrell Water Park before going to meet her friends who were taking their exams.""

"The UK has called for urgent changes to international aid rules so that its aid budget can be used to help victims of natural disasters like Hurricane Irma. Under international rules, Anguilla, Turks and Caicos and the British Virgin Islands are considered too wealthy to qualify for assistance. But International Development Secretary Priti Patel said they should consider the impact of natural disasters. She said the rules needed to be ""relevant and up to date"". Ms Patel said: ""We believe that the international rules should take into account the vulnerabilities of small island states. ""These rules were first established over 40 years ago. ""The world has changed dramatically since then, and we will work constructively with international partners to ensure the rules remain relevant and up to date."" UK's aid budget cannot be spent on Irma What are the UK's commitments to overseas territories? Aerial footage shows destruction on British Virgin Islands Earlier, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said a way would be found to use some of the UK's Â£13bn aid money. He made the comments during a joint press conference in London with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Describing his recent visit to the British Virgin Islands (BVI) and Anguilla, Mr Johnson said: ""I've never seen anything like it - like the destruction... you see in images from the First World War. ""And I think anybody with an ounce of compassion would want to see spending by our government on getting those people back up on their feet and indeed on getting those British - and I stress - British overseas territories helped in the long term."" The foreign secretary visited the British Virgin Islands, where communities suffered devastating damage Anguilla, Turks and Caicos, and the British Virgin Islands are among 14 self-governing British overseas territories. The UK government is responsible for their defence and security and has a duty to protect them from natural disasters. But under international rules they do not qualify for official aid because their national incomes are too high. The rules are agreed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, of which Britain is a member. They make clear that only the poorest countries can receive what is known as official development assistance or ODA. The Department for International Development insisted the fact the territories were not eligible for official development assistance had not affected the UK's emergency relief. And officials denied that claims that five times as much money would have been available if ODA could have been used. The Royal Marines have been helping with the relief effort in Anguilla Mr Johnson this week visited Anguilla's worst-hit areas, before heading to the neighbouring British Virgin Islands. During the trip, he promised Â£25m more relief money on top of the Â£32m already being spent in the Caribbean, with the money coming from different departmental budgets. The announcement comes amid criticism from Caribbean residents and senior MPs that the UK's response to the disasterwas too slow. Anguillan chief minister Victor Banks welcomed the visit but said the money offered by the government so far was ""not enough"". The former attorney general of Anguilla, Rupert Jones, told the Guardian the Â£32m hurricane relief fund was a ""drop in the Caribbean Sea,external"". Mr Johnson defended the government's response as being ""extremely fast"", while the Foreign Office said more than 1,000 UK military personnel were in the region helping with the relief effort, with 200 more arriving in the next few days.

"It's one in the morning and, under the neon lights of Seoul's shining skyscrapers, people are laughing and chatting, heading to eat barbecue or drink tiny glasses of soju, the country's national alcoholic drink. Being just 35 miles from one of the world's most dangerous borders isn't playing on the mind of anyone here tonight. For me, that's one of the most striking things about the mood in South Korea right now. The swirling fear that's enveloping other parts of the globe isn't in evidence here. People know this threat, they recognise it, but they've lived with it for a long time already. The conflict between North and South Korea is nothing new. Technically the two countries are still at war, and simply living in a state of armistice. So why has world attention - and fear - grown so fast in the past few months? In Seoul, people's response to the North Korean threat tends to fall along generational lines. For those who are too young to remember the Korean War, it feels like more of an abstract threat. While they can't see it, and it has no effect on their daily lives, they spend little time worrying about it. The Korean peninsula is a place of contrast. In just a few decades, the South has clawed its way back from almost complete destruction to become the fourth-largest economy in Asia. One of the colourful statues gracing Seoul's bustling Gangnam district I wandered through the Gangnam district packed with colourful statues celebrating the booming K-pop music scene. Even after midnight half the floors in Samsung's towering glass headquarters had lights on and people at their desks. This prosperity is born of hard graft. There's no outward show of wealth in the North. Driving along the border, hearing the heavy thumps of South Korean army target practice and the return of clattering gunfire from the North, two worlds are colliding. A quick check of my smartphone map app shows a featureless expanse. No roads, no towns. What goes on here is shadowy and secretive. I travelled to the closest village to the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ), just three miles from the barbed wire. Its men have special permission to farm inside the DMZ, and one of them, sprightly 77-year-old Mr Ong, showed me where he'd lost every toe on his right foot standing on a landmine. The North Korea crisis in 300 words North Korea slapped with UN sanctions after nuclear test North Korean defector: My life could end instantly A look inside a South Korean public shelter He described the day he heard a bang and looked down to see his leg mangled and twisted. Even then he felt lucky, nine men in his village had stood on mines and he was the only one of them to survive. Unlike in Seoul, where underground stations and housing block basements double-up as emergency shelters, this place has a clean, new, purpose-built bunker sunk two storeys below ground behind an 8in (20cm) thick door. Mr Ong lost all the toes on his right foot after treading on a landmine In one corner, stands a row of shelves, neatly stacked with clear plastic boxes. Inside, lie pristine escape hoods, hammers, first aid supplies, a torch, a whistle - all lined up and ready to be used in case of an emergency. They're so untouched that I ask if they've ever even been practised with. ""We haven't had a real emergency yet,"" says Mr Lee, the village elder in charge of the shelter. ""If we need them, there are directions on the wall."" Does this lack of urgency suggest the threat of imminent war has been overblown? ""I am worried,"" he replies, ""just last week someone from the city came to check on us."" Many analysts, though, believe Pyongyang has its eye on prizes far bigger and further away than its southern border. The Defence Secretary, Sir Michael Fallon, used the BBC's Andrew Marr programme to highlight the fact that London was closer to Pyongyang than to Los Angeles. ""This involves us,"" he said, which is true - but perhaps more in a diplomatic sense than as a target. The entrance to a South Korean public shelter in the village closest to the North Korean border When I put his comments to South Korean journalist Jungeun Kim, she was taken aback. ""Does he understand what he's talking about? I can't remember a time when Kim Jong-un has threatened the UK. His argument is with America."" Of that, there is no doubt. In Itaewon, I asked a uniformed US solder, one of more than 20,000 stationed on the Korean peninsula, what he thought of the current threat. Did he feel safe? ""Yes I do, I've even brought my family here."" When I pushed him on US President Donald Trump's response to the crisis, his answer was brief, but damning. ""He's dealt with it like a chump."" It's not hard to find others who agree. But any disdain felt towards the president is of course as nothing compared with the reputation of his North Korean counterpart. And most here believe it will be the actions of the latter that will determine how this unedifying stand-off ultimately plays out. How real is assassination threat to Kim Jong-un? Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? How should Trump handle North Korea?

"Tanya Heath Paris shoes come with changeable heels ""Give a girl the right shoes and she can conquer the world,"" film star Marilyn Monroe once said. But what constitutes ""right"" for women nowadays? While high heels can make the wearer feel more confident, they aren't comfortable for long-term wearing. This means that many women carry around a spare pair of flats with them. But what if one pair of shoes could do both jobs? Two small shoemaking firms, one in France and one in Germany, think they have the solution - women's shoes that come with interchangeable heels. In her office in Ottawa, Canada, Olga Streltchenko is not just known as a top financial risk manager. The 46-year-old also has a reputation for her shoes with removable heels. ""I am not very tall, so I like to be on high heels at work to enhance my presence,"" Mrs Streltchenko says. ""But I like to switch to lower, more comfortable heels to go home. And if I plan on going out after work, I take a pair of metallic heels with me, which are more playful."" The shoes, by Tanya Heath Paris, allow women to change their style from professional to casual, fancy to comfortable, high to low, simply by switching their heels. Tanya Heath, pictured, came up with the idea after moving to Paris Designer Tanya Heath came up with the idea for her shoes after moving to Paris in 1996. The Canadian, who spent years working for firms in the telecoms and energy sectors, was tired of having to change her shoes every time she arrived or left the office. ""I would arrive in ballerina pumps and change into heels, and my French colleagues ridiculed me,"" she says. ""They called me 'la New Yorkaise', because of the perception that New Yorkers wore trainers with suits while walking to work."" In 2009, with no experience in the fashion industry, Ms Heath finally began to develop the idea - all while juggling her responsibilities as a mother-of-three. The biggest challenge was to make shoes that were comfortable and stylish, she says. Since the 1980s, several firms had developed footwear with removable heels but none had been successful. ""Some of the other attempts out there were either awful-looking or worse, and they didn't really work, with the heels falling off,"" Mrs Heath says. Mime et moi's shoes come with a variety of heels Backed by a team of designers and engineers, she came up with a ""pick and choose concept"". First women buy the shoes, sandals, pumps or boots, then they buy the heels of their choice. Prices range from 290 euros (Â£260) for a pair of pumps, to 700 euros for a pair of leather boots. Customers can choose between 400 different heels, which cost between 25 and 100 euros each. Ms Heath says her first few years in business were tough, with no sales and little outside investment. But the firm has since shipped to 72 countries and opened boutiques in France, Portugal and Canada. ""We get girls coming into the stores who are clearly still in school, and we have women shopping for shoes to wear to their daughter's wedding,"" Mrs Heath says. The healthy sales at Tanya Heath Paris comes as the issue of whether women should wear high heels to work continues to spark controversy. In April of this year, the Canadian province of British Columbiabannedcompanies from being able to force women to wear high heels, while that same month the UK governmentrejected a petitioncalling for a similar ban in Britain. Women in British Columbia can no longer be forced to wear high heels to work Hannah Rochell, founder of fashion blogEnBrogue.com,external, which promotes flat shoes, says: ""While some women love to wear high heels, many would much rather opt for the comfort of flats, particularly when they're working in a business environment."" She adds that employers who enforce heels-only dress codes not only denigrate women, but are also ""completely out of touch"". For firms that make shoes with removable heels, their products merely offer women choice. Take Mime et moi, which was founded by four men from Munich, Germany. After a night out together, they noticed that their partners had all gone home barefoot because their feet were sore from wearing high heels. One of the men, a student of mechanical engineering and construction, then set about finding a solution. ""We immediately thought it was something that was absolutely missing,"" says Tim Haas, 31, one of the firm's co-founders. Mime et moi ""We wanted to create a shoe for women that looked amazing, sexy and feminine, but which had a comfort function."" They set up Mime et moi in 2013, and sold their first shoe three years later. The firm's removable heels range from 3cm tall to 11cm, and cost between 175 and 205 euros.

Turning the dead into vinyl records How Sicilian oranges are being made into clothes Elvis still earning a fortune 40 years after his death While some firms are focusing on removable heels, Californian Dolly Singh claims she has instead used engineering prowess to invent comfortable high heel shoes. In 2013 she gave up her job as head of talent acquisition at SpaceX, the rocket company led by tech billionaire Elon Musk, to pursue a personal project - creating shoes that don't make your feet sore. Ms Singh put together a team of experts from fashion, architecture, medicine and engineering, including specialists who worked for SpaceX and Nasa, the US space agency. Dolly Singh gave up a job at SpaceX to create her shoes She then launched her own business, Thesis Couture, and began selling the shoes that they had created. ""I ripped apart a pair of high heels to find out what was causing my feet to hurt so much,"" says Ms Singh. ""Inside each heel was a metal shank, which had no give, and was clearly not foot friendly."" The problem, she says, is that high heels are badly engineered. Ms Singh says her soles ""more intuitively"" map the shape of the foot ""The way heels are currently designed causes 80% of one's body weight to be on the balls of the feet and also causes the toes to curve slightly inward. ""What we did was shift that back to 60% by re-engineering the structure and designing our own shank, which is made of a strong-but-flexible polymer."" Thesis Couture sells its footwear online and now ships to most countries. Mrs Singh managed to raise more than $1.5m (Â£1.1m) in investment, in 2015 and anticipates sales of $1m in 2017.

"It is the corruption probe that has left politicians around the world looking over their shoulders. Prosecutors in a dozen countries are untangling a massive web of corruption that ran across a continent and further afield. Illegal payments may have sloshed through presidential campaigns, boosted the careers of political top brass in country after country, and oiled the wheels of worldwide construction projects including motorways, gas pipelines and hydroelectric dams. If you have never heard of a company called Odebrecht, you probably do not live in Latin America. It is a Brazilian construction giant behind venues for the 2016 Olympics, infrastructure for the 2014 World Cup and the metro system in Caracas, plus dams and airport terminals further afield. But anti-corruption investigators caught up with the company, and it admitted paying bribes in more than half of the countries in Latin America, as well as in Angola and Mozambique in Africa. Odebrecht played a game of quid pro quo: I will help you pay for your election campaign if you make sure I get that building contract. In country after country, it is alleged that Odebrecht employees made connections with those in power and those who looked like they would be getting into power soon. They did not restrict themselves to those of any particular political hue. Almost a third of Brazil's government ministers who served under former president, Michel Temer, have faced investigation,including his foreign minister and chief of staff. The predecessor of current far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who was arrested and released in a separate corruption case last month, isfacing investigationin relation to Odebrecht. He denied all allegations of corruption and accused the country's judiciary of heeding rumours and destroying reputations. The vice-president ofEcuador,Jorge Glas, became the highest-ranking government official to be convicted in the scandal when he was sentenced in December 2017 to six years in jail. Prosecutors said he took $13.5m (Â£10.2m) in bribes from Odebrecht. One of the biggest corporate corruption cases in history Who's who and what's what in corruption probe Colombiacharged a former vice-minister for transport and a former senator. The man who ran the election campaign of the former president,Juan Manuel Santos, has alleged it was financed with irregular Odebrecht payments. Mr Santos, who is a Nobel Peace Prize winner, said he did not authorise any payments or know about them. Colombia's President Santos, left, who negotiated a peace deal ending 60 years of conflict with Farc rebels, has denied authorising Odebrecht to pay for his presidential campaign Next door inVenezuela, former chief prosecutor Luisa Ortega has fled the country after being sacked. She alleges that President NicolÃ¡s Maduro is implicated and that a top court is blocking an investigation. Odebrecht hasdenied her other allegation,external- that they paid $100m (Â£76.5m) to the socialist party's vice-president, Diosdado Cabello. Venezuela has taken unfinished projects away from Odebrecht and blocked the company's bank accounts. InPeru, four ex-presidents have been placed under investigation. Ollanta Humala and his wife Nadine Herediaare are facing potentially lengthy prison sentences for allegedly receiving payments to fund his presidential campaigns in 2006 and 2011. Alan GarcÃ­a, who served as president from 1985 to 1990 and again from 2006 to 2011, killed himself with a bullet to the head on April 17 as police came to arrest him over claims he took bribes from Odebrecht. Former President Alejandro Toledo, accused of taking $20m in bribes, is thought to be living in the US and the Peruvian government has put up a $30,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. Staying with Peru, opposition leader Keiko Fujimori has come under preliminary investigation. The attorney general says a note found on Marcelo Odebrecht's mobile phone implicates her. She denied receiving money from the company. Keiko Fujimori, who ran for president last year in Peru, denies accusations she took Odebrecht bribery Panamacharged 17 people including government officials, and charged Odebrecht $59m in compensation. A lawyer from Mossack Fonseca - the firm at the centre of thePanama Papersleak - accused President Juan Carlos Varela of receiving Odebrecht donations. Mr Varela denies all wrongdoing. Mexicosummoned a former director of state oil company Pemex and other employees to give evidence over alleged Odebrecht bribes, while theDominican Republicasked Odebrecht for $184m compensation over the next eight years. Chilestarted an investigation and seized documents from the Odebrecht offices, while the firm agreed to pay Guatemala $17.9m in compensation for bribes paid to an official for public work, the attorney general's office said in January. And Brazilian newspaper O Globoreports,external(in Portuguese) that 29 countries, including Sweden, the US, France and the UK asked Brazil for help with their own Odebrecht investigations. Ecuador's vice-president Jorge Glas is serving a six-year term after he was convicted of taking $13.5m (Â£10.2m) in bribes from the firm. Former CEO Marcelo Odebrechtstarted a 19-year jail termin 2016 after being convicted of paying more than $30m (Â£21m) in bribes to officials in Brazil's state oil company in exchange for contracts and influence. Brazil's Supreme Court released a video last year showing Marcelo Odebrecht testifying More than 70 other Odebrecht executives were jailed but have agreed to plea deals, that is they agreed to provide information in exchange for more lenient sentences. Some are already out of jail and serving their sentences at home. The epicentre of the operation had a much more run-of-the-mill name, the Division of Structured Operations, but it was essentially the bribery department. Employees spent their time bribing government officials and political parties at home and abroad, to win business. The companyhas admitted this,externalto US, Brazilian and Swiss prosecutors. Money went through as many as four bank accounts in countries with good banking secrecy laws before getting to a recipient, usually an intermediary to someone with political power. When the department's employees wanted to communicate, they used a system unconnected to the main computer systems, to avoid detection. ""Dracula"" was the nickname given to Senator Humberto Costa And they gave their recipients flippant codenames: Dracula, Sauerkraut, Decrepit, Totally Ugly. One politician, whose wife was 40 years younger than him, got the codename Viagra. Protesters have hit the streets over the Odebrecht case in country after country, and the chain of events has brought corruption to the top of news agendas and prosecutors' agendas. They are ""clamouring for justice"", political analyst Geovanny Vicente Romero told the BBC ""Protesters are demanding people be held responsible for the negligence and corruption that are part and parcel of the historic inequalities in many of the region's countries,"" he said. ""Overall, people hope that the Odebrecht case will set a precedent so that these situations can be avoided in the future."" This protester in the Dominican Republic held a sign calling for corrupt people to go to jail The value of Odebrecht bonds was sliced. The downturn in construction that went alongside this contributed to a downturn in the Brazilian economy and the credit ratings agency Standard and Poor's cut the company to the lowest grading. It has recovered somewhat but is still far from excellent. The investigations have even contributed to economic downturn in Brazil, and Peru shaved almost a point off its growth forecasts for 2017, which the government blamed on ""the Odebrecht effect"". The company's website makes no mention of the scandal, but notes that ""sweeping and profound changes in its transformation process"" were undertaken in 2018, including the replacement of practically the entire Board of Directors to bring ""greater diversity."" And there have been two CEOs since Marcelo Odebrecht was jailed - but tellingly, neither has had the surname Odebrecht. Correction 26 September 2017: This article has been amended to remove a reference to Gaston Browne, the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda.

"Ellen Page played the title role in the 2007 comedy Ten years on from the release of Juno, film fans reckon they've spotted its influence reaching far beyond the box office. The movie, about a teenage girl falling pregnant unexpectedly, was something of a surprise hit in 2007 after it received a standing ovation at its Toronto Film Festival premiere. It went on to take $231m (Â£175m) globally on a $7m (Â£5.3m) budget and notched up four Oscar nominations, winning one for best original screenplay. But now some have noticed a potential link between the film's release and the number of teen pregnancies in the US. The birth rate among girls aged between 15 and 19 is at an all-time low, having fallen sharply since 2007, according to the latest governmentstatistics,external. Onecomment,externalposted on social media pointing out the correlation between the drop and the release of Juno received more than 28,000 retweets. ""I felt [the film's impact] in aspects when we were making it,"" says actress Ellen Page, who played the title role. Allison Janney and JK Simmons played Juno's stepmother and father ""At that time, a lead teenage girl in a movie even getting to dress like that felt a feat, when I was like 'I'm wearing this flannel'."" ""So I think in terms of that character itself, I felt it could potentially have an impact because it did feel like something new."" The film sees Juno decide to give birth when she can't go through with an abortion. She then puts the baby up for adoption. ""You hope the film resonates, and even though Juno does approach it with a lot of optimism and generosity, she obviously has a difficult time and difficult emotional experience, which manages to break through all the defence mechanisms,"" Page told the BBC. ""It explores abortion, we have a scene in an abortion clinic, and there's some conversation about that as well, so I hope it allowed to present all the choices and the impact of what that means.""

"A sheriff has granted a warrant to allow the sale of a boat which has been detained at Aberdeen harbour for more than a year because workers have not been paid. The Malaviya Seven was detained in June last year under merchant shipping regulations, and again in October. The International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) believes the crew are now owed more than Â£600,000 in total. Wages will be paid from the proceeds of the offshore vessel's sale at auction. Malaviya Seven was detained in June last year Aberdeen Sheriff Court heard there has already been interest in the vessel, which will be advertised for sale around the world. The ITF union expects the sale to cover the unpaid wages of the Indian crew. The court heard Aberdeen Harbour Board is owed money, and will request first right to any excess funds after the crew is paid. The court previously ruled the shipshould be valuedfor sale.

Three female former employees of Google have filed a lawsuit accusing the Alphabet-owned company of discriminating against women in pay and promotions. The proposed class action lawsuit filed in California state court in San Francisco comes as Google faces a sex bias investigation by the US Department of Labor. The three women - a former software engineer, a former communications specialist and a former manager - claim Google pays women in California less than men who perform similar work, and assigns female workers jobs that are less likely to lead to promotions. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The world economy, stunted by years of austerity and growing inequality, needs a
global ""New Deal"", inspired by policies that helped Europe rebound after
World War II, the UN said. ""The
world economy remains unbalanced in ways that are not only exclusionary, but also destabilising and
dangerous for the political, social and environmental health of the planet,""
said the UN development agency, UNCTAD. ""What is
urgently needed now is a global new deal,"" the agency said in its Trade and Development Report. The original
New Deal, launched in the United States in the 1930s in response to the Great Depression, was
replicated at an international level with the Marshall Plan, which is widely credited
with helping Western Europe make a spectacular recovery after World War II. ""Seven
decades later, an equally ambitious effort is needed to tackle the inequities of hyperglobalisation in order to
build inclusive and sustainable economies,"" UNCTAD said. As with the
previous plans, the report argued that the world, at both national and international levels, should be
focusing on job creation, the expansion of taxes to enable redistribution
of wealth and regulation aimed at taming finance. Business presenter Susannah Streeter tweets: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The tax authority said a single operation for carrying out border and tax checks could cost the taxpayer up to Â£800m as it warned that 5,000 extra staff may be needed to cope with Brexit. HM Revenue and Customs told MPs it is looking into creating a Singapore-style system that could make trade simpler for businesses by allowing them to get their tax and border assessments done in one place. Chief executive Jon Thompson said he is investigating the ""business case"" and had hired the team that delivered the Singapore project, but said the Treasury would have to stump up between Â£500m and Â£800m to get it off the ground. He told the Treasury Select Committee it was ""conceptionally possible"" for the Government to bring together 26 different organisations into a ""single window"" where businesses could do their border checks in one go. However, Mr Thompson added: ""We need to be transparent with you - that is a mega project. You need to be thinking about that as a project that costs somewhere between Â£500m to Â£800m. It would take five to seven years to implement. We have been asked to look at whether there is a business case for that because there would be a noticeable change to GDP in my opinion. It would make it much smoother to import and export if you only had to go to one place instead of multiple different Government departments.""

The governor of the Bank of England links the fall in the value of sterling to Brexit and says he wants inflation to be 2%. More from Mark Carney: ""We've all seen that prices are going up in the shops and that's been the result, entirely the result of the fall in the value of sterling which is due to, due to Brexit,"" he said. ""And what the Bank's been doing since the referendum has been looking to balance support for the economy as the economy adjusts to the prospect of Brexit, support for the economy with our ultimate objective, which is to bring inflation back to that 2% target, to make sure that the value of these notes and other notes stay stable."" The FTSE 100 has had a bad day, falling 1.1% to 7,298 points. Many of its companies make most of their earnings abroad and the jump in sterling today means a strong pound dampens  profits when they are converted into sterling. The day's big winner was Next, which jumped 13% after raising guidance for the full year. Morrisons slipped 5.1%, making the supermarket the biggest faller. Mark Carney has given a television interview following the Monetary Policy Committee's hints about a rate rise later this year in which he said: The majority of members of the (Monetary Policy) Committee, myself included, see that that balancing act is beginning to shift, and that in order to ... return inflation to that 2% target in a sustainable manner, there may need to be some adjustment of interest rates in the coming months. Now, we will take that decision based on the data. I guess that possibility has definitely increased.""  MPs are raising new concerns about working practices at Sports Direct after receiving claims from a whistleblower that couriers are being underpaid. Two select committees have written to the retailer's boss, Mike Ashley, saying they have been told Sports Direct and courier Hermes are underpaying workers for some deliveries. The Work and Pensions and Business select committees said they understood the delivery company pays two rates: one for a packet and another for heavier parcels.
 The whistleblower claimed there was a practice of sending larger, heavier goods as packets so the courier only gets paid the lower rate. Frank Field, chairman of the Work and Pensions committee, said: ""If this complaint stands up, it represents a new low in actually deliberately underpaying workers for the work they do."" Rachel Reeves, who chairs the Business committee, said: ""This appears to be a stitch-up between Hermes and Sports Direct to short-change low paid couriers in order to boost company profits.""

"Leave campaigner Sir James Dyson expects the UK to leave the EU with no deal, and trade to default to World Trade Organization rules and tariffs. Sir James, who founded the engineering firm Dyson, told the BBC such an arrangement would ""hurt the Europeans more than the British"". However, former Bank of England chief Lord King said he was ""not impressed"" with preparations for failed talks. It is ""very important"" the UK has a fall-back position, he said. ""I don't think the negotiations are going in the way that we might hope,"" he told the BBC's Newsnight programme. ""I think you need a separate team that is responsible for ensuring that if negotiations do break down...   then we are capable of saying if you don't want an agreement, we are capable of leaving and trading with you under, for example, WTO terms. It's not a first preference, but we can do it."" Sir James told the BBC's Today programme that Dyson, which became famous through its innovative vacuum cleaners, already pays the WTO tariff into Europe ""and it hasn't hurt us at all - we're one of the fastest growing companies in Europe"". He said UK business did not need a transitional period to separate from the European single market, saying he thought the term ""single market"" was ""quite wrong"". Brexit: All you need to know Brexit: 'UK will soon regret leaving EU' Ringo Starr says 'Get on with Brexit' ""It's a series of different markets with different languages, with different marketing required and different laws.... it's actually a very highly complex and broken up market,"" he said. This video can not be played Sir James Dyson says Britain will likely trade under WTO rules post-Brexit on Radio 4's Today programme Sir James added that ""business is about uncertainty"". ""There's always uncertainty in business, about exchange rates, conditions in markets, natural disasters... ""I think uncertainty is an opportunity, and the opportunity here is actually that the rest of the world is growing at a far greater rate than Europe, so the opportunity is to export to the rest of the world and to capitalise on that,"" he said. However, the chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, Sir Charlie Mayfield, told the Today programme that the pound and business confidence had been hit by the Brexit vote. ""We should be under no illusions, Brexit is having an effect on the economy, no question. It's the same for everybody, and the main effects are sterling and confidence. ""Uncertainty is one of the consequences of this, and of course businesses never like uncertainty, because it makes it hard to plan for the future. He called for ""a serious parliamentary debate, to figure out what kind of Brexit we're going to have in the best interests of the country and the economy."" Sir James' comments came as 33 undergraduates began studying at the Dyson Institute of Engineering and Technology. The student engineers have begun a four-year degree, during which they will be mentored by Dyson's  scientists and engineers who will teach alongside academics from Warwick University. Universities Minister Jo Johnson challenged Sir James 18 months ago to help train engineers in the UK. Sir James said: ""It is a great opportunity, and I think a great step forward in the way that higher education is provided. ""We're paying these people, they're getting about 40 days a year more academic time than you'd get at university, plus the fact that they're working with some of the best scientists and engineers in the world.""

"This video can not be played Trump 'fairly close' on Daca deal with Democrats US President Donald Trump has said he is ""fairly close"" to a bipartisan deal to protect young undocumented migrants known as Dreamers. Mr Trump told journalists at the White House that any agreement must include ""massive border security"". The president said funding for his proposed border wall on the US border with Mexico was not part of the pact. Mr Trump spoke a day after talks with top Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer at the White House. The president's right-wing supporters are infuriated. Only last week Mr Trump stunned fellow Republicans by making a budget deal with the Democrats. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme allows some 800,000 people to remain in the US, and provides temporary permits for work and study. The Obama-era scheme was put in place to protect so-called ""Dreamers"" - migrants who entered the US illegally as children - from deportation. What next for 'Dreamers'? Flip flops mock Trump contradictory tweets Only last week Mr Trump announced he would cancel the programme. He said he was giving Congress six months to enact a replacement plan for Daca recipients. Welcome to another episode of Deal or No Deal, White House edition. Unlike the classic game show, however, Donald Trump appears to be playing against himself. In a series of tweets, the president denied he had struck an immigration/border security agreement with Democratic congressional leaders, then effectively endorsed the same terms they set out in a press release Wednesday night. When speaking to reporters, he even echoed Democratic justifications for why undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children should be given normalised residency status. This comes as a shock to some of Trump's diehard anti-immigration supporters, who view any Daca-like agreement as amnesty for law-breakers. Congressional Republicans, who were working on their own deal with Democrats, are in a daze as well. There is the possibility that this could be a Nixon-in-China moment for the president, where only a man who campaigned vociferously against undocumented immigrants could agree to give legal residency to hundreds of thousands of them. Unlike Nixon's China diplomacy, however, Mr Trump will need congressional Republicans to go along with his deal. Many voted against his earlier agreement to raise the debt limit and avoid a government shutdown. This could be an even heavier lift. Decoding Trump's Daca dalliances Heading to Florida on Thursday morning to view the damage from Hurricane Irma, Mr Trump told journalists: ""We're working on a plan subject to getting massive border control, we are working on a plan for Daca. People want to see that happen."" He added: ""So we met last night with, as you know, with Schumer, Pelosi and a whole group and I think we're fairly close but we have to get massive border security."" The president said the congressional Republican leadership was ""on board"" with the plan. This video can not be played 'America is the only country I've known' ""The wall is going to be built,"" he added. ""It will be funded a little bit later."" Democrats have repeatedly vowed to block any legislation that includes funding for the border wall - a key campaign pledge by Mr Trump. After arriving in Florida, Mr Trump denied that he would back a path to citizenship for Dreamers. ""We're not looking at amnesty,"" he said. During the presidential campaign, in August 2015, Mr Trumpsaid in a TV interview,externalthat Dreamers ""have to go"". But on Thursday, he voiced support for the young immigrants in language that echoed former President Barack Obama. ""Does anybody really want to throw out good, educated and accomplished young people who have jobs, some serving in the military? Really!"" Mr Trump tweeted. This video can not be played The US president said he had ""great love"" for Daca Dreamers Paul Ryan, the top Republican in Congress, said Mr Trump's meeting with Democrats ""was a discussion not an agreement or a negotiation"". Ms Pelosi told reporters no deal had been finalised with the president. But she added: ""We had an agreement to move forward in our view, with a Dream Act as the basis for how we protect the Dreamers, and for further discussions on what provisions relating to the border might be and an accompanying bill or whatever as we go forward."" Democrats failed to get Daca on to the statute books during the Obama administration, so it would be a political coup to succeed in doing so when Republicans control the White House and Congress.

The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme was created in 2012 by then-President Barack Obama to shield children of undocumented immigrants from deportation. It also provided work and study permits for those it covered - popularly known as ""Dreamers"". In order to qualify for Daca, applicants under the age of 30 were required to submit personal information to the Department of Homeland Security, including addresses and phone numbers. They had to pass an FBI background check, have a clean criminal background, and either be in school, recently graduated or have been honourably discharged from the military. In exchange, the US government agreed to ""defer"" any action on their immigration status for a period of two years. The majority of Dreamers are from Mexico and other Latin American countries. The Department of Justice has said no new Daca applications will be taken. This video can not be played Where do America's undocumented immigrants live? US immigrants: Where are they?

"This video can not be played How FC Cologne fans (briefly) took over London Thousands of German football fans brought parts of central London to a standstill ahead of their team's Europa League match against Arsenal. Some 20,000 FC Cologne fans have come to London, and briefly brought the West End traffic to a halt as they marched down Oxford Street. The game was delayed by an hour, whichArsenal said was ""in the interests of crowd safety"". Police said they were dealing with disorder at the Emirates Stadium. More than a dozen police officers wearing helmets could be seen entering the ground as the game kicked off and riot police could be seen sitting outside the stadium. It is the first time in 25 years Cologne has played in an international club competition. The Metropolitan Police said in a statement: ""Officers are dealing with disorder at the Emirates Stadium where fans have gathered for the Arsenal v FC Cologne match. ""A policing plan is in place for the game and additional officers have been deployed."" Earlier, police said flares were let off and bottles thrown but reported no ""significant disorder"". The Bundesliga estimatedaround 20,000 fans had travelled to the capital,externalto support their team. It added only 2,900 tickets had been allocated to the away fans for the match. Earlier, the Met said: ""At around 15:00 BST on Thursday, 14 September a large group of football fans gathered in Oxford Street. ""The group was at the location for about 30 minutes whilst they boarded public transport to travel to a football match this evening. ""They did throw bottles and let off flares, but there was no significant disorder, police were on scene and there have been no arrests."" FC Cologne fans flood London.

"Aeroflot flight attendant Evgenia Magurina saw her income drop when she did not meet the airline's dress size requirement For Aeroflot it was an attempt at an image makeover that went wrong. When Russia's national airline decided to link the pay of its flight attendants to their dress size, Evgenia Magurina was outraged. ""I was in shock at first. It didn't make sense. How could they cut pay, because of your size?"" the stewardess recalls at her Moscow flat, close to the airport. ""They said the 'success' of a stewardess depends on her size, and that really offended me,"" she says, pointing out that she had seven years' experience at the airline. Aeroflot strenuously denies discrimination. But its approach seems particularly odd in Russia, 100 years after a revolution which prided itself on promoting equality. Last year, cabin crew at the airline were measured and photographed. Evgenia Magurina says she was told she had ""big cheeks and a big bust"" and should wear a sports bra. Then in October she noticed that her bonus pay had been docked. She had also been removed from more lucrative, long-haul flights. More from Sarah Rainsford: Russia and the art of 'kompromat' Domestic abuse: Why Russia believes the first time is not a crime Fidel, Russia and rekindled Cold War memories When she confronted her bosses she was told she didn't meet the size limit Aeroflot had set for its cabin crew: a Russian size 48, about a UK 14 or US 12. Evgenia Magurina says hundreds of other flight attendants suffered the same treatment, dubbing themselves the STS club after the Russian words for old, fat and ugly. Instead of long trips to New York, they joked that they had been relegated to night flights around the Russian city of Nizhny Novgorod, ""so no-one will see us"". Facing a cut of some 30% in her pay, Evgenia Magurina decided to sue. ""They put appearance in first place. But stewardesses are rescuers above all,"" she insists. ""Imagine if they had the same requirements for judges or doctors? It would be absurd."" Amid the throng of demands that drove the Russian revolution in 1917 was women's suffrage - here women march with a banner reading ""voting rights for women"" Russian women got the vote in 1917; abortion was legalised soon after. And in a hugely symbolic move, the USSR sent the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova into space. But years on, flight attendants aren't the only women facing discrimination here. In the central Russian city of Samara, Svetlana Medvedeva has been barred from a job captaining a boat. In 2012, she was hired as a boat pilot and mechanic but the offer was withdrawn when the firm's HR department intervened. It realised it could not employ her because she was female. In fact, 456 professions are off limits for women in Russia, labelled as dangerous or supposedly harmful to their reproductive health. That includes driving a train, fighting fires or working as a carpenter. ""I'd understand if they were really worried about pregnant women, but they don't even consider whether a woman is pregnant, or plans to be,"" Svetlana Medvedeva points out on a small motor boat on the wide, choppy river Volga. As we talk, a long, low passenger ferry sails past - the boat she was barred from working on. Svetlana Medvedeva has been disputing that decision through the courts ever since. Russia's ban on women working in 456 professions is an example of patriarchy in action, Svetlana Medvedeva thinks ""Russia is a patriarchal country. Any movement on women's rights is backwards,"" she argues. ""This list of professions speaks for itself."" Introduced in 1974, the list was confirmed in 2000 and allows exceptions only if an employer can prove they have made conditions safe - specifically for women. In practice, few want the hassle or cost of proving that. ""I don't know a single [piece of] research that supports this idea of protecting women by forbidding professions. I don't think this is the reason,"" says historian Irina Roldugina from the Higher School of Economics. She points out that the list came just as a new generation of post-Soviet women were finding their independent feet. ""Women started to see themselves as fully fledged citizens, and this was seen as a problem,"" Irina Roldugina argues. In February 2016, the UN's anti-discrimination body ruled that Svetlana Medvedeva had been denied work unfairly on the basis of her gender. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) says Russia has a ""moral obligation"" to implement its recommendation to revise the jobs list, but admits that is not legally binding. The Supreme Court did order Svetlana Medvedeva's case re-opened though and this week a judge in Samara is expected to reach a verdict. Meanwhile back in Moscow, Evgenia Magurina has already had her day in court. Aeroflot's lawyers attempted to defend the cut in her bonus pay by arguing that every extra kilo of weight cost the airline more in fuel. They also claimed their policy was based on narrow plane corridors and its crews' health, not purely their appearance. But the judge declared the airline's pay policy illegal, leaving Evgenia Magurina hugging her friends and lawyers in tears of disbelief. ""I hope this means women will be braver in fighting for their rights,"" she said, recalling one friend who made herself sick starving herself to reach the airline's size limit. ""They thought everyone would put up with it. But it offended us,"" she says. ""Now justice has prevailed.""

"In the immediate aftermath of the fire at Grenfell Tower, Prime Minister Theresa May said that every person made homeless would receive an offer of accommodation within three weeks. The government quickly clarified that this meant temporary accommodation, not a permanent new home. Three months on, however, only three out of 196 households who needed rehoming have moved into permanent accommodation offered by the council. A further four are in the process of making their temporary accommodation permanent. The 196 households include people who lived in Grenfell Tower and also those who live nearby whose homes were made uninhabitable by the fire. The Grenfell Fire Response Team says it has made offers of permanent housing to 38 households, 22 of which have been accepted, but not all have yet moved in. It says it has 105 homes available to be moved into immediately, and is looking to buy more. The team is operating a points-based system to prioritise who gets housing first. Reality Check: Did the government keep its Grenfell rehousing promise? Grenfell fire chief calls for sprinklers in tower blocks A number of organisations have stepped in to offer free advice All residents made homeless by the fire have automatically been given enough points to put them ahead of everyone else on the housing list in the Kensington and Chelsea borough. After that, first priority is being given to the bereaved. Then, other things will be taken into account, such as proximity to children's schools, a need to be on the ground floor due to a disability, and so on. Those with the most points will get first pick of the available housing stock. How the council will choose who gets housing if there is only one suitable unit and more than one family with the same number of points is not clear. Survivors currently living in temporary houses or flats provided by the council can choose to go through a legal process to stay in them permanently. Four households have asked to do this. The fire prompted an anti-government protest in June The response team said it did not want to make anyone move out of hotel rooms before they were ready - even after households have accepted offers of permanent accommodation, they can remain in a hotel room while they move across. A spokesman for the team said the process would move at a pace that suited the residents. Some survivors want to remain in the borough, but others want to move out of the area. The response team says it is working with other councils in the area and further afield to make sure that they recognise the priority of Grenfell residents, and will try to accommodate them in the borough of their request where possible. There is no formal system of transferring points across boroughs when it comes to housing, so this is being done on an ad hoc basis.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Apple's event in two minutes Apple has explained why its new facial recognition feature failed to unlock a handset at an on-stage demo at the iPhone X's launch on Tuesday. The company blamed the Face ID glitch on a lockout mechanism triggered by staff members moving the device ahead of its unveil.Yahoo News was first to report the details,external. Apple's software chief dealt with the hiccup by moving on to a back-up device, which worked as intended. But the hitch was widely reported. ""People were handling the device for [the] stage demo ahead of time and didn't realise Face ID was trying to authenticate their face,"" an unnamed company representativeis quoted as saying,externalby Yahoo's David Pogue. ""After failing a number of times, because they weren't Craig [Federighi], the iPhone did what it was designed to do, which was to require his passcode."" This video can not be played Craig Federighi's demo of the new feature did not go as planned Apple later confirmed to the BBC that the quote was real. At its launch event, the company had earlier described Face ID as being ""effortless"" to use and more accurate than its fingerprint-based Touch ID system. The older authentication system is not available on the new premium handset because it lacks a fingerprint sensor. So, despite the fact the incident lasted only about 10 seconds, out of a near two hour long presentation, it still has the potential to undermine confidence in the company's claims. Apple reveals 'leap forward' iPhone X New iPhone X: the internet reacts Hands on with the $999 iPhone Apple's augmented reality ambitions Apple has confirmed elsewhere that Face ID is disabled afterjust two unsuccessful attempts,external, unlike Touch ID, which requires a passcode to be manually typed in only after five failed tries. Earlier theories of what had gone wrong included Mr Federighi's stage make-up interfering with the system, as he was seen to wipe his face before making his second attempt, and that the phone had been recently rebooted triggering the need for a typed code. Other issues concerning the new facial recognition system have also been raised, including whether it might make it easier for the authorities or thieves to force a user to unlock their handset and whether it will handle the hijab worn by some Muslim women, among other facewear. The iPhone X is not due to go on sale until November, and journalists at the launch at the company's Cupertino, California headquarters were shown Face ID working in controlled circumstances. On Wednesday, the Democrat senator Al Franken published a letter he had sent to Apple seeking more information. ""Substantial questions remain about how Face ID will impact iPhone users' privacy and security, and whether the technology will perform equally well on different groups of people,"" he wrote. ""To offer clarity to the millions of Americans who use your products, I ask that you provide more information on how the company has processed these issues internally, as well as any additional steps that it intends to take to protect its users."" Update 18 September 2017: Apple has updated itsFace ID developer notes,externalto state that the system will be disabled after five failed authentication attempts rather than two, as previously stated.

"An Israeli company called Colu has launched a local digital currency in Liverpool, which aims to revitalise the local economy by cutting out the banks. Will it achieve more than paper local currencies have? To find out, Dougal Shaw followed the money trail. Large chains like Starbucks, Costa or McDonald's, need not apply. This new digital currency, known both as Colu and Local Pound Liverpool, is only open to locally owned and run businesses. The idea is to encourage people to support the local economy. Local currencies are common around the world - there are more than 10 in the UK. The idea behind them is that if you spend your money with a locally based company instead of a big chain, more of that money will continue to circulate locally. It won't be sucked out of your community into a company's foreign headquarters, or be paid out to shareholders. But these currencies rarely attract enough users to have a real economic impact. Could Colu be different? As well as being purely digital - running on a smartphone app - it is operated by a well-funded tech company that specialises in cryptocurrencies. In many other cases, local currencies are run by a small resource-starved team of enthusiasts and volunteers. I went to see who is actually using this new currency, from a man buying his weekly sausages to the assistant mayor of Liverpool. Foodie Ian Rasmussen is one of 17,000 Liverpudlians who have signed up to use Colu. I meet him at a deli called Delifonseca, where he is buying some sausages. ""I believe in local businesses, so I like to promote what they are doing through my consumption. One makes ethical decisions every day in the shops and I choose to buy locally because they tend to be more particular about where they get their food from. They tend to be better employers and re-invest in the community."" The app is easy to use, he says, which is one of the things that makes it appealing. But local currencies appeal to Ian for another reason. ""Since the financial crash of 2008, businesses have completely fallen out of love with the banking system and realised how ruinous it can be. It's nice if local businesses can get round the inconvenience of banks that don't understand them."" When Ian pays for his sausages at the till, the transaction is made purely through the app, with no bank involved. Ian has to buy his Colu pounds with normal UK pounds from his bank account. They are worth exactly the same. At the moment, a complimentary Â£5 is offered to new joiners and 10% is added every time money is paid in. This is funded by Colu, in a bid to get more people like Ian to join. Colu has a lot of venture capital behind it and investors are keen to see it grab market share, like Uber or Deliveroo. Candice Fonseca runs the deli where Ian purchased his sausages. It is one of more than 100 businesses accepting the local digital currency. ""Liverpool has a very strong sense of identity and in this globalised time people are more conscious of their localities,"" she says. ""We have customers who don't carry wallets, it's inevitable that currency will become phone-based. ""It's also cheaper for us. Customers can't really get their head around how much we pay for banking. Even to put cash into the bank as a business, we have to pay. The idea [with Colu] is to keep the money flowing locally. We'd like to give staff the option of taking Colu as part of their wages eventually."" Normally businesses pay a charge every time a customer uses a debit card (about 0.5-1%) or credit card (about 1-2%). A transaction in Colu incurs zero charge for the business. However, whenever anyone converts Colu back to normal UK pounds - cashing out, as it is known - they pay 1.5% commission. This is how Colu makes its money. ""If you pay another business [in Colu], then you don't pay anything, it's the cheapest way of taking money in that case. We're not cashing anything out. So we pay suppliers like Sugar & Lime, who we get our hire equipment from for outside catering, in Colu. We spend thousands with them."" More than a quarter of a million local pounds have circulated so far in Liverpool. But somebody needs to cash out at some stage and take the hit of 1.5%. One of them is Anthony O'Leary, who runs the catering equipment firm Sugar & Lime, which supplies Candice's deli. His warehouse contains supplies from around the world, which can't be bought with local currency. ""We cash out our local currency because we're the end of the line. There's nobody for us to spend the local pound with at present. ""But there is scope for products that we buy to be manufactured more locally, in which case we could continue the chain,"" he says. Although Anthony would prefer to be paid in cash, he says it's not a clear-cut decision. ""I've still got banking charges one way or another. Cash is expensive, credit card fees, it's all at a cost."" Colu also brings him new customers, he says, so in that sense it's a good investment. Anthony can also see another way for him to pass on the Colu currency and avoid the 1.5% charge - he could pay business rates in the local currency. This is what happens in Brixton and Bristol. But first the council has to agree to it. Gary Millar is assistant mayor of Liverpool and a technology enthusiast. He is a user of the app and a fan of local digital currencies in general. ""A council like Liverpool could use this to ensure money stays local. We know when people spend money locally with an independent, 65p in the pound stays local. If they spend it with a big global organisation, it will be about 30p instead,"" he says. ""I think it's wonderful if a small business can pay its business rates using a digital currency - I'd love that to happen."" He says this would only be a logical extension of what is happening at the moment, and hints that discussions are taking place about the possibility of allowing business rates, planning fees and even parking fine to be paid in the new currency. Millar says he could also imagine the council paying people with it, as long as this was done on an opt-in basis. The council pays some benefits on behalf of the government and of course it pays   wages to its workforce - these could in theory be paid in Colu. Millar is at pains to make clear that if such a payment system were adopted, Colu would have to take part in an open selection process. Duncan McCann is an economist with New Economics Foundation who researches local digital currencies. He thinks local digital currencies like Colu are a good idea, but he has some serious reservations. ""Local currencies seek to stop money escaping, the 'leaky bucket' argument we call it. They try to keep it circulating in your own community to do more good. ""Most local currency designs maximise the potential for the money to stick. There is some irony that this model that Colu is offering at its core extracts money to the mother company, which in this case is Colu [in Israel]."" Most other local currencies in the UK and Europe are run on a not-for-profit basis, he says. The incentives Colu offers to new joiners can only last so long, he suggests. ""The big danger is that if no profit is being made, or worse they start making a loss, that they will just cancel the app and all the hard work is lost in an instant. ""Then it becomes very hard to start another local currency because there is so much bad feeling."" Colu has been up and running in Liverpool since December. It also runs similar currencies in Tel Aviv and Haifa, both under two years old. It is free of the financial overheads that come with a paper currency and its deep pockets allow it to provide incentives to users, at least for now, and to employ someone to recruit new businesses into the scheme. Its backers think it can mount a challenge to global capitalism and multinational corporations. Its fate depends on how many people vote with their digital wallets.

"The attack has been claimed by so-called Islamic State At least 60 people have been killed in two attacks in southern Iraq, police and health officials say. A suicide bomber detonated a vest and gunmen opened fire inside a restaurant near Nasiriya, capital of Dhiqar province, security sources said. Soon afterwards, a car bomb exploded at a nearby checkpoint. So-called Islamic State said it carried out the attacks. Shia Muslim pilgrims including Iranians were killed by the suspected militants. According to news agency AFP, one report said the attackers were disguised as members of Hashd al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation) - a mainly Shia group that has fought alongside Iraqi forces against IS. The attackers struck at midday local time (09:00 GMT) in stolen army vehicles. ""One attacker blew up his suicide vest inside the crowded restaurant while a group of other gunmen started to throw grenades and fire at diners,"" said police colonel Ali Abdul Hussain, quoted by Reuters. At least seven Iranians were among the dead, health officials said, adding that more than 90 people were injured. Some of the injured are in a serious condition Unconfirmed reports said police officers had died in the checkpoint attack, but the total number of dead from that incident is not known. Afterwards, rescuers cleared away burned bodies, vehicles and twisted scraps of metal from corrugated shelters. IS are enduring defeat after defeat on front lines in both Iraq and Syria, but they remain capable of launching devastating assaults on soft targets, says BBC Middle East editor Alan Johnston. It is still believed to have hundreds of followers prepared to carry out attacks. However, such attacks are relatively rare in southern Iraq, and Dhiqar province has previously been spared some of the worst of Iraq's violence. The area targeted is on a main road frequented by Shia pilgrims and visitors from Iran on their way to the holy cities of Najaf and Karbala to the north.

"Archaeologists believe the car had been dismantled for repair by a local soldier, and then seemingly abandoned The remains of a MG roadster have been unearthed by archaeologists excavating a former military site. The 1932 MG J2 was found within a World War Two artillery position during excavations at Larkhill on Salisbury Plain. It is believed to be a pool car used by troops training in the 1960s which was dumped in a disused weapons pit. Damien Campbell-Bell, of Wessex Archaeology, described the find as ""a real surprise"". ""This particular MG J2 is pretty rare and was one of only 2,083 of this model ever made,"" he said. ""We can tell from the tyre pattern the car was probably in use until the early 1960s, at which point it seems to have been placed in the artillery position."" Mr Campbell-Bell said he thinks the car had been dismantled for repair by a local soldier, but was then seemingly abandoned. When the car was new in 1932, it had a top speed of 65 mph and would have cost about Â£199 The Larkhill site is one of a number of areas on Salisbury Plain which will see troops re-accommodated in the UK from Germany under theArmy Basing Programme,external. Environmental consultancy WYG has been employed by the Defence Infrastructure Organisation to survey the development site as part of the planning process. WYG archaeologist Martin Brown said: ""The MG is a particularly exciting find in that it shows the unrecorded side to life on an army camp. ""As a buried artefact it almost conforms to the urban myths of buried tanks, aircraft and equipment one hears about."" Archaeologists created a 3D model of the car to understand how it was left on the site Tank crushes illegal off-roader quad bike.

"This video can not be played The dormitory was gutted by the fire At least 23 students and teachers have died in a fire at a religious school in Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur. The fire at the Tahfiz Darul Quran Ittifaqiyah broke out in the early hours of Thursday morning. The victims are thought to been trapped in their dormitory as the windows were barred with metal grilles. ""It is one of the country's worst fire disasters in the past 20 years,"" Khirudin Drahman, director of the fire and rescue department, told AFP. Initial counts put the death toll at 25, but police later revised that down by two. Police said the dead were 21 students - all boys between the age of 13 and 17 - and two staff members. Ten people were taken to hospital, and four are thought to have serious injuries. Relatives of the victims arrived in the morning The blaze was reported at around 05:40 local time on Thursday morning (21:40 GMT Wednesday). According to the police it began in the sleeping quarters. In Islamic tahfiz schools - where children study the Koran - students often live at the school. Images and videos circulating online showed the entire upper room of the school ablaze. ""Based on our initial investigations, the position the victims were found in indicated that they tried to escape through the windows but were stopped due to the fixed grilles on the windows,"" fire and rescue department operations deputy director Soiman Jahid said. He said police were still investigating what caused the fire but that it likely was caused by short circuit or a lit mosquito repellent coil. Local media report,externalthe school could have been operating against government regulations, because its fire safety permit application was allegedly still pending. Malaysia's urban wellbeing and housing minister said there had been 29 fire incidents at tahfiz schools in the country since 2015. Malaysian authorities have raised concerns about safety measures at unregulated private religious schools. Earlier this year an 11-year-old schoolboydied in hospitalafter reportedly being beaten by a warden at a religious school. Picture from inside the school showed charred beds and scorched windows on the top floor A neighbour living next door to the school told the Reuters news agency they heard screams and saw the flames. ""The children were crying for help, but I couldn't help them as the door was already on fire,"" he said. One window appears not to have had metal bars, Reuters said, citing a 15-year-old student who described having seen eight children escaping through it and climbing down a water pipe. Kuala Lumpur Police chief Amar Singh said the bodies were ""totally burned"". ""Unfortunately there was only one entrance, so they could not escape. All the bodies were found lumped on one another."" Police chief Amar Singh said the victims probably suffocated due to the smoke Officials said fire engines were at the site within minutes, and the blaze was put out within an hour. Prime Minister Najib Razak tweeted his sympathies to those affected while a government minister said the incident should be quickly investigated ""so that we will be able to prevent future disasters"".

"The attack has been claimed by so-called Islamic State At least 60 people have been killed in two attacks in southern Iraq, police and health officials say. A suicide bomber detonated a vest and gunmen opened fire inside a restaurant near Nasiriya, capital of Dhiqar province, security sources said. Soon afterwards, a car bomb exploded at a nearby checkpoint. So-called Islamic State said it carried out the attacks. Shia Muslim pilgrims including Iranians were killed by the suspected militants. According to news agency AFP, one report said the attackers were disguised as members of Hashd al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation) - a mainly Shia group that has fought alongside Iraqi forces against IS. The attackers struck at midday local time (09:00 GMT) in stolen army vehicles. ""One attacker blew up his suicide vest inside the crowded restaurant while a group of other gunmen started to throw grenades and fire at diners,"" said police colonel Ali Abdul Hussain, quoted by Reuters. At least seven Iranians were among the dead, health officials said, adding that more than 90 people were injured. Some of the injured are in a serious condition Unconfirmed reports said police officers had died in the checkpoint attack, but the total number of dead from that incident is not known. Afterwards, rescuers cleared away burned bodies, vehicles and twisted scraps of metal from corrugated shelters. IS are enduring defeat after defeat on front lines in both Iraq and Syria, but they remain capable of launching devastating assaults on soft targets, says BBC Middle East editor Alan Johnston. It is still believed to have hundreds of followers prepared to carry out attacks. However, such attacks are relatively rare in southern Iraq, and Dhiqar province has previously been spared some of the worst of Iraq's violence. The area targeted is on a main road frequented by Shia pilgrims and visitors from Iran on their way to the holy cities of Najaf and Karbala to the north.

"Is South Korea planning to assassinate Kim Jong-un? Reports that South Korea, in the wake of North Korea's dramatic 3 September test of a massive thermonuclear bomb, has approved plans to establish a special forces unit to assassinate Kim Jong-un appear to signal a sharp change of direction in the foreign policy of South Korea's President Moon Jae-in. Why would a progressive politician elected in May on a platform of engagement with the North and who, just a few months ago in Berlin in July, talked confidently of establishing a ""permanent peace regime"" on the peninsula, of avoiding the ""collapse"" of North Korea and ""easing its security and economic concerns"", suddenly shift gears and appear to embrace aggressive regime change? Seoul's leaders are terrified by the apparent failure of military deterrence, and the inability of Donald Trump, through his confident ""fire and fury"" rhetoric, to stop Pyongyang from pressing ahead rapidly with its aggressive military modernisation campaign. More missile tests are a certainty and in the last day there have been reports of new activity at the North's nuclear testing facility at Punggye-ri that suggest a seventh nuclear test may be being prepared. The world should expect more missile and nuclear tests from North Korea Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? What do we know about N Korea's nuclear site? If the North finally and unambiguously becomes able accurately to deliver a long-range missile, armed with a powerful, miniaturised nuclear warhead, at an urban target in the continental United States, US planners will have, albeit reluctantly, to accept the need for military action on the Korean peninsula. As Republican Senator Lindsay Graham has pointed out on a number of occasions (ostensibly channelling the thinking of Donald Trump), the US will have to risk exposing Seoul to massive civilian and military casualties in order to prevent the North from putting a US city in its strategic cross-hairs. Only by scaring Mr Kim into believing his life may be in imminent danger can Seoul hope to offset this risk by persuading the North to pause its tests and engage in constructive dialogue. But is the threat of decapitation a credible one and would it deter the North? In the past, the North's leaders have taken seriously the risk of being targeted. In March 1993, for example, at a time of heightened US-North Korea tensions, Kim Jong-il, the father of Kim Jong-un, spent most of the month in a secure bunker, committed to a ""semi-war"" status while announcing the country's withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). Would threatening Mr Kim undermine support for his regime among Pyongyang's elite? Fear of US escalation pushed Mr Kim into hiding but did not prevent the North from continuing to respond belligerently by violating international norms and abrogating past agreements. The North also has a long history of creative adaptation in the face of foreign pressure. Fear of potential targeted strikes has encouraged a paranoid North Korean leadership, both past and present, to use dummy decoy vehicles and heavily circumscribed public appearances to minimise the risk of being caught in a surprise attack. Just a few months ago in May, North Korea accused the US of instigating a CIA-coordinated plot to bribe a North Korean citizen to carry out a biochemical attack on Kim Jong-un. It is impossible to corroborate these North Korean claims, which may amount simply to a propaganda gambit designed to deflect attention away from the North's own assassination plots, most notably the dramatic killing of Kim Jong-nam, Kim Jong-un's elder brother, apparently killed in February in Malaysia by North Korean operatives using a lethal VX nerve agent. How should Trump handle North Korea? How do you defend against North Korea? Given the fears and precautions of the North's leaders, a South Korean directed ""hit"" on Mr Kim would be highly risky and could easily degenerate into a Bay of Pigs scenario, comparable to the Kennedy administration's embarrassing failure to topple Cuba's Fidel Castro in 1961. The South needs, therefore, to be especially cautious. A botched assassination attempt could easily provoke retaliation from the North in the form of limited military action that might in turn rapidly escalate unintentionally to a full-blown nuclear exchange. Kim Jong-un took over as leader after his father's death in December 2011 Policy makers in Seoul may be hoping to effect change indirectly. By threatening Mr Kim directly, they may calculate that this will undermine support for the regime amongst political elites in Pyongyang who might be persuaded to launch a coup against the feared and brutal young leader. Recent high-level North Korean defector testimony suggests this scenario is highly unlikely. As much as North Korean elites fear and resent Mr Kim, they are just as troubled by the threat to their security of rival groups within their own society. North Korea remains a highly stratified and class-conscious society. The have-nots and those historically discriminated against in the North would, in the event of the removal of the leadership, rise up and seek retribution against the hyper privileged and favoured residents of Pyongyang. Fear of being caught up in a destructive and bloody counter-revolution is likely to be sufficient to stay the hand of, or at least give pause to, anyone minded to take the perilous step of plotting against the leadership. Decapitation then seems a high-risk strategy with a low chance of succeeding. Its value at this point is more declaratory than substantive. The Moon administration may also hope that it may deflect increasingly vocal South Korean conservative demands for the country to acquire its own indigenous nuclear capabilities to offset the growing North Korean threat. Notwithstanding recent positive remarks by the South Korean defence minister supporting the possible reintroduction of tactical nuclear weapons to the South, the government remains opposed to such a step, in part because it fears that this would spark a damaging and destabilising arms race in the region and further escalate tensions with the North, while increasing the risk of conflict arising through misperception and miscalculation. Seoul is worried about a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula Ultimately, President Moon wishes to revisit the possibility of dialogue and engagement with the North, reaffirming in the process the constructive, diplomacy-centred approach of former Presidents Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun. To do this, he needs time to delay both the North's military modernisation campaign and the related tendency for Washington to see its policy options increasingly constrained and narrowed to the point at which the use of military force becomes the least unappealing among a number of distinctly unattractive options. In an environment where there remain no good policy choices for dealing with the North Korean challenge, threatening decapitation may appear to be a viable card to play in an increasingly dangerous game of strategic poker.

"Profits at the John Lewis Partnership have more than halved after the retailer was hit by reorganisation costs and the impact of the weaker pound following the Brexit vote. The partnership said profits in the six months to 29 July fell 53.3% to Â£26.6m. John Lewis said the fall in the pound had pushed up its costs, hitting profit margins. It added that inflationary pressures, driven by exchange rates and political uncertainty, had hit customer demand. John Lewis Partnership chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield told the BBC: ""We should be under no illusions, Brexit is having an effect on the economy, no question. It's the same for everybody, and the main effects are sterling and confidence. ""Uncertainty is one of the consequences of this, and of course businesses never like uncertainty, because it makes it hard to plan for the future."" John Lewis was also hit by a one-off Â£56.4m charge, mainly for restructuring and redundancy costs. Profits at the department store business rose by 10%. However, Waitrose saw profits fall 18% as the supermarket chain was faced with higher costs, ""very few"" of which were passed on to shoppers, it said. ""Look, nobody should be surprised that this is a tough market for retailers. There's any number of reasons for that,"" Sir Charlie said. ""The reason our profits are down is predominantly because of margin, and cost prices are rising. It's a very competitive market, retail prices are not rising as fast."" Has the UK got enough coffee shops? Next shares surge on brighter outlook Morrisons reports rising sales and profits However, the retailer can afford to continue to absorb costs ""for a while"", Sir Charlie said, because of the group's healthy cash reserves. He also said that money spent on reorganising the business, which ate into profits, was an important investment. This video can not be played John Lewis boss says uncertainty over Brexit is damaging the economy on Radio 4's Today programme ""We haven't... hunkered down in a difficult market. Instead what we've done is we've pressed on with some really important changes that are going to make the business fit for the future,"" he said. ""While it's been a difficult first-half, our sales have still been up, our profits are down, but we've made some really important progress for the future,"" Sir Charlie added. Tom Berry, a retail analyst at GlobalData, expects profits to continue to fall this year due to squeezed profit margins and plans for large-scale investment. ""Waitrose must continue to invest in prices to remain affordable for a sufficient number of consumers,"" he said. But he said the reorganisation of the business should bear fruit, particularly the plan to remove managerial rather than face-to-face staff.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Apple's event in two minutes Apple has explained why its new facial recognition feature failed to unlock a handset at an on-stage demo at the iPhone X's launch on Tuesday. The company blamed the Face ID glitch on a lockout mechanism triggered by staff members moving the device ahead of its unveil.Yahoo News was first to report the details,external. Apple's software chief dealt with the hiccup by moving on to a back-up device, which worked as intended. But the hitch was widely reported. ""People were handling the device for [the] stage demo ahead of time and didn't realise Face ID was trying to authenticate their face,"" an unnamed company representativeis quoted as saying,externalby Yahoo's David Pogue. ""After failing a number of times, because they weren't Craig [Federighi], the iPhone did what it was designed to do, which was to require his passcode."" This video can not be played Craig Federighi's demo of the new feature did not go as planned Apple later confirmed to the BBC that the quote was real. At its launch event, the company had earlier described Face ID as being ""effortless"" to use and more accurate than its fingerprint-based Touch ID system. The older authentication system is not available on the new premium handset because it lacks a fingerprint sensor. So, despite the fact the incident lasted only about 10 seconds, out of a near two hour long presentation, it still has the potential to undermine confidence in the company's claims. Apple reveals 'leap forward' iPhone X New iPhone X: the internet reacts Hands on with the $999 iPhone Apple's augmented reality ambitions Apple has confirmed elsewhere that Face ID is disabled afterjust two unsuccessful attempts,external, unlike Touch ID, which requires a passcode to be manually typed in only after five failed tries. Earlier theories of what had gone wrong included Mr Federighi's stage make-up interfering with the system, as he was seen to wipe his face before making his second attempt, and that the phone had been recently rebooted triggering the need for a typed code. Other issues concerning the new facial recognition system have also been raised, including whether it might make it easier for the authorities or thieves to force a user to unlock their handset and whether it will handle the hijab worn by some Muslim women, among other facewear. The iPhone X is not due to go on sale until November, and journalists at the launch at the company's Cupertino, California headquarters were shown Face ID working in controlled circumstances. On Wednesday, the Democrat senator Al Franken published a letter he had sent to Apple seeking more information. ""Substantial questions remain about how Face ID will impact iPhone users' privacy and security, and whether the technology will perform equally well on different groups of people,"" he wrote. ""To offer clarity to the millions of Americans who use your products, I ask that you provide more information on how the company has processed these issues internally, as well as any additional steps that it intends to take to protect its users."" Update 18 September 2017: Apple has updated itsFace ID developer notes,externalto state that the system will be disabled after five failed authentication attempts rather than two, as previously stated.

"This video can not be played Trump 'fairly close' on Daca deal with Democrats US President Donald Trump has said he is ""fairly close"" to a bipartisan deal to protect young undocumented migrants known as Dreamers. Mr Trump told journalists at the White House that any agreement must include ""massive border security"". The president said funding for his proposed border wall on the US border with Mexico was not part of the pact. Mr Trump spoke a day after talks with top Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer at the White House. The president's right-wing supporters are infuriated. Only last week Mr Trump stunned fellow Republicans by making a budget deal with the Democrats. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme allows some 800,000 people to remain in the US, and provides temporary permits for work and study. The Obama-era scheme was put in place to protect so-called ""Dreamers"" - migrants who entered the US illegally as children - from deportation. What next for 'Dreamers'? Flip flops mock Trump contradictory tweets Only last week Mr Trump announced he would cancel the programme. He said he was giving Congress six months to enact a replacement plan for Daca recipients. Welcome to another episode of Deal or No Deal, White House edition. Unlike the classic game show, however, Donald Trump appears to be playing against himself. In a series of tweets, the president denied he had struck an immigration/border security agreement with Democratic congressional leaders, then effectively endorsed the same terms they set out in a press release Wednesday night. When speaking to reporters, he even echoed Democratic justifications for why undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children should be given normalised residency status. This comes as a shock to some of Trump's diehard anti-immigration supporters, who view any Daca-like agreement as amnesty for law-breakers. Congressional Republicans, who were working on their own deal with Democrats, are in a daze as well. There is the possibility that this could be a Nixon-in-China moment for the president, where only a man who campaigned vociferously against undocumented immigrants could agree to give legal residency to hundreds of thousands of them. Unlike Nixon's China diplomacy, however, Mr Trump will need congressional Republicans to go along with his deal. Many voted against his earlier agreement to raise the debt limit and avoid a government shutdown. This could be an even heavier lift. Decoding Trump's Daca dalliances Heading to Florida on Thursday morning to view the damage from Hurricane Irma, Mr Trump told journalists: ""We're working on a plan subject to getting massive border control, we are working on a plan for Daca. People want to see that happen."" He added: ""So we met last night with, as you know, with Schumer, Pelosi and a whole group and I think we're fairly close but we have to get massive border security."" The president said the congressional Republican leadership was ""on board"" with the plan. This video can not be played 'America is the only country I've known' ""The wall is going to be built,"" he added. ""It will be funded a little bit later."" Democrats have repeatedly vowed to block any legislation that includes funding for the border wall - a key campaign pledge by Mr Trump. After arriving in Florida, Mr Trump denied that he would back a path to citizenship for Dreamers. ""We're not looking at amnesty,"" he said. During the presidential campaign, in August 2015, Mr Trumpsaid in a TV interview,externalthat Dreamers ""have to go"". But on Thursday, he voiced support for the young immigrants in language that echoed former President Barack Obama. ""Does anybody really want to throw out good, educated and accomplished young people who have jobs, some serving in the military? Really!"" Mr Trump tweeted. This video can not be played The US president said he had ""great love"" for Daca Dreamers Paul Ryan, the top Republican in Congress, said Mr Trump's meeting with Democrats ""was a discussion not an agreement or a negotiation"". Ms Pelosi told reporters no deal had been finalised with the president. But she added: ""We had an agreement to move forward in our view, with a Dream Act as the basis for how we protect the Dreamers, and for further discussions on what provisions relating to the border might be and an accompanying bill or whatever as we go forward."" Democrats failed to get Daca on to the statute books during the Obama administration, so it would be a political coup to succeed in doing so when Republicans control the White House and Congress. Mr Trump's ultraconservative supporters are now upset. Congressman Steve King of Iowa tweeted at the president that, if the latest reports are true, ""Trump base is blown up, destroyed, irreparable, and disillusioned beyond repair. No promise is credible."" One of Mr Trump's earliest backers, media commentator Ann Coulter, tweeted: ""At this point, who DOESN'T want Trump impeached?"" Breitbart, the website run by Mr Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon, ran the headline, ""Amnesty Don"" and accused the president of ""a full-fledged cave"". Fox News host Sean Hannity tweeted that ""weak Republicans have betrayed voters,external"" and pushed Mr Trump ""into arms of political suicide,external"". The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme was created in 2012 by then-President Barack Obama to shield children of undocumented immigrants from deportation. It also provided work and study permits for those it covered - popularly known as ""Dreamers"". In order to qualify for Daca, applicants under the age of 30 were required to submit personal information to the Department of Homeland Security, including addresses and phone numbers. They had to pass an FBI background check, have a clean criminal background, and either be in school, recently graduated or have been honourably discharged from the military. In exchange, the US government agreed to ""defer"" any action on their immigration status for a period of two years. The majority of Dreamers are from Mexico and other Latin American countries. The Department of Justice has said no new Daca applications will be taken. This video can not be played Where do America's undocumented immigrants live? US immigrants: Where are they?

"Sharon White said the results would concern the whole industry Broadcasters are failing to represent society, with a lack of diversity among staff, Ofcom has warned. The broadcasting watchdog says women, ethnic minority groups and disabled people are all under-represented. Its chief executive Sharon White said many of the ""shocking"" results will ""concern the whole industry"". Ofcom's report looked at how the TV industry - focusing on the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Sky and Channel 5 owners Viacom - can improve. White said the report ""paints a worrying picture, with many broadcasters failing properly to monitor the make-up of their employees"". She added that ""too many people from minority groups struggle to get into television"", which ""creates a cultural disconnection between the people who make programmes, and the many millions who watch them"". The report found that across the five main broadcasters, women accounted for 48% of the total workforce - compared with 51% across the general population - and held 39% of senior roles. Ofcom also said those from a black, Asian or minority ethnic background made up 12% of workers, and disabled people just 3%, despite accounting for 14% and 18% of the general population respectively. Among workers aged over 50, there are 50% more men than women, while Ofcom said many older people, especially women, think they are represented negatively on screen. Ofcom's research found that lots of people feel there are not enough programmes on TV that ""authentically portray their lives and communities"". Those from ethnic minority groups feel they are portrayed neutrally or negatively on TV, while half of disabled people feel under-represented, Sharon White said. Ofcom said a ""step-change across industry"" is needed and that broadcasters need to regularly measure and monitor the make-up of their workforces, set clear diversity targets, and that ""diversity transformation should be led from the top"". Evans and Winkleman are the BBC's highest paid male and female stars It said the BBC should be ""leading the way"", but that ""its performance on most characteristics is behind that of Channel 4"", which had the most diverse workforce across most areas. The report comes after the BBC had to publish details of the pay of its top on-air talent, which showed that two-thirds of the stars earning more than Â£150,000 were male. Chris Evans topped the list with a salary of between Â£2.2m and Â£2.25m in 2016/2017, while Claudia Winkleman was the highest-paid female presenter, earning between Â£450,000 and Â£500,000. A BBC spokeswoman said: ""Ofcom's report uses old figures which don't show the recent progress we have made. ""Figures we've already published in 2017 show we have increased our representation across the board including in our female, LGBT, BAME and disability workforce. ""We've been clear about our commitment to leading the way on diversity and set the most stretching targets for 2020, because no one should be complacent about the challenge facing the whole industry."" By 2020, the BBC wants its employees to comprise 50% women, 8% disabled people, 8% lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people and 15% people from black, Asian and ethnic minority backgrounds. The report focuses on television, with a separate study on radio to come - although the BBC data does include radio as it provided it to Ofcom in a combined form. It comes as BBC chairman Sir David Clementi said, in a speech at the Royal Television Society convention in Cambridge, that the corporation was one of the most diverse workforces in the UK, and that its 2020 targets were among the most ambitious in the industry. He also said politicians needed to do more to defend journalists who were subject to abuse ""almost on a daily basis"", noting that such abuse was becoming ""increasingly explicit and aggressive"" - especially against female journalists. He added that ""much of it occurs online"" and that social media companies needed to do more. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"This video can not be played James Ward's sister April describes his release as ""bittersweet"" on BBC Radio 4's Today programme A man who has served 11 years in prison for what was a 10-month sentence is to be released, the Parole Board has said. James Ward was sentenced under Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP), after he set fire to his bed while in jail for actual bodily harm. The 33-year-old has mental health problems and has regularly self-harmed while serving his indefinite sentence. The Probation Service is working to find Mr Ward a hostel and mental health support in the coming weeks. Mr Ward's sister April said: ""We are over the moon, my dad can't stop grinning. ""My dad hasn't grinned for years. I can't stop crying or smiling. ""James is not a risk to the public, he's only ever been a risk to himself, and with the right support we can get him there."" Prisoner 'suicidal' 11 years into 10-month jail term Man 'trapped' in jail for 10 years 'I thought about ending my life' 'Get a grip' on IPP prisoners Ms Ward told Radio 4's Today programme she had yet to speak to her brother about his release and was unsure of whether he even knew that he was to be freed. ""He's got no hope. He will be very surprised of the release today because it's taken over 10 years for this result to happen."" Mr Ward, from Sutton-in-Ashfield, in Nottinghamshire, was serving a sentence in 2006 after getting into a fight with his father Bill. But unable to cope with prison life, he set fire to the mattress in his cell, leading a judge to give him an IPP, which has no release date. James' parents Christine and Bill Ward and his sister April have campaigned for his release Mr Ward, who has a low IQ, has regularly self-harmed while behind bars. He has also set light to his cell, barricaded himself in and has staged dirty protests. He wrote to BBC Radio 4's Today programme in 2016, and said: ""Prison is not fit to accommodate people like me with mental health problems. It's made me worse. How can I change in a place like this? I wake up every morning scared of what the day may hold."" The Parole Board has confirmed his release, but the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has not commented on the case. Ms Ward said she was ""very confident"" her brother will be able to get the help he needs once he is freed - including support from mental health services as well as the stability and love of his family. She added: ""I hope that IPP prisoners who are way over tariff can now also be released. I don't like to think about what would have happened if they'd decided against letting [James] out. He had given up."" The sentence was abolished in 2012, but more than 3,000 people in England and Wales are still serving IPPs. Previously an MoJ spokesperson said: ""We are determined to address the challenge of making sure all IPP prisoners have the support they need to show they are no longer a threat to public safety. ""This work is continuing to achieve results, with 576 IPP releases in 2016; the highest number of annual releases since the sentence became available in 2005.""

"""Miriam"" grew up in Sierra Leone and didn't go to school. As an adult, she struggled to read and write. When she was arrested for loitering, she misunderstood the offence and found herself in prison - but it was there that she had her first experience of the classroom. With some help, she has written the story of how she learned to read. ""How do you plead? Guilty or not guilty?"" ""What? I don't understand."" ""Are you guilty? Please answer."" ""Yes sir."" Over a year later, I was released from the Freetown Female Correctional Centre in Sierra Leone. Why was I there? Because I had no idea what the word guilty meant and there was nobody to translate for me. I am a 35-year-old mother of five, arrested in a neighbourhood raid after a serious theft. When we were all taken to court, I made a wrong plea due to my lack of education. When I began my sentence, I decided to take up the opportunity of the literacy classes provided twice-weekly for the female inmates. Like me, many of the other inmates were illiterate and had never been to school. After a couple of months, I no longer had to mark documents with a thumbprint because I had learned how to sign my own name. I loved these classes so much that the other women gave me the nickname ""School Girl"". Since my release from the correctional centre, I have built my own business which supports my family. Because of my new skills, I am now the chairperson of the local market-women, and am able to keep all the financial records in order. When I am not working in the market, I teach the children in my neighbourhood how to read and write using methods that I learned during my incarceration. My education certificate proves to people that I can read, write and do mathematics. It is one of my proudest achievements. I still needed assistance to write this story, but I know that what I want to tell you is what is written on the paper, which gives me a sense of control I never had before. BBC 100 Womennames 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year.

Find us onFacebook,external,Instagram,externalandTwitter,externaland use #100Women Inmates in the classroom with teachers Haja Gbla works as a teacher in the prison service, helping women to access education, through the charities EducAid and AdvocAid. Like Miriam, she missed out on normal schooling as a child, but the charity gave her the opportunity to go back to class and finish her studies. In the correctional centres, I have met so many women who have extraordinary tales of injustice to tell simply because of their lack of educational opportunity: those who have signed or thumb-printed documents they did not understand, those who have pleaded guilty having no idea what the words meant, those who have been imprisoned for breaking completely unreasonable micro-finance agreements they did not comprehend and so on. Running the literacy classes in prison gave me the opportunity to realise how fortunate those who do access education are and how completely disempowering it is to miss out on schooling. I have had many proud moments watching women transformed by realising that they too can handle a pen, find their own name on a list, calculate their business profits or expenses, or read and enjoy a book. It is especially exciting when the women are celebrated as they move up from one class to the next and they receive certificates and awards. Students in the prison are presented with certificates of achievement as they progress In my work both inside and outside of correctional centres, I am conscious of being a catalyst for women to find a way to realise their full potential. Education is a wonderful tool to open windows and opportunities and transform a woman's chances of controlling her own life. Just as my own access to education through EducAid made it possible for me to live up to my potential to be an agent for change, I want to help as many other young women as I can to join the army of women that are needed if we are to see justice and equality for women in Sierra Leone and elsewhere. Unfortunately, the current economic crisis in the aftermath of the recent Ebola epidemic has resulted in a vast reduction in the funding available to human rights organisations. Because of this, the literacy classes have been put on hold for the first time in 10 years. The ladies behind bars all want these classes to begin again, as they see them as an opportunity to improve their chances of a brighter future upon release.

"Almost 400,000 Rohingya refugees have entered Bangladesh since recent violence erupted in Myanmar You expect chaotic scenes at the beginning of a refugee crisis of the scale we are seeing here in south-eastern Bangladesh. But almost two-and-a-half weeks later, the beginnings of an organised response should have at least started to emerge. We are not seeing that here in Cox's Bazar, where many Rohingya fleeing Myanmar have ended up. The C-130 transport aircraft loaded with food and shelter have not been landing at the airport; you don't see aid trucks loaded with tents and water-purifying units lumbering along the busy roads. Indeed, one of the most shocking things among all the horror here is that fact many Rohingya say they have had no contact with any aid agencies or international aid bodies at all. Well-meaning Bangladeshis are doing what they can to help the newcomers Many say they have had details - their names and the villages they are from - taken at the border. After that, they have been on their own. Virtually all the squalid shelters you see in the vast makeshift cities that refugees are hacking out of the scrub in the low hills are built and paid for by the refugees themselves. A thriving new economy has grown up beside the roadside. Stalls sell freshly cut bamboo poles and flimsy black plastic sheets to the refugees. If you don't have money, you don't get anything. Beyond the official story in Myanmar How people in Yangon view the crisis Tens of thousands of people have been sleeping out in the open despite the monsoon rains. Food is in short supply. Huge crowds appear around the trucks from which well-meaning Bangladeshis throw food and clothes down into seething masses. I've seen children and old people being trampled in the chaos. That is not to say that nothing is being done. All the main aid agencies and international bodies are here. On the record they are diplomatic. They will admit that lots of people are not getting the help they need and will concede that the organisation of the relief effort could be better. But speak to them off the record and you get a different story. They say they are frustrated by the lack of co-ordination and the restrictions imposed by the Bangladeshi government on how they can operate. The latest huge exodus of Rohingya has left Bangladesh ""beyond saturation point"" Here an elderly Rohingya woman is comforted after the wooden boat they were travelling in crashed and tipped everyone out The most obvious example is the treatment of the United Nations' main refugee body, the UNHCR. According to a longstanding order, the UNHCR can only operate in two official refugee camps, Kutupalong and Nayapara. Both camps have been established for many years and were home to some 20,000 to 30,000 Rohingya who fled Myanmar in earlier waves of migration. The UN says that since this latest huge exodus of Rohingya began on 25 August, the population of the camps has reached 70,000 - ""beyond saturation point"". So all the rest of the 400,000 or so new refugees are outside the camps and - according to the Bangladeshi government's rules - the UNHCR cannot work with them. It is an extraordinary situation. Aid for the Rohingya is being sent from Indonesia (above) and other countries, but agencies say it is not getting through On Tuesday the UNHCR announced it was beginning a huge airlift of aid - two large cargo planes carrying family tents, blankets, jerrycans, sleeping mats and other essential items. It says it will be enough to meet the immediate needs of 25,000 refugees and that further flights are planned, bringing emergency aid for some 120,000 refugees in total. Yet, as things stand, the UNHCR has no authority to deliver these essential supplies to the people who need them. So why is the Bangladeshi government making it so hard for organisations like the UNHCR to do their job? The country faces an agonising dilemma. Many Bangladeshis know just how awful it is to be exiled. More than 10 million people fled the country during the bloody civil war in 1971, which led to the creation of the independent nation of Bangladesh from what had been East Pakistan. Why won't Aung San Suu Kyi act? What sparked the latest violence in Rakhine? Tales of horror from Myanmar It wants to help these fellow Muslims who have suffered such terrible persecution. But it also knows the refugees will be a huge burden for what is one of the poorest and most densely populated countries in the world. Many refugees say they have had no contact with any aid agencies or international aid bodies at all And do not forget that these are not the first Rohingya refugees who have sought shelter in Bangladesh. There were already 400,000 here, according to Bangladeshi government estimates. So while the government wants to offer help and support,as the Bangladeshi prime minister said on Tuesday, it does not want to make life too easy for the refugees for fear that more will be encouraged to cross over. The strategy carries risks - and not just for the refugees who suffer as a consequence. So far the world's opprobrium has been focused on Myanmar. But if the scenes of misery and despair we have been seeing from here continue, very soon it could be Bangladesh that finds itself at the sharp end of the world's disapproval.

"In the immediate aftermath of the fire at Grenfell Tower, Prime Minister Theresa May said that every person made homeless would receive an offer of accommodation within three weeks. The government quickly clarified that this meant temporary accommodation, not a permanent new home. Three months on, however, only three out of 196 households who needed rehoming have moved into permanent accommodation offered by the council. A further four are in the process of making their temporary accommodation permanent. The 196 households include people who lived in Grenfell Tower and also those who live nearby whose homes were made uninhabitable by the fire. The Grenfell Fire Response Team says it has made offers of permanent housing to 38 households, 22 of which have been accepted, but not all have yet moved in. It says it has 105 homes available to be moved into immediately, and is looking to buy more. The team is operating a points-based system to prioritise who gets housing first. Reality Check: Did the government keep its Grenfell rehousing promise? Grenfell fire chief calls for sprinklers in tower blocks A number of organisations have stepped in to offer free advice All residents made homeless by the fire have automatically been given enough points to put them ahead of everyone else on the housing list in the Kensington and Chelsea borough. After that, first priority is being given to the bereaved. Then, other things will be taken into account, such as proximity to children's schools, a need to be on the ground floor due to a disability, and so on. Those with the most points will get first pick of the available housing stock. How the council will choose who gets housing if there is only one suitable unit and more than one family with the same number of points is not clear. Survivors currently living in temporary houses or flats provided by the council can choose to go through a legal process to stay in them permanently. Four households have asked to do this. The fire prompted an anti-government protest in June The response team said it did not want to make anyone move out of hotel rooms before they were ready - even after households have accepted offers of permanent accommodation, they can remain in a hotel room while they move across. A spokesman for the team said the process would move at a pace that suited the residents. Some survivors want to remain in the borough, but others want to move out of the area. The response team says it is working with other councils in the area and further afield to make sure that they recognise the priority of Grenfell residents, and will try to accommodate them in the borough of their request where possible. There is no formal system of transferring points across boroughs when it comes to housing, so this is being done on an ad hoc basis.

"Shkreli (R) has frequently clashed with critics on social media A judge has ordered the jailing of ex-pharmaceutical chief executive Martin ""Pharma Bro"" Shkreli while he awaits sentencing for securities fraud. Judge Kiyo Matsumoto said a Facebook post in which Shkreli offered $5,000 for a strand of Hillary Clinton's hair showed he was a danger to the public. The former CEO, 34, had been free on $5m (Â£4m) bail since his 2015 arrest. Shkreli was branded ""the most hated man in America"" when his firm hiked the price of medication for Aids patients. In August 2017 he was found guilty of three counts of securities fraud by a New York City jury, which cleared him on five other counts. Shkreli was on trial in relation to a drug company he previously headed, Retrophin, and a hedge fund he managed. 'Pharma Bro' Martin Shkreli convicted of fraud Who is Martin Shkreli - 'the most hated man in America'? Martin Shkreli's trial shines light on US healthcare debate On Wednesday, Judge Matsumoto ruled that Shkreli's post on 4 September - made shortly before Mrs Clinton began a book tour - showed he posed a danger, rejecting arguments his words were protected by US free speech laws. Shkreli - who has clashed frequently with critics on social media - had argued that the since-deleted post amounted to satire, and had been a reference to DNA sequencing. ""This is a solicitation of assault in exchange for money,"" the judge said. ""That is not protected by the First Amendment."" Shkreli's lawyer Benjamin Brafman said: ""We are obviously disappointed. ""We believed that the court arrived at the wrong decision. But she's the judge, and right now we will have to live with this decision."" Shkreli, who is facing up to 20 years in prison following his fraud conviction last month, will now be placed in custody ahead of his sentencing hearing, which has been scheduled for January. Shkreli rocketed to notoriety in 2015 - and earned the nickname ""Pharma Bro"" - after raising the price of a lifesaving anti-parasite drug called Daraprim by 5,000% upon acquiring rights to the medication. Overnight, the price of the drug soared from $13.50 to $750 (Â£570) per dose.

"James Murdoch urged the government to give the deal the go-ahead The bid by 21st Century Fox to buy Sky will be referred to competition regulators in the ""coming days"", Culture Secretary Karen Bradley has confirmed. The deal is facing a much fuller examination than initially expected. It will be assessed ""on media plurality and genuine commitment to broadcasting standards grounds,"" Ms Bradley said. The Competition and Markets Authority will provide its response within 24 weeks of the referral. James Murdoch, chief executive of 21st Century Fox, urged the government to approve the deal. ""Remove the noise and get to the facts,"" he said, speaking to the Royal Television Society Convention in Cambridge. Giving it the go ahead would send a signal that the UK is ""open for business post-Brexit"", he said.  James Murdoch is also chairman of Sky which is currently 39% owned by 21st Century Fox. Culture Secretary Karen Bradley informed Parliament of her decision on Thursday The culture secretary had already indicated earlier this week that she was ""minded"" to ask the competition regulator to look at the deal on two counts: the level of influence it would give media companies controlled by the Murdoch family within the UK media landscape, and over 21st Century Fox's commitment to broadcasting standards. James Murdoch said: ""We owned 100% of [Sky] for many many years, there were no issues. When I was chief executive -  no issues. And when I was chairman - and I'm chairman again - no issues. So the record has to count for something."" Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said: ""I am glad that Karen Bradley has shown courage in the face of pressure from the Murdochs. ""This referral is completely justified on grounds both of plurality and broadcasting standards. ""It is now over to the Competition and Markets Authority to properly scrutinise this bid and stand up for a plural and independent media. Earlier this year, Ms Bradley said she hadreceived evidence,externalcasting doubt on Fox News's ""commitment to accuracy and fairness in broadcasting"" and supporting accusations of ""false reporting"" at the US channel. A series of damaging allegations of sexual harassment at the Fox News Channel have become another hurdle in the Murdoch-backed bid for full ownership of Sky. Last month, the media regulator,Ofcom, noted the,external""alleged behaviours amounting to significant corporate failures"" at Fox, but concluded that as they didn't take place in a broadcasting standards context they ""were not relevant to the decision over the takeover bid"". However, Ms Bradley said broadcasting standards and corporate governance questions would be included in the CMA's assessment of whether or not the deal should be approved, and if so, under what conditions. Several women have alleged they were harassed by former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes, who died in May this year. He was removed from his post following the allegations, but critics argue Fox had inadequate systems in place to deal with claims of this kind. The expanded agenda for the CMA referral has raised the prospect that the deal - the Murdochs' second attempt to acquire the rest of Sky - could fail. An initial bid in 2010 was abandoned in the wake of the phone hacking scandal. New governance systems were then introduced at Murdoch-owned media companies, and the broadcasting and film businesses were separated from Mr Murdoch's newspaper interests, which include the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times. Late last year, 21st Century Fox launched its new bid for Sky. On Tuesday, Ms Bradley gave both broadcasters involved in the Â£11.7bn deal 10 days in which to submit further arguments.

"Bank of England governor Mark Carney with the new note The new Â£10 note featuring novelist Jane Austen has entered circulation - marking a return of a woman in addition to the Queen on Bank of England notes. The launch comes after a four-month period when women, apart from the Queen, have not been represented on the Bank's notes. The last was the Â£5 note featuring reformer Elizabeth Fry which was replaced by a Winston Churchill fiver. The new Â£10 note is made of polymer and includes raised dots for blind people. It replaces the paper Â£10 note, with the portrait of naturalist Charles Darwin, which will still be accepted in the shops until Spring 2018. The exact date of withdrawal will be published three months in advance. Animal fat to stay in future banknotes Why Jane Austen is trending 200 years on ""Our banknotes serve as repositories of the country's collective memory, promoting awareness of the UK's glorious history and highlighting the contributions of its greatest citizens,"" said Bank of England governor Mark Carney. ""The new Â£10 note celebrates Jane Austen's work. Austen's novels have a universal appeal and speak as powerfully today as they did when they were first published,"" he said. Scottish banknotes can be issued by a number of banks. They will launch their new Â£10 notes into circulation in the coming weeks. The representation of women has continued on Scottish notes, with doctor and suffragist Elsie Inglis still the face of Clydesdale Bank's Â£50 note and writer Nan Shepherd on the RBS polymer Â£5 note. One billion polymer Jane Austen Â£10 notes have been printed and will be fed into general circulation over the coming weeks and months. The Bank said polymer, also used with the new fiver, was more durable and cleaner than paper notes. It has persevered with this, despite complaints from religious and vegan groups that the animal fat tallow is used in the production process. Following consultation, the Bank said in August that it would continue with the use of tallow in future banknotes - saying that it ""has not taken this decision lightly"". The Bank assessed whether palm oil or coconut oil should be used instead, but concluded that this might not be able to be sourced sustainably and changing production would also involve considerable extra costs to taxpayers. A see-through window featuring the Queen's portrait Winchester Cathedral shown in gold foil on the front of the note and silver on the back A quill at the side of the window which changes from purple to orange A hologram which contains the word ""Ten"" and changes to ""Pounds"" when the note is tilted A hologram of the coronation crown which appears 3D and multi-coloured when the note is tilted Micro-lettering beneath the Queen's portrait with tiny letters and numbers that are visible under a microscope A book-shaped copper foil patch which contains the letters JA The words ""Bank of England"" printed in intaglio (raised ink) along the top of the note On the front of the new note is the portrait of the Queen as well as Winchester Cathedral, Jane Austen's final resting place, in gold-coloured foil over a see-through window. In the top left corner, two clusters of bumps are on the plastic to allow blind and partially-sighted people to feel which note it is. This is the first time such a feature has been used on banknotes in the UK. It has been used before on Australian and Canadian banknotes. On the reverse of the note is Jane Austen's portrait with a quotation from her best known work, Pride and Prejudice, which says: ""I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading."" The line is from a character called Caroline Bingley who, in fact, has no interest in books and is merely trying to impress Mr Darcy, a potential suitor. This video can not be played Jane Austen ""would have been gobsmacked"" by the new Â£2 coin and Â£10 note says biographer One investment company has calculated that Â£10 from 1817 - when Jane Austen died - equates to roughly Â£786, in today's money. Ritu Vohora, investment director at M&G Investments, said: ""Jane Austen lived through the Napoleonic Wars, yet despite all the political upheaval - cash remained king."" A new polymer Â£20 featuring artist JMW Turner is due to be issued by the Bank of England in 2020, but there are no plans to replace the current Â£50 note, which was released in 2011.

"Relationships of longer than a year were a factor in women's lack of interest in sex Women are more than twice as likely as men to lack interest in sex when living with a partner, a study of British sexual attitudes suggests. It found that while men and women lost passion with age, women were often left cold by longer relationships. Overall, poor health and a lack of emotional closeness affected both men's and women's desire for sex. The findings are based on the experiences of nearly 5,000 men and 6,700 women, published inBMJ Open,external. The UK researchers said problems of sexual desire should be treated by looking at the whole person, rather than simply resorting to drugs. Join the debate on ourFacebook page,external. Relate sex therapist Ammanda Major said losing interest in sex wasn't necessarily abnormal, and there were many different reasons why men's and women's needs changed. ""For some, it is a natural and normal place to be, but for others it causes pain and misery,"" she said. In total, 15% of men and 34% of women surveyed said they had lost interest in sex for three months or more in the previous year. For men, this lack of interest was highest at the ages of 35-44 while for women it peaked between 55 and 64. But the researchers, from the University of Southampton and University College London, said there was no evidence that the menopause was a factor for women. However, they did find that having young children at home was a particular turn-off for women. Poor physical and mental health, poor communication and a lack of emotional connection during sex were the main reasons why men and women lost interest. Start talking about the issue early on rather than leaving it to fester - ignoring it can lead to other problems and make you feel resentful. If that doesn't work, confront the reason why you don't want to talk about it Explore other forms of intimacy such as holding hands, talking gently to each other, cuddling and stroking rather than full-on sex Feeling as if you are not being heard is a barrier to sex - so make your partner feel respected and important Get some additional support by going to see a sex therapist, relationship counsellor or your GP Relax - many relationships work very well when they are non-sexual, if it's an outcome that is reached jointly In theNational Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles in Britain,external, those who found it ""always easy to talk about sex"" with their partner were less likely to say they lacked interest. However, those whose partner had had sexual difficulties, and those who were less happy in their relationship, were more likely to say they had lost interest in sex at some stage, the researchers said. Among women, the study found that ""not sharing the same level of sexual interest with a partner, and not sharing the same sexual likes and dislikes"" were also a factor in loss of interest in sex. Is it him or me? Cynthia Graham, professor of sexual and reproductive health at the University of Southampton, said the findings increased understanding of what lay behind men and women's lack of interest in sex and how to treat it. ""This highlights the need to assess and - if necessary - treat sexual desire problems in a holistic and relationship-specific, as well as gender-specific way."" She added that this was a problem that could not be fixed by a pill alone. ""It is important to look beyond anti-depressants,"" Prof Graham said. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved the first-ever drug aimed at boosting female libido, called flibanserin. Ammanda Major said:  ""Sex is a very personal thing, and talking about it can be embarrassing.  But talking is often the best thing you can do to improve your sex life.""

"Profits at the John Lewis Partnership have more than halved after the retailer was hit by reorganisation costs and the impact of the weaker pound following the Brexit vote. The partnership said profits in the six months to 29 July fell 53.3% to Â£26.6m. John Lewis said the fall in the pound had pushed up its costs, hitting profit margins. It added that inflationary pressures, driven by exchange rates and political uncertainty, had hit customer demand. John Lewis Partnership chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield told the BBC: ""We should be under no illusions, Brexit is having an effect on the economy, no question. It's the same for everybody, and the main effects are sterling and confidence. ""Uncertainty is one of the consequences of this, and of course businesses never like uncertainty, because it makes it hard to plan for the future."" John Lewis was also hit by a one-off Â£56.4m charge, mainly for restructuring and redundancy costs. Profits at the department store business rose by 10%. However, Waitrose saw profits fall 18% as the supermarket chain was faced with higher costs, ""very few"" of which were passed on to shoppers, it said. ""Look, nobody should be surprised that this is a tough market for retailers. There's any number of reasons for that,"" Sir Charlie said. ""The reason our profits are down is predominantly because of margin, and cost prices are rising. It's a very competitive market, retail prices are not rising as fast."" Has the UK got enough coffee shops? Next shares surge on brighter outlook Morrisons reports rising sales and profits However, the retailer can afford to continue to absorb costs ""for a while"", Sir Charlie said, because of the group's healthy cash reserves. He also said that money spent on reorganising the business, which ate into profits, was an important investment. This video can not be played John Lewis boss says uncertainty over Brexit is damaging the economy on Radio 4's Today programme ""We haven't... hunkered down in a difficult market. Instead what we've done is we've pressed on with some really important changes that are going to make the business fit for the future,"" he said. ""While it's been a difficult first-half, our sales have still been up, our profits are down, but we've made some really important progress for the future,"" Sir Charlie added. Tom Berry, a retail analyst at GlobalData, expects profits to continue to fall this year due to squeezed profit margins and plans for large-scale investment. ""Waitrose must continue to invest in prices to remain affordable for a sufficient number of consumers,"" he said. But he said the reorganisation of the business should bear fruit, particularly the plan to remove managerial rather than face-to-face staff. ""The introduction of flexible team structures and responsibilities will allow the upmarket grocer to better attend to its affluent customer base that expects a high level of service.""

"DACA supporters at a protest rally in San Diego, California Top US Democrats say they have agreed to reach a deal with President Donald Trump to protect thousands of young undocumented migrants from deportation. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer said they also agreed to work on a border security package that would exclude Mr Trump's proposed wall with Mexico. However, the White House denied the wall had been excluded from proposals. Mr Trump scrapped the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme earlier this month. Trump: 'I have great love' for Daca Dreamers Trump: It's time for tax reform Trump earlier deal with the Dems: What was he thinking? The Obama-era Daca scheme was put in place to protect so-called ""Dreamers"" - migrants brought to the US illegally as children - from deportation.

"A protest held on Australia Day in January A third council in Melbourne has voted to scrap Australia Day celebrations out of respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Australia's national day on 26 January marks the anniversary of the arrival of Britain's First Fleet in 1788. Moreland City councillor Sue Bolton said the commemoration was ""like celebrating the Nazi Holocaust"", the Australian Associated Press reported. But others defended the day, which is backed by Australia's government. Assistant immigration minister Alex Hawke said the government ""strongly condemns comparisons of Australia Day with the Nazi Holocaust as deeply offensive to all Australians"". A majority of Moreland councillors voted to drop all references to Australia Day, although it will continue to hold citizenship ceremonies on 26 January. Ms Bolton said the date was ""grossly insensitive"". It follows decisions by Melbourne'sYarraand Darebin councils to also end celebrations on what many indigenous Australians refer to as ""Invasion Day"". This video can not be played Why is Australia Day controversial? TheAustralian Broadcasting Corp,externalreported that two Aboriginal leaders voiced opposing views at the council meeting. ""How dare you actually take away Australia Day. We are all Australians here... whether we be indigenous or non-indigenous,"" said Wurundjeri elder Ian Hunter. Dja Dja Wurrung elder Gary Murray said: ""Why would black people, Aboriginal people, celebrate a holocaust?"" Massacres of indigenous Australians mapped Calls to shift Australia Day have grown in recent years andspurred protests, but the government has repeatedly said a majority of Australians support keeping the date. ""An attack on Australia Day is a repudiation of the values the day celebrates: freedom, a fair go, mateship and diversity,"" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said last month.

Frank Vincent had a heart attack last week, TMZ reported. He was born in North Adams, Massachusetts and was introduced to show business at an early age by his father, an amateur actor.

"This video can not be played Archive: 'I admitted my mistake - now I'm back' Tennis star Maria Sharapova, who served a 15 month suspension for doping, has hit back at her critics, saying they ""don't have the facts"". The former world number one was suspended last year after she admitted taking the banned substance meldonium. She has been widely criticised. Fellow player Eugenie Bouchard said she should not have been allowed to return. But in a BBC interview, Sharapova denied cheating and said she had put the scandal behind her. Maria Sharapova: The story behind her downfall Is Maria Sharapova still a box office draw for sponsors? What is meldonium & will its use be widespread? In April,Bouchard had said: ""She's a cheater and I don't think a cheater in any sport should be allowed to play again."" But Sharapova told the BBC: ""I think those are comments not based on facts, and therefore I don't take them into consideration."" The Russian player, who has just released her memoir Unstoppable, My Life So Far, also took aim at Andy Murray. The British player has previously said he finds it strange that there is a prescription drug - meldonium - used to treat a heart condition commonly shared by many athletes at the top of their sport. Sharapova said: ""I don't think it's for them to really have an opinion, because they don't have the facts. So, you know, I think that those are the types of words that make headlines and they will be used as headlines. ""But ultimately, this is my career, and I faced it head on, and I admitted my mistake, and I went about it and I served my suspension and now I'm back."" Maria Sharapova said there was ""no proof"" of meldonium's performance-enhancing effects She admitted making ""a big mistake"" by taking the drug, which she says she has been taking since 2006 for health issues. It became a banned substance on 1 January 2016. However, she questioned whether it should be banned, saying there is ""no proof"" of its performance-enhancing effects. ""The problem I have with that is there's no proof of what it does, and no one can give you that proof. What is the ban based on?"" she said. It's thought the drug could have a positive effect on an athlete's stamina and endurance. On moving to the US aged six:""It was a crazy journey. I took up the language very fast and I was around kids that spoke English. I never really went to school to study English. I watched Barney and all these little cartoons."" On first watching the Williams sisters:""My father told me, you gotta watch and you gotta study them. And I was like, no, I don't want them to see me studying them! There was a shed behind the court they were practising on, and I watched them through this little peephole."" On equal pay in tennis:""As women athletes we've faced roadblocks. We still face roadblocks, we still face criticism, we still have a long way to go but we keep fighting for it. By our actions on the court and by our professionalism.""

"This video can not be played Sir Martin Moore-Bick said he hopes his inquiry will bring ""solace"" to the Grenfell Families The inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire has opened, with its chairman promising it will provide answers to how the disaster could have happened in 21st century London. Sir Martin Moore-Bick said he would not shrink away from making recommendations that could lead to prosecutions. But he has faced criticism for refusing to appoint a survivor to the inquiry panel. Grenfell survivors say they still feel like they ""have not been listened to"". Sir Martin told the hearing that the blaze on 14 June - in which at least 80 people died - was a ""tragedy unprecedented in modern times"". ""We are acutely aware that so many people died and that many of those who survived have been severely affected,"" he said. ""We are also conscious that many have lost everything. ""The inquiry cannot undo any of that, but it can and will provide answers to how a disaster of this kind could happen in 21st Century London."" Protesters gathered outside the Grand Connaught Rooms where the opening day of the inquiry was held Sir Martintold the hearing,externalhe recognised the ""great sense of anger and betrayal"" felt by those affected by the blaze and would examine evidence ""calmly and rationally"". But he rejected calls from survivors to appoint a person from the Grenfell community to the inquiry panel, saying it would ""risk undermining impartiality"". No evidence was heard on the first day of the hearing, held at the Grand Connaught Rooms in central London, and the former Court of Appeal judge did not take any questions afterwards. This prompted heckling at the end of the hearing after Sir Martin appeared to ignore Michael Mansfield QC, who is representing many of the survivors and attempted to address him. Solicitor Jhangir Mahmood, who is representing several families, said there was a ""huge level of mistrust"" among survivors who do not believe ""they have been listened to"". ""He (Sir Martin) really needs to take that on board. Today wasn't an example of him listening. ""Today was simply him laying down the rule book about how he wants to conduct the inquiry."" Hamid, who lived on the 16th floor of Grenfell Tower, was also not satisfied with the first day of the hearing. ""We are waiting for the answers,"" he said. ""We just want to ask some questions but no chance. That didn't happen."" Joe Delaney said he is more ""cautious"" than optimistic after hearing the opening of the inquiry Joe Delaney, who was evacuated from his flat close to the tower, said the investigation into how the fire started was ""not the only question"" that needed answering. ""The bigger question here would be why were concerns that were raised ignored? ""Why is he (Sir Martin) already trying to pre-empt the behaviour of legal representatives and force them to work together?"" He went on: ""Sadly now I feel more cautious than optimistic."" As it happened: Grenfell inquiry begins Who were the victims? What happened at Grenfell Tower? Reality Check: Homes for Grenfell survivors The inquiry's first hearing opened with a minute's silence for the victims. Some survivors and victims' families gathered in Notting Hill Methodist Church to watch Sir Martin's opening statement live on a screen. A silent march is planned for later on Thursday at the church. By Tom Symonds, home affairs correspondent Unlike Sir Martin Moore-Bick's previous public appearances - when he was heckled by people who survived the fire or lived near the tower - his opening statement was heard in silence by Grenfell residents and the bereaved. But there's still a lack of trust among local people of a process launched this morning at the lavish Grand Connaught Rooms. They described Sir Martin as an establishment figure presiding over a public inquiry surrounded by gold leaf. Outside, the inquiry's critics told us they were angry at his decision not to appoint survivors as part of a team of assessors who will advise him. The judge says that could damage his impartiality. Sir Martin's speech focused on his strategy for keeping what could be become a mammoth inquiry on the rails - this includes splitting it into two phases. The second, which looks at how the refurbished tower ended up a potential death-trap, could be the more complicated. Sir Martin said the reasoning behind decisions about the tower's management will be a key area of investigation. It is likely to look at whether cost-cutting led to to fatalities in Britain's worst ever tower-block fire. Sir Martin said the inquiry would be split into two phases - with the first examining how the blaze developed and the second looking at how the building became so exposed to the risk of a major fire. He said there was an ""urgent need"" to conduct phase one to find out what parts of the tower's design and construction played a role in allowing the disaster to happen. ""That's important because if there are similar defects in other high-rise buildings, steps must be taken quickly to ensure those who live in them are kept safe."" Tributes were left outside Notting Hill Methodist Church where families gathered to listen to the opening The fire started in a fridge freezer and spread quickly through the 24-storey tower block in North Kensington, in the early hours of 14 June. In August it was announced that the actions of Kensington and Chelsea Council, which operated the block, were to be examined by the inquiry. The council was criticised for its immediate response to the fire, which led former leaderNick Paget-Brown to resign. The inquiry's full terms of reference are: The cause and spread of the fire The design, construction and refurbishment of Grenfell Tower The scope and adequacy of the relevant regulations relating to high-rise buildings Whether the relevant legislation and guidance were complied with in the case of Grenfell Tower The actions of the local authority and other bodies before the tragedy The response of the London Fire Brigade to the fire and the response of central and local government in the aftermath Labour MP for Kensington Emma Dent Coad said she feared that some questions would remain unanswered. ""Why this has all happened, how was this allowed to happen and how the council was sitting on a third of a billion pounds worth of reserves and saved Â£100,000 on the cladding, all of those issues, will they be answered?"" Downing Street said it was confident the inquiry ""will get to the truth of what happened and learn the lessons to stop a similar catastrophe happening in the future"".

"This video can not be played The dormitory was gutted by the fire At least 23 students and teachers have died in a fire at a religious school in Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur. The fire at the Tahfiz Darul Quran Ittifaqiyah broke out in the early hours of Thursday morning. The victims are thought to been trapped in their dormitory as the windows were barred with metal grilles. ""It is one of the country's worst fire disasters in the past 20 years,"" Khirudin Drahman, director of the fire and rescue department, told AFP. Initial counts put the death toll at 25, but police later revised that down by two. Police said the dead were 21 students - all boys between the age of 13 and 17 - and two staff members. Ten people were taken to hospital, and four are thought to have serious injuries. Relatives of the victims arrived in the morning The blaze was reported at around 05:40 local time on Thursday morning (21:40 GMT Wednesday). According to the police it began in the sleeping quarters. In Islamic tahfiz schools - where children study the Koran - students often live at the school. Images and videos circulating online showed the entire upper room of the school ablaze. ""Based on our initial investigations, the position the victims were found in indicated that they tried to escape through the windows but were stopped due to the fixed grilles on the windows,"" fire and rescue department operations deputy director Soiman Jahid said. He said police were still investigating what caused the fire but that it likely was caused by short circuit or a lit mosquito repellent coil. Local media report,externalthe school could have been operating against government regulations, because its fire safety permit application was allegedly still pending. Malaysia's urban wellbeing and housing minister said there had been 29 fire incidents at tahfiz schools in the country since 2015. Malaysian authorities have raised concerns about safety measures at unregulated private religious schools. Earlier this year an 11-year-old schoolboydied in hospitalafter reportedly being beaten by a warden at a religious school. Picture from inside the school showed charred beds and scorched windows on the top floor A neighbour living next door to the school told the Reuters news agency they heard screams and saw the flames. ""The children were crying for help, but I couldn't help them as the door was already on fire,"" he said. One window appears not to have had metal bars, Reuters said, citing a 15-year-old student who described having seen eight children escaping through it and climbing down a water pipe. Kuala Lumpur Police chief Amar Singh said the bodies were ""totally burned"". ""Unfortunately there was only one entrance, so they could not escape. All the bodies were found lumped on one another."" Police chief Amar Singh said the victims probably suffocated due to the smoke Officials said fire engines were at the site within minutes, and the blaze was put out within an hour. Prime Minister Najib Razak tweeted his sympathies to those affected while a government minister said the incident should be quickly investigated ""so that we will be able to prevent future disasters"". ""We sympathise with the families. It is one of the worst fires involving so many lives in the capital in recent years, said Loga Bala Mohan, according to AFP.
