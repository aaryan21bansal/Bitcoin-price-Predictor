"Halls like this one in Knodishall, Suffolk, typically provide a focal point for different aspects of village life Village halls in need of a facelift can apply to share a Â£3m fund marking the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. The money will be divided between 125 halls in England to pay for renovations like wi-fi, building extensions and modernising facilities. Rural affairs minister Lord Benyon described the venues as ""the centrepiece of rural life"". The aim is to build on schemes that helped commemorate Queen Victoria and King George V. Three years ago 125 villages halls in England benefitted from Â£17m of government cash with other sources for renovations. Queen at Balmoral ahead of jubilee celebrations When's the four-day Jubilee bank holiday? Lord Benyon said of the support the halls offer: ""In a changing world, they are important facilities for community groups, social clubs and local services. ""This funding [from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] will ensure they are central to the fabric of our villages for many more years to come."" Villages halls are used for a wide variety of events, including as polling stations at election time Charity Action with Communities in Rural England (Acre) said the 10,000 village halls across England are often the only place people can socialise locally, and refurbishments would help safeguard their futures. Many of the volunteer-led halls are concerned about the rising cost of energy bills and need support to adopt more affordable heating and energy efficiency measures. Acre chair David Emerson said: ""This is an announcement that is especially appropriate in the week that thousands of halls across the country are hosting local celebrations of the royal jubilee."" Margaret Clark, chairwoman of the Rural Coalition, said the venues ""have a crucial role to play in helping levelling up in rural areas"". The Platinum Jubilee Village Halls Improvement Grant Fund follows a tradition of investments being made in village halls for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897 and King George V's Silver Jubilee in 1935.

"Irma Garcia and Eva Mireles ""We have a wonderful year ahead of us!"" This sweet and simple line, written by fourth-grade teacher Eva Mireles at the start of the school year, is haunting now. On Thursday, the last day of school, she and fellow teacher Irma Garcia should be packing up their shared classroom at Robb Elementary in the small Texan town of Uvalde, and preparing for the summer break. Instead, their families are making funeral arrangements, after they were gunned down in a mass shooting, which also killed 19 of their young students. AS IT HAPPENED:Texas primary school shooting leaves 21 dead VICTIM PROFILES:Texas victims: 'They were sweet kids and lovable' In the days since Tuesday's attack, Mrs Garcia and Ms Mireles' bravery has been praised - they were seen trying to shelter their students from the bullets. Mrs Garcia was found by officers ""embracing children in her arms pretty much until her last breath,"" her nephew John Martinez told the New York Times. ""She sacrificed herself protecting the kids in her classroom. She was a hero,"" he wrote on a fundraising page. Just two days later her family suffered another tragedy whenMrs Garcia's husband, Joe Garcia, died of a heart attack. Mr Martinez wrote that he ""passed away due to grief"". Mrs Garcia and Ms Mireles had been a teaching team for five years, and had 40 years of experience between them. A photo taken last month shows the pair in their classroom watching over students as they work on iPads, one giggling - he probably knows the photo is being taken. ""Eva Mireles and Irma Garcia were two of the greatest teachers Uvalde, [Texas] has ever known,"" Natalie Arias, an education specialist who lives in Uvalde wrote. ""Their classroom was full of fun, growth, giggles, teamwork, and, most of all, love."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. As the outpouring of grief continues, there is also anger that yet another deadly school shooting has been allowed to happen. It is legal to buy a gun at 18 in Texas, and according to US media, the attacker bought his - two AR-15 style semi-automatic rifles and 375 rounds of ammunition -  last week, the day after his birthday. America's bitter debate that never goes away Where does US gun control go from here? ""I'm furious that these shootings continue, these children are innocent, rifles should not be easily available to all,"" Eva Mireles' aunt, Lydia Martinez Delgado, said in a statement. ""This is my hometown, a small community of less than 20,000. I never imagined this would happen, especially to loved ones,"" she wrote. Ms Mireles' husband, Ruben Ruiz, is a school police officer. Two months ago he conducted an active shooter drill -which is common in US schools- at Uvalde High School. Little did he know that just weeks later, his own wife would be a victim to one. The Washington Post reports that Mr Ruiz rushed to Robb Elementary when he heard the news, and had to be held back by other officers as he desperately tried to get to his wife. At least 185 children, educators and other people have been killed in US school attacks since the 1999 Columbine High massacre,according to data by the Washington Post,external. There is even a unique memorial in Kansas for ""fallen educators"" that honours ""those who lost their lives in the line of duty."" Those words, more familiar when talking about soldiers, used here to describe murdered teachers. Now there are two more names to inscribe on the wall of remembrance. A teacher for 17 years, Ms Mireles described her love of running and hiking in a short biography posted on the school district's website. She also said she had ""a supportive, fun, and loving family"" - her husband, her college graduate daughter and ""three furry friends"". Her daughter Adalynn Ruiz wrote a heart-breaking tribute to her ""sweet mommy"" onTwitter,external. ""I'm so happy that people know your name and that beautiful face of yours and they know what a hero looks like,"" she said. ""Eva Mireles, 4th grade teacher... who selflessly jumped in front of her students to save their lives"". Ms Mireles was trained in special education, and was remembered by one parent, Audrey Garcia (no relation to Irma Garcia) for going ""above and beyond"" as a teacher. It was only a few years ago that schools in the Uvalde area started to integrate children with developmental disabilities into regular classrooms, and Ms Mireles was one of the teachers who taught them. ""She was a beautiful person & dedicated teacher. She believed in Gabby & went above & beyond to teach her"", Ms Garciawrote on Twitter,external. Mrs Garcia was a veteran teacher of 23 years - all of which were at Robb Elementary, and was the school's teacher-of-the-year in 2019. ""I am so excited to begin this new school year already!"" she wrote in her biography on the district's website. Authorities told her family that Mrs Garcia was seen by a friend in law enforcement trying to protect her students from the gunfire. ""I want her to be remembered as someone who sacrificed her life and put her life on the line for her kids,"" John Martinez, her nephew, told the Washington Post. ""They weren't just her students. Those were her kids, and she put her life on the line, she lost her life to protect them. That's the type of person she was."" Mrs Garcia was married and had four children - two boys and two girls ranging from 12 to 23 years old. Her Facebook page is an album of family memories and pride for her children.

"Fast fashion retailer Missguided is on the brink of collapse after being issued with a winding-up petition by creditors. It is understood the business, which has about 330 staff, could call in administrators as early as Monday. Missguided was rescued last autumn by the finance firm Alteri Investors. It has suffered from supply chain problems, rising freight costs and increasing competition from rivals like Boohoo and Chinese firm Shein. In recent weeks Alteri has been trying to secure a sale of the fast-fashion business. Insolvency specialists Teneo are advising Alteri on strategic options for the business and it is understood they are ready to step in as administrators if a solvent solution cannot be found. Any buyer may likely try to do a deal via what is known as a pre-pack administration, which allows an insolvent firm to sell its assets to a bidder. Boohoo hit as shoppers return more clothes Europe reveals fast fashion crackdown According to a report in the i newspaper,external, police were called to Missguided's Manchester headquarters after suppliers turned up earlier this week demanding overdue payments. Supplier JSK Fashions issued a winding up petition on 10 May. A creditor - in this case one of Missguided's suppliers - can apply to a court to close a company if it is unable to pay its debts. The idea is the firm's assets are sold and those who are owed money will be paid. The i said that three suppliers for Missguided warned they are at risk of going under due to outstanding payments. A Missguided spokesperson said: ""Missguided is aware of the action being taken by certain creditors of the company in recent days and is working urgently to address this. A process to identify a buyer with the required resources and platform for the business commenced in April and we expect to provide an update on progress of that process in the near future."" The business was founded by Nitin Passi in 2009 and grew to become one of the UK's biggest online fast-fashion players. The brand later expanded into Europe, the US and Australia and now ships to more than 180 countries. However, in the last few years the business has struggled to make a profit and in December Alteri announced redundancies as part of a turnaround plan. Mr Passi stepped down as chief executive in April. The firm began as a purely online retailer before adding several bricks-and mortar stores, including a flagship store in east London's Westfield shopping centre in 2016. It has since shut all its physical shops in the UK, saying they cost more to run than they brought in.

"Boris Johnson visited the CityFibre Training Academy in Stockton-on-Tees on Friday Two more Tory MPs have revealed they have submitted letters of no confidence in Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Ex-minister Steve Brine and Anne Marie Morris join the six Tory MPs to call for him to go since the Sue Gray report was published last Wednesday. Ms Gray's report details widespread rule-breaking in Downing Street during Covid lockdowns. Overall, the BBC is aware of at least 20 Tory MPs who have submitted letters of no confidence. This is short of the 54 needed to force a vote on the PM's future. although the actual number of letters could be higher. Only Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers, knows the exact number, and he is not expected to say anything until the 54 threshold has been reached. In a statement to constituents, Winchester MP Brine said he could no longer ""defend the indefensible"" as ""rule makers cannot be rule breakers"". On Friday, MP Paul Holmes quit his government job, saying he was ""shocked and appalled"" by events at No 10. Mr Holmes resigned as a parliamentary private secretary - a ministerial aide - to Home Secretary Priti Patel. He told the BBC he felt ""deeply uncomfortable"" over the findings inMs Gray's long-awaited report, which was published this week. Former junior minister Sir Bob Neill also called on the prime minister to quit over the report and submitted a letter of no confidence. Sir Bob, the Tory MP for Bromley & Chislehurst, said the report had ""highlighted a pattern of wholly unacceptable behaviour"". How much political danger is Boris Johnson in? Sue Gray reportâs key findings at a glance How many fines have there been over Partygate? And another of the 2019 intake of Conservative MPs, Alicia Kearns, issued a statement,reiterating that her position is ""unchanged"" since January, saying that the prime minister ""continues not to hold my confidence"". The MP for Rutland and Melton said she could only conclude that ""the prime minister's account of events to Parliament was misleading"", adding that the ""protracted affair has brought our government and my party into disrepute"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions on Friday, Treasury minister John Glen said the prime minister was in ""yellow card territory"" but said he would continue to ""get on and deliver"" as part of the government. In her report, Ms Gray said many events held during Covid restrictions ""should not have been allowed"" and the prime minister and his officials ""must bear responsibility for this culture"". She also found ""multiple examples of a lack of respect and poor treatment"" of security staff and cleaners by officials when gatherings took place. Sir Bob told the BBC he had made his decision to call on Mr Johnson to resign after speaking to constituents, adding he was ""not part of any campaign group"" to unseat the PM. He added what had gone on had ""eroded trust"" in government, and he found Mr Johnson's explanation he was unaware of the nature of parties in No 10 not credible. ""I can't believe he was not aware about at least some of what was going on,"" he added. This video can not be played Conservative MP Paul Holmes explains why he is stepping down from his Home Office role. Eastleigh MP Mr Holmes said his work for constituents had been ""tarnished by the toxic culture that seemed to have permeated No 10."" But speaking to BBC South Today, Mr Holmes insisted his resignation was ""not about the leadership, this is not about letters or the 1922 committee"". Ms Gray's report follows a four-month Metropolitan Police inquiry that saw 126 fines issued to 83 people - including Mr Johnson, his wife Carrie and Chancellor Rishi Sunak - for events that took place in 2020 and 2021. Before Mr Holmes announced his resignation, Mr Johnson told reporters he was confident he has enough support within his party to stay in post - but he deflected questions on whether he had tolerated the culture of heavy drinking and rule-breaking highlighted by Ms Gray's report. ""If you look at the answers in the House of Commons over more than two hours, I think you'll be able to see I answered that very, very extensively,"" said the PM. This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins onâ¦ The Sue Gray report Elected as MP at the 2019 general election, Mr Holmes has been a parliamentary private secretary to Ms Patel since September 2021. The unpaid role is the bottom rung of the government ladder, and is often seen as a way for newer MPs to gain experience of working with ministers. His resignation - announcedin a statement,external- made him the second Tory to have left a government post over the Partygate saga. In April, Lord David Wolfsonquit as a justice minister, saying the ""scale, context and nature"" of Covid breaches in government was inconsistent with his responsibility to uphold the rule of law.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Lengthy queues fill London St Pancras station Airlines have cancelled dozens of flights as travel disruption affects the half-term getaway for many. EasyJet and Tui apologised and blamed a number of issues including air traffic restrictions and runway works for axing the flights. Meanwhile, people were urged to check the latest advice before travelling to the Port of Dover due to ""extremely busy"" roads. Long queues have also been seen at London's St Pancras station. The station - home to Eurostar services - was exceptionally busy on Saturday with slow-moving queues stretching outside the building. Families heading to Disneyland Paris and football fans going to Paris for the Champions League final were among those travelling on train services across the Channel on Saturday. The coastguard has been handing out food and water to lorry drivers stuck in the queue at the port of Dover Earlier this week, EasyJet confirmed its plans to cancel 240 flights at airports across the UK over the next 10 days. The airline said about 24 flights a day from London's Gatwick airport would be cancelled between 28 May and 6 June. 'We were on the plane when our flight was cancelled' One passenger who spoke to the BBC said his EasyJet flight on Tuesday had been cancelled - but the earliest alternative flight offered by the airline was almost a week later on 6 June. And Tui passengers in Manchester and Birmingham said they were still waiting to fly to Dalaman, in Turkey, on Saturday - a day after their flight was due to depart. Tracey and her two sons had to watch the funeral on a Zoom call A woman has described how her family missed her father's funeral because their flight was cancelled by EasyJet minutes before departure. Tracey was booked to fly from Geneva to Bristol with her two sons to attend her father David Dane's funeral. Their flight was one of about 200the airline cancelledat short notice on 26 May. ""My problem isn't that the flight was cancelled,"" she said. ""It was the fact that there was no one to deal with the situation, this meant I had to watch my dad's funeral from a hotel room."" Read Tracey's story here On Thursday, a software failureforced EasyJet to cancel about 200 flights. The issue affected airports across the UK. EasyJet said the latest cancellations were unrelated to the IT issue, which is now resolved. It said a range of issues affected its operations and contributed to the cancellations, including air traffic control restrictions, runway works and airport handling delays. The airline will still be operating around 1,700 flights per day over the next week, it said. When a flight is cancelled fewer than seven days before the scheduled departure, airlines are obliged to inform those affected of their rights, and: offer to place them on an alternative flight - including on other airlines - to fly as soon as possible provide a full refund for parts of the ticket not used If a flight is cancelled with less than two weeks' notice, passengers may be entitled to additional compensation payments depending on the timings of any alternative flights: Â£220 for flights under 1,500km such as Glasgow to Amsterdam Â£350 for flights 1,500km to 3,500km such as East Midlands to Marrakesh Passengers who receive little or no notice about their cancelled flight, and ultimately arrive much later at their destination, may be entitled to extra compensation payments. Airlines are also expected to provide refreshments and accommodation as required while their customers await their new flight - or reimburse reasonable costs later on. People on affected package holidays booked throughmembers of Abta,externalhave the right to alternative arrangements at no extra cost or a full refund without delay. Full details of the Civil Aviation Authority rules arehere,external. A helpful guide from Which? consumer magazine ishere,external. Rory Boland, travel editor at Which? magazine, urged holidaymakers to take out travel insurance when they book, rather than before they travel to best protect themselves.""The problems that airlines are suffering are not easy to fix,"" he told the BBC, saying disruption was likely to continue into summer. In addition to Friday's delays, Tui cancelled six flights from Birmingham, Manchester and London Gatwick on Saturday morning. The cancellations were due to ""a combination of factors"" and refreshments and hotel accommodation would be provided, the company said. It also added that those whose flight was cancelled would be contacted directly and would receive a full refund within 14 days. Around 8,000 flights are expected to depart from UK airports over the weekend. Gatwick Airport said it expected 700 flights and 110,000 passengers on Saturday alone. Meanwhile, motoring organisation the RAC warned of congestion on the roads and said drivers were planning an estimated 17.8 million leisure trips between Friday and Sunday. Saturday is expected to be the busiest day. The Kent Resilience Forum said around 750 lorries were queuing near Dover on Saturday morning - though tourists are being prioritised. The coastguard has handed out food and water to lorry drivers stuck in the queue. Passengers have faced delays and cancellations at airports in recent months following the easing of Covid restrictions on international travel. The travel industry cut thousands of jobs during the pandemic, but as demand for flights has returned, it has struggled to recruit staff, carry out security checks and train new workers quickly.

Reflecting on how the Scotsman's return has been received by fans, Doyle said: ""For years we have struggled to find an identity again. One minute we are hiring managers who wants to play expansive football and then we bring in Sean Dyche and we are left with a mix of players who all different managers have signed. ""It's been a real mish-mash of a squad over the years. ""Moyes built a clear pathway to what Everton were about and it was great going to games knowing the team were going to be competitive. That can't really be said for the last few years. ""The supporters know there are limitations and expectations we can't quite reach at the moment but Moyes has given us that in the past and that is probably why there is a warm feeling around his re-appointment. ""Fans hope he can try and give us some of that back."" Listen to the full discussion on BBC Sounds Pat NevinFormer footballer and presenter Sean Dyche and Julen Lopetegui losing their jobs maybe weren't great surprises, even if the former Everton manager had personally saved the club last season and Lopetegui scarcely had enough time to stamp his authority atWest Ham. It is all because of the fear that grips clubs when the owners, and indeed the fans, start looking down instead of up in the Premier League. Like David Moyes, who was dismissed by West Ham only to be lured back by his old club to get them out of another fine mess, Dyche will soon be wanted again by clubs finding themselves in trouble. I am not sure if there has been a recent manager who has been more harshly undervalued for his efforts. Sign up to read more from Pat Nevin in his Football Extra newsletter David Moyes is back in charge of Everton and has a really tough job on his hands. In terms of firepower, he is armed with a water pistol. He has taken over a team which did not score enough goals under Sean Dyche. That was their biggest issue, and it is hard to see how Moyes can solve it with the same players that Dyche had. With Jordan Pickford, James Tarkowski and Jarrad Branthwaite, Everton have got players who can hold them together at the back, but Moyes' conundrum is to increase their attacking threat, and that is going to be a struggle, especially in these early days. Armando Broja is injured again so maybe Moyes can get a tune out of Dominic Calvert-Lewin, but that is something none of the the past few Everton managers have managed to do, and I have even seen him being linked with a move away. I have got Aston Villa's Emi Martinez in my Fantasy team, and I see him as the best goalkeeper in the Premier League, but they always seem to concede silly goals. So it is possible to get at Villa, I just don't see Everton managing it. I don't like talking about myself much but my last goal as a professional footballer was a clever header ina Villa winover a Moyes' Everton team at Goodison Park, and I am going for the same outcome here. Sutton's prediction: 0-2 Read the full predictions and have your say here We asked for your thoughts after Tuesday's Premier League game between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool. Here are some of your comments: Forest fans Peter:Superb in the first half, wilted in the second versus a relentless Liverpool team. Shame it was such a soft goal to concede but a draw is certainly decent. Superb atmosphere as well. John:Outstanding organisation, effort and flair in attack. There are so many key players all playing for each other.  Elliot Anderson is a bit of an unsung hero. Don't know whyNewcastlelet him go but thank you! Doug:A good result for both teams. In a strange way, as a Forest fan, it is a new era feeling a bit disappointed not coming away with the win. Well done, you Reds. Liverpool fans Ken:Slot has done very little wrong since taking the helm, but while he prefers a more measured approach, it is repeatedly throwing up these tepid first halves. The tempo is woefully slow and the passing laborious. It allows the opposition to stay compact. Credit for the eventual changes in the second half, which paid instant dividends and completely changed the flow of the game. Yusuf:It was a game that was a tactical battle in the first half and an absolute cracker in the second. We knew that it would be difficult to score, but our build-up play was good. Wasn't to be Mohamed Salah or Luis Diaz's day, but a step in the right direction. Being able to not get beaten, even if it is a draw, has set Liverpool apart from others this season, particularly against the teams near us at the top. A well-deserved draw for both teams in the end. Lewis:The games are getting harder week by week. I don't think it was great but another hard-won point. I'd give 7/10 for the performance. ""That is what happens when you are a top manager,"" said BBC Radio 5 Live pundit Clinton Morrison. ""You make big decisions."" Arne Slot's double change in the 66th minute, replacing Andrew Robertson and Ibrahima Konate with Diogo Jota and Kostas Tsimikas, is probably his most crucial choice of substitutes yet. Just 22 seconds later, Tsimikas whipped in a corner that found Jota's head six yards out to draw Liverpool level atNottingham Forest. Reds' fastest substitute goal since 2006-07 in a Premier League match. Slot was not keen so take the plaudits at full-time and played it down: ""If it had been open play then people could maybe say it was a tactical masterclass, but it was a set-piece so I don't think I deserve any credit for that. ""It was a substitution where we brought an attacker on for a defender and the fact it immediately led to a goal you could say was luck."" But Jota said he and fellow sub Tsimikas went on with the intention to combine and score: ""We were watching the cup goal from a few years ago where he passed it to me - so when we were on the touchline, we said: ""Let's go now and recreate that, you take the corner. And it was a goal."" Liverpool have rejected a Â£70m bid from Saudi Pro League club Al-Hilal for striker Darwin Nunez. (Anfield Watch,external) Meanwhile, the Reds are keen on Nurnberg striker Stefanos Tzimas, 19, with the Greek forward potentially available for about Â£20m and also attracting interest fromChelsea,BrightonandAston Villa. (Sky - in German,external) Want more transfer stories? Read Wednesday's full gossip column Follow the gossip column on BBC Sport Liverpool manager Arne Slot, speaking to BBC Sport:""I am a little bit disappointed, although when you're 1-0 down against Nottingham Forest it is maybe a lot to ask for a win because they've hardly given away any chances in the recent games that they have played. ""That is why I couldn't ask for more from our players. They created so many chances in the second half but to not score from all of those chances was a little disappointing of course."" On Matz Sels:""He was also like this at Anfield, but also all season. It isn't just their goalkeeper, but the way they defended and because of that maybe they deserved to not concede a second or third goal because they threw themselves for every ball and cross. They fight with everything they've got and the fans were really loud and helped them a lot. ""Still, we managed to create more than a few chances to score and that is what pleased me most and maybe, not for the first time this season, we didn't get what we deserved."" On what changed in the second half:""We were a bit more patient in the second half. Maybe the intensity was a little bit higher but maybe the other team is a little bit more tired too."" On the Jota and Tsimikas substitutions:""I just wanted to bring more attacking threat to the team and the fact we scored immediately was just a bonus."" On the result as a whole:""We should be disappointed, although they are having a great season. We want to win every game and they probably want to win every game as well. With how the game went I think we can be disappointed. ""They are a counter-attacking team and I think we only conceded one counter-attack and for us to come from behind shows the character and quality the team has. We must not get a habit of not getting what we deserved because it happened at Tottenham and it happened today and the analysts might not agree but based on expected goals we deserved more than 2-2 draw against Manchester United too."" No side have gained more points from losing positions than Liverpool in the Premier League this season (14). Meanwhile, Diogo Jota scored with his first touch just 22 seconds after coming off the bench â it is Liverpool's fastest substitute goal on record (since 2006-07) in a Premier League match. Liverpool goalscorer Diogo Jota, speaking to TNT Sports:""I not only score goals but I scored with my first touch today which I felt gave the team a bit of momentum. ""I had one or two more chances and I think I could have given us the three points. Unfortunately I couldn't."" On combining with fellow substitute Konstantinos Tsimikas for the goal:""We were watching the cup goal from a few years ago where he [Tsimikas] passed it to me and so when we were on the touchline we said: 'Let's go now and recreate that, you take the corner' - and it was a goal. ""It was one of those occasions where everything went right. But like I said, I am not happy because I think we could have won."" On Matz Sels' performance:""I was just telling that to my former coaches from Wolves just now. He made two or three great saves. You want to do better but he was good as well."" On their lead at the top:""It's a long way to go in the Premier League. Every ground you go to it's hard. It's one more point but we wanted the three.""

Here are the key lines from his news conference: Nicolas Kuhn is back available for selection having missed the 4-1 win against Ross County, while fellow winger Daizen Maeda - who was also absent last time out - will be assessed on Tuesday before the game. Rodgers says he is not concerned by Adam Idah's lack of goals currently, and backed the Republic of Ireland striker to come good in front of goal. Rodgers also pointed out how his teams do not rely on one player to score, and goals are spread throughout his squad. Says he is ""delighted"" for Johnny Kenny, who Rodgers believes has returned from his loan spell at Shamrock Rovers a better player. Says there will be a decision made soon as to whether his development is better served at Celtic or with another loan spell. On Dundee, Rodgers expects Tony Docherty's team to be ""tight and compact"". Says it is about Celtic staying patient and taking chances when they arise. Rodgers is determined to bring new players to Parkhead during the January window to provide a ""freshness"" for the second half of the season, but would not reveal how many signings he has in mind. When asked about speculation linking Kyogo with a move away from the club, Rodgers says the Japan striker is ""just the same guy"" and will be involved against Dundee. Suggested a perceived lack of goal celebration against Ross County may have been down to the amount of goals he scores or the freezing temperatures in Dingwall. Rodgers added he will not keep any player at Celtic who doesn't want to be at the club.

"This video can not be played First Minister Mark Drakeford removes all remaining Covid restrictions in Wales The wearing of face masks will no longer be legally required in Welsh health and social care services from Monday. First Minister Mark Drakeford confirmed the ending of the last of Wales' Covid rules, which have been in place in some form since March 2020. Ministers said the public health situation had continued to improve over the last few weeks. Wales was the last part of the UK with Covid restrictions still in place. However most of the rules that affected people's day to day lives, such as wearing face masks in shops and on public transport and self-isolation rules,ended in March. It will no longer be a legal requirement to wear a mask in hospitals from Monday - but guidance will remain The number of people estimated to have Covid-19 in Wales has fallen for the sixth week in a row. However the Welsh government said the NHS continued to experience ""emergency and pandemic pressures"". Guidance will remain in place strongly recommending the use of face coverings in health settings to help protect the most vulnerable. Wales' Covid laws and mass testing to be axed What are the latest Covid rules for Wales? What's the guidance for Covid in the UK now? Announcing the decision in a news conference, Mr Drakeford said authorities were planning to deal with Covid like ""any other seasonal illness"" from now on. But he warned measures were in reality ""on hold"" in case of another wave - with two new variants already being monitored by health officials. ""We have learned, time and again, that this virus can behave in ways that are neither expected nor predictable,"" he said. He said that the Welsh government was ""ready to bring back testing and contact tracing"", should that be needed. Booster vaccines are already being made available for the autumn, and ministers are encouraging people to get a flu jab later this year. Early indications were that ministers would be advised to offer an annual Covid jab in future years, the first minister added, possibly only to older age groups and the most vulnerable. Broader mask rules were scrapped earlier in the year Despite the changes to rules on face masks, Helen Whyley, director of nurses union RCN Wales, asked people to continue wearing them in healthcare settings if asked. She said: ""The legal requirement may be removed, however health and social care professionals across settings are still asking people to think carefully about wearing a mask when attending appointments or visiting friends and family. In some circumstances staff may ask you to wear a mask. ""I am encouraging everyone to be respectful with these requests to help keep the people of Wales safe and health care services recover from the pandemic."" Care Forum Wales said the decision was a ""step towards the normality everyone wants"" but admitted there would be a mixture of emotions. ""It's impossible to estimate the level of trauma people have gone through in the sector,"" chief executive Mary Wimbury toldRadio Wales Breakfast. ""It's going to have to be risk assessed for each sector. ""Sometimes you're going into people's homes where there is a lot of people in and out throughout the day, not wearing masks, and it's going to be great for staff not to have to [wear them] throughout the summer. ""Equally there is going to be vulnerable people you are still visiting and they will want you to wear masks. ""We understand why the restrictions have continued, but it is all about balance."" Newport's Lucy Taylor said she remained cautious and still wore her mask at work Lucy Taylor, from Newport, has cystic fibrosis and shielded during the pandemic. The 29-year-old said it had taken her a long time to be able to venture out and she continued to wear her mask at work. She said: ""It's better for me to live normally again. ""I think if I don't do that I'll just go back into my shell and I'm going to be so scared of going out, that I'm not going to want to go out."" Alex Osbourne has been shielding for the past two years due to her MS Alex Osbourne, from Caerphilly, works for the charity Disability Wales and has been shielding since the start of the pandemic due to her multiple sclerosis (MS). ""I'm quite anxious about this,"" she said, of the final rule being dropped. ""Masks made me feel a bit safer. I have to go to hospital quite a lot so the idea that they won't be worn there anymore is really stressful. ""I understand people don't want to wear them anymore, but it's very stressful for people like me with no immune system who don't have that same confidence as everyone else to start mixing again."" There were an estimated 52,900 people with the virus, according to the weekly swab survey of thousands of households in Wales by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS said this was one in 55 people - or 1.74% of the population, in the week ending 21 May,  a reduction for a sixth successive week. Daily estimates have infections highest in those in their early 40s and lowest in those over 80. Latest hospital figures in Wales showed on Thursday there were only 25 acute patients with Covid who were being actively treated for the virus. According to Digital Health and Care Wales figures, 85% of patients who tested positive for Covid were in hospital to be treated for something else. Looking at patients testing positive for Covid in all hospitals, the average in the last week has dropped by 27% to 215 - the lowest average since last August. Welsh Conservative shadow health minister Russell George said he was delighted that Covid regulations were ending. He said: ""Not only do we need to remember all those who lost lives and loved ones to lockdowns and the virus itself, but learn the lessons about how we can counter another pandemic and assess the impact of deploying harsh emergency restrictions on our population. ""But none of us will ever get the answers we deserve without the Wales-specific public inquiry everyone in the country wants apart from, not surprisingly, the Labour government who run scared of scrutiny."" Answering journalists' questions, Mr Drakeford again rejected such an investigation, saying he was ""confident"" the UK inquiry, chaired by Baroness Hallett, was ""sensitive to the needs of Wales"". A Welsh-only probe ""would not provide the answers people rightly would expect from an inquiry"", he added. Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said he shared the ""nervousness among health professionals about the removal of the need to wear masks in health and care settings, because of vulnerability of so many in the sector"". ""[The] Welsh government must make sure they monitor very carefully the extent to which people follow the guidance for people to continue wearing them in these settings,"" he added. Now that the Covid regulations are going, Mr ap Iorwerth said, ""we owe it to our hard-working staff"" to ""bring our health service on to a more sustainable footing, by reducing waiting times, speeding up the patient journey, and joining up health with social care"". Although the requirement to wear a face covering in health and social care was not part of the original legislation, coronavirus rules in Wales have existed in some form since March 2020. The law was used to impose strict curbs on people's day to day lives, including three stay-at-homelockdowns,restrictions on traveland on whatbusinesses could and could not do. In Wales masks became obligatory in all indoor public places in September 2020. Powers under public health legislation meant the rules could be imposed quickly, without always having to go to the Senedd for a vote first. Welsh ministers added and removed measures as the Covid situation changed. Initially the rules were largely the same across the UK, although this changed as England reopened in the summer of 2020, and differences developed between the different nations. Mr Drakeford's approach to sometimes ease restrictions slower than in England, and to impose restrictions during the first Omicron wave in the autumn, had been criticised by the Welsh Conservatives for being too stringent or for not moving fast enough to lift rules. But the Welsh government has said it had the public's support for how it managed the regulations. While the requirement to self-isolate has ended in law, and only LFTs and not PCR tests are now available to the general public, routine contract tracing has continued in Wales. Under the Welsh government's Covid-19 strategy, it will end in June. It ended in England on 24 February. In Friday's news conference, Mr Drakeford said Wales has a stock of 90 million lateral flow tests, and a decision is still to be made on whether to offer those stocks for free in the winter. The decision was whether to keep free tests over the summer - they are due to end at the end of June - or to hold stocks back for the winter, he added. Discussions are still going on with the UK government to see if further purchases of LTF tests will happen on a UK-wide basis, he said.

"By Jack Grey and Miriam Barker BBC Wales News Â Lucy Barret and Alice Trout have said it's ""amazing"" to no longer worry about Covid For the last two years, the streets of Wales were deserted as the effects of lockdown to combat the spread of Covid saw shops close, businesses shut and people observe social distancing. First Minister Mark Drakeford confirmed the ending of the last of Walesâ Covid rules, which has been in place in some form since March 2020. The usually bustling streets in city centres were empty of shoppers, many public buildings like Cardiff's central library were closed during the pandemic. As all the Covid restrictions in Wales are removed, people are once again able to go into city centres, and use public buildings. There were concerns over the economic impact of the outbreak for shops. Two years after the first restrictions were imposed, people in Wales can now go about their lives without any Covid rules in place. Masks were a common sight on the streets of Wales. Mask rules were scrapped earlier in the year along with social distancing rules. 1 of 9 After more than two years of rules and lockdowns, after this weekend there will be no remaining Covid restrictions in Wales. In Cardiff the city centre is packed, in stark contrast to the near empty streets in April 2020. On Friday Ed Sheeran will play the second of his three sold-out Principality Stadium gigs, with people travelling from across the UK to Cardiff. With all restrictions axed, and Covid infections falling for six consecutive weeks, does this mean the end of the pandemic in Wales?  ""The sun's out, and weâre loving it, itâs back to normal,"" said Lucy Barret, 27, who is visiting Cardiff to see Ed Sheeran with her friend Alice Trout, 27. The pair, from Stratford-upon-Avon, said it was ""amazing"" to no longer have to worry about Covid after an âawfulâ two years. âThe last two years during the pandemic were awful, we both have our own business and we were just doing absolutely nothing, we just couldnât work,"" Lucy added. ""It's so nice to finally be able to go out and enjoy yourself without worrying.â Alice added: âItâs just so lovely just to not have to think about Covid.""  Karla Tutton (right) and her colleagues said they'd had a rough few years in the care sector, and wanted to enjoy themselves. Also visiting the city for Ed Sheeran is Karla Tutton, with a group of colleagues from the care sector. ""I canât remember the last time I went out and just sat outside having a drink with friends. We're definitely making the most of it,"" said Karla, 41, from Bristol. ""Weâre still being careful...I was on the train today and I noticed no one was wearing masks, I was a bit âshould I shouldnât I?â."" Karla said after lockdowns it was important to enjoy life when you can. ""Working in care, itâs been a rough few years, and obviously we are all constantly still in it every day, we go home and itâs not just take your bra off, itâs take your mask off too. ""Even after things were relaxed people still didnât do it as much, and in our job we didnât want to."" Cardiff market is packed, after remaining empty or closed for much of the pandemic Jamal Eltagoury has run Cardiff Bakestones bakery in Cardiff market for the last 15 years âOh my god seeing all these people is fantastic,"" said Jamal Eltagoury from Cardiff, who has run Cardiff Bakestones bakery in Cardiff market for the last 15 years. âItâs brilliant, absolutely brilliant, itâs completely changed, we had absolutely nobody here and now look at it."" The Cardiff market bakery has boasted famous customers in the past, with Jamal having previously taught celebrity chef Jamie Oliver how to make Welsh cakes. Jamal said the staff at bakery feel great seeing so many customers, after the hardest couple of years the business has ever seen. âThe last two years has been terrible, but thank god we kept all of our staff,"" he added. Pat Pearce Hatfield (left) and Janet Sibley are enjoying a five day trip, after missing seeing friends during the pandemic Pat Pearce Hatfield, 85, Janet Sibley, 80, from Hertfordshire, are enjoying lunch in Cardiff before visiting the Royal Mint. ""Weâre getting out and about finally, and weâre loving it,"" said Pat, who is on a five day trip with her friend Janet. âWeâve had to cancel trips and not see friends, over the pandemic, it has been hard. ""Thankfully, weâve finally just got to the point where weâre not worrying when we go out."" ""I lost my dear husband nine years ago, so during the pandemic I had lots of phone calls with friends, but I couldnât see people, it was really tough,"" said Janet. ""So now Iâm just enjoying myself, you have got to live with it."" Mike Delaney, from Cardiff, makes around 20% of his income from busking and said the pandemic has meant he's taken a hit ""We all lived through this together, so it will always be on the brain,"" said busker Mike Delaney, from Cardiff. Mike, who makes around 20% of his income from busking, said things are slowly getting back to normal, but he doesn't feel it will ever be the same as it was. ""Itâs been rough, for sure, I used to make so much more money busking before Covid, even after things have opened up,"" he said. But despite this Mike said he's feeling very confident things are improving. ""Iâm feeling good, Iâm feeling optimistic, things are pretty much there.""

"Bible in hand as he approached the stage, Pastor Tony Gruben looked out onto a sea of shattered faces and paused. On Wednesday, less than 24 hours after one of America's deadliest school shootings, he admitted that he too, felt lost. ""I wanted to hope this was all a nightmare. I have no answers,"" he told a packed arena typically reserved for rodeos. ""But when the morning breaks, God is there."" As he spoke, neighbours clutched one another - too lost in their grief to really care about the news cameras nearby broadcasting their pain. Instead, they prayed for healing. They prayed for understanding. But most of all, they prayed for the souls of the 21 lives stolen from their community when an 18-year-old gunman opened fire at Robb Elementary School. Among the dead were 19 children between the ages of seven and 10. Who were the victims? Before last week, few could locate Uvalde, a small town of about 15,000 nestled between San Antonio and the US-Mexico border at the base of the Texas Hill Country. Now, its name has been added to a grim, yet growing, list of gun massacres in the United States. And as the world grasps for answers, the people here cling to their faith. ""We may not understand what happened here yesterday, but we seek the Lord, as best we can,"" another minister said. American flags, welcome signs and large crosses decorate front yards here. It's the kind of place where folks stop to help this journalist with a flat tyre, not caring how late they'll be to dinner, ""because that's what I would want someone to do for my daughter"". And it's a town full of people willing to offer a half-smile, even in the midst of their grief. Communities torn apart by mass shootings are often reduced to just a name: Columbine, Sandy Hook, Parkland. But where trauma transforms some into activists, the Uvalde community has turned inward. As she left a mid-day mass on Thursday, Irma Fuentes told the BBC she had spent the morning crying until she came to church. She said she prayed for the souls of the 19 children who were killed - and also for the soul of ""that boy"" who caused her community so much pain. Irma prays for her community ""The little girl that they found yesterday was my neighbour's granddaughter,"" she said, adding another neighbour's grandchild was still suffering from injuries in a San Antonio hospital. ""I'm going home now to be with them."" But while everyone knows someone who lost a loved one in the shooting, it seems no one really knew the boy who pulled the trigger. Salvador Ramos bought two rifles a week before the shooting, authorities have said. Texas shooting response was 'wrong', says official Classmates like Ivan Arrellano who, despite having shared classes and conversations with Ramos since they were 12 years old back in eighth grade, couldn't show you a school photo of him because ""he was never present for stuff like that."" Mickey Craddock lives just three doors down from the home where the rampage began after the gunman shot his grandmother. She always thought of him as a ""regular teenage kid"". She'd sometimes see him play basketball, and heard rumours about his unstable relationship with his mother. A mother holds up a photo of her child at the vigil ""He was a troubled kid, and I could probably point out five or six of them in this community,"" Ms Craddock said. ""People from bad backgrounds, drug backgrounds, you know, but we never thought anything like this would happen."" Some media reports have painted the gunman as a bullied and isolated teen, but Mr Arrellano said his experience was different. ""He was not a victim of bullying. He would try to scare people and I guess this was his last way to scare people,"" he said. We met 18-year-old Arellano two days before he was supposed to graduate high school. Now, because of the shooting, that milestone has been postponed, leaving the teenager to reflect on what he could have done. ""We knew he wasn't mentally healthyâ¦ we probably should've said something."" The morning after the shooting, the town was so silent you could hear a rooster crowing from blocks away. Standing in her yard, Sandra Parra looked down the street towards Robb Elementary. On any other weekday, she'd overhear the voices of small children as they walked past her home towards the school. Sometimes there'd be singing, sometimes there'd be shouting, but there was always proof of life. Monique holds son Joaquin close There was none of that Wednesday morning. Instead, her view of the school was obstructed by the hordes of media that swarmed the area - blocking roads and stomping through her neighbours' yards. ""The normality is not here anymore,"" Parra said. ""They didn't deserve it and I just don't understand what happened."" Politicians and pundits have already rebooted a familiar playbook: reducing the town's trauma to a talking point about mental health and gun control. Where does debate over US guns go now? America's gun culture in charts But all of that is not up for debate in Uvalde - at least not right now. On the day after the attack, once the initial shock of the shooting had passed, children returned to the school. Instead of backpacks and homework, they came bearing candles and flowers for classmates and friends they'd never see again. ""It's hard to explain to your kid that someone he used to play with won't be there anymore,"" said Monique, as she clutched her son, Joaquin, to her side. ""It's hard to explain evil, it's hard for them to understand."" The Jimenez siblings were inside the school during the shooting Ameriah, 10, and Travis, 11, were both inside the school when shots rang out. As they approached their school, now encircled with caution tape, they told the BBC they knew to hide because they'd practised active shooter drills. When police finally arrived, Travis had to climb over a chair and through a window to escape. Their father, Jesse Jimenez, said Ameriah was missing for four hours and he feared the worst. Finding her was a miracle. Both kids spoke quietly, leaving their father to fill in any details. ""My son ran up to me and said he didn't think he was going to make it out - that he didn't think he was going to see me or his mother again,"" he said. ""My daughter didn't know if it was a drill or if it was real."" The spectre of a school shooting has become so common in the United States, students across the country regularly practise how to respond to an active shooter. The Jimenez siblings said they were always told to ""take them seriously"". The teachers who died trying to save their pupils ""I know these kids practised,"" said JoAnn, a retired teacher who drove almost two hours to pay her respects. ""It just really breaks my heart that they might not have been able to put into place what they had learned - turning off the lights, shutting the door, locking the door, not opening the door unless someone physically opens it with a key."" And it hurts more because this time of the year was meant to be celebratory, she adds. In the 32 years JoAnn spent teaching, she came to love the end of the school year, even if it meant saying goodbye to students. ""Towards the end of the year you have a little bond with your students. You have a little love there. You're with them a lot more than your own family sometimes."" On Thursday afternoon, the community was dealt yet another blow. Joe Garcia, the husband of slain teacher Irma Garcia, had suffered a fatal heart attack. The two had been high school sweethearts. Earlier that day, Joe was seen taking flowers to a cross etched with his wife's name just outside the school.Now, his family says he died of a broken heart. ""I spent this afternoon with their family,"" Archbishop Gustavo Garcia-Siller said at the start of Mass that evening. ""This is a tragic situation."" Teacher Irma Garcia was killed. Her husband died of a heart attack days later For the Catholics in this predominantly-Latino community, Thursday was meant to be an annual day of celebration marking the Feast of Ascension, when Jesus rose to Heaven to take his seat beside God, His Father. Instead, at Sacred Heart Catholic Church, where the Garcias spent most Sundays, the congregation bowed their heads to mourn children and teachers who ascended too soon, leaving loved ones wracked with confusion and grief. As he read from the Gospel, a church deacon reminded the congregation that before he departed, Jesus said, ""You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy."" This year, that verse is proving more difficult to understand. After the spotlight fades and camera crews leave, the people in this all-American town will be left to rebuild after yet another distinctly American tragedy.

"This video can not be played A group of wardens describe what it's like living all year round on a tiny island Wildlife wardens hope to share one Welsh island's secrets with the world - by using cutting edge technology. Flat Holm island, near Cardiff, is home to unique lizards and flowers, and is an important bird sanctuary. Now the variety, location and numbers of flora and fauna will be updated on an interactive digital map at the city's Techniquest science museum. The wardens hope this will improve understanding of climate change and nature. Flat Holm is famous for itsrole in the inventionof radio, but its varieties of plants and animals are not so widely known. Cardiff Metropolitan University has teamed up with the island's wardens to design an interactive exhibit to reflect real-time wildlife data. The wardens described it as a ""really exciting chance"" to engage in the conservation efforts on Flat Holm. Climate change in Wales in charts Donkeys and sharks helped by new nature funding Life on the island is not always easy, according to the current wardens Heidi Aguirregoicoa and Pierre Court. ""It's just a really unique experience. I've never known a place like this,"" said Heidi. Heidi, 21 and Pierre, 23 have been the wardens on Flat Holm for just a few months. With the ""unique"" experience comes a vast range of responsibilities Pierre explained. Heidi Aguirregoicoa said they log data about island's flora, fauna and also the weather ""It's very different to being a manager in an office,"" said Pierre. As well as managing volunteers on the island, the wardens guide tours, run the island pub, maintain buildings and infrastructure and ensure they have clean water. ""All of our water is collected from rainwater. It is then stored in a Victorian tank underneath the ground and filtered several times. And then we can finally drink it and use it in the accommodation,"" added Pierre. ""We basically use the water we've collected throughout the winter and it will last us the entire summer. So, this is a big concern of ours."" He said: ""It makes you really humble living here and you understand that nature will always win. No matter what you do."" Flat Holm Island has been a Site of Special Scientific Interest since 1972. For the wardens and volunteers conservation work is at the heart of life on Flat Holm. Home to a huge population of gulls, the island is also the habitat of slow worms with unique blue markings as well as moths, butterflies and rabbits. Rare plants, such as rock sea lavender, wild peonies and wild leek also grow on the island. To keep track of wildlife, the wardens conduct regular surveys. The interactive map at Techniquest is designed to give an insight into the island's wildlife and weather ""Some of our surveys are monthly and weekly, and some are daily. ""The daily survey is the bird survey. We do a long round trip for an hour every morning, about 7:30 around the edges of the island,"" explained Heidi. They do a rough count of birds and log numbers of the types of moths, butterflies and slow worms. The way the wardens log this data has now changed. Instead of using a paper and a pen, information will be uploaded to an app. This project was a result of a collaboration between Cardiff Harbour Authority, Cardiff Metropolitan University, Techniquest and Yard, a technical marketing agency. Pierre Court said they also run the island's pub as part of their duties Heidi said the new method of logging data is quicker and there is no risk of the data being lost. As well as feeding directly to an exhibit at Techniquest Science Discovery Centre in Cardiff Bay, the data contributes to long-term conservation datasets on the island. Welsh farmers told to cut more carbon emissions How will hospitality survive after summer? Dr Fiona Carroll, an expert in our relationships with computers at Cardiff Met University, believes the pandemic helped us engage with data. ""People started to become fatigued by a lot of the complex data,"" she said. ""So, we've come up with a data impression, and that's really been inspired by going back to the 1800s and the French Impressionists."" Dr Fiona Carroll said the exhibit's colours was inspired by the French Impressionists The interactive exhibit allows people to press buttons which will show the numbers of different animals on the island, using colours and patterns. Data about the weather on the island is also collected and visualised using prisms which rotate to show types of wind, rain or sunshine. There are plans to use these methods and technology in other practical settings. ""We've got data coming out of our ears every second of the day, we're generating more and more data,"" explains Dr Carroll. The slow worms on Flat Holm have unique markings on them She said visualising data could help the public have a greater understanding of the world around them, in areas such as air pollution and making sense of rising food costs in supermarkets. ""It's really exciting knowing the general public are going to be able to experience Flat Holm from afar,"" said Heidi. It is a view shared by warden Pierre, too. ""It's helping us build this relationship with the visitors and the public,"" he said. ""This has just started so we're really hoping that throughout the summer season we might have visitors coming to the island saying, 'oh yeah, I was at the Techniquest and I saw all the data'. ""We're hoping this is going to help Flat Holm grow even more, and help people to get into conservation and into their local sites of interest.""

"Bible in hand as he approached the stage, Pastor Tony Gruben looked out onto a sea of shattered faces and paused. On Wednesday, less than 24 hours after one of America's deadliest school shootings, he admitted that he too, felt lost. ""I wanted to hope this was all a nightmare. I have no answers,"" he told a packed arena typically reserved for rodeos. ""But when the morning breaks, God is there."" As he spoke, neighbours clutched one another - too lost in their grief to really care about the news cameras nearby broadcasting their pain. Instead, they prayed for healing. They prayed for understanding. But most of all, they prayed for the souls of the 21 lives stolen from their community when an 18-year-old gunman opened fire at Robb Elementary School. Among the dead were 19 children between the ages of seven and 10. Who were the victims? Before last week, few could locate Uvalde, a small town of about 15,000 nestled between San Antonio and the US-Mexico border at the base of the Texas Hill Country. Now, its name has been added to a grim, yet growing, list of gun massacres in the United States. And as the world grasps for answers, the people here cling to their faith. ""We may not understand what happened here yesterday, but we seek the Lord, as best we can,"" another minister said. American flags, welcome signs and large crosses decorate front yards here. It's the kind of place where folks stop to help this journalist with a flat tyre, not caring how late they'll be to dinner, ""because that's what I would want someone to do for my daughter"". And it's a town full of people willing to offer a half-smile, even in the midst of their grief.

"Ukrainian troops could withdraw from their final pockets of resistance in the eastern Luhansk region, an official there says Russia is trying to encircle Ukrainian forces in Severodonetsk and Lysychansk as it tries to capture the Donbas region Civilians in Severodonetsk ""are constantly in shelters, it is almost impossible to go outside due to the density of shelling,"" said governor Serhiy Haidai Earlier Ukrainian officials said Russian-backed forces had taken control of the city of Lyman in the eastern Donetsk region The Pentagon says it is ""mindful"" of Ukrainian requests for long-range weapons, something Russian state TV called a red line The Moscow-backed branch of Ukraine's Orthodox Church severs ties with Russia, saying its leaders have failed to condemn the war We're pausing our live coverage of the Ukraine war for now, but will be resuming on Saturday. Thanks for joining us. Our editors today were Thom Poole, Chris Giles and James Clarke. Our writers were James FitzGerald, Emily McGarvey, Robert Greenall, Jeremy Gahagan, Leo Sands and Yaroslav Lukov. You can read more of one of our main stories today - the possible withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from the big eastern city of Severodonetsk -here. If you're just joining us, or need a quick recap, here's the latest with what's been happening in Ukraine on Friday: Russia captures Lyman  Luhansk  Long-range weapons  Church schism This video can not be played 'Switch off the TV': Former Russian-state TV journalist's plea to Russia A journalist who quit her job at Russian state-controlled TV channel back in March over the invasion of Ukraine has told Russian audiences to switch off their television sets. ""Just don't listen, find other sources of information,"" Zhanna Agalakova said in an interview with BBC Newsnight. ""It blows my mind how they do it,"" she added. ""How they brainwash their population"" If you're in the UK you can watch the full interview tonight (Friday 27 May) on BBC Two at 22:30 BST. Some more now on Ukraine's request that the US start supplying it with powerful long-range weapon systems to enhance its military capabilities against Russia. On Friday a Pentagon spokesperson announced that ""decisions...haven't been made yet"" but the US is ""mindful"" of the request. The comment comes after CNN published a report that the US was preparing to send Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) to Ukraine. In the past Washington officials had denied the request fearing such long-range weapons could be used to attack targets inside Russia and end up widening and prolonging the conflict. A presenter on Russian state TV responded to the report by claiming the US would be crossing a red line and deliberately provoking Russia if it supplied Ukraine with the weapons. The evacuees left the city in an armoured vehicle Ukraine's police have taken to safety 31 residents - including 13 children - of Ukraine's eastern city of Lysychansk, in what the top regional official describes as one of the most ""difficult evacuations"" in recent days. Luhansk regional head Serhiy Haidai says the officers were initially sent to evacuate seven people, who had previously agreed to leave but - after ""a few hours of persuasion"" - ended up picking up 31 residents. Haidai also says that one vehicle that delivered humanitarian aid to Lysychansk was damaged because of the fighting in the area. Russian forces have been slowly advancing on the twin cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk. Local officials say two-thirds of Severodonetsk is now surrounded. Ukraine is hugely significant for the Russian Orthodox Church, with many parishes and some of its most important monasteries located there The Ukrainian Orthodox Church has declared its ""full autonomy and independence"" from the under Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP), condemning the stance Russian religious leaders have taken on the war in Ukraine. ""We disagree with the position of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow,"" the UOC-MP said in a statement after a council meeting in Kyiv, referring to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC). Kirill has openly voiced support for Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine launched on 24 February. It is the second schism in Ukraine in recent years, with part of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church breaking away from Moscow in 2019. The Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) was then granted a degree of independence, or the tomos, by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Talks on the unification of the Ukrainian Orthodoxy between the UOC-MP and the OCU have so far brought no breakthrough. Ukraine is hugely significant for the ROC, with many parishes and some of its most important monasteries located there.  Russian forces will not capture Luhansk in the coming days but Ukraine may have to evacuate some of its forces there for their own protection, the region's governor has saidon Telegram,external. ""It is possible that in order not to be surrounded we will have to retreat,"" Serhiy Haidai wrote. In an evening military report he also described how dangerous everyday life was in the Ukrainian-controlled areas of Luhansk. Remaining civilians ""are constantly in shelters, it is almost impossible to go outside due to the density of shelling,"" he said. Haidai added that Russian forces have been continuing to target the city of Severodonetsk, where fighting has broken out on the outskirts of the city. Earlier we reported that the US is preparing to offer Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) to Ukraine, according to reports in US media. Last Saturday Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky repeated his request for Western and Nato countries to supply the weaponry. ""I can honestly say our expectations are very high and we have been waiting a long time ... and I hope for a positive response that will allow us to acquire MLRS weapons,"" he said during a press conference in Kyiv. Thanks to this system, ""Ukraine will be able to take steps to liberate its country,"" he added. The powerful M270 system can launch rockets further than any weapons Ukraine currently possesses. What weapons has the US given to Ukraine? Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent Fire crews deal with a fire after shelling at Bakhmut in the Donbas region There is no doubt Ukraine is suffering setbacks in eastern Ukraine. The assessments from President Zelensky sound increasingly bleak. He says Russia is reducing cities to ashes. Earlier this week he said between 50 and 100 Ukrainians were losing their lives every day in the Donbas. Ukraine is certainly outnumbered and outgunned â with relentless Russian artillery bombardments being used to brutal effect over a much smaller area than during the first phase of the war. One Ukrainian official estimated that in some areas of Donbas their forces are outnumbered seven to one. Today UK PM Boris Johnson acknowledged that Russia was making slow but palpable progress in the region. He called for more military support â including providing Ukraine with long range rocket launchers â which the US is now considering too. There has been a lag between some Western promises of weapons and the time it takes to deliver them and to train Ukrainian forces. They could make a difference. But Russia still has much larger stockpiles of artillery ammunition. A senior official of one Nato country said it was âcriminalâ that the West had more limited stocks. Ukraine and Belarus last met in a qualifying game for Euro 2016 - Ukraine won 3-1 in Lviv Teams from Ukraine and Belarus will be kept apart in international football tournaments and European club competitions until further notice, governing body Uefa says. Uefa suspended Russia - and Russian clubs - from its tournaments
following the invasion of Ukraine, but has allowed Belarus to continue competing
despite that country's support of the invasion. Belarus have already been ordered to play home matches behind closed doors on
neutral territory, and now Uefa says it will not permit any meetings between
teams from Belarus and Ukraine to ensure the safety and security of everyone
involved. The news comes the week beforeUkraine's footballers bid to qualify for the World Cup- they play Scotland next Wednesday in a match delayed by the war, with the winners then playing Wales four days later for a spot in the finals in Qatar. Action against sportspeople and teams from Russia and Belarus has been a bone of contention in recent months. The International Olympic Committee's executive board recommended in February that athletes and teams from the two nations should not
be allowed to take part in international competitions. But international tennis ruling bodies have saidno ranking points will be awarded at Wimbledon this yearafter championship organisers said they would exclude Russian and Belarussian players. The French Open, currently taking place, does feature stars from the two countries. More now on thisnews we brought you earlier. Shaun Pinner, 48, and another Brit, 28-year-old Aiden Aslin, were captured in April while defending Ukraine's south-eastern port of Mariupol, which is now in Russian hands. In footage later shown on Russian state TV, both appeared to have facial bruising, prompting their families to call for the Geneva Convention to be respected. Mr Pinner, originally from Bedfordshire, has lived in Ukraine since 2018. Also in April, Russia released a video of a man who it said he was called Andrew Hill and that he had surrendered to Russian troops. The man, who was seen wearing a military camouflage uniform, said he was from Plymouth, and had children and a partner. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged Moscow to treat captured British fighters ""humanely and compassionately"". The Moroccan national was shown in Russian custody by state-run media in April, calling himself Sadun Brahim. He is believed to have studied in Kyiv before Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. The Geneva Convention states that prisoners of war must be protected ""against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity"". If you're just joining us, here are the latest developments from Ukraine: On the ground  Elsewhere  Two UK citizens and a Moroccan, who fought on the Ukrainian side in the country's eastern Donbas region, may face the death penalty, Russian-backed rebels are quoted as saying by Russia's Interfax news agency. Viktor Gavrilov, an official at the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic's (DNR) prosecutor general's office,  says a criminal investigation ""has been completed"" and - taking into account that a war is going on - the accused may be given capital punishment. Gavrilov identified the two captured Brits as Shaun Pinner and Andrew Hill, while the Moroccan national was named as Sadun Brahim. The DNR reportedly introduced the death penalty on the territory seized from Ukraine in 2014. In a call with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday, Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba says the pair discussed American military support for Kyiv. Kuleba says ""heavy weapons"" are top of Ukraine's agenda and wrote that ""more are coming our way"" following the call. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of ""sabotaging"" peace talks with Russia, the Kremlin has said. The comments were apparently made during a 45-minute phone call between the Russian leader and the Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer. According to Moscow's readout of the call, Putin denied that his country's blockade of Ukrainian ports is to blame for disruption to global food supplies, suggesting the real cause were sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union. Austria's Chancellor said the point of the call, described as ""very intense, very serious"", was to establish if potential humanitarian solutions can be found in Ukraine. He also added Putin said he was ready to discuss a prisoner swap with
Ukraine. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg holds up Sweden and Finland's membership applications Talks aimed at overcoming Turkey's objections to Sweden and Finland joining Nato have broken up with no sign of progress. A senior Turkish official said talks between the countries made little headway and told Reuters news agency ""it is not an easy process"". Negotiations will continue but no date has been set for them, the source added. All 30 Nato members, including Turkey, need to approve the applications from Sweden and Finland to join the Western security alliance. But Turkey has challenged both after accusing the two countries of harbouring individuals linked to Kurdish terrorists, a claim denied by Sweden and Finland. Some analysts view Turkey's stance as an attempt to win concessions from other Nato members. A Ukrainian official has been giving more details about the fighting in the city of Severodonetsk. The head of the Severodonetsk district administration, Roman Vlasenko, told the BBC's World At One programme that Ukrainian forces needed more heavy weaponry to drive the Russians out of the city. He said Russian forces did not have a numerical advantage but had more heavy weapons. ""Arms are reaching the front in many areas of Luhansk and
Donetsk regions,"" Vlasenko said. ""But for the counter-offensive to be quick and effective we
need more of them."" He said Russian forces were in the suburbs and trying to take the city from three sides, but had been repulsed from central areas twice in the last three days. This video can not be played District head Roman Vlasenko says troops need more weapons or Russia will overpower them. Russia requires substantial financial resources in order to continue supporting both its economy and its ""special operation"" in Ukraine, the country's finance minister says. ""Money for a special operation"" means ""huge resources"" are needed, Anton Siluanov says at a university event. Moscow officials insist on referring to the invasion of Ukraine as a ""special military operation."" He adds the Russian government will be spending 8 trillion roubles (Â£95.8bn) in the form of an economic stimulus package this year. ""Huge funds. We need these resources to support the economy, support our citizens."" The Russian economy has fared poorly in the last few months afterbeing hammered by Western sanctions, with some forecasts projecting its GDP to shrink by between 8.5% and 15% this year. Up to 90% of the city has been damaged by shelling Russian forces have taken over two-thirds of the perimeter of the front-line city of Severodonetsk, the governor of Luhansk region says. But Serhiy Haidai says the city is not completely surrounded, denying reports by officials from the pro-Moscow self-declared Luhansk People's Republic that Ukrainian forces are cut off there. Severodonetsk is the most easterly major population centre in the Donbas still controlled by Ukraine. Earlier we reported that 60% of the city's housing stock is completely destroyed and up to 90% of buildings are damaged. At least 1,500 people have died there since the invasion began in February. Russia appears to have gained control of most of Lyman in Donetsk region - one of several key locations in eastern Ukraine under intense bombardment. Moscow says its forces are fighting for the ""complete liberation"" of the Donbas, which broadly refers to Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before the invasion. Russia now controls more than 90% of Luhansk and has made significant advances in Donetsk since its invasion on 24 February. See the latest maps and charts here Â© 2025 BBC.

"Sarah Hawkins gave birth to her stillborn daughter Harriet in 2016 A mother whose baby died after mistakes by staff said she felt like she ""was dying"", on the day the NHS trust responsible is ordered to improve its maternity services. The units at Nottingham University Hospitals trust - under review after dozens of baby deaths - have been rated inadequate by the health watchdog. Sarah Hawkins gave birth to her stillborn daughter Harriet in 2016. The trust said it was working hard to make improvements. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said the trust must make immediate improvements to its maternity services, adding there were serious staffing and cultural problems. It comes after it was announced on Thursday that Donna Ockenden, who led an inquiry into maternity failings in Shropshire, is tochair a review of services in Nottingham. The original review was launched followinga number of baby deaths and injuriesbut had faced sustained criticism from families and campaigners over its remit and independence. Mrs Hawkins, who worked at the trust with her husband Jack, had been in labour for six days before she gave birth to her stillborn daughter Harriet at Nottingham City Hospital in 2016. She said they knew something had gone wrong as soon as they were told their baby had died. ""Being two clinicians here at the time we thought 'you've seriously got this wrong' and I was then left for nine hours trying to deliver a dead baby because of communication errors,"" she toldRadio 4's Today programme. ""This whole time, I can't even describe the confusion, I felt like I was dying."" The couple were told their daughter had died from an infection, something they did not believe to be correct. They pushed for an external review, in which it was found the deathhad been preventable. They are one of a number of familieswho have spoken out about their experiencesand called for a public inquiry. Donna Ockenden also chaired an inquiry into maternity services in Shropshire Ms Ockenden told the BBC her first priority was to listen to the families that had been affected. ""Very clearly, the CQC issuing a safety warning notice and the stories that we're all seeing - parents have shared widely - there is clearly something that is very, very wrong at the trust,"" she said. ""I'd say to parents speak up if you have concerns, but you should feel confident that the enhanced scrutiny that there is on the trust can only be positive."" Maternity review sees 387 families come forward Families in maternity inquiry hit out at review Maternity review chair steps down from role NHS maternity services in Nottingham - based at the Nottingham City Hospital and Queen's Medical Centre - were initially rated as inadequate in 2020. Thelatest reports,externalsaid maternity servicesat both sites,externalremained inadequate overall. Inspectors, who visited in March, said the department did not have enough staff to care for women and keep them safe. The CQC noted that at City Hospital, there were 19 serious incidents reported by maternity staff between March 2021 and February 2022. In addition, there are currently five Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch investigations. They also issued a warning notice over safe care and treatment related to observations and triage services. Maternity services run by Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust were rated inadequate after an inspection in 2020 Inspectors said their warning notice was issued as staff were not always carrying out observations to make sure patients' conditions were not deteriorating and that triage wait times were too long. However, the report did say staff were compassionate and kind and there was an improvement in staff morale. Fiona Allinson, CQC's director of operations Midlands network, said: ""It's disappointing that despite several inspections where CQC has told the trust areas they must improve to keep mums and babies safe, serious problems remain."" By Michael Buchanan, social affairs correspondent What's most worrying about this report is that the trust is struggling to deal with issues it has long known about. Back in 2018, the trust board was sent a letter from doctors and midwives saying a lack of staff in its maternity units was endangering patient safety. In 2020, the CQC told the trust that staff didn't always know how to keep women and babies safe. Both of these issues remain ongoing concerns. Following reports like this, trusts often argue that if they weren't in the headlines, they could get on with making improvements. But when the bond with patients has been broken, as it has for many in Nottingham, a laser focus on its actions is often the only reassurance families have that meaningful change is under way. The original review, which has now concluded,published its interim report,externalon Thursday. It said maternity services nationally were ""under immense scrutiny"" in light of reports at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust and Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust. Some evidence of ""bullying behaviour"" had been uncovered, with a small number of staff displaying ""unacceptable behaviours such as being 'rude' and 'abrasive'"". However, it added the ""vast majority"" of staff were committed to ""a caring and compassionate culture"". Sharon Wallis, director of midwifery at NUH, said: ""Our teams are working hard to make the necessary improvements, but recognise we have more to do and are absolutely determined to speed up the pace of change and deliver quality services for women and their families."" The overall rating for both Nottingham City Hospital and Queen's Medical Centre following the CQC inspection remains as requires improvement.

Nuno Espirito Santo's side are the only team to beat the leaders in the league this season and proved to be stubborn challengers again. ""Nottingham Forest have definitely got title ambitions,"" said Morrison on BBC Radio 5 Live's Football Daily podcast. ""To hold the best team in the league is a fantastic result. ""Liverpool came on strong in the last 10 minutes and you have to stick together. To get four points off the team who are probably going to win the league is brilliant. ""It tells us that the title race is still open and other teams will struggle here [at The City Ground]. ""Off the evidence shown in that game, Forest will finish in the Champions League spots."" Listen to the Football Daily podcast on BBC Sounds We asked for your thoughts after Tuesday's Premier League game between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool. Here are some of your comments: Forest fans Peter:Superb in the first half, wilted in the second versus a relentless Liverpool team. Shame it was such a soft goal to concede but a draw is certainly decent. Superb atmosphere as well. John:Outstanding organisation, effort and flair in attack. There are so many key players all playing for each other.  Elliot Anderson is a bit of an unsung hero. Don't know whyNewcastlelet him go but thank you! Doug:A good result for both teams. In a strange way, as a Forest fan, it is a new era feeling a bit disappointed not coming away with the win. Well done, you Reds. Liverpool fans Ken:Slot has done very little wrong since taking the helm, but while he prefers a more measured approach, it is repeatedly throwing up these tepid first halves. The tempo is woefully slow and the passing laborious. It allows the opposition to stay compact. Credit for the eventual changes in the second half, which paid instant dividends and completely changed the flow of the game. Yusuf:It was a game that was a tactical battle in the first half and an absolute cracker in the second. We knew that it would be difficult to score, but our build-up play was good. Wasn't to be Mohamed Salah or Luis Diaz's day, but a step in the right direction. Being able to not get beaten, even if it is a draw, has set Liverpool apart from others this season, particularly against the teams near us at the top. A well-deserved draw for both teams in the end. Lewis:The games are getting harder week by week. I don't think it was great but another hard-won point. I'd give 7/10 for the performance. Nick MashiterBBC Sport football news reporter Nottingham Forest are not going away. A night under the lights at the City Ground should disprove any remaining doubters. Nuno Espirito Santo's side went toe-to-toe with leadersLiverpoolto justify their second place in the Premier League. They are Liverpool's nearest challengers - beforeArsenal'snorth London derby withTottenhamon Wednesday - and while Nuno will always look to keep a lid on expectations his side show no signs of stopping. The City Ground erupted after Chris Wood's opener - which came against the run of play - but still encapsulated the clinical nature of Forest this season. They then dug in and relentlessly fought for every inch. The hosts may have needed three superb Matz Sels saves to keep their point but they were brave, with defender Murillo also excellent, and underlined why they have one of the best defences in the division. There was a tinge of disappointment from the hosts at the point, which shows the standards set this season and the potential trajectory of the squad. Forest remain the only team to beat Liverpool this season in the Premier League and Arne Slot's side will be glad to see the back of them. While Liverpool will take some stopping, Forest are in title contention because they are just six points behind with over half the season done. Even if the trophy is out of reach, a place in the Champions League remains well within their grasp. Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo, talking to TNT Sports:""It was a good game. It was entertaining. ""First half I think we were organised and didn't allow too many situations. The second half was like ping pong and that is when Liverpool become stronger, when they have space and with the speed and talent they have it is very dangerous. ""I am very proud of the team for the way they worked and ran, especially up and down and the sprints to recover and the desire to attack."" On Chris Wood's goal:""It was a beautiful finish. It was clinical. It was good."" On the equaliser:""When Liverpool made the changes, we were also about to make a change. Credit to Liverpool, they had a lot of chances."" On Matz Sels:""He is in a good moment. He is full of confidence and he is keeping us in games. We are very thankful."" On the support:""It is amazing. Today they helped us defend. We didn't have the ball for so much time and they kept supporting us realising how tough the opponent is. The support in the last seven minutes felt like they were giving extra runs to our players."" On being second:""Of course we are satisfied. Especially because of the way the players work. I am so proud. We keep going. We want to enjoy the moment and we are competing very well."" Anthony Elanga assisted Chris Wood for the eighth time in the Premier League - the most one player has assisted another for Nottingham Forest in the competition. Liverpool goalscorer Diogo Jota, speaking to TNT Sports:""I not only score goals but I scored with my first touch today which I felt gave the team a bit of momentum. ""I had one or two more chances and I think I could have given us the three points. Unfortunately I couldn't."" On combining with fellow substitute Konstantinos Tsimikas for the goal:""We were watching the cup goal from a few years ago where he [Tsimikas] passed it to me and so when we were on the touchline we said: 'Let's go now and recreate that, you take the corner' - and it was a goal. ""It was one of those occasions where everything went right. But like I said, I am not happy because I think we could have won."" On Matz Sels' performance:""I was just telling that to my former coaches from Wolves just now. He made two or three great saves. You want to do better but he was good as well."" On their lead at the top:""It's a long way to go in the Premier League. Every ground you go to it's hard. It's one more point but we wanted the three."" Nottingham Forest goalkeeper Matz Sels, speaking to TNT Sports:""One point is a good result for us. Before the game there was a lot of talk from everyone about 'if we win or if we lose' but this was a good scenario for us. We scored a quick goal but then we know it is a small advantage. ""In the second half we knew they would have more spaces between the lines. They are a very good team, they use that space and created a lot of chances. We are happy with the point and are looking forward to Sunday."" On his personal performance:""First half I did not have a lot of work but always against these teams there are a few moments. In the last 20-25 minutes they had quite a few chances. It is important for me to be there to help the team to stay in the game. ""In the end everyone could see that people had cramps and pains which shows that everybody fought for it and we deserved the point. We need to continue looking forward."" On the talk around the team:""We are of course enjoying it. We had just won six times in a row, which is something positive. We need to enjoy these moments. ""We said before the season that if we took 40 points as quick as possible that would be great and we are now on 41 with 17 games to go. We can now aim a little higher and see where we end up by the end of the season."" On challenging for the title:""We are not talking about this. We want to finish as high as possible in the league. A lot of people before the season said we would play against relegation so we need to enjoy the good momentum we are in. We take it game by game."" Were you at the game or following from elsewhere?

Nottingham Forest fan Ben Marshall says the club's supporters have been coy about thinking their side is in the title race - but accepts that could change quickly. ""We've got to be realistic,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast. ""Tonight is a really tough test - it all still feels quite frankly surreal.

""We found them really tough to play against at Anfield and last year was similar,"" he said. ""Arne Slot was surprised earlier in the season that they lost, and I think Liverpool will have a lot more respect for them.

Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster, O'Neill said the absence ofManchester UnitedandTottenhamin the upper echelons of the table strengthens Forest's chances. ""When they are so far adrift at this moment, then you have to start believing if you're a Forest fan that European football, maybe top six, is certainly a possibility,"" said O'Neill, a two-time European Cup winner with Forest. ""If they happen to win at home tonight, Champions League football, daft as it may seem or daft as it may have seemed at the start of the season, is a distinct possibility. ""They are sitting there after 20 games with 40 points. They've got more points now than they had all of last season. It's been a terrific achievement."" Having left Forest in 1981, O'Neill returned in 2019 when he was appointed manager. However, he was sacked after just five months. ""I wasn't there long enough to put the shoes into the room,"" he recalled. ""I was there for 19 games. Strangely enough we won the last three games. ""I came in a January period [but] I didn't spend a penny on a player.

""Just don't listen, find other sources of information,"" Zhanna Agalakova said in an interview with BBC Newsnight. ""It blows my mind how they do it,"" she added. ""How they brainwash their population"" If you're in the UK you can watch the full interview tonight (Friday 27 May) on BBC Two at 22:30 BST. Some more now on Ukraine's request that the US start supplying it with powerful long-range weapon systems to enhance its military capabilities against Russia. On Friday a Pentagon spokesperson announced that ""decisions...haven't been made yet"" but the US is ""mindful"" of the request. The comment comes after CNN published a report that the US was preparing to send Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) to Ukraine. In the past Washington officials had denied the request fearing such long-range weapons could be used to attack targets inside Russia and end up widening and prolonging the conflict. A presenter on Russian state TV responded to the report by claiming the US would be crossing a red line and deliberately provoking Russia if it supplied Ukraine with the weapons. The evacuees left the city in an armoured vehicle Ukraine's police have taken to safety 31 residents - including 13 children - of Ukraine's eastern city of Lysychansk, in what the top regional official describes as one of the most ""difficult evacuations"" in recent days. Luhansk regional head Serhiy Haidai says the officers were initially sent to evacuate seven people, who had previously agreed to leave but - after ""a few hours of persuasion"" - ended up picking up 31 residents. Haidai also says that one vehicle that delivered humanitarian aid to Lysychansk was damaged because of the fighting in the area. Russian forces have been slowly advancing on the twin cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk. Local officials say two-thirds of Severodonetsk is now surrounded. Ukraine is hugely significant for the Russian Orthodox Church, with many parishes and some of its most important monasteries located there The Ukrainian Orthodox Church has declared its ""full autonomy and independence"" from the under Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP), condemning the stance Russian religious leaders have taken on the war in Ukraine. ""We disagree with the position of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow,"" the UOC-MP said in a statement after a council meeting in Kyiv, referring to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC). Kirill has openly voiced support for Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine launched on 24 February. It is the second schism in Ukraine in recent years, with part of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church breaking away from Moscow in 2019. The Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) was then granted a degree of independence, or the tomos, by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Talks on the unification of the Ukrainian Orthodoxy between the UOC-MP and the OCU have so far brought no breakthrough. Ukraine is hugely significant for the ROC, with many parishes and some of its most important monasteries located there.  Russian forces will not capture Luhansk in the coming days but Ukraine may have to evacuate some of its forces there for their own protection, the region's governor has saidon Telegram,external. ""It is possible that in order not to be surrounded we will have to retreat,"" Serhiy Haidai wrote. In an evening military report he also described how dangerous everyday life was in the Ukrainian-controlled areas of Luhansk. Remaining civilians ""are constantly in shelters, it is almost impossible to go outside due to the density of shelling,"" he said. Haidai added that Russian forces have been continuing to target the city of Severodonetsk, where fighting has broken out on the outskirts of the city. Earlier we reported that the US is preparing to offer Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) to Ukraine, according to reports in US media. Last Saturday Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky repeated his request for Western and Nato countries to supply the weaponry. ""I can honestly say our expectations are very high and we have been waiting a long time ... and I hope for a positive response that will allow us to acquire MLRS weapons,"" he said during a press conference in Kyiv. Thanks to this system, ""Ukraine will be able to take steps to liberate its country,"" he added. The powerful M270 system can launch rockets further than any weapons Ukraine currently possesses. What weapons has the US given to Ukraine? Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent Fire crews deal with a fire after shelling at Bakhmut in the Donbas region There is no doubt Ukraine is suffering setbacks in eastern Ukraine. The assessments from President Zelensky sound increasingly bleak. He says Russia is reducing cities to ashes. Earlier this week he said between 50 and 100 Ukrainians were losing their lives every day in the Donbas. Ukraine is certainly outnumbered and outgunned â with relentless Russian artillery bombardments being used to brutal effect over a much smaller area than during the first phase of the war. One Ukrainian official estimated that in some areas of Donbas their forces are outnumbered seven to one. Today UK PM Boris Johnson acknowledged that Russia was making slow but palpable progress in the region. He called for more military support â including providing Ukraine with long range rocket launchers â which the US is now considering too. There has been a lag between some Western promises of weapons and the time it takes to deliver them and to train Ukrainian forces. They could make a difference. But Russia still has much larger stockpiles of artillery ammunition. A senior official of one Nato country said it was âcriminalâ that the West had more limited stocks. Ukraine and Belarus last met in a qualifying game for Euro 2016 - Ukraine won 3-1 in Lviv Teams from Ukraine and Belarus will be kept apart in international football tournaments and European club competitions until further notice, governing body Uefa says. Uefa suspended Russia - and Russian clubs - from its tournaments
following the invasion of Ukraine, but has allowed Belarus to continue competing
despite that country's support of the invasion. Belarus have already been ordered to play home matches behind closed doors on
neutral territory, and now Uefa says it will not permit any meetings between
teams from Belarus and Ukraine to ensure the safety and security of everyone
involved. The news comes the week beforeUkraine's footballers bid to qualify for the World Cup- they play Scotland next Wednesday in a match delayed by the war, with the winners then playing Wales four days later for a spot in the finals in Qatar. Action against sportspeople and teams from Russia and Belarus has been a bone of contention in recent months. The International Olympic Committee's executive board recommended in February that athletes and teams from the two nations should not
be allowed to take part in international competitions. But international tennis ruling bodies have saidno ranking points will be awarded at Wimbledon this yearafter championship organisers said they would exclude Russian and Belarussian players. The French Open, currently taking place, does feature stars from the two countries. More now on thisnews we brought you earlier. Shaun Pinner, 48, and another Brit, 28-year-old Aiden Aslin, were captured in April while defending Ukraine's south-eastern port of Mariupol, which is now in Russian hands. In footage later shown on Russian state TV, both appeared to have facial bruising, prompting their families to call for the Geneva Convention to be respected. Mr Pinner, originally from Bedfordshire, has lived in Ukraine since 2018. Also in April, Russia released a video of a man who it said he was called Andrew Hill and that he had surrendered to Russian troops. The man, who was seen wearing a military camouflage uniform, said he was from Plymouth, and had children and a partner. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged Moscow to treat captured British fighters ""humanely and compassionately"". The Moroccan national was shown in Russian custody by state-run media in April, calling himself Sadun Brahim. He is believed to have studied in Kyiv before Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. The Geneva Convention states that prisoners of war must be protected ""against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity"". If you're just joining us, here are the latest developments from Ukraine: On the ground  Elsewhere  Two UK citizens and a Moroccan, who fought on the Ukrainian side in the country's eastern Donbas region, may face the death penalty, Russian-backed rebels are quoted as saying by Russia's Interfax news agency. Viktor Gavrilov, an official at the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic's (DNR) prosecutor general's office,  says a criminal investigation ""has been completed"" and - taking into account that a war is going on - the accused may be given capital punishment. Gavrilov identified the two captured Brits as Shaun Pinner and Andrew Hill, while the Moroccan national was named as Sadun Brahim. The DNR reportedly introduced the death penalty on the territory seized from Ukraine in 2014. In a call with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday, Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba says the pair discussed American military support for Kyiv. Kuleba says ""heavy weapons"" are top of Ukraine's agenda and wrote that ""more are coming our way"" following the call. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of ""sabotaging"" peace talks with Russia, the Kremlin has said. The comments were apparently made during a 45-minute phone call between the Russian leader and the Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer. According to Moscow's readout of the call, Putin denied that his country's blockade of Ukrainian ports is to blame for disruption to global food supplies, suggesting the real cause were sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union. Austria's Chancellor said the point of the call, described as ""very intense, very serious"", was to establish if potential humanitarian solutions can be found in Ukraine. He also added Putin said he was ready to discuss a prisoner swap with
Ukraine. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg holds up Sweden and Finland's membership applications Talks aimed at overcoming Turkey's objections to Sweden and Finland joining Nato have broken up with no sign of progress. A senior Turkish official said talks between the countries made little headway and told Reuters news agency ""it is not an easy process"". Negotiations will continue but no date has been set for them, the source added. All 30 Nato members, including Turkey, need to approve the applications from Sweden and Finland to join the Western security alliance. But Turkey has challenged both after accusing the two countries of harbouring individuals linked to Kurdish terrorists, a claim denied by Sweden and Finland. Some analysts view Turkey's stance as an attempt to win concessions from other Nato members. A Ukrainian official has been giving more details about the fighting in the city of Severodonetsk. The head of the Severodonetsk district administration, Roman Vlasenko, told the BBC's World At One programme that Ukrainian forces needed more heavy weaponry to drive the Russians out of the city. He said Russian forces did not have a numerical advantage but had more heavy weapons. ""Arms are reaching the front in many areas of Luhansk and
Donetsk regions,"" Vlasenko said. ""But for the counter-offensive to be quick and effective we
need more of them."" He said Russian forces were in the suburbs and trying to take the city from three sides, but had been repulsed from central areas twice in the last three days. This video can not be played District head Roman Vlasenko says troops need more weapons or Russia will overpower them. Russia requires substantial financial resources in order to continue supporting both its economy and its ""special operation"" in Ukraine, the country's finance minister says. ""Money for a special operation"" means ""huge resources"" are needed, Anton Siluanov says at a university event. Moscow officials insist on referring to the invasion of Ukraine as a ""special military operation."" He adds the Russian government will be spending 8 trillion roubles (Â£95.8bn) in the form of an economic stimulus package this year. ""Huge funds. We need these resources to support the economy, support our citizens."" The Russian economy has fared poorly in the last few months afterbeing hammered by Western sanctions, with some forecasts projecting its GDP to shrink by between 8.5% and 15% this year. Up to 90% of the city has been damaged by shelling Russian forces have taken over two-thirds of the perimeter of the front-line city of Severodonetsk, the governor of Luhansk region says. But Serhiy Haidai says the city is not completely surrounded, denying reports by officials from the pro-Moscow self-declared Luhansk People's Republic that Ukrainian forces are cut off there. Severodonetsk is the most easterly major population centre in the Donbas still controlled by Ukraine. Earlier we reported that 60% of the city's housing stock is completely destroyed and up to 90% of buildings are damaged. At least 1,500 people have died there since the invasion began in February. Russia appears to have gained control of most of Lyman in Donetsk region - one of several key locations in eastern Ukraine under intense bombardment. Moscow says its forces are fighting for the ""complete liberation"" of the Donbas, which broadly refers to Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before the invasion. Russia now controls more than 90% of Luhansk and has made significant advances in Donetsk since its invasion on 24 February. See the latest maps and charts here Â© 2025 BBC.

"Boris Johnson visited the CityFibre Training Academy in Stockton-on-Tees on Friday Two more Tory MPs have revealed they have submitted letters of no confidence in Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Ex-minister Steve Brine and Anne Marie Morris join the six Tory MPs to call for him to go since the Sue Gray report was published last Wednesday. Ms Gray's report details widespread rule-breaking in Downing Street during Covid lockdowns. Overall, the BBC is aware of at least 20 Tory MPs who have submitted letters of no confidence. This is short of the 54 needed to force a vote on the PM's future. although the actual number of letters could be higher. Only Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers, knows the exact number, and he is not expected to say anything until the 54 threshold has been reached. In a statement to constituents, Winchester MP Brine said he could no longer ""defend the indefensible"" as ""rule makers cannot be rule breakers"". On Friday, MP Paul Holmes quit his government job, saying he was ""shocked and appalled"" by events at No 10. Mr Holmes resigned as a parliamentary private secretary - a ministerial aide - to Home Secretary Priti Patel. He told the BBC he felt ""deeply uncomfortable"" over the findings inMs Gray's long-awaited report, which was published this week. Former junior minister Sir Bob Neill also called on the prime minister to quit over the report and submitted a letter of no confidence. Sir Bob, the Tory MP for Bromley & Chislehurst, said the report had ""highlighted a pattern of wholly unacceptable behaviour"". How much political danger is Boris Johnson in? Sue Gray reportâs key findings at a glance How many fines have there been over Partygate? And another of the 2019 intake of Conservative MPs, Alicia Kearns, issued a statement,reiterating that her position is ""unchanged"" since January, saying that the prime minister ""continues not to hold my confidence"". The MP for Rutland and Melton said she could only conclude that ""the prime minister's account of events to Parliament was misleading"", adding that the ""protracted affair has brought our government and my party into disrepute"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions on Friday, Treasury minister John Glen said the prime minister was in ""yellow card territory"" but said he would continue to ""get on and deliver"" as part of the government. In her report, Ms Gray said many events held during Covid restrictions ""should not have been allowed"" and the prime minister and his officials ""must bear responsibility for this culture"". She also found ""multiple examples of a lack of respect and poor treatment"" of security staff and cleaners by officials when gatherings took place. Sir Bob told the BBC he had made his decision to call on Mr Johnson to resign after speaking to constituents, adding he was ""not part of any campaign group"" to unseat the PM. He added what had gone on had ""eroded trust"" in government, and he found Mr Johnson's explanation he was unaware of the nature of parties in No 10 not credible. ""I can't believe he was not aware about at least some of what was going on,"" he added. This video can not be played Conservative MP Paul Holmes explains why he is stepping down from his Home Office role. Eastleigh MP Mr Holmes said his work for constituents had been ""tarnished by the toxic culture that seemed to have permeated No 10."" But speaking to BBC South Today, Mr Holmes insisted his resignation was ""not about the leadership, this is not about letters or the 1922 committee"". Ms Gray's report follows a four-month Metropolitan Police inquiry that saw 126 fines issued to 83 people - including Mr Johnson, his wife Carrie and Chancellor Rishi Sunak - for events that took place in 2020 and 2021. Before Mr Holmes announced his resignation, Mr Johnson told reporters he was confident he has enough support within his party to stay in post - but he deflected questions on whether he had tolerated the culture of heavy drinking and rule-breaking highlighted by Ms Gray's report. ""If you look at the answers in the House of Commons over more than two hours, I think you'll be able to see I answered that very, very extensively,"" said the PM. This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins onâ¦ The Sue Gray report Elected as MP at the 2019 general election, Mr Holmes has been a parliamentary private secretary to Ms Patel since September 2021. The unpaid role is the bottom rung of the government ladder, and is often seen as a way for newer MPs to gain experience of working with ministers. His resignation - announcedin a statement,external- made him the second Tory to have left a government post over the Partygate saga. In April, Lord David Wolfsonquit as a justice minister, saying the ""scale, context and nature"" of Covid breaches in government was inconsistent with his responsibility to uphold the rule of law.

"Sarah Hawkins gave birth to her stillborn daughter Harriet in 2016 A mother whose baby died after mistakes by staff said she felt like she ""was dying"", on the day the NHS trust responsible is ordered to improve its maternity services. The units at Nottingham University Hospitals trust - under review after dozens of baby deaths - have been rated inadequate by the health watchdog. Sarah Hawkins gave birth to her stillborn daughter Harriet in 2016. The trust said it was working hard to make improvements. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said the trust must make immediate improvements to its maternity services, adding there were serious staffing and cultural problems. It comes after it was announced on Thursday that Donna Ockenden, who led an inquiry into maternity failings in Shropshire, is tochair a review of services in Nottingham. The original review was launched followinga number of baby deaths and injuriesbut had faced sustained criticism from families and campaigners over its remit and independence. Mrs Hawkins, who worked at the trust with her husband Jack, had been in labour for six days before she gave birth to her stillborn daughter Harriet at Nottingham City Hospital in 2016. She said they knew something had gone wrong as soon as they were told their baby had died. ""Being two clinicians here at the time we thought 'you've seriously got this wrong' and I was then left for nine hours trying to deliver a dead baby because of communication errors,"" she toldRadio 4's Today programme. ""This whole time, I can't even describe the confusion, I felt like I was dying."" The couple were told their daughter had died from an infection, something they did not believe to be correct. They pushed for an external review, in which it was found the deathhad been preventable. They are one of a number of familieswho have spoken out about their experiencesand called for a public inquiry. Donna Ockenden also chaired an inquiry into maternity services in Shropshire Ms Ockenden told the BBC her first priority was to listen to the families that had been affected. ""Very clearly, the CQC issuing a safety warning notice and the stories that we're all seeing - parents have shared widely - there is clearly something that is very, very wrong at the trust,"" she said. ""I'd say to parents speak up if you have concerns, but you should feel confident that the enhanced scrutiny that there is on the trust can only be positive."" Maternity review sees 387 families come forward Families in maternity inquiry hit out at review Maternity review chair steps down from role NHS maternity services in Nottingham - based at the Nottingham City Hospital and Queen's Medical Centre - were initially rated as inadequate in 2020. Thelatest reports,externalsaid maternity servicesat both sites,externalremained inadequate overall. Inspectors, who visited in March, said the department did not have enough staff to care for women and keep them safe. The CQC noted that at City Hospital, there were 19 serious incidents reported by maternity staff between March 2021 and February 2022. In addition, there are currently five Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch investigations. They also issued a warning notice over safe care and treatment related to observations and triage services. Maternity services run by Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust were rated inadequate after an inspection in 2020 Inspectors said their warning notice was issued as staff were not always carrying out observations to make sure patients' conditions were not deteriorating and that triage wait times were too long. However, the report did say staff were compassionate and kind and there was an improvement in staff morale. Fiona Allinson, CQC's director of operations Midlands network, said: ""It's disappointing that despite several inspections where CQC has told the trust areas they must improve to keep mums and babies safe, serious problems remain."" By Michael Buchanan, social affairs correspondent What's most worrying about this report is that the trust is struggling to deal with issues it has long known about. Back in 2018, the trust board was sent a letter from doctors and midwives saying a lack of staff in its maternity units was endangering patient safety. In 2020, the CQC told the trust that staff didn't always know how to keep women and babies safe. Both of these issues remain ongoing concerns. Following reports like this, trusts often argue that if they weren't in the headlines, they could get on with making improvements. But when the bond with patients has been broken, as it has for many in Nottingham, a laser focus on its actions is often the only reassurance families have that meaningful change is under way. The original review, which has now concluded,published its interim report,externalon Thursday. It said maternity services nationally were ""under immense scrutiny"" in light of reports at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust and Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust. Some evidence of ""bullying behaviour"" had been uncovered, with a small number of staff displaying ""unacceptable behaviours such as being 'rude' and 'abrasive'"". However, it added the ""vast majority"" of staff were committed to ""a caring and compassionate culture"". Sharon Wallis, director of midwifery at NUH, said: ""Our teams are working hard to make the necessary improvements, but recognise we have more to do and are absolutely determined to speed up the pace of change and deliver quality services for women and their families."" The overall rating for both Nottingham City Hospital and Queen's Medical Centre following the CQC inspection remains as requires improvement.

"Ian Fenn and Chloe on their local high street An autistic man is taking supermarket giant Sainsbury's to court for refusing entry to his assistance cat. Designer and writer Ian Fenn from London says the ban on Chloe, who helps him in daily life, is limiting his independence. He says she helps him stay calm, but the supermarket argues that cats, unlike assistance dogs, present risks to food hygiene. The case might set a legal precedent if it has to be ruled on by top judges. Sainsbury's says it is working with an environmental health team to find out how Ian and his cat can visit safely. Man with guide dog refused supermarket access twice How are emotional support animals allowed on flights? This video can not be played Watch the moment Ian Fenn is told he must leave Chloe outside Ian was recently diagnosed with autism after many years of struggling with anxiety in busy or noisy environments. He has trained Chloe to help him manage his way through daily life after discovering on a train journey that her presence improved what would otherwise have been a stressful situation. When we meet Ian and Chloe in a south London pub, she's sitting on a small, dedicated mat beside him on the sofa, gazing intently at the drinkers. She wears a ""service cat"" jacket and occasionally nibbles treats. Over the course of an hour, she occasionally looks around, but does not leave the mat once. Outside the pub, she sits on Ian's shoulder or walks around on a lead. Chloe joins Ian on local buses ""I realised that my life was a lot better with her being around - there's a lot of autistic people suffering from depression. I'm not alone any more,"" he says. ""I get sensory overload in busy environments and tend to shut down. But with Chloe I can focus on her. ""She brings structure to my life, she wakes me up in the morning, she tells me when to go to bed. It's difficult to know how she feels about the relationship, but I feel that we're a team now."" This year, she's been to more than 30 different restaurants and pubs, numerous public attractions, a hospital and on scores of trains and buses. Ian contacts business owners or operators in advance - but Chloe is not universally accepted. She also joins him at a local pub for a bit of relaxation In March, the pair visited a Sainsbury's in Clapham, south London after thinking he had been given permission. But security and store staff told him he needed to leave his cat outside. ""I ended up becoming quite upset,"" he says. ""I got to the point where I couldn't actually remember why I was in the store and what I needed to buy. ""It affected my confidence significantly. I stayed in the house for two weeks before I got the confidence back to go out."" The store was the first rejection from a major supermarket. A nearby Tesco lets Ian visit, as the BBC witnessed.  After Ian complained, Sainsbury's told him it would only allow assistance dogs into its stores. It said that while Chloe may be well-behaved, if it altered its general policy it could present a risk of other more unruly cats causing havoc - and it would have no way of assessing an animal's behaviour or training. And this is where the matter has become a potentially complicated courtroom fight: The law on assistance animals is not clear cut. Banned from Sainsburys: Ian was told Chloe couldn't come in Ian's view is that Chloe is a properly-trained assistance animal who is an essential ""auxiliary aid"" - a legal term for something that is providing support for someone with a disability. Under the Equality Act 2010, business owners have a duty to make a reasonable adjustment so as to ensure that someone who has a disability is not placed at a substantial disadvantage. The UK's definition of a disability includes autism, because the condition can be shown to affect day-to-day life. An assistance pony being trained on Newcastle upon Tyne's Metro in 2019 In a statement, Sainsbury's said: ""We want to be an inclusive retailer where people love to work and shop and understand that some of our colleagues and customers may need support in our stores. ""At the same time, safety is our highest priority and our colleagues are trained to balance maintaining our high food hygiene standards with supporting all our customers who shop with us. ""We are in contact with the local environmental health team to see if there are ways we can help Mr Fenn to visit our store without compromising this."" Ian does not agree that the supermarket's current stance is reasonable and that is why he plans to argue his case before a judge. ""I appreciate a bloke wandering around with a cat is a bit unusual,"" he says. ""The reality is that I don't want that attention. What I want to do is just run my life normally. So when somebody says, 'No, you can't, because you have this creature that is helping you,' it's really upsetting."" Chris Fry, one of the UK's leading disability rights lawyers, is representing Ian. ""The key and fundamental principles are that service providers have a legal obligation to provide reasonable adjustments to accommodate disabled customers,"" he says. ""Guide dogs are seen as being established as a reasonable or an auxiliary aid to help disabled customers. ""But there's never been anything specific in relation to anything other than a support dog in this country."" There have been assistance horses in service in the UK - but it has been a much hotter topic in the United States. The US government has tightened up rules on emotional support animals Four years ago, American airlines recorded 751,000 requests to take emotional support animals on flights - including miniature horses and a turkey. The matter turned into a national media debate when a passenger was banned from taking their support peacock on a plane. Ultimately, the US's national air transport rules were tightened upto ban emotional support animalsother than dogs. While US law is different, Chris says similar legal questions need to be explored in the UK as society's understanding of disability equality and rights develops. He says Ian can show the training he has provided Chloe - and a business should take that into account. But would a win mean anyone could take their trained gerbil or rabbit to the weekly shop? ""Cases like this provide clarity - for businesses and for individuals alike,"" says Chris. ""I think the court will be concerned to make sure that if this case goes as far as final judgment, that it will set out some guidelines to help address issues.""

"The National Rifle Association (NRA) is holding its annual meeting in Indianapolis, with former US President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis due to address delegates. The meeting is taking place amid increasing calls for tighter US gun laws in the wake ofa record number of mass shootings in 2023. According to theGun Violence Archive,external, there have been 146 mass shootings in the country since January. Founded in 1871 as a recreational group designed to ""promote and encourage rifle shooting"", the National Rifle Association has grown into one of the most powerful political organisations in the US. It lobbies heavily against all forms of gun control and argues aggressively that more guns make the country safer. It relies on, and staunchly defends, a disputed interpretation of the Second Amendment to the US Constitution, which it argues gives US citizens the rights to bear arms. It directly funds US politicians and lawmakers who support its aims. Chief executive Wayne LaPierre has run the NRA since 1991. The group is currently in legal difficulties, having been locked in a court battle with New York's Attorney General since 2020. Letitia Jamesalleges that in the past the organisation diverted millions of dollarsto leaders including Mr LaPierre for their personal use. She is suing Mr LaPierre for millions of dollars he has been paid by the NRA, and wants the organisation to face financial monitoring. The NRA has described her lawsuit as a ""baseless, premeditated attack"". Estimates of the NRA's membership vary widely. The association claimed that membership rose to nearly to five million in response to the mass shooting at Sandy Hook school in 2012. However, some analysts put the figure at closer to three million. There are frequent protests outside the NRA's headquarters in Virginia Current NRA members include former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, and actors Tom Selleck and Whoopi Goldberg. Former vice-president Mike Pence is expected to join Mr Trump and Mr DeSantis in Indianapolis for the 2023 meeting. In 2022, the NRAreceived $97m (Â£78m) from membership dues,external. That is down by more than 40% from its peak year, 2018. The organisation blamed the Covid pandemic for the fall. However, the NRA still has a substantial budget which it uses to try and influence US politicians on gun policy. In 2021, itspent $4.2m on lobbying,external, according to non-partisan US research firm OpenSecrets. OpenSecrets' figures suggest that since 2010, the NRA has directed more than $140m to pro-gun election candidates. The NRA also has considerable influence via its membership, many of whom will vote for a candidate based solely on their stance on guns. It grades members of Congress from A to F on their perceived friendliness to gun rights. Those ratings can cost pro-gun control candidates their seats. For decades, the NRA has aggressively opposed measures which would restrict gun ownership, despite a series of high profile mass shootings, including many in schools. The late actor Charlton Heston - a former NRA president - famously held a rifle over his head following the 1999 Columbine High School mass shooting, telling gun control advocates they would have to take  the weapon ""from my cold, dead hands"". Actor Charlton Heston was a long-serving NRA president On 27 March,six people including three children were killed at a school in Nashville. The NRA responded bycalling for more security in schools,external, rather than restrictions on gun ownership. The Nashville attack was the worst mass shooting at a US school since 19 children and two adults were killedin Uvalde, Texas, in May 2022. The NRA held its 2022 meeting in nearby Houston only days after the Uvalde attack, despite widespread calls to cancel the event. In 2018, it backed a call by then-president Donald Trump toarm teachers and other members of staff,externalto deter gun attacks - although many teachers do not want to be armed.

"This video can not be played The prime minster described the help package as a 'big bazooka' Boris Johnson has said the Â£15bn package unveiled by the chancellor to help people with soaring energy bills has been targeted at the poorest homes. Labour says some of the money will go to better-off people not in hardship. Speaking in County Durham, the prime minister insisted it would ""overwhelmingly"" support the most vulnerable households. But he said he was ""not going to pretend this is going to fix everything for everybody immediately"". He insisted the measures, which he described as a ""big bazooka"", were ""massively redistributive"", adding that three quarters of those that would benefit would be the most vulnerable. Visiting Stockton-on-Tees, Mr Johnson also said the help was ""much more generous"" than what Labour had proposed, giving Â£1,200 to eight million households. How will I get the Â£400 promised for energy bills? What was behind Sunak's mini Budget? How plans to tackle cost of living will affect you Is the government package really worth Â£37bn? Earlier this week, UK energy regulator Ofgem said the typical household energy bill was set to rise by Â£800 in October, bringing it to Â£2,800 a year. Bills rose by Â£700 on average in April. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the Â£15bn package on Thursday, following weeks of pressure to act from Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP. Part-funded by a 25% windfall tax on gas and oil company profits, all households will get Â£400 off their energy bills this October, and there will be further help for those most in need. Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves told BBC Breakfast the windfall tax meant the government had ""finally come to their senses"", but asked: ""What took them so long?"" The opposition has broadly welcomed the extra help, but says it is poorly targeted, too long in coming, and will funnel extra cash to people who do not need it. Because the money is being paid directly to every household, people who own second or third homes will get multiple Â£400 payments. But the Treasury said Labour's call for a cut to VAT on fuel  - another of Sir Keir Starmer's key demands - would have benefited better-off households even more. Labour's Rachel Reeves said second home owners should not get extra benefits from the energy bill discount Responding to Labour's criticisms, Mr Sunak said second homes accounted for only ""one or two per cent of the property stock"" across the UK. He suggested that wealthy individuals donate the Â£400 they will save on bills to charity, adding that he had done so himself. ""I'm sure you will join me in giving that money to charity,"" he said on ITV's Good Morning Britain. He called the tax and the cost-of-living help measures ""temporary"". But the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank says calls for assistance are likely to continue for at least another year, with bills expected to keep rising into 2023. Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme if he planned another emergency package next year, even if it meant more government borrowing and higher taxes, the chancellor said: ""I've always been prepared to respond to the situation on the ground"". He added:  ""We will be able to combat and reduce inflation. We have the tools at our disposal and after time it will come down."" Some Conservative MPs have criticised the use of a windfall tax to help fund assistance with bills, with the national debt - pushed higher by furlough and other help during the pandemic -currently standing at around Â£2.3 trillion.,external One MP, Richard Drax, accused the chancellor of ""throwing red meat to socialists"", while another, Craig Mackinlay, described the policy as ""tripe"". But Mr Sunak insisted he remained a ""fiscal conservative"" and wanted to manage the UK's finances ""responsibly"". The Resolution Foundation, a think tank which focuses on people on lower incomes,described the measures,externalas ""a big and well-targeted package"" that would ""offset 82% of the rise in households' energy costs in 2022-23, rising to over 90% for poorer households"". Because higher income households had already seen major tax rises, it added, the overall effect of changes to taxes and benefits this year would be ""highly progressive"".

"UK Trade Minister Ranil Jayawardena will sign the deal in the US state of Indiana on Friday The UK is to sign its first trade agreement with an individual US state, with more expected this year as it attempts to show post-Brexit progress. The Memorandum of Understanding with Indiana seeks to boost the Â£1.1bn ($1.4bn) worth of goods the state already buys from the UK. Trade Minister Ranil Jayawardena will sign the agreement with the Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb on Friday. But opposition parties said it was no substitute for a UK-US trade deal. The UK government is looking to strike agreements with about 20 states after talks on a broader US-wide trade deal stalled. International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said the Indiana agreement ""will help deliver value to UK businesses and support our areas of shared interest, such as levelling up"". What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? US negotiator's plea ahead of possible trade deal Brexit and Northern Ireland: What does each side want? Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government once saw the prospect of a trade deal with the US as a whole as one of the biggest prizes of leaving the European Union. But hopes of a quick deal have faded since US President Joe Biden took office and raised concerns about the UK's handling of post-Brexit trade arrangements in Northern Ireland. Instead, the UK's Department for International Trade is pushing for agreements with individual US states and cities, to help improve trade relations. The agreement with Indiana is a memorandum of understanding (MoU), which is a document that sets out the key points of a non-binding economic partnership between two parties. International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said the deal will deliver value to UK businesses The UK says,externalits agreement with Indiana - a Midwestern state - will remove barriers to trade and pave the way for businesses to invest, export and create jobs. Opportunities in areas such as renewable energy, advanced manufacturing and pharmaceuticals will be available to businesses under the agreement, the UK says. It says the agreement would also streamline procurement processes, enable academics to collaborate more easily, and ensure that professional qualifications were recognized on both sides. In 2019,the UK was the seventh largest export market for Indiana,external, which has a gross domestic product (GDP) of about $350bn and a large manufacturing sector. The agreement was the ""first of many"" the UK would sign ""as we look to bolster our Â£200bn trading relationship with the US"", Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt said. Writing for the Conservative Home website,external, she said agreements with almost half of the 50 US states would follow, including Oklahoma, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas. Usually trade deals with the US are signed at a national level, between central governments. But the US government under President Biden has not made a firm commitment to a full free-trade deal with the UK, despite historic ties between the two countries. Labour's Shadow International Trade Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the Conservatives had promised a comprehensive US-UK free-trade agreement by the end of 2022. ""With less than seven months to go it seems that this will be another broken promise from this government,"" he said. Sarah Olney, Liberal Democrat MP and party spokesperson for trade, said the Indiana agreement ""makes a mockery of the government's promise for Global Britain"". She said Mr Johnson had ""utterly failed to secure the US trade deal he said he would, being left to negotiate with one state at a time with his tail between his legs"". SNP international trade spokesperson Drew Hendry said the PM had no chance of striking a US-wide deal while he continued his ""reckless games"" over post-Brexit trade in Northern Ireland. He added that ""piecemeal"" agreements with individual US states would do ""little to mitigate the huge damage caused by the Tories' chaotic Brexit"". The situation in Northern Ireland, where a dispute over a post-Brexit trade deal has created a block on forming its devolved government, has been a source on tension between the UK and US. The deal - known as the protocol - is a special arrangement that keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods, avoiding a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. The UK has proposed legislationthat would allow ministers to scrap some of the rules governing trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. But some US lawmakers, who must approve trade agreements, have said they would not support one with the UK if its actions jeopardised the peace process in Northern Ireland. Last weekHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said,externalshe was ""deeply concerned"" that the UK was seeking to ""unilaterally discard"" the protocol.

"Fast fashion retailer Missguided is on the brink of collapse after being issued with a winding-up petition by creditors. It is understood the business, which has about 330 staff, could call in administrators as early as Monday. Missguided was rescued last autumn by the finance firm Alteri Investors. It has suffered from supply chain problems, rising freight costs and increasing competition from rivals like Boohoo and Chinese firm Shein. In recent weeks Alteri has been trying to secure a sale of the fast-fashion business. Insolvency specialists Teneo are advising Alteri on strategic options for the business and it is understood they are ready to step in as administrators if a solvent solution cannot be found. Any buyer may likely try to do a deal via what is known as a pre-pack administration, which allows an insolvent firm to sell its assets to a bidder. Boohoo hit as shoppers return more clothes Europe reveals fast fashion crackdown According to a report in the i newspaper,external, police were called to Missguided's Manchester headquarters after suppliers turned up earlier this week demanding overdue payments. Supplier JSK Fashions issued a winding up petition on 10 May. A creditor - in this case one of Missguided's suppliers - can apply to a court to close a company if it is unable to pay its debts. The idea is the firm's assets are sold and those who are owed money will be paid. The i said that three suppliers for Missguided warned they are at risk of going under due to outstanding payments. A Missguided spokesperson said: ""Missguided is aware of the action being taken by certain creditors of the company in recent days and is working urgently to address this. A process to identify a buyer with the required resources and platform for the business commenced in April and we expect to provide an update on progress of that process in the near future."" The business was founded by Nitin Passi in 2009 and grew to become one of the UK's biggest online fast-fashion players. The brand later expanded into Europe, the US and Australia and now ships to more than 180 countries. However, in the last few years the business has struggled to make a profit and in December Alteri announced redundancies as part of a turnaround plan. Mr Passi stepped down as chief executive in April. The firm began as a purely online retailer before adding several bricks-and mortar stores, including a flagship store in east London's Westfield shopping centre in 2016.

"Ukrainian troops could withdraw from their final pockets of resistance in the eastern Luhansk region, an official there says Russia is trying to encircle Ukrainian forces in Severodonetsk and Lysychansk as it tries to capture the Donbas region Civilians in Severodonetsk ""are constantly in shelters, it is almost impossible to go outside due to the density of shelling,"" said governor Serhiy Haidai Earlier Ukrainian officials said Russian-backed forces had taken control of the city of Lyman in the eastern Donetsk region The Pentagon says it is ""mindful"" of Ukrainian requests for long-range weapons, something Russian state TV called a red line The Moscow-backed branch of Ukraine's Orthodox Church severs ties with Russia, saying its leaders have failed to condemn the war We're pausing our live coverage of the Ukraine war for now, but will be resuming on Saturday. Thanks for joining us. Our editors today were Thom Poole, Chris Giles and James Clarke. Our writers were James FitzGerald, Emily McGarvey, Robert Greenall, Jeremy Gahagan, Leo Sands and Yaroslav Lukov. You can read more of one of our main stories today - the possible withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from the big eastern city of Severodonetsk -here. If you're just joining us, or need a quick recap, here's the latest with what's been happening in Ukraine on Friday: Russia captures Lyman  Luhansk  Long-range weapons  Church schism This video can not be played 'Switch off the TV': Former Russian-state TV journalist's plea to Russia A journalist who quit her job at Russian state-controlled TV channel back in March over the invasion of Ukraine has told Russian audiences to switch off their television sets. ""Just don't listen, find other sources of information,"" Zhanna Agalakova said in an interview with BBC Newsnight. ""It blows my mind how they do it,"" she added. ""How they brainwash their population"" If you're in the UK you can watch the full interview tonight (Friday 27 May) on BBC Two at 22:30 BST. Some more now on Ukraine's request that the US start supplying it with powerful long-range weapon systems to enhance its military capabilities against Russia. On Friday a Pentagon spokesperson announced that ""decisions...haven't been made yet"" but the US is ""mindful"" of the request. The comment comes after CNN published a report that the US was preparing to send Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) to Ukraine. In the past Washington officials had denied the request fearing such long-range weapons could be used to attack targets inside Russia and end up widening and prolonging the conflict. A presenter on Russian state TV responded to the report by claiming the US would be crossing a red line and deliberately provoking Russia if it supplied Ukraine with the weapons. The evacuees left the city in an armoured vehicle Ukraine's police have taken to safety 31 residents - including 13 children - of Ukraine's eastern city of Lysychansk, in what the top regional official describes as one of the most ""difficult evacuations"" in recent days. Luhansk regional head Serhiy Haidai says the officers were initially sent to evacuate seven people, who had previously agreed to leave but - after ""a few hours of persuasion"" - ended up picking up 31 residents. Haidai also says that one vehicle that delivered humanitarian aid to Lysychansk was damaged because of the fighting in the area. Russian forces have been slowly advancing on the twin cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk. Local officials say two-thirds of Severodonetsk is now surrounded. Ukraine is hugely significant for the Russian Orthodox Church, with many parishes and some of its most important monasteries located there The Ukrainian Orthodox Church has declared its ""full autonomy and independence"" from the under Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP), condemning the stance Russian religious leaders have taken on the war in Ukraine. ""We disagree with the position of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow,"" the UOC-MP said in a statement after a council meeting in Kyiv, referring to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC). Kirill has openly voiced support for Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine launched on 24 February. It is the second schism in Ukraine in recent years, with part of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church breaking away from Moscow in 2019. The Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) was then granted a degree of independence, or the tomos, by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Talks on the unification of the Ukrainian Orthodoxy between the UOC-MP and the OCU have so far brought no breakthrough. Ukraine is hugely significant for the ROC, with many parishes and some of its most important monasteries located there.  Russian forces will not capture Luhansk in the coming days but Ukraine may have to evacuate some of its forces there for their own protection, the region's governor has saidon Telegram,external. ""It is possible that in order not to be surrounded we will have to retreat,"" Serhiy Haidai wrote. In an evening military report he also described how dangerous everyday life was in the Ukrainian-controlled areas of Luhansk. Remaining civilians ""are constantly in shelters, it is almost impossible to go outside due to the density of shelling,"" he said. Haidai added that Russian forces have been continuing to target the city of Severodonetsk, where fighting has broken out on the outskirts of the city. Earlier we reported that the US is preparing to offer Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) to Ukraine, according to reports in US media. Last Saturday Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky repeated his request for Western and Nato countries to supply the weaponry. ""I can honestly say our expectations are very high and we have been waiting a long time ... and I hope for a positive response that will allow us to acquire MLRS weapons,"" he said during a press conference in Kyiv. Thanks to this system, ""Ukraine will be able to take steps to liberate its country,"" he added. The powerful M270 system can launch rockets further than any weapons Ukraine currently possesses. What weapons has the US given to Ukraine? Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent Fire crews deal with a fire after shelling at Bakhmut in the Donbas region There is no doubt Ukraine is suffering setbacks in eastern Ukraine. The assessments from President Zelensky sound increasingly bleak. He says Russia is reducing cities to ashes. Earlier this week he said between 50 and 100 Ukrainians were losing their lives every day in the Donbas. Ukraine is certainly outnumbered and outgunned â with relentless Russian artillery bombardments being used to brutal effect over a much smaller area than during the first phase of the war. One Ukrainian official estimated that in some areas of Donbas their forces are outnumbered seven to one. Today UK PM Boris Johnson acknowledged that Russia was making slow but palpable progress in the region. He called for more military support â including providing Ukraine with long range rocket launchers â which the US is now considering too. There has been a lag between some Western promises of weapons and the time it takes to deliver them and to train Ukrainian forces. They could make a difference. But Russia still has much larger stockpiles of artillery ammunition. A senior official of one Nato country said it was âcriminalâ that the West had more limited stocks. Ukraine and Belarus last met in a qualifying game for Euro 2016 - Ukraine won 3-1 in Lviv Teams from Ukraine and Belarus will be kept apart in international football tournaments and European club competitions until further notice, governing body Uefa says. Uefa suspended Russia - and Russian clubs - from its tournaments
following the invasion of Ukraine, but has allowed Belarus to continue competing
despite that country's support of the invasion. Belarus have already been ordered to play home matches behind closed doors on
neutral territory, and now Uefa says it will not permit any meetings between
teams from Belarus and Ukraine to ensure the safety and security of everyone
involved. The news comes the week beforeUkraine's footballers bid to qualify for the World Cup- they play Scotland next Wednesday in a match delayed by the war, with the winners then playing Wales four days later for a spot in the finals in Qatar. Action against sportspeople and teams from Russia and Belarus has been a bone of contention in recent months. The International Olympic Committee's executive board recommended in February that athletes and teams from the two nations should not
be allowed to take part in international competitions. But international tennis ruling bodies have saidno ranking points will be awarded at Wimbledon this yearafter championship organisers said they would exclude Russian and Belarussian players. The French Open, currently taking place, does feature stars from the two countries. More now on thisnews we brought you earlier. Shaun Pinner, 48, and another Brit, 28-year-old Aiden Aslin, were captured in April while defending Ukraine's south-eastern port of Mariupol, which is now in Russian hands. In footage later shown on Russian state TV, both appeared to have facial bruising, prompting their families to call for the Geneva Convention to be respected. Mr Pinner, originally from Bedfordshire, has lived in Ukraine since 2018. Also in April, Russia released a video of a man who it said he was called Andrew Hill and that he had surrendered to Russian troops. The man, who was seen wearing a military camouflage uniform, said he was from Plymouth, and had children and a partner. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged Moscow to treat captured British fighters ""humanely and compassionately"". The Moroccan national was shown in Russian custody by state-run media in April, calling himself Sadun Brahim. He is believed to have studied in Kyiv before Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. The Geneva Convention states that prisoners of war must be protected ""against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity"". If you're just joining us, here are the latest developments from Ukraine: On the ground  Elsewhere  Two UK citizens and a Moroccan, who fought on the Ukrainian side in the country's eastern Donbas region, may face the death penalty, Russian-backed rebels are quoted as saying by Russia's Interfax news agency. Viktor Gavrilov, an official at the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic's (DNR) prosecutor general's office,  says a criminal investigation ""has been completed"" and - taking into account that a war is going on - the accused may be given capital punishment. Gavrilov identified the two captured Brits as Shaun Pinner and Andrew Hill, while the Moroccan national was named as Sadun Brahim. The DNR reportedly introduced the death penalty on the territory seized from Ukraine in 2014. In a call with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday, Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba says the pair discussed American military support for Kyiv. Kuleba says ""heavy weapons"" are top of Ukraine's agenda and wrote that ""more are coming our way"" following the call. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

So far the US has refused pleas to provide Ukraine with the longer-range systems, reportedly fearing that they could be used to attack sites inside Russia thereby expanding the conflict.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of ""sabotaging"" peace talks with Russia, the Kremlin has said. The comments were apparently made during a 45-minute phone call between the Russian leader and the Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer. According to Moscow's readout of the call, Putin denied that his country's blockade of Ukrainian ports is to blame for disruption to global food supplies, suggesting the real cause were sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union. Austria's Chancellor said the point of the call, described as ""very intense, very serious"", was to establish if potential humanitarian solutions can be found in Ukraine. He also added Putin said he was ready to discuss a prisoner swap with
Ukraine. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg holds up Sweden and Finland's membership applications Talks aimed at overcoming Turkey's objections to Sweden and Finland joining Nato have broken up with no sign of progress. A senior Turkish official said talks between the countries made little headway and told Reuters news agency ""it is not an easy process"". Negotiations will continue but no date has been set for them, the source added. All 30 Nato members, including Turkey, need to approve the applications from Sweden and Finland to join the Western security alliance. But Turkey has challenged both after accusing the two countries of harbouring individuals linked to Kurdish terrorists, a claim denied by Sweden and Finland. Some analysts view Turkey's stance as an attempt to win concessions from other Nato members. A Ukrainian official has been giving more details about the fighting in the city of Severodonetsk. The head of the Severodonetsk district administration, Roman Vlasenko, told the BBC's World At One programme that Ukrainian forces needed more heavy weaponry to drive the Russians out of the city. He said Russian forces did not have a numerical advantage but had more heavy weapons. ""Arms are reaching the front in many areas of Luhansk and
Donetsk regions,"" Vlasenko said. ""But for the counter-offensive to be quick and effective we
need more of them."" He said Russian forces were in the suburbs and trying to take the city from three sides, but had been repulsed from central areas twice in the last three days. This video can not be played District head Roman Vlasenko says troops need more weapons or Russia will overpower them. Russia requires substantial financial resources in order to continue supporting both its economy and its ""special operation"" in Ukraine, the country's finance minister says. ""Money for a special operation"" means ""huge resources"" are needed, Anton Siluanov says at a university event. Moscow officials insist on referring to the invasion of Ukraine as a ""special military operation."" He adds the Russian government will be spending 8 trillion roubles (Â£95.8bn) in the form of an economic stimulus package this year. ""Huge funds. We need these resources to support the economy, support our citizens."" The Russian economy has fared poorly in the last few months afterbeing hammered by Western sanctions, with some forecasts projecting its GDP to shrink by between 8.5% and 15% this year. Up to 90% of the city has been damaged by shelling Russian forces have taken over two-thirds of the perimeter of the front-line city of Severodonetsk, the governor of Luhansk region says. But Serhiy Haidai says the city is not completely surrounded, denying reports by officials from the pro-Moscow self-declared Luhansk People's Republic that Ukrainian forces are cut off there. Severodonetsk is the most easterly major population centre in the Donbas still controlled by Ukraine. Earlier we reported that 60% of the city's housing stock is completely destroyed and up to 90% of buildings are damaged. At least 1,500 people have died there since the invasion began in February. Russia appears to have gained control of most of Lyman in Donetsk region - one of several key locations in eastern Ukraine under intense bombardment. Moscow says its forces are fighting for the ""complete liberation"" of the Donbas, which broadly refers to Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before the invasion. Russia now controls more than 90% of Luhansk and has made significant advances in Donetsk since its invasion on 24 February. See the latest maps and charts here Â© 2025 BBC.

"Sarah Hawkins gave birth to her stillborn daughter Harriet in 2016 A mother whose baby died after mistakes by staff said she felt like she ""was dying"", on the day the NHS trust responsible is ordered to improve its maternity services. The units at Nottingham University Hospitals trust - under review after dozens of baby deaths - have been rated inadequate by the health watchdog. Sarah Hawkins gave birth to her stillborn daughter Harriet in 2016. The trust said it was working hard to make improvements. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said the trust must make immediate improvements to its maternity services, adding there were serious staffing and cultural problems. It comes after it was announced on Thursday that Donna Ockenden, who led an inquiry into maternity failings in Shropshire, is tochair a review of services in Nottingham. The original review was launched followinga number of baby deaths and injuriesbut had faced sustained criticism from families and campaigners over its remit and independence. Mrs Hawkins, who worked at the trust with her husband Jack, had been in labour for six days before she gave birth to her stillborn daughter Harriet at Nottingham City Hospital in 2016. She said they knew something had gone wrong as soon as they were told their baby had died. ""Being two clinicians here at the time we thought 'you've seriously got this wrong' and I was then left for nine hours trying to deliver a dead baby because of communication errors,"" she toldRadio 4's Today programme. ""This whole time, I can't even describe the confusion, I felt like I was dying."" The couple were told their daughter had died from an infection, something they did not believe to be correct. They pushed for an external review, in which it was found the deathhad been preventable. They are one of a number of familieswho have spoken out about their experiencesand called for a public inquiry. Donna Ockenden also chaired an inquiry into maternity services in Shropshire Ms Ockenden told the BBC her first priority was to listen to the families that had been affected. ""Very clearly, the CQC issuing a safety warning notice and the stories that we're all seeing - parents have shared widely - there is clearly something that is very, very wrong at the trust,"" she said. ""I'd say to parents speak up if you have concerns, but you should feel confident that the enhanced scrutiny that there is on the trust can only be positive."" Maternity review sees 387 families come forward Families in maternity inquiry hit out at review Maternity review chair steps down from role NHS maternity services in Nottingham - based at the Nottingham City Hospital and Queen's Medical Centre - were initially rated as inadequate in 2020. Thelatest reports,externalsaid maternity servicesat both sites,externalremained inadequate overall. Inspectors, who visited in March, said the department did not have enough staff to care for women and keep them safe. The CQC noted that at City Hospital, there were 19 serious incidents reported by maternity staff between March 2021 and February 2022. In addition, there are currently five Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch investigations. They also issued a warning notice over safe care and treatment related to observations and triage services. Maternity services run by Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust were rated inadequate after an inspection in 2020 Inspectors said their warning notice was issued as staff were not always carrying out observations to make sure patients' conditions were not deteriorating and that triage wait times were too long. However, the report did say staff were compassionate and kind and there was an improvement in staff morale. Fiona Allinson, CQC's director of operations Midlands network, said: ""It's disappointing that despite several inspections where CQC has told the trust areas they must improve to keep mums and babies safe, serious problems remain."" By Michael Buchanan, social affairs correspondent What's most worrying about this report is that the trust is struggling to deal with issues it has long known about. Back in 2018, the trust board was sent a letter from doctors and midwives saying a lack of staff in its maternity units was endangering patient safety. In 2020, the CQC told the trust that staff didn't always know how to keep women and babies safe. Both of these issues remain ongoing concerns. Following reports like this, trusts often argue that if they weren't in the headlines, they could get on with making improvements. But when the bond with patients has been broken, as it has for many in Nottingham, a laser focus on its actions is often the only reassurance families have that meaningful change is under way. The original review, which has now concluded,published its interim report,externalon Thursday. It said maternity services nationally were ""under immense scrutiny"" in light of reports at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust and Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust. Some evidence of ""bullying behaviour"" had been uncovered, with a small number of staff displaying ""unacceptable behaviours such as being 'rude' and 'abrasive'"". However, it added the ""vast majority"" of staff were committed to ""a caring and compassionate culture"". Sharon Wallis, director of midwifery at NUH, said: ""Our teams are working hard to make the necessary improvements, but recognise we have more to do and are absolutely determined to speed up the pace of change and deliver quality services for women and their families."" The overall rating for both Nottingham City Hospital and Queen's Medical Centre following the CQC inspection remains as requires improvement.

Six-year-old Xavier Charles, better known as Stanley, collapsed while on patrol with his handler in London in the early hours of Sunday morning. A Met Police spokesman said Stanley, who competed in the national police dog trials in 2019, had been involved in 280 charges over his career. The ""larger than life character"" was described as ""one of the very best police dogs"". Stanley pictured alongside another police dog, Stella, and his handler The Met Police Taskforce said it believed he died from heart failure after the chase near Wandsworth Common in south-west London. A spokesman said there were ""two suspects on one moped"" and added that thanks to Stanley's actions, the moped was recovered. Taskforce Commander Karen Findlay said: ""Whilst this is still very raw, we have been asked to share this sad news to not only remember this wonderful, faithful and loyal friend but also to highlight the amazing work Stanley and his other canine heroes do to keep us all safe. ""Rest easy Stan, you have left your mark on our world and you will live long in the memory of so many who had the pleasure to know you."" Allow Twitter content?

On Friday a Pentagon spokesperson announced that ""decisions...haven't been made yet"" but the US is ""mindful"" of the request. The comment comes after CNN published a report that the US was preparing to send Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) to Ukraine. In the past Washington officials had denied the request fearing such long-range weapons could be used to attack targets inside Russia and end up widening and prolonging the conflict. A presenter on Russian state TV responded to the report by claiming the US would be crossing a red line and deliberately provoking Russia if it supplied Ukraine with the weapons. The evacuees left the city in an armoured vehicle Ukraine's police have taken to safety 31 residents - including 13 children - of Ukraine's eastern city of Lysychansk, in what the top regional official describes as one of the most ""difficult evacuations"" in recent days. Luhansk regional head Serhiy Haidai says the officers were initially sent to evacuate seven people, who had previously agreed to leave but - after ""a few hours of persuasion"" - ended up picking up 31 residents. Haidai also says that one vehicle that delivered humanitarian aid to Lysychansk was damaged because of the fighting in the area. Russian forces have been slowly advancing on the twin cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk. Local officials say two-thirds of Severodonetsk is now surrounded. Ukraine is hugely significant for the Russian Orthodox Church, with many parishes and some of its most important monasteries located there The Ukrainian Orthodox Church has declared its ""full autonomy and independence"" from the under Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP), condemning the stance Russian religious leaders have taken on the war in Ukraine. ""We disagree with the position of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow,"" the UOC-MP said in a statement after a council meeting in Kyiv, referring to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC). Kirill has openly voiced support for Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine launched on 24 February. It is the second schism in Ukraine in recent years, with part of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church breaking away from Moscow in 2019. The Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) was then granted a degree of independence, or the tomos, by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Talks on the unification of the Ukrainian Orthodoxy between the UOC-MP and the OCU have so far brought no breakthrough. Ukraine is hugely significant for the ROC, with many parishes and some of its most important monasteries located there.  Russian forces will not capture Luhansk in the coming days but Ukraine may have to evacuate some of its forces there for their own protection, the region's governor has saidon Telegram,external. ""It is possible that in order not to be surrounded we will have to retreat,"" Serhiy Haidai wrote. In an evening military report he also described how dangerous everyday life was in the Ukrainian-controlled areas of Luhansk. Remaining civilians ""are constantly in shelters, it is almost impossible to go outside due to the density of shelling,"" he said. Haidai added that Russian forces have been continuing to target the city of Severodonetsk, where fighting has broken out on the outskirts of the city. Earlier we reported that the US is preparing to offer Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) to Ukraine, according to reports in US media. Last Saturday Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky repeated his request for Western and Nato countries to supply the weaponry. ""I can honestly say our expectations are very high and we have been waiting a long time ... and I hope for a positive response that will allow us to acquire MLRS weapons,"" he said during a press conference in Kyiv. Thanks to this system, ""Ukraine will be able to take steps to liberate its country,"" he added. The powerful M270 system can launch rockets further than any weapons Ukraine currently possesses. What weapons has the US given to Ukraine? Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent Fire crews deal with a fire after shelling at Bakhmut in the Donbas region There is no doubt Ukraine is suffering setbacks in eastern Ukraine. The assessments from President Zelensky sound increasingly bleak. He says Russia is reducing cities to ashes. Earlier this week he said between 50 and 100 Ukrainians were losing their lives every day in the Donbas. Ukraine is certainly outnumbered and outgunned â with relentless Russian artillery bombardments being used to brutal effect over a much smaller area than during the first phase of the war. One Ukrainian official estimated that in some areas of Donbas their forces are outnumbered seven to one. Today UK PM Boris Johnson acknowledged that Russia was making slow but palpable progress in the region. He called for more military support â including providing Ukraine with long range rocket launchers â which the US is now considering too. There has been a lag between some Western promises of weapons and the time it takes to deliver them and to train Ukrainian forces. They could make a difference. But Russia still has much larger stockpiles of artillery ammunition. A senior official of one Nato country said it was âcriminalâ that the West had more limited stocks. Ukraine and Belarus last met in a qualifying game for Euro 2016 - Ukraine won 3-1 in Lviv Teams from Ukraine and Belarus will be kept apart in international football tournaments and European club competitions until further notice, governing body Uefa says. Uefa suspended Russia - and Russian clubs - from its tournaments
following the invasion of Ukraine, but has allowed Belarus to continue competing
despite that country's support of the invasion. Belarus have already been ordered to play home matches behind closed doors on
neutral territory, and now Uefa says it will not permit any meetings between
teams from Belarus and Ukraine to ensure the safety and security of everyone
involved. The news comes the week beforeUkraine's footballers bid to qualify for the World Cup- they play Scotland next Wednesday in a match delayed by the war, with the winners then playing Wales four days later for a spot in the finals in Qatar. Action against sportspeople and teams from Russia and Belarus has been a bone of contention in recent months. The International Olympic Committee's executive board recommended in February that athletes and teams from the two nations should not
be allowed to take part in international competitions. But international tennis ruling bodies have saidno ranking points will be awarded at Wimbledon this yearafter championship organisers said they would exclude Russian and Belarussian players. The French Open, currently taking place, does feature stars from the two countries. More now on thisnews we brought you earlier. Shaun Pinner, 48, and another Brit, 28-year-old Aiden Aslin, were captured in April while defending Ukraine's south-eastern port of Mariupol, which is now in Russian hands. In footage later shown on Russian state TV, both appeared to have facial bruising, prompting their families to call for the Geneva Convention to be respected. Mr Pinner, originally from Bedfordshire, has lived in Ukraine since 2018. Also in April, Russia released a video of a man who it said he was called Andrew Hill and that he had surrendered to Russian troops. The man, who was seen wearing a military camouflage uniform, said he was from Plymouth, and had children and a partner. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged Moscow to treat captured British fighters ""humanely and compassionately"". The Moroccan national was shown in Russian custody by state-run media in April, calling himself Sadun Brahim. He is believed to have studied in Kyiv before Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. The Geneva Convention states that prisoners of war must be protected ""against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity"". If you're just joining us, here are the latest developments from Ukraine: On the ground  Elsewhere  Two UK citizens and a Moroccan, who fought on the Ukrainian side in the country's eastern Donbas region, may face the death penalty, Russian-backed rebels are quoted as saying by Russia's Interfax news agency. Viktor Gavrilov, an official at the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic's (DNR) prosecutor general's office,  says a criminal investigation ""has been completed"" and - taking into account that a war is going on - the accused may be given capital punishment. Gavrilov identified the two captured Brits as Shaun Pinner and Andrew Hill, while the Moroccan national was named as Sadun Brahim. The DNR reportedly introduced the death penalty on the territory seized from Ukraine in 2014. In a call with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday, Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba says the pair discussed American military support for Kyiv. Kuleba says ""heavy weapons"" are top of Ukraine's agenda and wrote that ""more are coming our way"" following the call. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of ""sabotaging"" peace talks with Russia, the Kremlin has said. The comments were apparently made during a 45-minute phone call between the Russian leader and the Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer. According to Moscow's readout of the call, Putin denied that his country's blockade of Ukrainian ports is to blame for disruption to global food supplies, suggesting the real cause were sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union. Austria's Chancellor said the point of the call, described as ""very intense, very serious"", was to establish if potential humanitarian solutions can be found in Ukraine. He also added Putin said he was ready to discuss a prisoner swap with
Ukraine. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg holds up Sweden and Finland's membership applications Talks aimed at overcoming Turkey's objections to Sweden and Finland joining Nato have broken up with no sign of progress. A senior Turkish official said talks between the countries made little headway and told Reuters news agency ""it is not an easy process"". Negotiations will continue but no date has been set for them, the source added. All 30 Nato members, including Turkey, need to approve the applications from Sweden and Finland to join the Western security alliance. But Turkey has challenged both after accusing the two countries of harbouring individuals linked to Kurdish terrorists, a claim denied by Sweden and Finland. Some analysts view Turkey's stance as an attempt to win concessions from other Nato members. A Ukrainian official has been giving more details about the fighting in the city of Severodonetsk. The head of the Severodonetsk district administration, Roman Vlasenko, told the BBC's World At One programme that Ukrainian forces needed more heavy weaponry to drive the Russians out of the city. He said Russian forces did not have a numerical advantage but had more heavy weapons. ""Arms are reaching the front in many areas of Luhansk and
Donetsk regions,"" Vlasenko said. ""But for the counter-offensive to be quick and effective we
need more of them."" He said Russian forces were in the suburbs and trying to take the city from three sides, but had been repulsed from central areas twice in the last three days. This video can not be played District head Roman Vlasenko says troops need more weapons or Russia will overpower them. Russia requires substantial financial resources in order to continue supporting both its economy and its ""special operation"" in Ukraine, the country's finance minister says. ""Money for a special operation"" means ""huge resources"" are needed, Anton Siluanov says at a university event. Moscow officials insist on referring to the invasion of Ukraine as a ""special military operation."" He adds the Russian government will be spending 8 trillion roubles (Â£95.8bn) in the form of an economic stimulus package this year. ""Huge funds. We need these resources to support the economy, support our citizens."" The Russian economy has fared poorly in the last few months afterbeing hammered by Western sanctions, with some forecasts projecting its GDP to shrink by between 8.5% and 15% this year. Up to 90% of the city has been damaged by shelling Russian forces have taken over two-thirds of the perimeter of the front-line city of Severodonetsk, the governor of Luhansk region says. But Serhiy Haidai says the city is not completely surrounded, denying reports by officials from the pro-Moscow self-declared Luhansk People's Republic that Ukrainian forces are cut off there. Severodonetsk is the most easterly major population centre in the Donbas still controlled by Ukraine. Earlier we reported that 60% of the city's housing stock is completely destroyed and up to 90% of buildings are damaged. At least 1,500 people have died there since the invasion began in February. Russia appears to have gained control of most of Lyman in Donetsk region - one of several key locations in eastern Ukraine under intense bombardment. Moscow says its forces are fighting for the ""complete liberation"" of the Donbas, which broadly refers to Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before the invasion. Russia now controls more than 90% of Luhansk and has made significant advances in Donetsk since its invasion on 24 February. See the latest maps and charts here Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played A group of wardens describe what it's like living all year round on a tiny island Wildlife wardens hope to share one Welsh island's secrets with the world - by using cutting edge technology. Flat Holm island, near Cardiff, is home to unique lizards and flowers, and is an important bird sanctuary. Now the variety, location and numbers of flora and fauna will be updated on an interactive digital map at the city's Techniquest science museum. The wardens hope this will improve understanding of climate change and nature. Flat Holm is famous for itsrole in the inventionof radio, but its varieties of plants and animals are not so widely known. Cardiff Metropolitan University has teamed up with the island's wardens to design an interactive exhibit to reflect real-time wildlife data. The wardens described it as a ""really exciting chance"" to engage in the conservation efforts on Flat Holm. Climate change in Wales in charts Donkeys and sharks helped by new nature funding Life on the island is not always easy, according to the current wardens Heidi Aguirregoicoa and Pierre Court. ""It's just a really unique experience. I've never known a place like this,"" said Heidi. Heidi, 21 and Pierre, 23 have been the wardens on Flat Holm for just a few months. With the ""unique"" experience comes a vast range of responsibilities Pierre explained. Heidi Aguirregoicoa said they log data about island's flora, fauna and also the weather ""It's very different to being a manager in an office,"" said Pierre. As well as managing volunteers on the island, the wardens guide tours, run the island pub, maintain buildings and infrastructure and ensure they have clean water. ""All of our water is collected from rainwater. It is then stored in a Victorian tank underneath the ground and filtered several times. And then we can finally drink it and use it in the accommodation,"" added Pierre. ""We basically use the water we've collected throughout the winter and it will last us the entire summer. So, this is a big concern of ours."" He said: ""It makes you really humble living here and you understand that nature will always win. No matter what you do."" Flat Holm Island has been a Site of Special Scientific Interest since 1972. For the wardens and volunteers conservation work is at the heart of life on Flat Holm. Home to a huge population of gulls, the island is also the habitat of slow worms with unique blue markings as well as moths, butterflies and rabbits. Rare plants, such as rock sea lavender, wild peonies and wild leek also grow on the island. To keep track of wildlife, the wardens conduct regular surveys. The interactive map at Techniquest is designed to give an insight into the island's wildlife and weather ""Some of our surveys are monthly and weekly, and some are daily. ""The daily survey is the bird survey. We do a long round trip for an hour every morning, about 7:30 around the edges of the island,"" explained Heidi. They do a rough count of birds and log numbers of the types of moths, butterflies and slow worms. The way the wardens log this data has now changed. Instead of using a paper and a pen, information will be uploaded to an app. This project was a result of a collaboration between Cardiff Harbour Authority, Cardiff Metropolitan University, Techniquest and Yard, a technical marketing agency. Pierre Court said they also run the island's pub as part of their duties Heidi said the new method of logging data is quicker and there is no risk of the data being lost. As well as feeding directly to an exhibit at Techniquest Science Discovery Centre in Cardiff Bay, the data contributes to long-term conservation datasets on the island. Welsh farmers told to cut more carbon emissions How will hospitality survive after summer? Dr Fiona Carroll, an expert in our relationships with computers at Cardiff Met University, believes the pandemic helped us engage with data. ""People started to become fatigued by a lot of the complex data,"" she said. ""So, we've come up with a data impression, and that's really been inspired by going back to the 1800s and the French Impressionists."" Dr Fiona Carroll said the exhibit's colours was inspired by the French Impressionists The interactive exhibit allows people to press buttons which will show the numbers of different animals on the island, using colours and patterns. Data about the weather on the island is also collected and visualised using prisms which rotate to show types of wind, rain or sunshine. There are plans to use these methods and technology in other practical settings. ""We've got data coming out of our ears every second of the day, we're generating more and more data,"" explains Dr Carroll. The slow worms on Flat Holm have unique markings on them She said visualising data could help the public have a greater understanding of the world around them, in areas such as air pollution and making sense of rising food costs in supermarkets. ""It's really exciting knowing the general public are going to be able to experience Flat Holm from afar,"" said Heidi. It is a view shared by warden Pierre, too. ""It's helping us build this relationship with the visitors and the public,"" he said. ""This has just started so we're really hoping that throughout the summer season we might have visitors coming to the island saying, 'oh yeah, I was at the Techniquest and I saw all the data'. ""We're hoping this is going to help Flat Holm grow even more, and help people to get into conservation and into their local sites of interest.""

"This video can not be played 'A contributor to Irish language, culture and tradition' Without scholars such as John Hannon and his contemporaries, much of the Irish language, through song and written word, could have been consigned to history. The Crossmaglen man was a collector, writing down the phrases, lyrics and prayers which had been passed down from generation to generation in south Armagh. On Thursday, more than 90 years after his death, the linguist was honoured with a blue plaque by the Ulster History Circle. Dr GearÃ³id Trimble, of Foras na Gaeilge, said Hannon was an important figure in ""gathering and preserving what was left of that last generation of native Gaelic speakers"" in the late 19th century. His work took place in the context of younger generations learning English to seek opportunities for work or to emigrate. ""There was this huge stigma associated with the Irish language among those who were speaking and using it, but these local collectors, the likes of Hannon, being of the area, were able to break down the barriers,"" Dr Trimble told BBC News NI. Born in County Leitrim in 1867, Hannon was the son of a Royal Irish Constabulary constable. After John Sr took early retirement, the family moved to Crossmaglen, close to his mother's birthplace, and opened a shop in the centre of the village. It was there that a young Hannon, who did not speak Irish, became fascinated by the language used by the family's customers and neighbours. Adapting a key system for transcriptions, Hannon learned how to write down the words phonetically. Dr GearÃ³id Trimble said Hannon amassed a valuable linguistic store of the Oriel dialect Dr Trimble said his manuscripts would go on to include ""over 130 songs that were commonly sung in the district during the 19th century"". Among these was 'MÃ¡ire Chaoch' (Crooked-eye Mary), a satirical poem by Art McCooey, who was also honoured with a blue plaque in the area in 2014. Drawing upon dozens of contacts, Hannon ""managed to amass a huge valuable linguistic store of contents in the unique dialect of Oriel"", Dr Trimble said. The Oriel - or Oirialla - refers to a region along the modern Irish border including south Armagh. ""It wasn't connected to Donegal Irish, it wasn't connected to Connemara Irish, it was very much a form of dialect that managed to develop in its own right and it was cut off from other parts of Irish-speaking Ireland,"" Dr Trimble explained. Hannon, who neither married nor had children, died aged 64 in 1931, after spending the last years of his life in a Newry workhouse. Archbishop of Armagh Eamon Martin, the head of the Catholic Church in Ireland, said he ""left behind him a very rich resource, a collection which will speak for generations to come"". Archbishop Eamon Martin said Hannon's legacy will inspire future generations ""The work that he did was perhaps forgotten, but I think that's a lovely lesson for everyone to realise that you can make a contribution which will be remembered a whole century after you've died and people will remember it and thank you for it,"" he told BBC News NI. The singer PÃ¡draigÃ­n NÃ­ UallachÃ¡in, who has written about the songs and traditions of the Oriel region, said the plaque was a long-deserved recognition. ""Other collectors and other linguists were using his material over the past 100 years for their own studies,"" she said. PÃ¡draigÃ­n NÃ­ UallachÃ¡in standing at the door of the shop owned by the Hannon family ""He did tremendous work. It's also very lonely work because you are witnessing the death of a great, great tradition and he was doing that alone knowing that, if he hadn't done that, then it would be lost. ""There were singers in this area who could recite a thousand lines of the richest of poetry,"" she continued. ""They may not have been schooled in the formal sense, but they had tremendous capacity for retaining oral memory."" Ms NÃ­ UallachÃ¡in said that during her research for songs to perform, she discovered in Hannon's work ""so much memory that had been lost and could be returned to people in the community"". ""It can't be measured, the value of that material for people and generations who are returning to the language and reclaiming their own traditions."" During the event on Thursday, the Oriel Traditional Orchestra, along with local singers, played some of the songs which Hannon transcribed, including Chuaigh an Mhaol, which has its origins in the village square where it was performed. ""This song was used to try and scare children to keep them in at night,"" said Dr Trimble, who is from Crossmaglen. ""The premise of the song was this bald, hornless cow would come chasing you. An awful lot of these songs are very unique to the area. ""They preserve place names, names of families, people, events - they are capsules of social history in their own right."" Local singers performed some of the songs Hannon transcribed EibhlÃ­n Mhic Aoidh, from the Ulster History Circle, who spoke at the unveiling, studied Irish at summer colleges in Donegal. ""Some of the songs I learned were actually songs that Hannon had collected and preserved,"" she recalled. ""Some of them are sung throughout Ireland. ""This event is folklore as a dynamic, living, breathing phenomenon. They are being sung by local people and by young people,"" she continued. Chuaigh an Mhaol was performed in its traditional setting, the market square of Crossmaglen ""These are the songs John Hannon noted from old people at the end of the 19th century."" Ms Mhic Aoidh said the plaque was an example of the voluntary group trying to ""shine a light on the contribution of local people to history"". Finance Minister Conor Murphy was also in attendance and described Hannon as a ""very important figure, although not a very well known figure"". Growing up in south Armagh, he said he was aware of the area's ""rich tradition of Gaelic poets, folklore and music"", but had it not been for Hannon, much of it could have been ""lost for all time"". ""There are more prominent Gaelic scholars, and perhaps he wasn't as academic as the rest of them, but his work was invaluable,"" the Newry and Armagh assembly member said. He said the ""growing and vibrant"" language community of today could trace its success back to the work of collectors such as Hannon. The event came a day after legislation to provide for the ""recognition and protection"" of the Irish languagetook its first steps at Westminster. The bill also provides for the development of the Ulster Scots and Ulster British tradition in Northern Ireland.

"This video can not be played A group of wardens describe what it's like living all year round on a tiny island Wildlife wardens hope to share one Welsh island's secrets with the world - by using cutting edge technology. Flat Holm island, near Cardiff, is home to unique lizards and flowers, and is an important bird sanctuary. Now the variety, location and numbers of flora and fauna will be updated on an interactive digital map at the city's Techniquest science museum. The wardens hope this will improve understanding of climate change and nature. Flat Holm is famous for itsrole in the inventionof radio, but its varieties of plants and animals are not so widely known. Cardiff Metropolitan University has teamed up with the island's wardens to design an interactive exhibit to reflect real-time wildlife data. The wardens described it as a ""really exciting chance"" to engage in the conservation efforts on Flat Holm. Climate change in Wales in charts Donkeys and sharks helped by new nature funding Life on the island is not always easy, according to the current wardens Heidi Aguirregoicoa and Pierre Court. ""It's just a really unique experience. I've never known a place like this,"" said Heidi. Heidi, 21 and Pierre, 23 have been the wardens on Flat Holm for just a few months. With the ""unique"" experience comes a vast range of responsibilities Pierre explained. Heidi Aguirregoicoa said they log data about island's flora, fauna and also the weather ""It's very different to being a manager in an office,"" said Pierre. As well as managing volunteers on the island, the wardens guide tours, run the island pub, maintain buildings and infrastructure and ensure they have clean water. ""All of our water is collected from rainwater. It is then stored in a Victorian tank underneath the ground and filtered several times. And then we can finally drink it and use it in the accommodation,"" added Pierre. ""We basically use the water we've collected throughout the winter and it will last us the entire summer. So, this is a big concern of ours."" He said: ""It makes you really humble living here and you understand that nature will always win. No matter what you do."" Flat Holm Island has been a Site of Special Scientific Interest since 1972. For the wardens and volunteers conservation work is at the heart of life on Flat Holm. Home to a huge population of gulls, the island is also the habitat of slow worms with unique blue markings as well as moths, butterflies and rabbits. Rare plants, such as rock sea lavender, wild peonies and wild leek also grow on the island. To keep track of wildlife, the wardens conduct regular surveys. The interactive map at Techniquest is designed to give an insight into the island's wildlife and weather ""Some of our surveys are monthly and weekly, and some are daily. ""The daily survey is the bird survey. We do a long round trip for an hour every morning, about 7:30 around the edges of the island,"" explained Heidi. They do a rough count of birds and log numbers of the types of moths, butterflies and slow worms. The way the wardens log this data has now changed. Instead of using a paper and a pen, information will be uploaded to an app. This project was a result of a collaboration between Cardiff Harbour Authority, Cardiff Metropolitan University, Techniquest and Yard, a technical marketing agency. Pierre Court said they also run the island's pub as part of their duties Heidi said the new method of logging data is quicker and there is no risk of the data being lost. As well as feeding directly to an exhibit at Techniquest Science Discovery Centre in Cardiff Bay, the data contributes to long-term conservation datasets on the island. Welsh farmers told to cut more carbon emissions How will hospitality survive after summer? Dr Fiona Carroll, an expert in our relationships with computers at Cardiff Met University, believes the pandemic helped us engage with data. ""People started to become fatigued by a lot of the complex data,"" she said. ""So, we've come up with a data impression, and that's really been inspired by going back to the 1800s and the French Impressionists."" Dr Fiona Carroll said the exhibit's colours was inspired by the French Impressionists The interactive exhibit allows people to press buttons which will show the numbers of different animals on the island, using colours and patterns. Data about the weather on the island is also collected and visualised using prisms which rotate to show types of wind, rain or sunshine. There are plans to use these methods and technology in other practical settings. ""We've got data coming out of our ears every second of the day, we're generating more and more data,"" explains Dr Carroll. The slow worms on Flat Holm have unique markings on them She said visualising data could help the public have a greater understanding of the world around them, in areas such as air pollution and making sense of rising food costs in supermarkets. ""It's really exciting knowing the general public are going to be able to experience Flat Holm from afar,"" said Heidi. It is a view shared by warden Pierre, too. ""It's helping us build this relationship with the visitors and the public,"" he said. ""This has just started so we're really hoping that throughout the summer season we might have visitors coming to the island saying, 'oh yeah, I was at the Techniquest and I saw all the data'. ""We're hoping this is going to help Flat Holm grow even more, and help people to get into conservation and into their local sites of interest.""

Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Paul Sorvino and Joe Pesci all appeared in the mobster movie Scorsese said he was ""absolutely shocked and devastated"" by the news and that he would always be proud of their work together. ""Playing Henry Hill in Goodfellas was a tall order, because the character had so many different facets, so many complicated layers, and Ray was in almost every scene of a long, tough shoot,"" the filmmaker explained. ""He absolutely amazed me, and I'll always be proud of the work we did together on that picture. ""My heart goes out to his loved ones, and it aches for his loss, way too early."" Lorraine Bracco, who played Karen Friedman Hill in Goodfellas, said she was ""shattered"" to hear the news of her former co-star's death. She shared a photo of them both on Twitter, saying being with him had been the best part of making the film. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The cost of rapidly charging an electric car has risen sharply as energy costs soar, the RAC has said. However, electric car charging still remains cheaper than petrol and diesel, the motoring organisation said. Rises in electricity and gas prices, in part since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, are behind the increased charging costs. But fuel prices have gone up more quickly as crude oil suppliers struggle to meet demand. The price of charging an electric car on a pay-as-you-go, non-subscription basis at a publicly accessible rapid charger has increased by 21% over the last nine months, the RAC said. Even charging at home has been getting more expensive as energy bills spiral upwards. The cost of the electricity used to power electric vehicles varies according to the household tariff the customer is on. But both rapid charging and home charging are still less expensive than petrol or diesel per mile. Electric vehicle (EV) charging is nearly half the cost per mile compared to filling a family car with petrol, the motoring organisation said. The average cost of a litre of petrol has increased by 25% since last September, and diesel by 30%, according to the RAC. This month diesel pricesrose to a recordof more than Â£1.80 a litre. ""While electric car drivers may not be immune from the rocketing price of wholesale energy - most notably gas, which in turn dictates the cost of electricity - there's no doubt that charging an electric vehicle still represents excellent value for money compared to filling up a petrol or diesel car,"" RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams told the BBC. The three main rapid charging companies are BP Pulse, Instavolt and Ospreyaccording to Zap Map,external, which records charge point distribution and costs. Mr Williams said that ""unsurprisingly"" the quickest places to charge are also the most expensive with ultra-rapid chargers costing on average 14% more to use than rapid chargers. How easy is it to drive across Wales in an electric car? Is the UK on track to meet its climate targets? The classic cars being converted to electric vehicles While the RAC analysis charted on-the-road pricing, private EV owners may not use this as their primary way of charging. The RAC said the most affordable way of charging an electric car is from home, where overnight electricity rates can be much lower than their public charger counterparts. According to the AA motoring group, some EV car owners use tariffs as low as 4.5p per kilowatt hour during off-peak times when charging at home. In addition, it said charging from lampposts is 46% cheaper than on-the-road rapid charging. But it said this option is only available in some parts of the country at the moment. ""Sadly just 87 councils out of almost 400 across the UK have applied for the on-street residential chargepoint grant since 2017,"" said Jack Cousins, head of road policy at the AA. ""This needs to dramatically improve so that EV drivers across the country have access to good, local chargepoints,"" he said. Another reason home charging can be so much cheaper than rapid charging is because of ""the bizarre way that electricity is taxed"", Simon Williams from the RAC added. ""Right now, VAT on electricity from a public charger is levied at a rate four-times that which applies to domestic electricity, which makes it far more expensive to charge on-the-go than it should be,"" he said. Electric cars also usually cost thousands of pounds more than their petrol or diesel counterparts. This is because EV batteries are expensive to make and a high level of investment is needed to transform existing factory production lines to manufacture the new technology. However, costs are expected to come down in the near future: industry group the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders forecasts electric and internal combustion engine cars should cost roughly the same ""by the end of this decade."" Melanie Shufflebotham, co-founder of Zap Map, said: ""More electric cars need to be produced at a mid-price range, with the cost of living crisis it's going to be really hard for many people to buy a new car but there are subscription models."" ""There should be price parity for EV cars by 2025 as the price of batteries comes down"". ""Though costs are up, EV drivers are feeling happy they're saving even when charging on the most expensive public charging spots when compared to fossil fuels,"" she added.

"Sarah Hawkins gave birth to her stillborn daughter Harriet in 2016 A mother whose baby died after mistakes by staff said she felt like she ""was dying"", on the day the NHS trust responsible is ordered to improve its maternity services. The units at Nottingham University Hospitals trust - under review after dozens of baby deaths - have been rated inadequate by the health watchdog. Sarah Hawkins gave birth to her stillborn daughter Harriet in 2016. The trust said it was working hard to make improvements. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said the trust must make immediate improvements to its maternity services, adding there were serious staffing and cultural problems. It comes after it was announced on Thursday that Donna Ockenden, who led an inquiry into maternity failings in Shropshire, is tochair a review of services in Nottingham. The original review was launched followinga number of baby deaths and injuriesbut had faced sustained criticism from families and campaigners over its remit and independence. Mrs Hawkins, who worked at the trust with her husband Jack, had been in labour for six days before she gave birth to her stillborn daughter Harriet at Nottingham City Hospital in 2016. She said they knew something had gone wrong as soon as they were told their baby had died. ""Being two clinicians here at the time we thought 'you've seriously got this wrong' and I was then left for nine hours trying to deliver a dead baby because of communication errors,"" she toldRadio 4's Today programme. ""This whole time, I can't even describe the confusion, I felt like I was dying."" The couple were told their daughter had died from an infection, something they did not believe to be correct. They pushed for an external review, in which it was found the deathhad been preventable. They are one of a number of familieswho have spoken out about their experiencesand called for a public inquiry. Donna Ockenden also chaired an inquiry into maternity services in Shropshire Ms Ockenden told the BBC her first priority was to listen to the families that had been affected. ""Very clearly, the CQC issuing a safety warning notice and the stories that we're all seeing - parents have shared widely - there is clearly something that is very, very wrong at the trust,"" she said. ""I'd say to parents speak up if you have concerns, but you should feel confident that the enhanced scrutiny that there is on the trust can only be positive."" Maternity review sees 387 families come forward Families in maternity inquiry hit out at review Maternity review chair steps down from role NHS maternity services in Nottingham - based at the Nottingham City Hospital and Queen's Medical Centre - were initially rated as inadequate in 2020. Thelatest reports,externalsaid maternity servicesat both sites,externalremained inadequate overall. Inspectors, who visited in March, said the department did not have enough staff to care for women and keep them safe. The CQC noted that at City Hospital, there were 19 serious incidents reported by maternity staff between March 2021 and February 2022. In addition, there are currently five Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch investigations. They also issued a warning notice over safe care and treatment related to observations and triage services. Maternity services run by Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust were rated inadequate after an inspection in 2020 Inspectors said their warning notice was issued as staff were not always carrying out observations to make sure patients' conditions were not deteriorating and that triage wait times were too long. However, the report did say staff were compassionate and kind and there was an improvement in staff morale. Fiona Allinson, CQC's director of operations Midlands network, said: ""It's disappointing that despite several inspections where CQC has told the trust areas they must improve to keep mums and babies safe, serious problems remain."" By Michael Buchanan, social affairs correspondent What's most worrying about this report is that the trust is struggling to deal with issues it has long known about. Back in 2018, the trust board was sent a letter from doctors and midwives saying a lack of staff in its maternity units was endangering patient safety. In 2020, the CQC told the trust that staff didn't always know how to keep women and babies safe. Both of these issues remain ongoing concerns. Following reports like this, trusts often argue that if they weren't in the headlines, they could get on with making improvements. But when the bond with patients has been broken, as it has for many in Nottingham, a laser focus on its actions is often the only reassurance families have that meaningful change is under way. The original review, which has now concluded,published its interim report,externalon Thursday. It said maternity services nationally were ""under immense scrutiny"" in light of reports at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust and Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust. Some evidence of ""bullying behaviour"" had been uncovered, with a small number of staff displaying ""unacceptable behaviours such as being 'rude' and 'abrasive'"". However, it added the ""vast majority"" of staff were committed to ""a caring and compassionate culture"". Sharon Wallis, director of midwifery at NUH, said: ""Our teams are working hard to make the necessary improvements, but recognise we have more to do and are absolutely determined to speed up the pace of change and deliver quality services for women and their families."" The overall rating for both Nottingham City Hospital and Queen's Medical Centre following the CQC inspection remains as requires improvement.

"Ian Fenn and Chloe on their local high street An autistic man is taking supermarket giant Sainsbury's to court for refusing entry to his assistance cat. Designer and writer Ian Fenn from London says the ban on Chloe, who helps him in daily life, is limiting his independence. He says she helps him stay calm, but the supermarket argues that cats, unlike assistance dogs, present risks to food hygiene. The case might set a legal precedent if it has to be ruled on by top judges. Sainsbury's says it is working with an environmental health team to find out how Ian and his cat can visit safely. Man with guide dog refused supermarket access twice How are emotional support animals allowed on flights? This video can not be played Watch the moment Ian Fenn is told he must leave Chloe outside Ian was recently diagnosed with autism after many years of struggling with anxiety in busy or noisy environments. He has trained Chloe to help him manage his way through daily life after discovering on a train journey that her presence improved what would otherwise have been a stressful situation. When we meet Ian and Chloe in a south London pub, she's sitting on a small, dedicated mat beside him on the sofa, gazing intently at the drinkers. She wears a ""service cat"" jacket and occasionally nibbles treats. Over the course of an hour, she occasionally looks around, but does not leave the mat once. Outside the pub, she sits on Ian's shoulder or walks around on a lead. Chloe joins Ian on local buses ""I realised that my life was a lot better with her being around - there's a lot of autistic people suffering from depression. I'm not alone any more,"" he says. ""I get sensory overload in busy environments and tend to shut down. But with Chloe I can focus on her. ""She brings structure to my life, she wakes me up in the morning, she tells me when to go to bed. It's difficult to know how she feels about the relationship, but I feel that we're a team now."" This year, she's been to more than 30 different restaurants and pubs, numerous public attractions, a hospital and on scores of trains and buses. Ian contacts business owners or operators in advance - but Chloe is not universally accepted. She also joins him at a local pub for a bit of relaxation In March, the pair visited a Sainsbury's in Clapham, south London after thinking he had been given permission. But security and store staff told him he needed to leave his cat outside. ""I ended up becoming quite upset,"" he says. ""I got to the point where I couldn't actually remember why I was in the store and what I needed to buy. ""It affected my confidence significantly. I stayed in the house for two weeks before I got the confidence back to go out."" The store was the first rejection from a major supermarket. A nearby Tesco lets Ian visit, as the BBC witnessed.  After Ian complained, Sainsbury's told him it would only allow assistance dogs into its stores. It said that while Chloe may be well-behaved, if it altered its general policy it could present a risk of other more unruly cats causing havoc - and it would have no way of assessing an animal's behaviour or training. And this is where the matter has become a potentially complicated courtroom fight: The law on assistance animals is not clear cut. Banned from Sainsburys: Ian was told Chloe couldn't come in Ian's view is that Chloe is a properly-trained assistance animal who is an essential ""auxiliary aid"" - a legal term for something that is providing support for someone with a disability. Under the Equality Act 2010, business owners have a duty to make a reasonable adjustment so as to ensure that someone who has a disability is not placed at a substantial disadvantage. The UK's definition of a disability includes autism, because the condition can be shown to affect day-to-day life. An assistance pony being trained on Newcastle upon Tyne's Metro in 2019 In a statement, Sainsbury's said: ""We want to be an inclusive retailer where people love to work and shop and understand that some of our colleagues and customers may need support in our stores. ""At the same time, safety is our highest priority and our colleagues are trained to balance maintaining our high food hygiene standards with supporting all our customers who shop with us. ""We are in contact with the local environmental health team to see if there are ways we can help Mr Fenn to visit our store without compromising this."" Ian does not agree that the supermarket's current stance is reasonable and that is why he plans to argue his case before a judge. ""I appreciate a bloke wandering around with a cat is a bit unusual,"" he says. ""The reality is that I don't want that attention. What I want to do is just run my life normally. So when somebody says, 'No, you can't, because you have this creature that is helping you,' it's really upsetting."" Chris Fry, one of the UK's leading disability rights lawyers, is representing Ian. ""The key and fundamental principles are that service providers have a legal obligation to provide reasonable adjustments to accommodate disabled customers,"" he says. ""Guide dogs are seen as being established as a reasonable or an auxiliary aid to help disabled customers. ""But there's never been anything specific in relation to anything other than a support dog in this country."" There have been assistance horses in service in the UK - but it has been a much hotter topic in the United States. The US government has tightened up rules on emotional support animals Four years ago, American airlines recorded 751,000 requests to take emotional support animals on flights - including miniature horses and a turkey. The matter turned into a national media debate when a passenger was banned from taking their support peacock on a plane. Ultimately, the US's national air transport rules were tightened upto ban emotional support animalsother than dogs. While US law is different, Chris says similar legal questions need to be explored in the UK as society's understanding of disability equality and rights develops. He says Ian can show the training he has provided Chloe - and a business should take that into account. But would a win mean anyone could take their trained gerbil or rabbit to the weekly shop? ""Cases like this provide clarity - for businesses and for individuals alike,"" says Chris. ""I think the court will be concerned to make sure that if this case goes as far as final judgment, that it will set out some guidelines to help address issues.""

"This video can not be played The prime minster described the help package as a 'big bazooka' Boris Johnson has said the Â£15bn package unveiled by the chancellor to help people with soaring energy bills has been targeted at the poorest homes. Labour says some of the money will go to better-off people not in hardship. Speaking in County Durham, the prime minister insisted it would ""overwhelmingly"" support the most vulnerable households. But he said he was ""not going to pretend this is going to fix everything for everybody immediately"". He insisted the measures, which he described as a ""big bazooka"", were ""massively redistributive"", adding that three quarters of those that would benefit would be the most vulnerable. Visiting Stockton-on-Tees, Mr Johnson also said the help was ""much more generous"" than what Labour had proposed, giving Â£1,200 to eight million households. How will I get the Â£400 promised for energy bills? What was behind Sunak's mini Budget? How plans to tackle cost of living will affect you Is the government package really worth Â£37bn? Earlier this week, UK energy regulator Ofgem said the typical household energy bill was set to rise by Â£800 in October, bringing it to Â£2,800 a year. Bills rose by Â£700 on average in April. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the Â£15bn package on Thursday, following weeks of pressure to act from Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP. Part-funded by a 25% windfall tax on gas and oil company profits, all households will get Â£400 off their energy bills this October, and there will be further help for those most in need. Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves told BBC Breakfast the windfall tax meant the government had ""finally come to their senses"", but asked: ""What took them so long?"" The opposition has broadly welcomed the extra help, but says it is poorly targeted, too long in coming, and will funnel extra cash to people who do not need it. Because the money is being paid directly to every household, people who own second or third homes will get multiple Â£400 payments. But the Treasury said Labour's call for a cut to VAT on fuel  - another of Sir Keir Starmer's key demands - would have benefited better-off households even more. Labour's Rachel Reeves said second home owners should not get extra benefits from the energy bill discount Responding to Labour's criticisms, Mr Sunak said second homes accounted for only ""one or two per cent of the property stock"" across the UK. He suggested that wealthy individuals donate the Â£400 they will save on bills to charity, adding that he had done so himself. ""I'm sure you will join me in giving that money to charity,"" he said on ITV's Good Morning Britain. He called the tax and the cost-of-living help measures ""temporary"". But the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank says calls for assistance are likely to continue for at least another year, with bills expected to keep rising into 2023. Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme if he planned another emergency package next year, even if it meant more government borrowing and higher taxes, the chancellor said: ""I've always been prepared to respond to the situation on the ground"". He added:  ""We will be able to combat and reduce inflation. We have the tools at our disposal and after time it will come down."" Some Conservative MPs have criticised the use of a windfall tax to help fund assistance with bills, with the national debt - pushed higher by furlough and other help during the pandemic -currently standing at around Â£2.3 trillion.,external One MP, Richard Drax, accused the chancellor of ""throwing red meat to socialists"", while another, Craig Mackinlay, described the policy as ""tripe"". But Mr Sunak insisted he remained a ""fiscal conservative"" and wanted to manage the UK's finances ""responsibly"". The Resolution Foundation, a think tank which focuses on people on lower incomes,described the measures,externalas ""a big and well-targeted package"" that would ""offset 82% of the rise in households' energy costs in 2022-23, rising to over 90% for poorer households"". Because higher income households had already seen major tax rises, it added, the overall effect of changes to taxes and benefits this year would be ""highly progressive"".

"The government is likely to come under pressure to help households with soaring energy bills again next year, the Institute of Fiscal Studies think tank has warned. The IFS said calls for help were likely to continue for ""at least"" another year if oil and gas prices do not fall. Energy bills are expected to keep rising until at least spring 2023. But the government insisted the support package announced by the chancellor on Thursday was a ""temporary"" measure. The Â£15bn package meansevery UK household will get an energy bill discount of Â£400 from October, with further support for the poorest households, pensioners and disabled people. The new measures add to around Â£17bn of support already given by the government. This included one-off Â£150 council tax rebates for most homes in England and Wales and matched funding for the other devolved nations. A steep rise in the cost of living, in particular a jump in energy prices in April, and a second one scheduled for October, had put growing pressure on the government to take action. The announcement, which came a day after the publication ofSue Gray's report into rule-breaking at Downing Street during the pandemic, was on a larger scale than many expected. The support was broadly welcomed and described as a ""genuinely big package"" by the IFS. However, the think tank warned that it could prompt calls for additional support again next year, which in turn could contribute to further inflation. ""I think the biggest risk is that the chancellor will be tempted to do this again and again, and I think if that happens then we really could be in for a bit of trouble,"" IFS director Paul Johnson told the BBC's Today programme. ""He's got the most extraordinarily difficult decisions to make later this year on public sector pay, and then he'll be under pressure I suspect again this time next year when energy prices will still be high. ""I think if he's tempted to continue putting money in to an economy where inflation is very high then that becomes a significant risk."" Adam Scorer, chief executive of fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, said the chancellor's measures averted ""the darkest of outcomes"" but warned ""millions will still be struggling and the energy crisis is far from over"". He said a ""large, more targeted intervention is what was needed ahead of winter"", and said the government needed to plan for energy prices to remain high for some time. The cost of living is set to continue to rise, with inflation - the rate at which prices go up - at a 40-year high and forecast to hit 10% later this year. Concerns have also been raised that the extra support for households could contribute to further inflation, by providing more spending power in the economy at a time when supply chains and the labour market are struggling to meet demand. However, Chancellor Rishi Sunak insisted that his new measures would have a""minimal impact"" on inflation. How plans to tackle cost of living will affect you Every household to get Â£400 energy bill discount Typical energy bill set to rise by Â£800 a year Higher energy prices, caused in part by the war in Ukraine, have been a key factor driving inflation and analysts expect energy costs to remain high. Cornwall Insight, has predicted the energy price cap, which limits how much providers can raise prices, will be marginally higher in spring 2023 to around Â£2,818 than the price cap this autumn at Â£2,791. The cost of the extra support for energy bills will be partly offset by a 25% additional tax on oil and gas firms' profits, which have soared in recent months. Opposition parties had been calling for a windfall tax on energy firms for several months. A windfall tax is a one-off levy imposed by a government on a company. The idea is to target firms that were lucky enough to benefit from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall. Mr Sunak said the ""energy profits levy"" had been designed so it would ""incentivise and encourage investment"". But Dan Atzori, research partner at Cornwall Insight, warned the tax came with ""risks to both investment and energy security"". If windfall taxes were repeated over time, Mr Atzori said, it risked ""creating an unstable environment, and may lead to energy producers, who operate globally, investing and relocating to other areas"". The government had previously rejected the idea of a windfall tax on energy firms' profit, but Mr Sunak said with the sector ""making extraordinary profits"" he was ""sympathetic to the argument to tax those profits fairly"". However, energy giant BP said while it knew ""how difficult things are for people"" Thursday's announcement was ""not for a one-off tax"" but a ""multi-year proposal"". ""Naturally we will now need to look at the impact of both the new levy and the tax relief on our North Sea investment plans,"" it said. The body which represents oil and gas firms, Offshore Energies UK, said the levy would""drive away"" investors and cut UK energy production.

"Sarah Hawkins gave birth to her stillborn daughter Harriet in 2016 A mother whose baby died after mistakes by staff said she felt like she ""was dying"", on the day the NHS trust responsible is ordered to improve its maternity services. The units at Nottingham University Hospitals trust - under review after dozens of baby deaths - have been rated inadequate by the health watchdog. Sarah Hawkins gave birth to her stillborn daughter Harriet in 2016. The trust said it was working hard to make improvements. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said the trust must make immediate improvements to its maternity services, adding there were serious staffing and cultural problems. It comes after it was announced on Thursday that Donna Ockenden, who led an inquiry into maternity failings in Shropshire, is tochair a review of services in Nottingham. The original review was launched followinga number of baby deaths and injuriesbut had faced sustained criticism from families and campaigners over its remit and independence. Mrs Hawkins, who worked at the trust with her husband Jack, had been in labour for six days before she gave birth to her stillborn daughter Harriet at Nottingham City Hospital in 2016. She said they knew something had gone wrong as soon as they were told their baby had died. ""Being two clinicians here at the time we thought 'you've seriously got this wrong' and I was then left for nine hours trying to deliver a dead baby because of communication errors,"" she toldRadio 4's Today programme. ""This whole time, I can't even describe the confusion, I felt like I was dying."" The couple were told their daughter had died from an infection, something they did not believe to be correct. They pushed for an external review, in which it was found the deathhad been preventable. They are one of a number of familieswho have spoken out about their experiencesand called for a public inquiry. Donna Ockenden also chaired an inquiry into maternity services in Shropshire Ms Ockenden told the BBC her first priority was to listen to the families that had been affected. ""Very clearly, the CQC issuing a safety warning notice and the stories that we're all seeing - parents have shared widely - there is clearly something that is very, very wrong at the trust,"" she said. ""I'd say to parents speak up if you have concerns, but you should feel confident that the enhanced scrutiny that there is on the trust can only be positive."" Maternity review sees 387 families come forward Families in maternity inquiry hit out at review Maternity review chair steps down from role NHS maternity services in Nottingham - based at the Nottingham City Hospital and Queen's Medical Centre - were initially rated as inadequate in 2020. Thelatest reports,externalsaid maternity servicesat both sites,externalremained inadequate overall. Inspectors, who visited in March, said the department did not have enough staff to care for women and keep them safe. The CQC noted that at City Hospital, there were 19 serious incidents reported by maternity staff between March 2021 and February 2022. In addition, there are currently five Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch investigations. They also issued a warning notice over safe care and treatment related to observations and triage services. Maternity services run by Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust were rated inadequate after an inspection in 2020 Inspectors said their warning notice was issued as staff were not always carrying out observations to make sure patients' conditions were not deteriorating and that triage wait times were too long. However, the report did say staff were compassionate and kind and there was an improvement in staff morale. Fiona Allinson, CQC's director of operations Midlands network, said: ""It's disappointing that despite several inspections where CQC has told the trust areas they must improve to keep mums and babies safe, serious problems remain."" By Michael Buchanan, social affairs correspondent What's most worrying about this report is that the trust is struggling to deal with issues it has long known about. Back in 2018, the trust board was sent a letter from doctors and midwives saying a lack of staff in its maternity units was endangering patient safety. In 2020, the CQC told the trust that staff didn't always know how to keep women and babies safe. Both of these issues remain ongoing concerns. Following reports like this, trusts often argue that if they weren't in the headlines, they could get on with making improvements. But when the bond with patients has been broken, as it has for many in Nottingham, a laser focus on its actions is often the only reassurance families have that meaningful change is under way. The original review, which has now concluded,published its interim report,externalon Thursday. It said maternity services nationally were ""under immense scrutiny"" in light of reports at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust and Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust. Some evidence of ""bullying behaviour"" had been uncovered, with a small number of staff displaying ""unacceptable behaviours such as being 'rude' and 'abrasive'"". However, it added the ""vast majority"" of staff were committed to ""a caring and compassionate culture"". Sharon Wallis, director of midwifery at NUH, said: ""Our teams are working hard to make the necessary improvements, but recognise we have more to do and are absolutely determined to speed up the pace of change and deliver quality services for women and their families."" The overall rating for both Nottingham City Hospital and Queen's Medical Centre following the CQC inspection remains as requires improvement.

"This video can not be played A group of wardens describe what it's like living all year round on a tiny island Wildlife wardens hope to share one Welsh island's secrets with the world - by using cutting edge technology. Flat Holm island, near Cardiff, is home to unique lizards and flowers, and is an important bird sanctuary. Now the variety, location and numbers of flora and fauna will be updated on an interactive digital map at the city's Techniquest science museum. The wardens hope this will improve understanding of climate change and nature. Flat Holm is famous for itsrole in the inventionof radio, but its varieties of plants and animals are not so widely known. Cardiff Metropolitan University has teamed up with the island's wardens to design an interactive exhibit to reflect real-time wildlife data. The wardens described it as a ""really exciting chance"" to engage in the conservation efforts on Flat Holm. Climate change in Wales in charts Donkeys and sharks helped by new nature funding Life on the island is not always easy, according to the current wardens Heidi Aguirregoicoa and Pierre Court. ""It's just a really unique experience. I've never known a place like this,"" said Heidi. Heidi, 21 and Pierre, 23 have been the wardens on Flat Holm for just a few months. With the ""unique"" experience comes a vast range of responsibilities Pierre explained. Heidi Aguirregoicoa said they log data about island's flora, fauna and also the weather ""It's very different to being a manager in an office,"" said Pierre. As well as managing volunteers on the island, the wardens guide tours, run the island pub, maintain buildings and infrastructure and ensure they have clean water. ""All of our water is collected from rainwater. It is then stored in a Victorian tank underneath the ground and filtered several times. And then we can finally drink it and use it in the accommodation,"" added Pierre. ""We basically use the water we've collected throughout the winter and it will last us the entire summer. So, this is a big concern of ours."" He said: ""It makes you really humble living here and you understand that nature will always win. No matter what you do."" Flat Holm Island has been a Site of Special Scientific Interest since 1972. For the wardens and volunteers conservation work is at the heart of life on Flat Holm. Home to a huge population of gulls, the island is also the habitat of slow worms with unique blue markings as well as moths, butterflies and rabbits. Rare plants, such as rock sea lavender, wild peonies and wild leek also grow on the island. To keep track of wildlife, the wardens conduct regular surveys. The interactive map at Techniquest is designed to give an insight into the island's wildlife and weather ""Some of our surveys are monthly and weekly, and some are daily. ""The daily survey is the bird survey. We do a long round trip for an hour every morning, about 7:30 around the edges of the island,"" explained Heidi. They do a rough count of birds and log numbers of the types of moths, butterflies and slow worms. The way the wardens log this data has now changed. Instead of using a paper and a pen, information will be uploaded to an app. This project was a result of a collaboration between Cardiff Harbour Authority, Cardiff Metropolitan University, Techniquest and Yard, a technical marketing agency. Pierre Court said they also run the island's pub as part of their duties Heidi said the new method of logging data is quicker and there is no risk of the data being lost. As well as feeding directly to an exhibit at Techniquest Science Discovery Centre in Cardiff Bay, the data contributes to long-term conservation datasets on the island. Welsh farmers told to cut more carbon emissions How will hospitality survive after summer? Dr Fiona Carroll, an expert in our relationships with computers at Cardiff Met University, believes the pandemic helped us engage with data. ""People started to become fatigued by a lot of the complex data,"" she said. ""So, we've come up with a data impression, and that's really been inspired by going back to the 1800s and the French Impressionists."" Dr Fiona Carroll said the exhibit's colours was inspired by the French Impressionists The interactive exhibit allows people to press buttons which will show the numbers of different animals on the island, using colours and patterns. Data about the weather on the island is also collected and visualised using prisms which rotate to show types of wind, rain or sunshine. There are plans to use these methods and technology in other practical settings. ""We've got data coming out of our ears every second of the day, we're generating more and more data,"" explains Dr Carroll. The slow worms on Flat Holm have unique markings on them She said visualising data could help the public have a greater understanding of the world around them, in areas such as air pollution and making sense of rising food costs in supermarkets. ""It's really exciting knowing the general public are going to be able to experience Flat Holm from afar,"" said Heidi. It is a view shared by warden Pierre, too. ""It's helping us build this relationship with the visitors and the public,"" he said. ""This has just started so we're really hoping that throughout the summer season we might have visitors coming to the island saying, 'oh yeah, I was at the Techniquest and I saw all the data'. ""We're hoping this is going to help Flat Holm grow even more, and help people to get into conservation and into their local sites of interest.""

The US star had been on location filming the movie Dangerous Waters, his publicist Jennifer Allen said. His fiancÃ©e Jacy Nittolo was on location at the time of his death, Ms Allen added. Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Paul Sorvino and Joe Pesci all appeared in the mobster movie Scorsese said he was ""absolutely shocked and devastated"" by the news and that he would always be proud of their work together. ""Playing Henry Hill in Goodfellas was a tall order, because the character had so many different facets, so many complicated layers, and Ray was in almost every scene of a long, tough shoot,"" the filmmaker explained. ""He absolutely amazed me, and I'll always be proud of the work we did together on that picture. ""My heart goes out to his loved ones, and it aches for his loss, way too early."" Lorraine Bracco, who played Karen Friedman Hill in Goodfellas, said she was ""shattered"" to hear the news of her former co-star's death. She shared a photo of them both on Twitter, saying being with him had been the best part of making the film. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Ukrainian troops could withdraw from their final pockets of resistance in the eastern Luhansk region, an official there says Russia is trying to encircle Ukrainian forces in Severodonetsk and Lysychansk as it tries to capture the Donbas region Civilians in Severodonetsk ""are constantly in shelters, it is almost impossible to go outside due to the density of shelling,"" said governor Serhiy Haidai Earlier Ukrainian officials said Russian-backed forces had taken control of the city of Lyman in the eastern Donetsk region The Pentagon says it is ""mindful"" of Ukrainian requests for long-range weapons, something Russian state TV called a red line The Moscow-backed branch of Ukraine's Orthodox Church severs ties with Russia, saying its leaders have failed to condemn the war We're pausing our live coverage of the Ukraine war for now, but will be resuming on Saturday. Thanks for joining us. Our editors today were Thom Poole, Chris Giles and James Clarke. Our writers were James FitzGerald, Emily McGarvey, Robert Greenall, Jeremy Gahagan, Leo Sands and Yaroslav Lukov. You can read more of one of our main stories today - the possible withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from the big eastern city of Severodonetsk -here. If you're just joining us, or need a quick recap, here's the latest with what's been happening in Ukraine on Friday: Russia captures Lyman  Luhansk  Long-range weapons  Church schism This video can not be played 'Switch off the TV': Former Russian-state TV journalist's plea to Russia A journalist who quit her job at Russian state-controlled TV channel back in March over the invasion of Ukraine has told Russian audiences to switch off their television sets. ""Just don't listen, find other sources of information,"" Zhanna Agalakova said in an interview with BBC Newsnight. ""It blows my mind how they do it,"" she added. ""How they brainwash their population"" If you're in the UK you can watch the full interview tonight (Friday 27 May) on BBC Two at 22:30 BST. Some more now on Ukraine's request that the US start supplying it with powerful long-range weapon systems to enhance its military capabilities against Russia. On Friday a Pentagon spokesperson announced that ""decisions...haven't been made yet"" but the US is ""mindful"" of the request. The comment comes after CNN published a report that the US was preparing to send Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) to Ukraine. In the past Washington officials had denied the request fearing such long-range weapons could be used to attack targets inside Russia and end up widening and prolonging the conflict. A presenter on Russian state TV responded to the report by claiming the US would be crossing a red line and deliberately provoking Russia if it supplied Ukraine with the weapons. The evacuees left the city in an armoured vehicle Ukraine's police have taken to safety 31 residents - including 13 children - of Ukraine's eastern city of Lysychansk, in what the top regional official describes as one of the most ""difficult evacuations"" in recent days. Luhansk regional head Serhiy Haidai says the officers were initially sent to evacuate seven people, who had previously agreed to leave but - after ""a few hours of persuasion"" - ended up picking up 31 residents. Haidai also says that one vehicle that delivered humanitarian aid to Lysychansk was damaged because of the fighting in the area. Russian forces have been slowly advancing on the twin cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk. Local officials say two-thirds of Severodonetsk is now surrounded. Ukraine is hugely significant for the Russian Orthodox Church, with many parishes and some of its most important monasteries located there The Ukrainian Orthodox Church has declared its ""full autonomy and independence"" from the under Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP), condemning the stance Russian religious leaders have taken on the war in Ukraine. ""We disagree with the position of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow,"" the UOC-MP said in a statement after a council meeting in Kyiv, referring to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC). Kirill has openly voiced support for Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine launched on 24 February. It is the second schism in Ukraine in recent years, with part of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church breaking away from Moscow in 2019. The Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) was then granted a degree of independence, or the tomos, by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Talks on the unification of the Ukrainian Orthodoxy between the UOC-MP and the OCU have so far brought no breakthrough. Ukraine is hugely significant for the ROC, with many parishes and some of its most important monasteries located there.  Russian forces will not capture Luhansk in the coming days but Ukraine may have to evacuate some of its forces there for their own protection, the region's governor has saidon Telegram,external. ""It is possible that in order not to be surrounded we will have to retreat,"" Serhiy Haidai wrote. In an evening military report he also described how dangerous everyday life was in the Ukrainian-controlled areas of Luhansk. Remaining civilians ""are constantly in shelters, it is almost impossible to go outside due to the density of shelling,"" he said. Haidai added that Russian forces have been continuing to target the city of Severodonetsk, where fighting has broken out on the outskirts of the city. Earlier we reported that the US is preparing to offer Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) to Ukraine, according to reports in US media. Last Saturday Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky repeated his request for Western and Nato countries to supply the weaponry. ""I can honestly say our expectations are very high and we have been waiting a long time ... and I hope for a positive response that will allow us to acquire MLRS weapons,"" he said during a press conference in Kyiv. Thanks to this system, ""Ukraine will be able to take steps to liberate its country,"" he added. The powerful M270 system can launch rockets further than any weapons Ukraine currently possesses. What weapons has the US given to Ukraine? Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent Fire crews deal with a fire after shelling at Bakhmut in the Donbas region There is no doubt Ukraine is suffering setbacks in eastern Ukraine. The assessments from President Zelensky sound increasingly bleak. He says Russia is reducing cities to ashes. Earlier this week he said between 50 and 100 Ukrainians were losing their lives every day in the Donbas. Ukraine is certainly outnumbered and outgunned â with relentless Russian artillery bombardments being used to brutal effect over a much smaller area than during the first phase of the war. One Ukrainian official estimated that in some areas of Donbas their forces are outnumbered seven to one. Today UK PM Boris Johnson acknowledged that Russia was making slow but palpable progress in the region. He called for more military support â including providing Ukraine with long range rocket launchers â which the US is now considering too. There has been a lag between some Western promises of weapons and the time it takes to deliver them and to train Ukrainian forces. They could make a difference. But Russia still has much larger stockpiles of artillery ammunition. A senior official of one Nato country said it was âcriminalâ that the West had more limited stocks. Ukraine and Belarus last met in a qualifying game for Euro 2016 - Ukraine won 3-1 in Lviv Teams from Ukraine and Belarus will be kept apart in international football tournaments and European club competitions until further notice, governing body Uefa says. Uefa suspended Russia - and Russian clubs - from its tournaments
following the invasion of Ukraine, but has allowed Belarus to continue competing
despite that country's support of the invasion. Belarus have already been ordered to play home matches behind closed doors on
neutral territory, and now Uefa says it will not permit any meetings between
teams from Belarus and Ukraine to ensure the safety and security of everyone
involved. The news comes the week beforeUkraine's footballers bid to qualify for the World Cup- they play Scotland next Wednesday in a match delayed by the war, with the winners then playing Wales four days later for a spot in the finals in Qatar. Action against sportspeople and teams from Russia and Belarus has been a bone of contention in recent months. The International Olympic Committee's executive board recommended in February that athletes and teams from the two nations should not
be allowed to take part in international competitions. But international tennis ruling bodies have saidno ranking points will be awarded at Wimbledon this yearafter championship organisers said they would exclude Russian and Belarussian players.

Shaun Pinner, 48, and another Brit, 28-year-old Aiden Aslin, were captured in April while defending Ukraine's south-eastern port of Mariupol, which is now in Russian hands. In footage later shown on Russian state TV, both appeared to have facial bruising, prompting their families to call for the Geneva Convention to be respected. Mr Pinner, originally from Bedfordshire, has lived in Ukraine since 2018. Also in April, Russia released a video of a man who it said he was called Andrew Hill and that he had surrendered to Russian troops.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of ""sabotaging"" peace talks with Russia, the Kremlin has said. The comments were apparently made during a 45-minute phone call between the Russian leader and the Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer. According to Moscow's readout of the call, Putin denied that his country's blockade of Ukrainian ports is to blame for disruption to global food supplies, suggesting the real cause were sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union. Austria's Chancellor said the point of the call, described as ""very intense, very serious"", was to establish if potential humanitarian solutions can be found in Ukraine. He also added Putin said he was ready to discuss a prisoner swap with
Ukraine. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg holds up Sweden and Finland's membership applications Talks aimed at overcoming Turkey's objections to Sweden and Finland joining Nato have broken up with no sign of progress. A senior Turkish official said talks between the countries made little headway and told Reuters news agency ""it is not an easy process"". Negotiations will continue but no date has been set for them, the source added. All 30 Nato members, including Turkey, need to approve the applications from Sweden and Finland to join the Western security alliance. But Turkey has challenged both after accusing the two countries of harbouring individuals linked to Kurdish terrorists, a claim denied by Sweden and Finland. Some analysts view Turkey's stance as an attempt to win concessions from other Nato members. A Ukrainian official has been giving more details about the fighting in the city of Severodonetsk. The head of the Severodonetsk district administration, Roman Vlasenko, told the BBC's World At One programme that Ukrainian forces needed more heavy weaponry to drive the Russians out of the city. He said Russian forces did not have a numerical advantage but had more heavy weapons. ""Arms are reaching the front in many areas of Luhansk and
Donetsk regions,"" Vlasenko said. ""But for the counter-offensive to be quick and effective we
need more of them."" He said Russian forces were in the suburbs and trying to take the city from three sides, but had been repulsed from central areas twice in the last three days. This video can not be played District head Roman Vlasenko says troops need more weapons or Russia will overpower them. Russia requires substantial financial resources in order to continue supporting both its economy and its ""special operation"" in Ukraine, the country's finance minister says. ""Money for a special operation"" means ""huge resources"" are needed, Anton Siluanov says at a university event. Moscow officials insist on referring to the invasion of Ukraine as a ""special military operation."" He adds the Russian government will be spending 8 trillion roubles (Â£95.8bn) in the form of an economic stimulus package this year. ""Huge funds. We need these resources to support the economy, support our citizens."" The Russian economy has fared poorly in the last few months afterbeing hammered by Western sanctions, with some forecasts projecting its GDP to shrink by between 8.5% and 15% this year. Up to 90% of the city has been damaged by shelling Russian forces have taken over two-thirds of the perimeter of the front-line city of Severodonetsk, the governor of Luhansk region says. But Serhiy Haidai says the city is not completely surrounded, denying reports by officials from the pro-Moscow self-declared Luhansk People's Republic that Ukrainian forces are cut off there. Severodonetsk is the most easterly major population centre in the Donbas still controlled by Ukraine. Earlier we reported that 60% of the city's housing stock is completely destroyed and up to 90% of buildings are damaged. At least 1,500 people have died there since the invasion began in February. Russia appears to have gained control of most of Lyman in Donetsk region - one of several key locations in eastern Ukraine under intense bombardment. Moscow says its forces are fighting for the ""complete liberation"" of the Donbas, which broadly refers to Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before the invasion. Russia now controls more than 90% of Luhansk and has made significant advances in Donetsk since its invasion on 24 February. See the latest maps and charts here Â© 2025 BBC.

"Ukrainian troops could withdraw from their final pockets of resistance in the eastern Luhansk region, an official there says Russia is trying to encircle Ukrainian forces in Severodonetsk and Lysychansk as it tries to capture the Donbas region Civilians in Severodonetsk ""are constantly in shelters, it is almost impossible to go outside due to the density of shelling,"" said governor Serhiy Haidai Earlier Ukrainian officials said Russian-backed forces had taken control of the city of Lyman in the eastern Donetsk region The Pentagon says it is ""mindful"" of Ukrainian requests for long-range weapons, something Russian state TV called a red line The Moscow-backed branch of Ukraine's Orthodox Church severs ties with Russia, saying its leaders have failed to condemn the war We're pausing our live coverage of the Ukraine war for now, but will be resuming on Saturday. Thanks for joining us. Our editors today were Thom Poole, Chris Giles and James Clarke. Our writers were James FitzGerald, Emily McGarvey, Robert Greenall, Jeremy Gahagan, Leo Sands and Yaroslav Lukov. You can read more of one of our main stories today - the possible withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from the big eastern city of Severodonetsk -here. If you're just joining us, or need a quick recap, here's the latest with what's been happening in Ukraine on Friday: Russia captures Lyman  Luhansk  Long-range weapons  Church schism This video can not be played 'Switch off the TV': Former Russian-state TV journalist's plea to Russia A journalist who quit her job at Russian state-controlled TV channel back in March over the invasion of Ukraine has told Russian audiences to switch off their television sets. ""Just don't listen, find other sources of information,"" Zhanna Agalakova said in an interview with BBC Newsnight. ""It blows my mind how they do it,"" she added. ""How they brainwash their population"" If you're in the UK you can watch the full interview tonight (Friday 27 May) on BBC Two at 22:30 BST. Some more now on Ukraine's request that the US start supplying it with powerful long-range weapon systems to enhance its military capabilities against Russia. On Friday a Pentagon spokesperson announced that ""decisions...haven't been made yet"" but the US is ""mindful"" of the request. The comment comes after CNN published a report that the US was preparing to send Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) to Ukraine. In the past Washington officials had denied the request fearing such long-range weapons could be used to attack targets inside Russia and end up widening and prolonging the conflict. A presenter on Russian state TV responded to the report by claiming the US would be crossing a red line and deliberately provoking Russia if it supplied Ukraine with the weapons. The evacuees left the city in an armoured vehicle Ukraine's police have taken to safety 31 residents - including 13 children - of Ukraine's eastern city of Lysychansk, in what the top regional official describes as one of the most ""difficult evacuations"" in recent days. Luhansk regional head Serhiy Haidai says the officers were initially sent to evacuate seven people, who had previously agreed to leave but - after ""a few hours of persuasion"" - ended up picking up 31 residents. Haidai also says that one vehicle that delivered humanitarian aid to Lysychansk was damaged because of the fighting in the area. Russian forces have been slowly advancing on the twin cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk. Local officials say two-thirds of Severodonetsk is now surrounded. Ukraine is hugely significant for the Russian Orthodox Church, with many parishes and some of its most important monasteries located there The Ukrainian Orthodox Church has declared its ""full autonomy and independence"" from the under Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP), condemning the stance Russian religious leaders have taken on the war in Ukraine. ""We disagree with the position of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow,"" the UOC-MP said in a statement after a council meeting in Kyiv, referring to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC). Kirill has openly voiced support for Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine launched on 24 February. It is the second schism in Ukraine in recent years, with part of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church breaking away from Moscow in 2019. The Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) was then granted a degree of independence, or the tomos, by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Talks on the unification of the Ukrainian Orthodoxy between the UOC-MP and the OCU have so far brought no breakthrough. Ukraine is hugely significant for the ROC, with many parishes and some of its most important monasteries located there.  Russian forces will not capture Luhansk in the coming days but Ukraine may have to evacuate some of its forces there for their own protection, the region's governor has saidon Telegram,external.

The DUP has refused to support the election of a new speaker or first and deputy first minister until there is ""action"" on the NI Protocol. It comes as a US delegation is in Belfast meeting the five main parties. The delegation's leader Congressman Richard Neal had been criticised for sayingthe protocol dispute was ""manufactured"", which the DUP said was ""one-sided"". However, the DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said the US politicians had shown ""a greater understanding of unionist concerns"" in a meeting with him on Thursday. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Claims about Northern Ireland's Brexit fact-checked ""If their public response echoes what they said to us in the meeting, then some progress will have been made,"" he added. Mr Neal said the meeting went ""pretty well"" with the DUP leader. ""The conversations we had probably 25 years ago were considerably more strenuous than the one we had today,"" he said. He said the argument of the US delegation was ""negotiate a solution to a satisfactory outcome"". Unionist politicians have been protesting against the protocol, which was part ofthe UK government's Brexit deal with the EU. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says US politicians showed an understanding of unionist concerns, including that the protocol undermined Northern Ireland's position in the UK Designed to ensure free trade could continue across Ireland's land border post-Brexit, it has also resulted in additional checks being placed on some goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Sir Jeffrey has previously described this as undermining Northern Ireland's position in the UK. For unionists this US fact finding mission will be remembered for two words, manufactured and planters. Both caused offence when used by Congressman Neal to describe the protocol row and unionists living in Northern Ireland. He may have rowed back from the remarks behind closed doors but there was no sense of a climbdown when Congressman Neal appeared in front of the cameras. ""No harm intended"" was as close as he came. But for the other Stormont parties, the DUP's outrage at Congressman Neal was manufactured to deflect from the party's Executive boycott. The US visitors may not have found too many new facts about the protocol but they did discover where all the pressure points are. The Stormont recall petition was proposed by Sinn FÃ©in on Wednesday in a bid to see a new speaker elected. That election, which required cross-community support, is the first act that must happen after an election before the assembly can carry out any other business. There are concerns that without a functioning government in Northern Ireland, the cost of living crisis cannot be addressed by politicians. On Thursday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announceda Â£1,000 payment for Northern Ireland's most vulnerable households, including a one-off cost of living payment. The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal: it means lorries don't face checkpoints when they go from Northern Ireland (in the UK) to the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) Instead,when goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales), they are checked against EU rules The UK and the EU chose this arrangement becausethe Irish border is a sensitive issuedue to Northern Ireland's troubled political history Read more:Guide to the Brexit border problem The petition needed 30 signatures to pass, and received the backing of Alliance and SDLP. Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) have now been summoned to the Stormont chamber on Monday by current Speaker Alex Maskey to debate the ""urgent appointment"" of ministers. Sinn FÃ©in's would-be first minister, Michelle O'Neill, said voters expected politicians to be in the assembly chamber. Richard Neal, leading a delegation of US politicians, at Stormont with outgoing Speaker Alex Maskey Speaking after meeting the US delegation at Stormont, Ms O'Neill said: ""They expect us to be putting money into peoples pockets but the DUP are blocking all that. ""It's important we attempt to elect a speaker."" However Sir Jeffrey dismissed the recall as a Sinn FÃ©in ""stunt"". ""If they think that pulling a stunt like this next Monday is going to change things, then they really don't understand unionism and our determination to stand our ground until we get the decisive action that is required to move us all forward."" Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie confirmed his party would be at Stormont on Monday, ""because that's our job"". ""The people of Northern Ireland are suffering, we have the power to help them, and the way to do that is to get both the assembly and the executive up and running,"" he said. Mr Beattie said he felt US representatives would emerge from Thursday's meetings ""understanding the unionist position"". He added: ""We were all in agreement to a degree that this is not a crisis, this is a problem and a problem to be solved."" Alliance MP Stephen Farry said there were ""genuine"" problems with the protocol, but unionism was not ""helping itself"" by walking away from solutions offered. ""The solution here has to be about partnership between the UK and the European Union, and we deeply understand the frustrations that the EU has with the approach that the UK has taken, but we also feel that creativity is required to get this over the line. ""We need to see more progress."" On Wednesday night, the American delegation was hosted by Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis, who said the UK and the US were united in their shared commitment to the Good Friday Agreement. DUP Mayor of Derry Graham Warke asked if the US visitors ""could be careful with their words"" Earlier, the UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, on a visit to County Antrim, said issues with the protocol were ""soluble"" but cannot be allowed to drift. Businesses in Northern Ireland think the protocol can work- and want it to, the UK's biggest business association has said. Tony Danker, the director general of the CBI, said: ""If you're a manufacturer you have access to dual markets. That is a very big deal in the context of the overall Brexit fall out.""

"This video can not be played 'A contributor to Irish language, culture and tradition' Without scholars such as John Hannon and his contemporaries, much of the Irish language, through song and written word, could have been consigned to history. The Crossmaglen man was a collector, writing down the phrases, lyrics and prayers which had been passed down from generation to generation in south Armagh. On Thursday, more than 90 years after his death, the linguist was honoured with a blue plaque by the Ulster History Circle. Dr GearÃ³id Trimble, of Foras na Gaeilge, said Hannon was an important figure in ""gathering and preserving what was left of that last generation of native Gaelic speakers"" in the late 19th century. His work took place in the context of younger generations learning English to seek opportunities for work or to emigrate. ""There was this huge stigma associated with the Irish language among those who were speaking and using it, but these local collectors, the likes of Hannon, being of the area, were able to break down the barriers,"" Dr Trimble told BBC News NI. Born in County Leitrim in 1867, Hannon was the son of a Royal Irish Constabulary constable. After John Sr took early retirement, the family moved to Crossmaglen, close to his mother's birthplace, and opened a shop in the centre of the village. It was there that a young Hannon, who did not speak Irish, became fascinated by the language used by the family's customers and neighbours. Adapting a key system for transcriptions, Hannon learned how to write down the words phonetically. Dr GearÃ³id Trimble said Hannon amassed a valuable linguistic store of the Oriel dialect Dr Trimble said his manuscripts would go on to include ""over 130 songs that were commonly sung in the district during the 19th century"". Among these was 'MÃ¡ire Chaoch' (Crooked-eye Mary), a satirical poem by Art McCooey, who was also honoured with a blue plaque in the area in 2014. Drawing upon dozens of contacts, Hannon ""managed to amass a huge valuable linguistic store of contents in the unique dialect of Oriel"", Dr Trimble said. The Oriel - or Oirialla - refers to a region along the modern Irish border including south Armagh. ""It wasn't connected to Donegal Irish, it wasn't connected to Connemara Irish, it was very much a form of dialect that managed to develop in its own right and it was cut off from other parts of Irish-speaking Ireland,"" Dr Trimble explained. Hannon, who neither married nor had children, died aged 64 in 1931, after spending the last years of his life in a Newry workhouse. Archbishop of Armagh Eamon Martin, the head of the Catholic Church in Ireland, said he ""left behind him a very rich resource, a collection which will speak for generations to come"". Archbishop Eamon Martin said Hannon's legacy will inspire future generations ""The work that he did was perhaps forgotten, but I think that's a lovely lesson for everyone to realise that you can make a contribution which will be remembered a whole century after you've died and people will remember it and thank you for it,"" he told BBC News NI. The singer PÃ¡draigÃ­n NÃ­ UallachÃ¡in, who has written about the songs and traditions of the Oriel region, said the plaque was a long-deserved recognition. ""Other collectors and other linguists were using his material over the past 100 years for their own studies,"" she said. PÃ¡draigÃ­n NÃ­ UallachÃ¡in standing at the door of the shop owned by the Hannon family ""He did tremendous work. It's also very lonely work because you are witnessing the death of a great, great tradition and he was doing that alone knowing that, if he hadn't done that, then it would be lost. ""There were singers in this area who could recite a thousand lines of the richest of poetry,"" she continued. ""They may not have been schooled in the formal sense, but they had tremendous capacity for retaining oral memory."" Ms NÃ­ UallachÃ¡in said that during her research for songs to perform, she discovered in Hannon's work ""so much memory that had been lost and could be returned to people in the community"". ""It can't be measured, the value of that material for people and generations who are returning to the language and reclaiming their own traditions."" During the event on Thursday, the Oriel Traditional Orchestra, along with local singers, played some of the songs which Hannon transcribed, including Chuaigh an Mhaol, which has its origins in the village square where it was performed. ""This song was used to try and scare children to keep them in at night,"" said Dr Trimble, who is from Crossmaglen. ""The premise of the song was this bald, hornless cow would come chasing you. An awful lot of these songs are very unique to the area. ""They preserve place names, names of families, people, events - they are capsules of social history in their own right."" Local singers performed some of the songs Hannon transcribed EibhlÃ­n Mhic Aoidh, from the Ulster History Circle, who spoke at the unveiling, studied Irish at summer colleges in Donegal. ""Some of the songs I learned were actually songs that Hannon had collected and preserved,"" she recalled. ""Some of them are sung throughout Ireland. ""This event is folklore as a dynamic, living, breathing phenomenon. They are being sung by local people and by young people,"" she continued. Chuaigh an Mhaol was performed in its traditional setting, the market square of Crossmaglen ""These are the songs John Hannon noted from old people at the end of the 19th century."" Ms Mhic Aoidh said the plaque was an example of the voluntary group trying to ""shine a light on the contribution of local people to history"". Finance Minister Conor Murphy was also in attendance and described Hannon as a ""very important figure, although not a very well known figure"". Growing up in south Armagh, he said he was aware of the area's ""rich tradition of Gaelic poets, folklore and music"", but had it not been for Hannon, much of it could have been ""lost for all time"". ""There are more prominent Gaelic scholars, and perhaps he wasn't as academic as the rest of them, but his work was invaluable,"" the Newry and Armagh assembly member said. He said the ""growing and vibrant"" language community of today could trace its success back to the work of collectors such as Hannon. The event came a day after legislation to provide for the ""recognition and protection"" of the Irish languagetook its first steps at Westminster. The bill also provides for the development of the Ulster Scots and Ulster British tradition in Northern Ireland.

"Eight million people are receiving the final instalment of cost of living payments totalling Â£900. Those on means-tested benefits including universal credit will be paid directly, without the need to make a claim, by 22 February.

To qualify, people need to have claimed a benefits payment between 13 November 2023 and 12 December 2023. Those who received a payment for an assessment period ending between these dates are also eligible. Pensioner households may be able to have a new pension credit claim backdated. An estimated 850,000 pensioner householdsdo not claim pension credit, which is a gateway to these extra payments. People are not eligible if they receive new-style employment and support allowance, contributory employment and support allowance, or new-style jobseeker's allowance - unless they get universal credit. Anyone who thinks they should have received the help but did not should contact the office that pays their benefit or tax credits, orreport it here,external. The payment reference on a recipient's bank account is their National Insurance number, followed by DWP COL. The 1.1 million people who receive only working tax credit or child tax credit, rather than any of the other benefits have the reference HMRC COLS. Cost of living payments do not affect the tax you pay, or the benefits or tax credits you receive. Households thatreceive the winter fuel payment,external- which is paid to nearly all homes with at least one person of pension age - received an extra payment of between Â£150 and Â£300 during the winter. Lower-income pensioners who claim pension credit get the money in addition to the support provided for those on benefits.

It is the deadliest shooting at a US elementary school since 20 children and six adults died at Sandy Hook school a decade ago. There were two pairs of cousins among the children killed in the attack. Some parents were at the school hours before the shooting, watching with pride as their children held up their honour roll certificates at an awards ceremony. Hours later, they were back there. One of them wasAlexandria Aniyah Rubio, in the fourth grade, who had earned an A certificate. ""We told her we loved her and would pick her up after school,"" her mother Kimberly wrote on Facebook.

"The windfall tax on oil and gas companies will increase in November, and will remain in place until March 2030. The levy was introduced as a response to soaring energy company profits, and was designed to help fund a scheme to limit household gas and electricity bills. However, firms in the sector have warned that the increase will hit jobs and investment. A windfall tax is a levy imposed on companies that have benefited from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall. Global oil and gas prices started to rise in late 2020 as demand increased with the lifting of Covid restrictions, but they soared in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The increase in prices led to bumper profits for energy companies, leading to calls for a windfall tax. The Energy Profits Levy - the formal name for the windfall tax -was introduced in May 2022 by the then Chancellor, Rishi Sunak,external. The government said the money raised would fund support for households facing rising energy bills. The levy applies to profits made from extracting UK oil and gas. It was initially set at 25% and was due to expire at the end of 2025. In January 2023 the then Chancellor Jeremy Hunt increased the levy to 35%. In the spring 2024 Budget,Hunt announced it would remain in place until March 2029because the continuing war in Ukraine was extending energy firms' windfall profits. The new Labour government saidit would increase the levy to 38% on 1 November,external. The tax will remain in place until 31 March 2030, unless - as originallyset out by the previous government- oil and gas prices drop below a certain level for six months. A separate levy was also brought in on ""extraordinary returns"" from low-carbon electricity generating firms in the UK. Larger operators started payingthe Electricity Generator Levy,externalon 1 January 2023. It was hoped this would raise about Â£14bn over six years. Among the UK energy giants, BP reported a record profit of $27.7bn in 2022. While this fell to$13.8bn in 2023, it was still the firm's second highest annual profit in a decade. Shell's profits of $39.9bn in 2022 were the highest in its 115-year history. Its 2023profits were $28.2bn. BP says its UK businesses account for less than 10% of global profits, while Shell makes about 5% of its revenue in the UK. Oil and gas firms operating in the North Sea were already taxed differently before the levy was introduced In the financial year 2022-2023, the first year of its operation,the levy raised Â£2.6bn,external. In the following 12-month periodit raised Â£3.6bn,external. BP said its North Sea business paid $2.2bn in UK tax for its North Sea operations in 2022, of which $700m was due to the levy. In 2023 it paid $1.5bn (Â£1.2bn), including $720m under the levy. Shell said it paid Â£178m in UK windfall tax for 2022. In 2023, it paid Â£1.1bn in overall tax in the UK, Â£240m of which was a result of the levy. Oil and gas firms operating in the North Sea are taxed differently to other companies. They pay 30% corporation tax on their profits and a supplementary 10% rate on top of that. In contrast, other firms with profits over Â£250,000 a year pay 25% corporation tax. When the windfall tax is added, it means the overall tax rate faced by oil and gas companies operating in the UK is 75%, rising to 78% in November. However, oil and gas firms have been able to reduce the amount of UK tax they pay by factoring in losses or spending on things like decommissioning North Sea oil platforms. BP,externalandShell,externalboth received more money back from the UK government than they paid in tax every year from 2015 to 2020 (except Shell in 2017). Energy firms have also been able to reduce the amount of windfall tax they pay through certain investment allowances. However, the government has said it will remove some of these allowances from 1 November. Further details on the changes to the windfall levy will be set out in the Budget on 30 October. What might be in the Budget? The industry body Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) said the proposed changes to the windfall taxwill sharply reduce investment in the sector, putting thousands of jobs at risk. OEUK says the expected tax paid by oil and gas producers would ""increase in the very short term"" by Â£2bn, and would later result in a Â£12bn loss. In August, 42 companies wrote to the government toexpress their ""grave concern"" over the changes. The Treasury said the government was committed to a ""constructive dialogue"" with the oil and gas industry about the levy. But it also said it wanted North Sea oil and gas producers ""to contribute their fair share towards our energy transition"" away from fossil fuels. Where does the UK get its energy from?

"This video can not be played BBC Political Editor Chris Mason asks the chancellor why he uses âenergy profits levy"" phrase - and not say windfall tax. Every household in the UK is to get an energy bill discount of Â£400 this October as part of a package of new measures to tackle soaring prices. The poorest households will also get a payment of Â£650 to help with the cost of living, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said. It follows warnings that millions could be left struggling if energy prices rise again in October as expected. Mr Sunak said he had offered ""significant support"" for households who were facing ""acute distress"". The package of new measures, worth Â£15bn in total, will also offer more targeted help to pensioners and the disabled. The cost will be partly offset by 25% windfall tax on oil and gas firms' profits, which have soared in recent months. It comes a day afterSue Gray's critical report into lockdown parties in Downing Streetand follows intense pressure on the government to do more to help people with the cost of living crisis. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said the support was a ""genuinely big package"". ""Put these benefit increases alongside the tax rises just implemented, and Mr Sunak is engaging in some serious redistribution from rich to poor - albeit against a backdrop of rising inequality."" How plans to tackle cost of living will affect you Live page: Millions to get support with energy bills Typical energy bill set to rise by Â£800 a year Mr Sunak said the government had ""a collective responsibility to help those who are paying the highest price for the high inflation we face."" The chancellor also announced: Eight million households on means-tested benefits will get Â£650 paid directly into their bank accounts in two lump sums - one in July, the other this autumn There will be separate one-off payments of Â£300 to pensioner households and Â£150 to individuals receiving disability benefits - groups who are ""most vulnerable to rising prices"" The emergency Household Support Fund, which is allocated by councils in England, will be extended by Â£500m to Â£1.5bn. The devolved governments will receive equivalent funding. Earlier this week,UK energy regulator Ofgem saidthe typical household energy bill was set to rise by Â£800 in October, bringing it to Â£2,800 a year. Bills had already risen by Â£700 on average in April. Households will still face rises in bills even with the further government support. Mr Sunaktold the BBC the new measures will have a ""minimal impact"" on inflation. The prices of food, fuel and other goods have surged in recent months, pushing inflation - the rate at which prices rise - to a 40-year high. This video can not be played Rachel Reeves says the Conservative windfall tax is a ""policy that dare not speak its name"". Mr Sunak blamed the war in Ukraine, recent lockdowns in China and the post-pandemic recovery for the surging prices. But he said the situation had ""evolved and become more serious"" pushing the government to act. Under the new measures, the government will scrapa plan to give everyone in England, Scotland and Wales Â£200 off bills from Octoberwhich would be repaid over five years. Instead, that sum will be doubled to Â£400 and will not need to be paid back. Direct debit and credit customers will have the money credited to their accounts, while customers with pre-payment meters will have the money applied to their meter or paid via a voucher. While the Â£400 discount should be UK wide, the lack of an Executive at Stormont in Northern Ireland means people there must wait before they find out when will they receive the discount. The measures add to around Â£17bn of support already given by the government, including one-off Â£150 council tax rebates for most homes in England and Wales. The government had until now rejected the idea of a windfall tax on energy firms' profits, saying it could deter investment in the UK. But Mr Sunak said the oil and gas sector was ""making extraordinary profits"" and that he was ""sympathetic to the argument to tax those profits fairly"". He said the tax would raise about Â£5bn this year and be scrapped when oil and gas prices - which have surged recently - return to normal levels. However, in seeking a ""sensible middle ground"" energy suppliers will be able to apply for tax relief of 90p for every pound they invest in UK oil and gas projects. Mr Sunak also said he believed there was a case for taxing electricity suppliers more, announcing a consultation on the idea. How will the Â£5bn windfall tax on energy firms work? What help will I get with my bills? Is the UK doing as much on bills as other countries? Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chancellor, said: ""After five months of being dragged kicking and screaming, the chancellor has finally come to his senses, U-turned, and adopted Labour's plan for a windfall tax on oil and gas producer profits to lower bills."" But business lobby group the CBI warned the windfall tax would be damaging to investment needed for Britain's ""energy security and net zero ambitions"". Oil giant BP said the new tax was ""a multi-year proposal"" rather than a ""one-off tax"". ""Naturally we will now need to look at the impact of both the new levy and the tax relief on our North Sea investment plans,"" it warned. Zoe, a single mum who lives on The Wirral with her four year old daughter, and who receives universal credit will get Â£400 off her energy bills and also the Â£650 one-off payment. She said she was ""over the moon that the government is finally making us feel like we're being listened to"". ""My big worry was going through the summer holidays with a young one and obviously not having the money to take them out too much,"" she told the BBC. ""With that payment coming through that has lifted a lot of stress and anxiety, because I was really panicked about this."" Debt charity Turn2Us called the support package ""a much-needed step in the right direction in making sure people on the lowest incomes are able to weather this financial crisis"". But Michael Clarke, its head of information programmes, added: ""For people who are in crisis currently, one-off payments will only act as a sticking plaster until longer term investment is made to boost their overall income."" Think tank the Resolution Foundation, which campaigns to end poverty, called the measures ""progressive"", adding that twice as much of the Â£15bn package would go to low-income households than high income ones. Chief executive Torsten Bell said: ""The decision to provide one-off payments this year to poorer households, pensioners and those with a disability is a good attempt to target those with higher energy bills - although the relative lack of support for larger families stands out.""

"Sarah Hawkins gave birth to her stillborn daughter Harriet in 2016 A mother whose baby died after mistakes by staff said she felt like she ""was dying"", on the day the NHS trust responsible is ordered to improve its maternity services. The units at Nottingham University Hospitals trust - under review after dozens of baby deaths - have been rated inadequate by the health watchdog. Sarah Hawkins gave birth to her stillborn daughter Harriet in 2016. The trust said it was working hard to make improvements. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said the trust must make immediate improvements to its maternity services, adding there were serious staffing and cultural problems. It comes after it was announced on Thursday that Donna Ockenden, who led an inquiry into maternity failings in Shropshire, is tochair a review of services in Nottingham. The original review was launched followinga number of baby deaths and injuriesbut had faced sustained criticism from families and campaigners over its remit and independence. Mrs Hawkins, who worked at the trust with her husband Jack, had been in labour for six days before she gave birth to her stillborn daughter Harriet at Nottingham City Hospital in 2016. She said they knew something had gone wrong as soon as they were told their baby had died. ""Being two clinicians here at the time we thought 'you've seriously got this wrong' and I was then left for nine hours trying to deliver a dead baby because of communication errors,"" she toldRadio 4's Today programme. ""This whole time, I can't even describe the confusion, I felt like I was dying."" The couple were told their daughter had died from an infection, something they did not believe to be correct. They pushed for an external review, in which it was found the deathhad been preventable. They are one of a number of familieswho have spoken out about their experiencesand called for a public inquiry. Donna Ockenden also chaired an inquiry into maternity services in Shropshire Ms Ockenden told the BBC her first priority was to listen to the families that had been affected. ""Very clearly, the CQC issuing a safety warning notice and the stories that we're all seeing - parents have shared widely - there is clearly something that is very, very wrong at the trust,"" she said. ""I'd say to parents speak up if you have concerns, but you should feel confident that the enhanced scrutiny that there is on the trust can only be positive."" Maternity review sees 387 families come forward Families in maternity inquiry hit out at review Maternity review chair steps down from role NHS maternity services in Nottingham - based at the Nottingham City Hospital and Queen's Medical Centre - were initially rated as inadequate in 2020. Thelatest reports,externalsaid maternity servicesat both sites,externalremained inadequate overall. Inspectors, who visited in March, said the department did not have enough staff to care for women and keep them safe. The CQC noted that at City Hospital, there were 19 serious incidents reported by maternity staff between March 2021 and February 2022. In addition, there are currently five Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch investigations. They also issued a warning notice over safe care and treatment related to observations and triage services. Maternity services run by Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust were rated inadequate after an inspection in 2020 Inspectors said their warning notice was issued as staff were not always carrying out observations to make sure patients' conditions were not deteriorating and that triage wait times were too long. However, the report did say staff were compassionate and kind and there was an improvement in staff morale. Fiona Allinson, CQC's director of operations Midlands network, said: ""It's disappointing that despite several inspections where CQC has told the trust areas they must improve to keep mums and babies safe, serious problems remain."" By Michael Buchanan, social affairs correspondent What's most worrying about this report is that the trust is struggling to deal with issues it has long known about. Back in 2018, the trust board was sent a letter from doctors and midwives saying a lack of staff in its maternity units was endangering patient safety. In 2020, the CQC told the trust that staff didn't always know how to keep women and babies safe. Both of these issues remain ongoing concerns. Following reports like this, trusts often argue that if they weren't in the headlines, they could get on with making improvements. But when the bond with patients has been broken, as it has for many in Nottingham, a laser focus on its actions is often the only reassurance families have that meaningful change is under way. The original review, which has now concluded,published its interim report,externalon Thursday. It said maternity services nationally were ""under immense scrutiny"" in light of reports at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust and Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust. Some evidence of ""bullying behaviour"" had been uncovered, with a small number of staff displaying ""unacceptable behaviours such as being 'rude' and 'abrasive'"". However, it added the ""vast majority"" of staff were committed to ""a caring and compassionate culture"". Sharon Wallis, director of midwifery at NUH, said: ""Our teams are working hard to make the necessary improvements, but recognise we have more to do and are absolutely determined to speed up the pace of change and deliver quality services for women and their families."" The overall rating for both Nottingham City Hospital and Queen's Medical Centre following the CQC inspection remains as requires improvement.

"Ray Liotta played mobster Henry Hill in Goodfellas Goodfellas actor Ray Liotta has died in his sleep in the Dominican Republic at the age of 67. The US star had been on location filming the movie Dangerous Waters, his publicist Jennifer Allen said. He was best known for playing mobster Henry Hill in Martin Scorsese's 1990 gangster film Goodfellas and also appeared in Field of Dreams. Liotta got his big break playing ex-convict Ray Sinclair in 1986 black comedy Something Wild.

By the 90s he was starring in Unlawful Entry, Cop Land and Corrina, Corrina with Whoopi Goldberg. Last year he starred in the Sopranos prequel filmThe Many Saints Of Newark,having turned down a role in the original series. The New Jersey-born actor said in 2016 that he regretted turning down the chance to audition for Tim Burton's Batman film. ""When I did my first movie, Tim Burton was getting ready to do Batman and he was interested in me because he wanted it to be edgy and real. ""I thought, 'Batman? That's a stupid idea', even though he had just done one of my favourite movies of all time, Beetlejuice. So yes, I regret not auditioning for that'.""

"The cost of rapidly charging an electric car has risen sharply as energy costs soar, the RAC has said. However, electric car charging still remains cheaper than petrol and diesel, the motoring organisation said. Rises in electricity and gas prices, in part since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, are behind the increased charging costs. But fuel prices have gone up more quickly as crude oil suppliers struggle to meet demand. The price of charging an electric car on a pay-as-you-go, non-subscription basis at a publicly accessible rapid charger has increased by 21% over the last nine months, the RAC said. Even charging at home has been getting more expensive as energy bills spiral upwards. The cost of the electricity used to power electric vehicles varies according to the household tariff the customer is on. But both rapid charging and home charging are still less expensive than petrol or diesel per mile. Electric vehicle (EV) charging is nearly half the cost per mile compared to filling a family car with petrol, the motoring organisation said. The average cost of a litre of petrol has increased by 25% since last September, and diesel by 30%, according to the RAC. This month diesel pricesrose to a recordof more than Â£1.80 a litre. ""While electric car drivers may not be immune from the rocketing price of wholesale energy - most notably gas, which in turn dictates the cost of electricity - there's no doubt that charging an electric vehicle still represents excellent value for money compared to filling up a petrol or diesel car,"" RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams told the BBC. The three main rapid charging companies are BP Pulse, Instavolt and Ospreyaccording to Zap Map,external, which records charge point distribution and costs. Mr Williams said that ""unsurprisingly"" the quickest places to charge are also the most expensive with ultra-rapid chargers costing on average 14% more to use than rapid chargers. How easy is it to drive across Wales in an electric car? Is the UK on track to meet its climate targets? The classic cars being converted to electric vehicles While the RAC analysis charted on-the-road pricing, private EV owners may not use this as their primary way of charging. The RAC said the most affordable way of charging an electric car is from home, where overnight electricity rates can be much lower than their public charger counterparts. According to the AA motoring group, some EV car owners use tariffs as low as 4.5p per kilowatt hour during off-peak times when charging at home. In addition, it said charging from lampposts is 46% cheaper than on-the-road rapid charging. But it said this option is only available in some parts of the country at the moment. ""Sadly just 87 councils out of almost 400 across the UK have applied for the on-street residential chargepoint grant since 2017,"" said Jack Cousins, head of road policy at the AA. ""This needs to dramatically improve so that EV drivers across the country have access to good, local chargepoints,"" he said. Another reason home charging can be so much cheaper than rapid charging is because of ""the bizarre way that electricity is taxed"", Simon Williams from the RAC added. ""Right now, VAT on electricity from a public charger is levied at a rate four-times that which applies to domestic electricity, which makes it far more expensive to charge on-the-go than it should be,"" he said. Electric cars also usually cost thousands of pounds more than their petrol or diesel counterparts. This is because EV batteries are expensive to make and a high level of investment is needed to transform existing factory production lines to manufacture the new technology. However, costs are expected to come down in the near future: industry group the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders forecasts electric and internal combustion engine cars should cost roughly the same ""by the end of this decade."" Melanie Shufflebotham, co-founder of Zap Map, said: ""More electric cars need to be produced at a mid-price range, with the cost of living crisis it's going to be really hard for many people to buy a new car but there are subscription models."" ""There should be price parity for EV cars by 2025 as the price of batteries comes down"". ""Though costs are up, EV drivers are feeling happy they're saving even when charging on the most expensive public charging spots when compared to fossil fuels,"" she added.

"This video can not be played First Minister Mark Drakeford removes all remaining Covid restrictions in Wales The wearing of face masks will no longer be legally required in Welsh health and social care services from Monday. First Minister Mark Drakeford confirmed the ending of the last of Wales' Covid rules, which have been in place in some form since March 2020. Ministers said the public health situation had continued to improve over the last few weeks. Wales was the last part of the UK with Covid restrictions still in place. However most of the rules that affected people's day to day lives, such as wearing face masks in shops and on public transport and self-isolation rules,ended in March. It will no longer be a legal requirement to wear a mask in hospitals from Monday - but guidance will remain The number of people estimated to have Covid-19 in Wales has fallen for the sixth week in a row. However the Welsh government said the NHS continued to experience ""emergency and pandemic pressures"". Guidance will remain in place strongly recommending the use of face coverings in health settings to help protect the most vulnerable. Wales' Covid laws and mass testing to be axed What are the latest Covid rules for Wales? What's the guidance for Covid in the UK now? Announcing the decision in a news conference, Mr Drakeford said authorities were planning to deal with Covid like ""any other seasonal illness"" from now on. But he warned measures were in reality ""on hold"" in case of another wave - with two new variants already being monitored by health officials. ""We have learned, time and again, that this virus can behave in ways that are neither expected nor predictable,"" he said. He said that the Welsh government was ""ready to bring back testing and contact tracing"", should that be needed. Booster vaccines are already being made available for the autumn, and ministers are encouraging people to get a flu jab later this year. Early indications were that ministers would be advised to offer an annual Covid jab in future years, the first minister added, possibly only to older age groups and the most vulnerable. Broader mask rules were scrapped earlier in the year Despite the changes to rules on face masks, Helen Whyley, director of nurses union RCN Wales, asked people to continue wearing them in healthcare settings if asked. She said: ""The legal requirement may be removed, however health and social care professionals across settings are still asking people to think carefully about wearing a mask when attending appointments or visiting friends and family. In some circumstances staff may ask you to wear a mask. ""I am encouraging everyone to be respectful with these requests to help keep the people of Wales safe and health care services recover from the pandemic."" Care Forum Wales said the decision was a ""step towards the normality everyone wants"" but admitted there would be a mixture of emotions. ""It's impossible to estimate the level of trauma people have gone through in the sector,"" chief executive Mary Wimbury toldRadio Wales Breakfast. ""It's going to have to be risk assessed for each sector. ""Sometimes you're going into people's homes where there is a lot of people in and out throughout the day, not wearing masks, and it's going to be great for staff not to have to [wear them] throughout the summer. ""Equally there is going to be vulnerable people you are still visiting and they will want you to wear masks. ""We understand why the restrictions have continued, but it is all about balance."" Newport's Lucy Taylor said she remained cautious and still wore her mask at work Lucy Taylor, from Newport, has cystic fibrosis and shielded during the pandemic. The 29-year-old said it had taken her a long time to be able to venture out and she continued to wear her mask at work. She said: ""It's better for me to live normally again. ""I think if I don't do that I'll just go back into my shell and I'm going to be so scared of going out, that I'm not going to want to go out."" Alex Osbourne has been shielding for the past two years due to her MS Alex Osbourne, from Caerphilly, works for the charity Disability Wales and has been shielding since the start of the pandemic due to her multiple sclerosis (MS). ""I'm quite anxious about this,"" she said, of the final rule being dropped. ""Masks made me feel a bit safer. I have to go to hospital quite a lot so the idea that they won't be worn there anymore is really stressful. ""I understand people don't want to wear them anymore, but it's very stressful for people like me with no immune system who don't have that same confidence as everyone else to start mixing again."" There were an estimated 52,900 people with the virus, according to the weekly swab survey of thousands of households in Wales by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS said this was one in 55 people - or 1.74% of the population, in the week ending 21 May,  a reduction for a sixth successive week. Daily estimates have infections highest in those in their early 40s and lowest in those over 80. Latest hospital figures in Wales showed on Thursday there were only 25 acute patients with Covid who were being actively treated for the virus. According to Digital Health and Care Wales figures, 85% of patients who tested positive for Covid were in hospital to be treated for something else. Looking at patients testing positive for Covid in all hospitals, the average in the last week has dropped by 27% to 215 - the lowest average since last August. Welsh Conservative shadow health minister Russell George said he was delighted that Covid regulations were ending. He said: ""Not only do we need to remember all those who lost lives and loved ones to lockdowns and the virus itself, but learn the lessons about how we can counter another pandemic and assess the impact of deploying harsh emergency restrictions on our population. ""But none of us will ever get the answers we deserve without the Wales-specific public inquiry everyone in the country wants apart from, not surprisingly, the Labour government who run scared of scrutiny."" Answering journalists' questions, Mr Drakeford again rejected such an investigation, saying he was ""confident"" the UK inquiry, chaired by Baroness Hallett, was ""sensitive to the needs of Wales"". A Welsh-only probe ""would not provide the answers people rightly would expect from an inquiry"", he added. Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said he shared the ""nervousness among health professionals about the removal of the need to wear masks in health and care settings, because of vulnerability of so many in the sector"". ""[The] Welsh government must make sure they monitor very carefully the extent to which people follow the guidance for people to continue wearing them in these settings,"" he added. Now that the Covid regulations are going, Mr ap Iorwerth said, ""we owe it to our hard-working staff"" to ""bring our health service on to a more sustainable footing, by reducing waiting times, speeding up the patient journey, and joining up health with social care"". Although the requirement to wear a face covering in health and social care was not part of the original legislation, coronavirus rules in Wales have existed in some form since March 2020. The law was used to impose strict curbs on people's day to day lives, including three stay-at-homelockdowns,restrictions on traveland on whatbusinesses could and could not do. In Wales masks became obligatory in all indoor public places in September 2020. Powers under public health legislation meant the rules could be imposed quickly, without always having to go to the Senedd for a vote first. Welsh ministers added and removed measures as the Covid situation changed. Initially the rules were largely the same across the UK, although this changed as England reopened in the summer of 2020, and differences developed between the different nations. Mr Drakeford's approach to sometimes ease restrictions slower than in England, and to impose restrictions during the first Omicron wave in the autumn, had been criticised by the Welsh Conservatives for being too stringent or for not moving fast enough to lift rules. But the Welsh government has said it had the public's support for how it managed the regulations. While the requirement to self-isolate has ended in law, and only LFTs and not PCR tests are now available to the general public, routine contract tracing has continued in Wales. Under the Welsh government's Covid-19 strategy, it will end in June. It ended in England on 24 February. In Friday's news conference, Mr Drakeford said Wales has a stock of 90 million lateral flow tests, and a decision is still to be made on whether to offer those stocks for free in the winter. The decision was whether to keep free tests over the summer - they are due to end at the end of June - or to hold stocks back for the winter, he added. Discussions are still going on with the UK government to see if further purchases of LTF tests will happen on a UK-wide basis, he said.

"This video can not be played BBC Political Editor Chris Mason asks the chancellor why he uses âenergy profits levy"" phrase - and not say windfall tax. Every household in the UK is to get an energy bill discount of Â£400 this October as part of a package of new measures to tackle soaring prices. The poorest households will also get a payment of Â£650 to help with the cost of living, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said. It follows warnings that millions could be left struggling if energy prices rise again in October as expected. Mr Sunak said he had offered ""significant support"" for households who were facing ""acute distress"". The package of new measures, worth Â£15bn in total, will also offer more targeted help to pensioners and the disabled. The cost will be partly offset by 25% windfall tax on oil and gas firms' profits, which have soared in recent months. It comes a day afterSue Gray's critical report into lockdown parties in Downing Streetand follows intense pressure on the government to do more to help people with the cost of living crisis. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said the support was a ""genuinely big package"". ""Put these benefit increases alongside the tax rises just implemented, and Mr Sunak is engaging in some serious redistribution from rich to poor - albeit against a backdrop of rising inequality."" How plans to tackle cost of living will affect you Live page: Millions to get support with energy bills Typical energy bill set to rise by Â£800 a year Mr Sunak said the government had ""a collective responsibility to help those who are paying the highest price for the high inflation we face."" The chancellor also announced: Eight million households on means-tested benefits will get Â£650 paid directly into their bank accounts in two lump sums - one in July, the other this autumn There will be separate one-off payments of Â£300 to pensioner households and Â£150 to individuals receiving disability benefits - groups who are ""most vulnerable to rising prices"" The emergency Household Support Fund, which is allocated by councils in England, will be extended by Â£500m to Â£1.5bn. The devolved governments will receive equivalent funding. Earlier this week,UK energy regulator Ofgem saidthe typical household energy bill was set to rise by Â£800 in October, bringing it to Â£2,800 a year. Bills had already risen by Â£700 on average in April. Households will still face rises in bills even with the further government support. Mr Sunaktold the BBC the new measures will have a ""minimal impact"" on inflation. The prices of food, fuel and other goods have surged in recent months, pushing inflation - the rate at which prices rise - to a 40-year high. This video can not be played Rachel Reeves says the Conservative windfall tax is a ""policy that dare not speak its name"". Mr Sunak blamed the war in Ukraine, recent lockdowns in China and the post-pandemic recovery for the surging prices. But he said the situation had ""evolved and become more serious"" pushing the government to act. Under the new measures, the government will scrapa plan to give everyone in England, Scotland and Wales Â£200 off bills from Octoberwhich would be repaid over five years. Instead, that sum will be doubled to Â£400 and will not need to be paid back. Direct debit and credit customers will have the money credited to their accounts, while customers with pre-payment meters will have the money applied to their meter or paid via a voucher. While the Â£400 discount should be UK wide, the lack of an Executive at Stormont in Northern Ireland means people there must wait before they find out when will they receive the discount. The measures add to around Â£17bn of support already given by the government, including one-off Â£150 council tax rebates for most homes in England and Wales. The government had until now rejected the idea of a windfall tax on energy firms' profits, saying it could deter investment in the UK. But Mr Sunak said the oil and gas sector was ""making extraordinary profits"" and that he was ""sympathetic to the argument to tax those profits fairly"". He said the tax would raise about Â£5bn this year and be scrapped when oil and gas prices - which have surged recently - return to normal levels. However, in seeking a ""sensible middle ground"" energy suppliers will be able to apply for tax relief of 90p for every pound they invest in UK oil and gas projects. Mr Sunak also said he believed there was a case for taxing electricity suppliers more, announcing a consultation on the idea. How will the Â£5bn windfall tax on energy firms work? What help will I get with my bills? Is the UK doing as much on bills as other countries? Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chancellor, said: ""After five months of being dragged kicking and screaming, the chancellor has finally come to his senses, U-turned, and adopted Labour's plan for a windfall tax on oil and gas producer profits to lower bills."" But business lobby group the CBI warned the windfall tax would be damaging to investment needed for Britain's ""energy security and net zero ambitions"". Oil giant BP said the new tax was ""a multi-year proposal"" rather than a ""one-off tax"". ""Naturally we will now need to look at the impact of both the new levy and the tax relief on our North Sea investment plans,"" it warned. Zoe, a single mum who lives on The Wirral with her four year old daughter, and who receives universal credit will get Â£400 off her energy bills and also the Â£650 one-off payment. She said she was ""over the moon that the government is finally making us feel like we're being listened to"". ""My big worry was going through the summer holidays with a young one and obviously not having the money to take them out too much,"" she told the BBC. ""With that payment coming through that has lifted a lot of stress and anxiety, because I was really panicked about this."" Debt charity Turn2Us called the support package ""a much-needed step in the right direction in making sure people on the lowest incomes are able to weather this financial crisis"". But Michael Clarke, its head of information programmes, added: ""For people who are in crisis currently, one-off payments will only act as a sticking plaster until longer term investment is made to boost their overall income."" Think tank the Resolution Foundation, which campaigns to end poverty, called the measures ""progressive"", adding that twice as much of the Â£15bn package would go to low-income households than high income ones. Chief executive Torsten Bell said: ""The decision to provide one-off payments this year to poorer households, pensioners and those with a disability is a good attempt to target those with higher energy bills - although the relative lack of support for larger families stands out.""

LIVE: Sunak unveils more cost of living help How would a windfall tax on energy firms work?

But Liberal Democrat Treasury spokeswoman Christine Jardine said the measures were ""too little, too late"". The plans received a mixed reaction from the Conservative backbenchers, with some calling it ""tripe"" and others saying it did not go far enough. The government faced accusations that it had timed the announcement to distract fromthe release of the Sue Gray reportinto lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street during the pandemic. But the claims were denied by No 10. This video can not be played Rachel Reeves says the Conservative windfall tax is a ""policy that dare not speak its name"". Households across the country have faced soaring costs in recent months as the prices of food, fuel and energy have all rocketed, with inflation hitting a 40-year high. The government has been under growing pressure to act, especially afterenergy regulator Ofgem warned of an additional rise to bills of Â£800 in the autumn. The Liberal Democrats first put forward the idea of a windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies - which have peaked as the economy restarted after the pandemic - in November, with Labour outlining its own version in January. The SNP has also called for such a measure. The parties said the money raised could go towards helping those households hardest hit by the cost of living increases. Initially, the idea was rejected by ministers, including Boris Johnson, who warned it could ""deter"" investment. But both Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak subsequently softened their stance, and now the policy U-turn has been confirmed. Making a statement in the Commons, the chancellor said the inflation faced by the UK was causing ""acute distress for the people of this country"" and he knew people were worried. But, Mr Sunak added: ""This government will never stop trying to help people, to fix problems where we can, to do what is right - as we did during the pandemic."" He confirmed the government would introduce a ""temporary targeted energy profits levy"" charged at a rate of 25% on profits of oil and gas companies to fund ""significant support for the British people"". However, he said his ""sensible middle ground"" plan included a new investment allowance, so ""for every pound a company invests they will get back 90% in tax relief - the more the company invests the less tax they will pay"". Mr Sunak said: ""We should not be ideological about this, we should be pragmatic. ""It is possible to both tax extraordinary profits fairly and incentivise investments."" The chancellor said the tax would then be removed when energy prices returned to normal levels. Shadow chancellor Ms Reeves said the government had been ""dragged kicking and screaming"" to its new policy position. She added: ""The chancellor has finally come to his senses, U-turned, and adopted Labour's plan for a windfall tax on oil and gas producer profits to lower bills."" But Ms Reeves claimed the government ""still have no long term plan to grow our economy and pull us out of the mess they've got us into"". What does this change of tack signal? The cabinet was split on whether to bring in a windfall tax Analysis by David Wallace Lockhart, BBC political correspondent Ministers have been facing calls to do more to help with the cost of living for quite some time. So why today? As recently as the weekend, Downing Street sources were indicating there would be no imminent announcement on windfall taxes. And it was only a couple of weekends ago Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng called it a ""bad idea"". So why the change of heart? Well, ministers have been clear for some time that more help is on the way. And they did get a clearer idea of future energy prices this week. But - to be more cynical - the government had a particularly uncomfortable day on Wednesday with the publication of the Sue Gray report into Downing Street gatherings. Boris Johnson has made it clear that he's desperate to stop talking about parties. An announcement of billions of pounds of assistance for households certainly helps to move the agenda on. Downing Street deny that the timing of this has anything to do with Partygate. But plenty of opposition MPs won't buy that argument. The package of measures announced by Mr Sunak was attacked by many of his opponents for not going far enough. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey criticised the government for failing to cut taxes for workers, pointing to the new health and social care levy introduced in April amid the cost of living crisis. He tweeted: ""Sunak's like a thief who steals your car and then wants you to be grateful when he returns the steering wheel."" The SNP's Kirsty Blackman said the government had ""listened to a certain extent"", but had ""failed"" on a number of measures, especially her party's call to uprate benefits in line with inflation. She told the BBC the one-off payment was ""kicking the can down the road"" and those hit hardest could face more difficulties in the future. When it came to Mr Sunak's own benches, Conservatives appeared split on both the policies and how to fund them. Richard Drax accused the chancellor of ""throwing red meat to the socialists by raising taxes on businesses"", adding a windfall tax was ""not the Conservative way"" of doing things. Another backbench Tory, Craig Mackinlay, said he was ""appalled that a Conservative chancellor could come up with this tripe"", calling the tax ""outrageous"" and ""inherently wrong"". Former party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, however, called the chancellor's statement ""a good start and welcome"", but added: ""More needs to be done. ""Our response to this economic crisis should have three goals at its centre: adequate financial support for the poorest, helping those who are able into work, and reducing the burden of taxation.""

"The typical household energy bill is set to rise by about Â£800 a year in October, the energy regulator warns. Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley said the energy price cap, which limits how much providers can raise prices, is expected to increase to Â£2,800 a year, due to continued volatility in gas prices. Mr Brearley said the price rises were a ""once in a generation event not seen since the oil crisis in the 1970s"". He added the number of households in fuel poverty may double to 12 million. A household is in fuel poverty when it has to spend 10% or more of its disposable income on energy. How high could my energy bills go? Energy firms warn against extending windfall tax Which countries are doing the most to tackle bills? The energy price cap already rose sharply in April to Â£1,971, meaning that homes using a typical amount of gas and electricity are now paying an extra Â£700 per year on average. Mr Brearley told the business select committee of MPs that Ofgem was only part way through reviewing prices ahead of setting the next cap in October, but added: ""We are expecting a price cap in the region of Â£2,800."" It means the typical household bill could rise by Â£800 per year. Ofgem's price cap covers England Wales and Scotland. Northern Ireland does not have a price cap, but households have also been witnessing sharp price rises. Mr Brearley said that conditions in the global gas market had ""worsened"" following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has led to concerns about potential supply issues. He warned that the price cap could rise beyond Â£2,800 if Russia - one of the world's largest exporters of natural gas - decided to disrupt supplies. ""We are really managing between two versions of events,"" he said. ""One where the price falls back down to where it was before, for example if there's peace in Ukraine, but one where prices could go even further if we were to see, for example, a disruptive interruption of gas from Russia."" Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia, so sudden supply cuts could have a huge economic impact. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it would be affected by prices rising on global markets as demand in Europe increased. ""The price changes we have seen in the gas market are genuinely a once-in-a-generation event not seen since the oil crisis of the 1970s,"" Mr Brearley told the Business select committee. But the Ofgem boss apologised for regulatory shortcomings and admitted had financial controls been in place sooner for suppliers, fewer firms would have gone bust due to being unprepared for the sharp rise in wholesale prices. We are all getting used to bill shocks when it comes to paying for gas and electricity - but this could be the biggest of all. Regulators do not usually give such early indications of the costs to come, which makes the seriousness of the situation all the more obvious. Some 23 million households have their domestic energy bill governed by the price cap. In April, they typically started paying Â£700 a year more. In October, according to Mr Brearley, it could be a further annual rise of Â£800. The trouble is, the old way of tackling this is as a billpayer was to shop around for a better tariff. That option is no longer available. Analysts say the average price of the cheapest 10 fixed tariffs on the market is Â£3,685 a year - clearly a poor financial choice. So that leaves people to budget and use savings as best they can, and leaves ministers under even greater pressure to offer more support, especially during the colder, darker, more expensive months ahead. Later on Tuesday, the Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told MPs people will have to ""wait and see what's forthcoming"" from the chancellor and the prime minister on further help on energy bills as he said economic growth was the ""time honoured way"" to help people. Mr Kwarteng said the government had put forward Â£9.1bn in support for energy bills, including council tax and energy bill rebates, and an extension of the Warm Home Discount. He added that the government had been waiting to see where gas prices were heading before making a decision on further assistance. ""What we see now isn't the full picture. Both the prime minister and the chancellor say there is more to do, and we have to see what is forthcoming"", Mr Kwarteng told the committee. The Labour committee chairman, Darren Jones, asked the business secretary if he thought ""bill payers are happy with that answer? Just wait and see?"". Mr Kwarteng acknowledged it was ""a difficult time"" and ""people are under huge stress"" but added that ""nobody is suggesting that the government can pay the entirety of the energy bill"". ""What we are committed to is giving support, and that's what we're doing,"" he said. Asked by Mr Jones what he thought about the prospect of a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas companies, Mr Kwarteng said he didn't think it supported investment. In response to Ofgem's price cap forecast, Downing Street acknowledged that energy prices were a ""significant challenge"", but said the government was ""actively looking at what more could be done in this space"". Meanwhile, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves questioned: ""How many more alarm bells does the chancellor need to hear before he acts? ""The government have got to get a grip on this crisis and to protect families and our economy."" Ms Reeves repeated her party's call for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms' profits to help lower bills for households. Recently, Shell reported a record Â£7bn profit in the first three months of this year while BP made Â£5bn, the highest for 10 years.

"The government is likely to come under pressure to help households with soaring energy bills again next year, the Institute of Fiscal Studies think tank has warned. The IFS said calls for help were likely to continue for ""at least"" another year if oil and gas prices do not fall. Energy bills are expected to keep rising until at least spring 2023. But the government insisted the support package announced by the chancellor on Thursday was a ""temporary"" measure. The Â£15bn package meansevery UK household will get an energy bill discount of Â£400 from October, with further support for the poorest households, pensioners and disabled people. The new measures add to around Â£17bn of support already given by the government. This included one-off Â£150 council tax rebates for most homes in England and Wales and matched funding for the other devolved nations. A steep rise in the cost of living, in particular a jump in energy prices in April, and a second one scheduled for October, had put growing pressure on the government to take action. The announcement, which came a day after the publication ofSue Gray's report into rule-breaking at Downing Street during the pandemic, was on a larger scale than many expected. The support was broadly welcomed and described as a ""genuinely big package"" by the IFS. However, the think tank warned that it could prompt calls for additional support again next year, which in turn could contribute to further inflation. ""I think the biggest risk is that the chancellor will be tempted to do this again and again, and I think if that happens then we really could be in for a bit of trouble,"" IFS director Paul Johnson told the BBC's Today programme. ""He's got the most extraordinarily difficult decisions to make later this year on public sector pay, and then he'll be under pressure I suspect again this time next year when energy prices will still be high. ""I think if he's tempted to continue putting money in to an economy where inflation is very high then that becomes a significant risk."" Adam Scorer, chief executive of fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, said the chancellor's measures averted ""the darkest of outcomes"" but warned ""millions will still be struggling and the energy crisis is far from over"". He said a ""large, more targeted intervention is what was needed ahead of winter"", and said the government needed to plan for energy prices to remain high for some time. The cost of living is set to continue to rise, with inflation - the rate at which prices go up - at a 40-year high and forecast to hit 10% later this year. Concerns have also been raised that the extra support for households could contribute to further inflation, by providing more spending power in the economy at a time when supply chains and the labour market are struggling to meet demand. However, Chancellor Rishi Sunak insisted that his new measures would have a""minimal impact"" on inflation. How plans to tackle cost of living will affect you Every household to get Â£400 energy bill discount Typical energy bill set to rise by Â£800 a year Higher energy prices, caused in part by the war in Ukraine, have been a key factor driving inflation and analysts expect energy costs to remain high. Cornwall Insight, has predicted the energy price cap, which limits how much providers can raise prices, will be marginally higher in spring 2023 to around Â£2,818 than the price cap this autumn at Â£2,791. The cost of the extra support for energy bills will be partly offset by a 25% additional tax on oil and gas firms' profits, which have soared in recent months. Opposition parties had been calling for a windfall tax on energy firms for several months. A windfall tax is a one-off levy imposed by a government on a company. The idea is to target firms that were lucky enough to benefit from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall. Mr Sunak said the ""energy profits levy"" had been designed so it would ""incentivise and encourage investment"". But Dan Atzori, research partner at Cornwall Insight, warned the tax came with ""risks to both investment and energy security"". If windfall taxes were repeated over time, Mr Atzori said, it risked ""creating an unstable environment, and may lead to energy producers, who operate globally, investing and relocating to other areas"". The government had previously rejected the idea of a windfall tax on energy firms' profit, but Mr Sunak said with the sector ""making extraordinary profits"" he was ""sympathetic to the argument to tax those profits fairly"". However, energy giant BP said while it knew ""how difficult things are for people"" Thursday's announcement was ""not for a one-off tax"" but a ""multi-year proposal"". ""Naturally we will now need to look at the impact of both the new levy and the tax relief on our North Sea investment plans,"" it said.

"This video can not be played BBC Political Editor Chris Mason asks the chancellor why he uses âenergy profits levy"" phrase - and not say windfall tax. Rishi Sunak says new measures to ease the cost of living crisis will have a ""minimal impact"" on inflation. The chancellor told the BBC he had struck the ""right balance"" between supporting people and pushing prices ""excessively"" higher. Earlier, Mr SunakannouncedÂ£15bn to reduce energy bills, partly funded by a windfall tax on oil and gas firms. He denied the announcement was rushed out to divert attention from areportinto rule-breaking parties in No 10. He said he had chosen to set out the measures this week because Ofgem, the energy regulator,had released their forecastof expected energy price rises. ""That meant we could scale and size our policies effectively,"" he said. How would a windfall tax on energy firms work? Sunak confirms U-turn on windfall tax Chris Mason: What was behind Sunak's mini Budget? The chancellor's decision to impose a 25% levy on oil and gas firms came after weeks of government ministers repeatedly rejecting the idea. The windfall tax plan - put forward by Labour, the Liberal Democrats and SNP - would see a one-off charge imposed on the companies' record profits. Mr Sunak avoided calling his measure a windfall tax, instead referring to it as a ""temporary, targeted energy profits levy"". ""These are windfall profits and they will be taxed,"" he said, but added that the levy would also include incentives to encourage businesses to invest. He noted that opposition parties had made similar proposals, but said: ""I think they were blunt instruments."" ""We have designed something that will continue to incentivise and encourage investment,"" he told BBC political editor Chris Mason. Households have come under pressure in recent months as food and energy costs have risen, with inflation hitting a 40-year high. Under Mr Sunak's new measures, every household will get an energy bill discount of Â£400. Eight million households on means-tested benefits will also get a payment of Â£650 paid into their account in two lump sums. In addition to a windfall tax, the extra support will be funded by around Â£10bn of extra borrowing. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously suggested providing more support could risk an ""inflationary spiral"" as giving people more money could lead to further price rises. But Mr Sunak said he had targeted support at the most vulnerable households in order to avoid ""fuelling inflation and making the situation worse"". ""That is something that I do watch and I worry about."" This video can not be played Rachel Reeves says the Conservative windfall tax is a ""policy that dare not speak its name"". Asked if he was worried about a recession Mr Sunak said he was concerned about inflationary pressures but confident about the future of the economy. Responding to his announcement in Parliament, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Mr Sunak had ""finally come to his senses"". But his method of partly funding support through a windfall tax was criticised by some Conservative backbenchers. Richard Drax accused the chancellor of ""throwing red meat to socialists"". And Craig Mackinlay described the tax as ""tripe"".

"The typical household energy bill is set to rise by about Â£800 a year in October, the energy regulator warns. Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley said the energy price cap, which limits how much providers can raise prices, is expected to increase to Â£2,800 a year, due to continued volatility in gas prices. Mr Brearley said the price rises were a ""once in a generation event not seen since the oil crisis in the 1970s"". He added the number of households in fuel poverty may double to 12 million. A household is in fuel poverty when it has to spend 10% or more of its disposable income on energy. How high could my energy bills go? Energy firms warn against extending windfall tax Which countries are doing the most to tackle bills? The energy price cap already rose sharply in April to Â£1,971, meaning that homes using a typical amount of gas and electricity are now paying an extra Â£700 per year on average. Mr Brearley told the business select committee of MPs that Ofgem was only part way through reviewing prices ahead of setting the next cap in October, but added: ""We are expecting a price cap in the region of Â£2,800."" It means the typical household bill could rise by Â£800 per year. Ofgem's price cap covers England Wales and Scotland. Northern Ireland does not have a price cap, but households have also been witnessing sharp price rises. Mr Brearley said that conditions in the global gas market had ""worsened"" following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has led to concerns about potential supply issues. He warned that the price cap could rise beyond Â£2,800 if Russia - one of the world's largest exporters of natural gas - decided to disrupt supplies. ""We are really managing between two versions of events,"" he said. ""One where the price falls back down to where it was before, for example if there's peace in Ukraine, but one where prices could go even further if we were to see, for example, a disruptive interruption of gas from Russia."" Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia, so sudden supply cuts could have a huge economic impact. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it would be affected by prices rising on global markets as demand in Europe increased. ""The price changes we have seen in the gas market are genuinely a once-in-a-generation event not seen since the oil crisis of the 1970s,"" Mr Brearley told the Business select committee. But the Ofgem boss apologised for regulatory shortcomings and admitted had financial controls been in place sooner for suppliers, fewer firms would have gone bust due to being unprepared for the sharp rise in wholesale prices. We are all getting used to bill shocks when it comes to paying for gas and electricity - but this could be the biggest of all. Regulators do not usually give such early indications of the costs to come, which makes the seriousness of the situation all the more obvious. Some 23 million households have their domestic energy bill governed by the price cap. In April, they typically started paying Â£700 a year more. In October, according to Mr Brearley, it could be a further annual rise of Â£800. The trouble is, the old way of tackling this is as a billpayer was to shop around for a better tariff. That option is no longer available. Analysts say the average price of the cheapest 10 fixed tariffs on the market is Â£3,685 a year - clearly a poor financial choice. So that leaves people to budget and use savings as best they can, and leaves ministers under even greater pressure to offer more support, especially during the colder, darker, more expensive months ahead. Later on Tuesday, the Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told MPs people will have to ""wait and see what's forthcoming"" from the chancellor and the prime minister on further help on energy bills as he said economic growth was the ""time honoured way"" to help people. Mr Kwarteng said the government had put forward Â£9.1bn in support for energy bills, including council tax and energy bill rebates, and an extension of the Warm Home Discount. He added that the government had been waiting to see where gas prices were heading before making a decision on further assistance. ""What we see now isn't the full picture. Both the prime minister and the chancellor say there is more to do, and we have to see what is forthcoming"", Mr Kwarteng told the committee. The Labour committee chairman, Darren Jones, asked the business secretary if he thought ""bill payers are happy with that answer? Just wait and see?"". Mr Kwarteng acknowledged it was ""a difficult time"" and ""people are under huge stress"" but added that ""nobody is suggesting that the government can pay the entirety of the energy bill"". ""What we are committed to is giving support, and that's what we're doing,"" he said. Asked by Mr Jones what he thought about the prospect of a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas companies, Mr Kwarteng said he didn't think it supported investment. In response to Ofgem's price cap forecast, Downing Street acknowledged that energy prices were a ""significant challenge"", but said the government was ""actively looking at what more could be done in this space"". Meanwhile, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves questioned: ""How many more alarm bells does the chancellor need to hear before he acts? ""The government have got to get a grip on this crisis and to protect families and our economy."" Ms Reeves repeated her party's call for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms' profits to help lower bills for households. Recently, Shell reported a record Â£7bn profit in the first three months of this year while BP made Â£5bn, the highest for 10 years.
