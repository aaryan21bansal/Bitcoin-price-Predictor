"This video can not be played The inquest was shown CCTV footage of Westminster attacker Khalid Masood's final preparations Westminster Bridge attacker Khalid Masood told his children he was ""going to die fighting for God"", an inquest into his victims' deaths has heard. But while visiting his mother days before the attack, he told her: ""They will say I'm a terrorist. I'm not."" CCTV footage of his final movements before the attack were also shown. Masood, 52, was shot dead after driving into pedestrians on the bridge and fatally stabbing a police officer. Five people died in the March 2017 attack. The inquest into the deaths of PC Keith Palmer, 48, Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Andreea Cristea, 31, is taking place at the Old Bailey in central London. Victims of the Westminster terror attack Who was attacker Khalid Masood? During video calls to his younger children, who were living in east London while he stayed in Birmingham, Masood spoke about dreams he had had and told them he was ""going to die fighting for God"", Det Ch Insp Dan Brown told the inquest. Masood drove from Birmingham to Wales to visit his mother, Janet Ajao, and stepfather on 16 March, after picking up the vehicle he would use to carry out the attack. As he was leaving the house the following day, Mr Brown said he ""turned over his shoulder"" and insisted he was not a terrorist. Investigators now believe this was ""a goodbye visit"". The inquest was shown CCTV footage of Masood's final preparations ahead of the attack on 22 March. On 9 March he bought two knives, which he would use to stab PC Palmer, at a Tesco store in Birmingham. A week later he rented a car in Birmingham, before driving to Wales to visit his mother and stepfather. On 18 March he drove to central London, crossing Westminster Bridge, in what investigators believe was a reconnaissance trip The night before the attack he visited a fish and chip shop in Brighton and stayed the night in the city. On the morning of the attack he carried out internet searches for Prime Minister's Questions, which was taking place later that day, and car bombs. Masood's final movements before the attack were also shown: At 10:30 he drove across Westminster Bridge, in a second recce At 13:59 Masood parked at St Thomas' hospital and remained there until 14.31 At 14:26 and 14.29 he sent a ""jihad document"" to several people in his phone contacts, some of whom he did not know very well. It featured quotes apparently trying to justify the attack and a picture of him while on pilgrimage in Mecca At 14:38 the vehicle is seen parked in a bus lane before the attack Earlier the inquest heard how Masood had a history of violent crime and converted to Islam while in prison. Masood's mother had described him as ""an angry person"" and was ""worried he would kill someone through fighting"", Mr Brown said. She told police that as an older teenager he would go out to pubs and clubs looking for a fight. Mr Brown said: ""His mother suggested he exhibited normal boisterous behaviour, but his two brothers suggested he was a violent, disruptive person, who would not back down from a disagreement."" Masood first got into trouble with the police after shoplifting at the age of 14 in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, where he lived with his mother, stepfather and two stepbrothers. He was involved in a number of violent incidents which became more serious as he got older. In May 2003, he stabbed a man through the nose with a carving knife after accusing him of being an undercover police officer. Masood claimed self defence and was acquitted of attempted murder, wounding with intent, and having a bladed weapon. In December 2003, he was released from Lewes prison in East Sussex, where he had been held on remand, based on time served from a previous weapons offence. Clockwise from top left - PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade, Leslie Rhodes, Andreea Cristea and Kurt Cochran all lost their lives in the attack The inquest heard how Masood considered his acquittal, as well as the survival of his eldest daughter - who was later involved in a serious car accident - as the ""miracles"" which cemented his Muslim faith. Kurt Cochran, Leslie Rhodes, Aysha Frade, and Andreea Cristea were all hit by Masood's car during the attack on Westminster Bridge on 22 March last year. Moments later, PC Palmer was stabbed to death by Masood outside the Houses of Parliament. The inquest is set to last about five weeks. A separate inquest into the death of Masood will be held after the hearing into his victims' deaths has concluded. The coroner is expected to examine Masood's background, police records, and look into the fact that he briefly featured in MI5 investigations in 2009 and 2010. The absence of armed officers at the scene will also be examined. Westminster security 'failed' stabbed PC Westminster attack '82 seconds of terrible drama' Masood: From schoolboy to killer.

"This video can not be played Jack Burn died hours after being born at Princess Royal Hospital in Telford A review into mother and baby deaths and injuries at hospitals in Shropshire is examining more than 100 cases, it is understood. In 2017, Jeremy Hunt ordered aninvestigation into maternity care relating to 23 casesat the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust (SaTH). That figure expanded to 40 but is now thought to include 104 families. Meanwhile, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) has taken urgent action against the maternity department. One mother whose daughter died at the trust said ""it is time to get justice"". The trust said it ""continues to engage fully"" with health watchdog the CQC ""during our current, ongoing inspection"". Latest news and updates from Midlands Live Tasha Turner and partner Jacob's baby Esmai died in 2013 at Royal Shrewsbury Hospital A specialist team led by Donna Ockenden is looking into the allegations that some babies born at the trust between 2000 and 2017 suffered avoidable harm due to errors by maternity staff. In August a spokesperson for NHS Improvement said it had agreed ""to consider additional historical investigations where women, infants and new-born babies had died or suffered harm"". At the time the trust said these were cases which were already in the public domain, but the BBC understands at least 104 families have now come forward wanting their cases to be considered. Dr Kathy McLean, Executive Medical Director and Chief Operating Officer of NHS Improvement, said: ""At this stage, we are unable to confirm how many historical cases will be considered under our independent review. ""We are examining in detail anything that may be relevant, ensuring that possible duplication is taken into account. ""Also, it is important that in any historical investigations that we consider, appropriate consent from the family members is obtained in advance."" Mother and baby deaths review widened Further review into maternity care Cluster of baby deaths probe ordered Professor Ted Baker, CQC's Chief Inspector of Hospitals, confirmed it is taking further enforcement action against SaTH. It followsan inspection last month, which highlighted safety fears""within the trust's maternity services"", Prof Baker said. ""This action is subject to a period of appeal and we will provide further information when the legal process allows."" A spokesman for SaTH said: ""In line with normal CQC processes, we will be making representations to them in respect of this matter within the permitted 28 day timeframe."" In 2013 Tasha Turner's first child Esmai was born by Caesarean section at 36 weeks at Royal Shrewsbury Hospital. Ms Turner, 25, said she was assured there was no cause for concern and her daughter was soon drinking her breast milk with the aid of a tube. But when she went to check on Esmai the following morning, she was on life support. Ms Turner said she was told Esmai had lactic acidosis, a build up of lactic acid in her body, and after four days Ms Turner and partner Jacob were advised to remove life support. The couple said when they asked what led to their daughter's death they were told by the hospital ""it happens"". Baby Esmai spent four days on life support The couple have since had two more children but said they are determined to know what happened to Esmai. ""I have so many questions,"" said Tasha. ""How was I told when she was born that she was fine, and then she dies four days later? I've looked up the condition she had - no way should it kill someone."" Deirdre Fowler, Director of Nursing, Midwifery and Quality at SaTH said: ""We recognise that, taken in isolation, the number of cases which are being considered may cause concern or anxiety for families currently using our services. ""It is important that any families who have any questions or concerns over their care are given the chance to have them explored.""

"This video can not be played Transport secretary Chris Grayling: Passengers were let down ""No-one took charge"" during the timetable chaos that caused severe disruption on Britain's railways in May, a regulator has said. The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) blamed a lack of ""responsibility and accountability"" and said passengers were ""badly treated"". It said track manager Network Rail, two train operators and the Department for Transport ""had all made mistakes"". It came as the government promised a major review of Britain's railways. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling - who had previously insisted: ""I don't run the railways"" - told the BBC's Today programme that the problem was system-wide and that it was his job to ""make sure it doesn't happen again"". He said he had taken at ""face value"" assurances by industry-leaders that they were ready to make the changes. The unhappy face of rail travellers From 20 May, passengers suffered delays and cancellations after the rail industry attempted to introduce the biggest timetable change in a generation. The upgrade - which involved changes to 46% of train times - mainly affected Northern Trains in the north west of England and Govia Thameslink (GTR) routes into London. The ORR assessed the causes, consequences and management of the disruption Over a period of several weeks, GTR and Northern cancelled up to 470 and 310 scheduled trains respectively each weekday. ORR chairman Prof Stephen Glaister said: ""Good intentions and over-optimism within the rail industry about its ability to recover missed deadlines left no time to uncover and fix problems. Rail timetable chaos inquiry launched Northern axe trains in timetable reshuffle ""When problems arose, timetable planners were stretched and train operators were ill-equipped to help passengers."" Prof Glaister told the BBC ""it was unclear"" who should have the responsibility for tackling the problems. But, following a three-month inquiry, the ORR found the causes of the botched rollout dated back years. These included delays with Network Rail's electrification work in northern England, as well as late changes to the Thameslink programme. This pushed back the development of the timetable and gave train operators less time to prepare for the introduction of new services. Rail users expressed their frustrations at Manchester Piccadilly during the disruption The ORR also said that: Network Rail was best placed to manage these risks but did not take sufficient action Neither GTR or Northern were prepared for the disruption that arose, nor did they do enough to provide accurate information to passengers Both the Department for Transport (DfT) and the ORR itself failed in their duties to oversee the industry Prof Glaister told the BBC that the ORR itself had failings - like everyone else in the industry. ""We took on trust what we were told,"" he said. ""What happened here is that railway people have a tradition of sorting out problems as they occur. ""That led to complacency when in the process of planning the timetables - deadlines were missed, late decisions were made so that operators didn't have time to deliver a proper service on the day."" Tom Burridge, Transport correspondent This report underlines an inherent weakness in our rail system; No single entity or person is in overall control. The mayhem resulting from a complicated shake-up of timetables on Northern and Govia Thameslink was the product of systemic failings over several months. But as the problems built up on both Network Rail and Govia Thameslink in the run-up to the launch of the new schedules, it seems that no-one properly flagged up the risks and the potential that it all might go badly wrong. Officials from Network Rail, the Department for Transport (DfT) and the train companiesweremeeting. Industry sources say DfT officials were briefed that things weren't going to plan. The Transport Secretary Chris Grayling says he received the necessary assurances from the train companies. So the infamous and well-known British train blame game rolls on. Andrew Haines, the boss of Network Rail, offered his ""sincerest apologies to passengers for letting them down with May's timetable troubles"". ""A whole system approach to timetable planning must be the way ahead and we have already started on that path with the new winter timetable due in December that will see some modest improvements."" The DfT said it welcomed the ORR's findings and called May's disruption ""unacceptable"". The resignation of Charles Horton, chief executive of GTR,was announced in June. Mr Grayling, when asked if other resignations were needed, said the report found Northern Rail's problems were linked to local infrastructure problems. Northern Rail said the report found ""that the root cause of the timetable disruption was delays to engineering projects to improve the railway"". It said train operators were usually given 40 weeks to plan the twice-yearly introduction but had to rewrite its May 2018 timetable in 16 weeks. The company added it was ""deeply sorry"" for the disruption, saying it had reinstated 151 of the 165 services hit by the problems. Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group which represents train companies and Network Rail, said the rail industry was determined to learn from the issues to avoid a repeat. He added: ""The structural issues highlighted in this report underline the need for the wide-ranging, root and branch rail review we have been calling for to deliver meaningful reform."" The government has also launched what it called the most significant review of the rail industry since privatisation, headed by former British Airways boss Keith Williams. It comes amid significant challenges, with punctuality at a 12-year low and commuters facing an increase of up to 3.2% in the cost of season tickets from January. The DfT said the review would consider all parts of the sector, including accountability, the franchising system and value for money for passengers and taxpayers. Mr Grayling told the BBC: ""The fragmentation of the industry today doesn't work"". ""What I am absolutely certain of is we need an integrated railway"". He pointed to Japan where the rail companies were integrated and  London where contracts were performance-related. Labour wantsto nationalise the industrybut Mr Grayling told the BBC: ""It's not about ownership... it's about the pressure on the system.""

"Officials say rivers in South Carolina could reach their highest levels by the end of this week or early next Two mental health patients have died when the police van they were being transported in got caught in floodwaters in the US, police say. The two officers escorting the pair were eventually rescued. The patients' deaths bring the death toll from Storm Florence to 37. Thousands of homes and roadways in the region remain underwater less than a week after the storm made landfall. President Donald Trump arrived in North Carolina on Wednesday to survey damage. Mr Trump praised the response to the ""devastating"" storm by federal and local disaster officials at a news conference in North Carolina on Wednesday morning. ""Unfortunately, the money will be a lot, but it's going to come as fast as you need it,"" Mr Trump said. ""We're going to take care of everybody."" Mr Trump will be heading to South Carolina next. The storm's latest victims in South Carolina were identified as Wendy Wenton, 45, and Nicolette Green, 43, by the Marion County Coroner, US media report. The Horry County Sheriff's Department said in a statement that when the waters overtook the van, they rose too quickly for the pair to be saved. Pig waste pools overflow after Florence A community cut off after 'terrifying' storm The numbers behind impact of Florence A high water team eventually rescued the two deputies who were escorting them.

""At this time, the recovery effort is ongoing, and the transportation vehicle cannot be removed due to rising waters and dangerous conditions."" Florence has caused major flooding across the Carolinas The detainees were women being transported from Waccamaw Mental Health and Loris Hospital to a behavioural health hospital in Darlington, South Carolina, according to the Associated Press. ""Tonight's incident is a tragedy,"" Sheriff Phillip Thompson told the Greenville News. ""Just like you, we have questions we want answered. We are fully co-operating with the State Law Enforcement Division to support their investigation of this event."" The tragic incident occurred near the Little Pee Dee River, which continues to rise as water from upriver North Carolina makes its way into South Carolina's waterways. The Little Pee Dee has crested in some regions at over 46ft (14m) and its flooding has impacted town water supplies, officials say. Florence has claimed eight lives in South Carolina thus far, and flooding is expected to worsen later this week and into next. Thousands of homes are still underwater in the Carolinas and thousands of families have had to be rescued from the floods. As of Wednesday, more than 3,000 people had been rescued in North Carolina and 20,000 federal and military personnel are supporting state efforts. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper called Florence ""a storm like no other"" during a news conference with Mr Trump and federal officials on Wednesday. ""We are a beacon in the South and we have weathered storms before in our state. But Mr President, we have never seen one like this. This one has been epic. It has been disastrous. It has been widespread."" Brock Long, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), said the government is pushing disaster survivor assistance teams into the Carolinas. ""A disaster response like this takes all of us working together, not just the federal government,"" he said. ""This event's not over. The rivers are still cresting we still have a lot of work to do."" The president has promised to completely support the Carolinas' recovery efforts. ""We will be there 100%,"" he said.

"Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the judiciary committee, has set a Friday deadline for Christine Blasey Ford The Senate has given a woman who accuses Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault until Friday to decide if she will testify. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley sent a letter setting the 21 September deadline to Christine Blasey Ford's lawyers. Judge Kavanaugh, 53, has firmly denied the allegation. He has been meeting with White House officials this week. Prof Ford declined to testify unless the FBI begins investigating the judge. Her lawyers have said the California psychology lecturer is receiving death threats and has had to move home since alleging the nominee tried to rape her 36 years ago. Judge Kavanaugh, 53, has labelled the claim ""completely false"". The Senate Judiciary Committee has called on both Judge Kavanaugh and Prof Ford to testify - either publicly or in a closed-door session - next Monday. This video can not be played Senator Mazie Hirono urged ""the men in this country"" to ""do the right thing for a change"" Prof Ford's legal team has declined the Senate's offer to testify. Her lawyer Lisa Banks said that before her client goes to Congress, she wants an FBI investigation into Judge Kavanaugh. In a statement on Wednesday Ms Banks said that the Committee's plan to move forward with a hearing that has only two witnesses is ""not a fair or good faith investigation"". ""There are multiple witnesses whose names have appeared publicly and should be included in any proceeding,"" the statement reads. ""The rush to a hearing is unnecessary, and contrary to the Committee discovering the truth,"" it adds. In his letter to Prof Ford's legal team, Mr Grassley said ""it is not the FBI's role to investigate a matter such as this"". The truth about false assault accusations Kavanaugh accuser 'faces death threats' Could Kavanaugh confirmation be derailed? ""I have reopened the hearing because I believe that anyone who comes forward with allegations of sexual assault has a right to be heard, and because it is the Committee's responsibility to fully evaluate the fitness of a nominee to the Supreme Court,"" the Iowa Republican wrote. The Senate, the committee chairman notes, ""and only the Senate"", is tasked with vetting a president's Supreme Court nominee. ""The FBI does not make a credibility assessment of any information it receives with respect to a nominee. ""Nor is it tasked with investigating a matter simply because the Committee deems it important."" Prof Ford says Brett Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed and tried to take off her clothes Back in 1991, however, the FBI did investigate sexual harassment claims against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. The White House under President George H W Bush ordered that inquiry. It took three days, CNN notes, and the claims by Anita Hill were dismissed as unfounded. Judge Thomas was narrowly confirmed and he remains a Supreme Court justice. Mr Grassley's letter states that Prof Ford has until Friday morning to provide the committee with her prepared testimony and biography if she plans to testify next Monday. He said he was ""disturbed"" to hear that she had been facing threats and harassment, but urged her to speak before the committee. ""You have stated repeatedly that Dr Ford wants to tell her story. I sincerely hope that Dr Ford will accept my invitation to do so, either privately or publicly, on Monday."" Judge Kavanaugh has been meeting with officials at the White House this week Prof Ford has accused him of drunkenly trying to remove her clothing at a house party in a Washington DC suburb in 1982 when they were both teenagers. She says he pinned her to a bed and clamped his hand over her mouth when she tried to scream. Anita Hill - whose allegation against Clarence Thomas has drawn endless parallels with the Ford-Kavanaugh controversy - says the accuser must not be hurried. ""Do not rush these hearings,"" she wrote in an opinion piece for theNew York Times,external. ""Doing so would not only signal that sexual assault accusations are not important."" On Wednesday, President Donald Trump continued to support his nominee, telling reporters outside the White House: ""He is such an outstanding man, [it is] very hard for me to imagine anything happened."" ""I want to see what she [Prof Ford] has to say but I want to give it all the time they need,"" the Republican president said. ""If she shows up that would be wonderful."" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham tweeted on Wednesday that it was ""imperative"" to move forward on the Kavanaugh vote. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"A key part of the Brexit negotiations has been the border that separates Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The border is a matter of great political, security and diplomatic sensitivity in Ireland. Therefore the UK and EU agreed that whatever happens as a result of Brexit there should be no new physical checks or infrastructure at the frontier. This is where the controversial ""backstop"" comes in. At present, goods and services are traded between the two jurisdictions with few restrictions. That is because the UK and Ireland are part of the EU's single market and customs union, so products do not need to be inspected for customs or standards. But after Brexit, all that could change - the two parts of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which could mean products being checked at the border. The preference of both sides is to prevent this happening through a deep and comprehensive trade deal. However, the UK's ambition to leave the customs union and the single market, could make that very difficult. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. And if both sides couldn't reach agreement on a deal keeping the border as open as it is now - that's where the backstop would come in. So how might it it work? There are several options: This is what the EU originally proposed. It would involve Northern Ireland alone remaining in the EU's single market and customs union, leaving Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) free to strike trade deals. But the DUP - a Northern Ireland unionist party that propped up Theresa May's minority Conservative government - objected to this. It said it would see Northern Ireland treated differently and could threaten the union. Boris Johnson has alsospecifically ruled this out. After the DUP's objections, Mrs May agreed a backstop involving the whole of the UK retaining a very close relationship with the EU - staying in the customs union - for an indefinite period. It would also see Northern Ireland staying even more closely tied to some rules of the EU single market. These arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agree they are no longer necessary. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) The backstop would not apply if the UK left the EU without a deal but the potential problems with the border would remain. The backstop plan was agreed by UK-EU negotiators and formed part of Theresa May's withdrawal agreement in November 2018 (often referred to as the Brexit ""divorce deal""). It sparked a backlash from many Conservative MPs (and the DUP) at Westminster and several of her own ministers resigned in protest. Please upgrade your browser They feared that the backstop would be used to permanently trap the UK in the EU customs union, preventing the country from striking its own trade deals. Ultimately, her deal was voted down three times, leading to her resignation. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is committed to ""getting rid"" of the backstop, describing it as ""anti-democratic"". His government has instead proposed the idea of a ""single regulatory zone"" on the island of Ireland. That would mean Northern Ireland continuing to follow EU rules on animal health, food safety and manufactured goods. It would effectively mean a new regulatory border in the Irish Sea with checks and controls at ports. The DUP say they can accept this as long as there is a role for the Northern Ireland Assembly to give ongoing consent to these arrangements. On customs, the UK has said Northern Ireland must leave the EU customs union. However the Prime Minister believes checks at the Irish frontier can be avoided by instead having customs processes mainly at company premises. The EU is sceptical about this and the latest negotiations have focused largely on customs. Many Brexit supporters say what are known as ""alternative arrangements"" could be used to avoid checks at the border. The phrase is normally used to refer to technical or technological solutions. These include things like trusted traders schemes and using GPS to track lorries. The EU has committed to working on alternative arrangements but has said no systems which could solve the border problem are currently ""operational"".

"""No, no, no!"" That is the response that you get when you ask EU players whether they can abandon the principles that are determining their stance on Brexit. The response you get when you ask UK insiders whether they can move on their core beliefs about Ireland. ""No, no, no!"". And guess what, for more than two years now people involved in the Brexit process have been saying, ah, until we can find a way through on the question of Ireland well, we can't be sure of anything. Sure, there is a huge amount of chatter about how some nips and tucks to the rival proposals might change things, to soften the hard edges of the arguments. May seeks backing for 'serious' Brexit plan Will EU's Salzburg summit mark a Brexit turning point? The UK might accept a border for rules and regulations in time, but there is no chance that as things stand, they will go anywhere near touching a different customs system for Northern Ireland. The EU might come up with cunning plan after cunning plan, asking for only one kind of check, or a system rather like the one that operates between Spain and the Canary Islands. Every single comment made by Michel Barnier is examined in microscopic detail to see what compromise it might reveal. Here's the thing. The disagreements aren't over the detail, it's not the practicalities that are really the problem but the principles. Officials involved privately admit there is little chance that the solution is going to be found in any of the technical solutions, there is going to have to be a big political move on one side, or moves on both sides to be able to get to a deal. And despite protestations from Brexiteers about how Ireland has come to dominate the talks, it has become whether they like it or not, the real life expression of Brexit's bigger conundrums. The talks were always going to be complicated. But summit after summit, the biggest obstacle remains what happens there after we leave the EU. Because after Brexit the border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the island becomes the line between the huge European trading club and a country that's on the outside. No one wants there to be anything that really changes or disrupts life  on either side. But Brexit is such a major change that everything simply can't remain the same. The two sides in the negotiations seem stuck in a deep clash over how to handle the change. Because the EU has more power in the negotiations it's often assumed that the UK will end up having to ditch its resistance. And with some soft soaping from Brussels around the language of their proposals Theresa May will just about be able to swallow more compromises. But ahead of the Tory conference, rather than showing any flexibility the UK is sticking with its position. The PM appealed to the other EU leaders on Wednesday, imploring them to understand that she can't accept what's on the table right now. But with a rough date set for deal day, the position might have to evolve. And Wednesday's digging in might make any eventual climbdown more painful still, yet the prime minister may not find herself with that much choice. After all, the answer she can't accept for the whole deal in the end, is, ""no, no, no!""

"This video can not be played Theresa May on what can be achieved at Salzburg summit Theresa May has said the EU must ""evolve"" its stance on the Irish border as she seeks to persuade fellow leaders about the viability of her Brexit plan. The PM is using a dinner in Salzburg to make the case for her controversial Chequers strategy for future relations. Before the event, she said it was the only credible plan to allay concerns on the Irish border and trade disruption. Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who is hosting the event, said both sides needed to make compromises. 'Multiple chances' for new Brexit vote It's my Brexit deal or no deal, May says Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop The UK and EU both want to avoid a hard border - meaning any physical infrastructure like cameras or guard posts - between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland but can't agree on how. Mrs May has previously rejected the EU's ""backstop"" plan - which involves keeping Northern Ireland aligned with its trading rules - saying it would divide up the UK. Ahead of the Salzburg summit, the EU's negotiator Michel Barnier said most checks could take place away from border areas, an apparent concession to the UK. Addressing reporters as she arrived for dinner in the Austrian city, Mrs May welcomed what she said was the EU's recognition its initial proposal were ""unacceptable"". ""If we're going to achieve a successful conclusion then, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to evolve its position too,"" she said. This video can not be played BBC News NI's political reporter Jayne McCormack explains why the border is an issue After Brexit, the 310 mile border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will become the UK's border with the EU. At the moment, thousands of people cross it every day for both work and pleasure - as do goods, like food and medicines, being delivered across the two countries. As part of the EU single market and customs union, these products do not need to be checked for customs and standards, but when the UK leaves these two arrangements, this all changes. Nobody wants a hard border for the checks - in fact the 1998 Good Friday agreement, which helped bring peace to Northern Ireland, got rid of security checks as part of the deal, and police in Northern Ireland have warned reinstating them could make crossings targets for violence. But there is no agreement between the UK and EU, or between Leavers and Remainers, about the answer. The border between the two countries has hundreds of crossing points Privately, EU officials say those checks could be carried out by British or EU officials, or by health inspectors rather than customs officials, to ""de-dramatise"" the border issue. Mrs May has insisted there needs to be ""friction-free movement of goods"", with no customs or regulatory checks, between Northern Ireland and the Republic, in order to avoid a hard border there. There are just over six months to go before the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. Negotiations are at a critical stage, with both sides hoping for an agreement on the terms of the UK's withdrawal and future trade relations by the start of November at the latest. Please upgrade your browser Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Barnier said the talks were in the ""home straight"" but there were still significant areas of disagreement - such as on the role of the European Court of Justice in enforcing the withdrawal agreement and intellectual property issues, including geographical protections for food and drink. ""October is the key point in time - it is the moment of truth,"" he added. The EU is still insisting on its own ""legally operationally backstop"" - what it describes as an insurance policy to prevent the return of physical infrastructure on the border in the event no other solution can be found. Will summit mark a Brexit turning point? Brexit: All you need to know At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Brussels put forward a proposal in February that would see Northern Ireland stay aligned with the EU in key areas, effectively staying in the customs union and single market and not needing those border checks. But the UK insisted this was unacceptable as it would split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK. On Tuesday Mr Barnier said the backstop should focus on a ""set of technical checks and controls"" to make sure standards are met and customs are paid, and not be about a sea or land border.

""We are ready to improve this proposal,"" he said. ""Work on the EU side is ongoing. We are clarifying which goods arriving in Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK would need to be checked and where, when and by whom these checks could be performed. ""We can also clarify that most checks can take place away from the border at a company premises or at the markets."" BBC Northern Ireland business editor John Campbell said that the fact the EU was prepared to ""improve"" the language of the backstop was not news as it hadbeen talked about before,external- so ""we need to wait and see what any improvements might amount to"". Speaking in Salzburg, Mr Tusk confirmed a special EU summit dedicated to Brexit would take place in mid-November. He welcomed some elements of the Chequers proposals - on security and policing - but said that on the Irish border and economic cooperation they will need to be ""reworked and further negotiated"". It has been reported Mrs May will have ten minutes to update her 27 counterparts At the dinner in Salzburg, Mrs May is expected to appeal for ""goodwill and determination"" from the EU, while stressing that ""no other country"" could accept the EU's backstop plan if they were in the same situation. The UK put forward rival backstop proposals in June, which would see the whole of the UK staying in a customs union with the EU after the end of the proposed Brexit transition period in December 2020. It also says its Chequers blueprint for a future trading relationship - involving a ""common rulebook"" for goods and treating the UK and the EU as a ""combined customs territory"" - would solve the border question. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the EU had to move closer to the UK's position or it would be a ""lose-lose"" for both sides. ""Chequers may not be perfect, but it's the most credible plan,"" he told LBC Radio. ""I think there is an understanding that we're approaching the endpoint of these negotiations, and there will need to be some movement on the EU side."" In an interview with theDaily Express,external, Mrs May said that going back on the 2016 vote to leave the EU would ""destroy trust in politicians"". MPs had decided to give people a vote on EU membership by a large margin, she said: ""People weren't saying it's the choice of the public except if we disagree with the answer we'll ask them again."" The People's Vote campaign wants the final terms of Brexit to be put to a referendum with the option of staying in the EU if it is rejected. ""My answer to the People's Vote is that we've had the people's vote - it was the referendum - and now we should deliver on it,"" the prime minister said. On Tuesday People's Vote set out ways they said a new referendum could be achieved through votes in Parliament.

"This video can not be played The inquest was shown CCTV footage of Westminster attacker Khalid Masood's final preparations Westminster Bridge attacker Khalid Masood told his children he was ""going to die fighting for God"", an inquest into his victims' deaths has heard. But while visiting his mother days before the attack, he told her: ""They will say I'm a terrorist. I'm not."" CCTV footage of his final movements before the attack were also shown. Masood, 52, was shot dead after driving into pedestrians on the bridge and fatally stabbing a police officer. Five people died in the March 2017 attack. The inquest into the deaths of PC Keith Palmer, 48, Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Andreea Cristea, 31, is taking place at the Old Bailey in central London. Victims of the Westminster terror attack Who was attacker Khalid Masood? During video calls to his younger children, who were living in east London while he stayed in Birmingham, Masood spoke about dreams he had had and told them he was ""going to die fighting for God"", Det Ch Insp Dan Brown told the inquest. Masood drove from Birmingham to Wales to visit his mother, Janet Ajao, and stepfather on 16 March, after picking up the vehicle he would use to carry out the attack. As he was leaving the house the following day, Mr Brown said he ""turned over his shoulder"" and insisted he was not a terrorist. Investigators now believe this was ""a goodbye visit"". The inquest was shown CCTV footage of Masood's final preparations ahead of the attack on 22 March. On 9 March he bought two knives, which he would use to stab PC Palmer, at a Tesco store in Birmingham. A week later he rented a car in Birmingham, before driving to Wales to visit his mother and stepfather. On 18 March he drove to central London, crossing Westminster Bridge, in what investigators believe was a reconnaissance trip The night before the attack he visited a fish and chip shop in Brighton and stayed the night in the city. On the morning of the attack he carried out internet searches for Prime Minister's Questions, which was taking place later that day, and car bombs. Masood's final movements before the attack were also shown: At 10:30 he drove across Westminster Bridge, in a second recce At 13:59 Masood parked at St Thomas' hospital and remained there until 14.31 At 14:26 and 14.29 he sent a ""jihad document"" to several people in his phone contacts, some of whom he did not know very well. It featured quotes apparently trying to justify the attack and a picture of him while on pilgrimage in Mecca At 14:38 the vehicle is seen parked in a bus lane before the attack Earlier the inquest heard how Masood had a history of violent crime and converted to Islam while in prison. Masood's mother had described him as ""an angry person"" and was ""worried he would kill someone through fighting"", Mr Brown said. She told police that as an older teenager he would go out to pubs and clubs looking for a fight. Mr Brown said: ""His mother suggested he exhibited normal boisterous behaviour, but his two brothers suggested he was a violent, disruptive person, who would not back down from a disagreement."" Masood first got into trouble with the police after shoplifting at the age of 14 in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, where he lived with his mother, stepfather and two stepbrothers. He was involved in a number of violent incidents which became more serious as he got older. In May 2003, he stabbed a man through the nose with a carving knife after accusing him of being an undercover police officer. Masood claimed self defence and was acquitted of attempted murder, wounding with intent, and having a bladed weapon. In December 2003, he was released from Lewes prison in East Sussex, where he had been held on remand, based on time served from a previous weapons offence. Clockwise from top left - PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade, Leslie Rhodes, Andreea Cristea and Kurt Cochran all lost their lives in the attack The inquest heard how Masood considered his acquittal, as well as the survival of his eldest daughter - who was later involved in a serious car accident - as the ""miracles"" which cemented his Muslim faith. Kurt Cochran, Leslie Rhodes, Aysha Frade, and Andreea Cristea were all hit by Masood's car during the attack on Westminster Bridge on 22 March last year. Moments later, PC Palmer was stabbed to death by Masood outside the Houses of Parliament. The inquest is set to last about five weeks. A separate inquest into the death of Masood will be held after the hearing into his victims' deaths has concluded. The coroner is expected to examine Masood's background, police records, and look into the fact that he briefly featured in MI5 investigations in 2009 and 2010. The absence of armed officers at the scene will also be examined. Westminster security 'failed' stabbed PC Westminster attack '82 seconds of terrible drama' Masood: From schoolboy to killer.

"Mueller-Korenek cycled at the take-off speed of a large jet For most people, the idea of travelling along the ground at more than 180mph in anything other than a plane preparing for take-off is nausea-inducing. Denise Mueller-Korenek, it is fair to say, is not most people. The US woman reached an eye-watering average speed of 183.932 mph (296.010 km/h) - on a bicycle. The remarkable speed means the 45-year-old not only smashed her own world record, but the long-standing men's one as well. Her reaction? Somewhat understated. ""It was a crazy wild ride to 183.9 mph, but so worth the sacrifice and years of focus on becoming the fastest human on a bicycle in the world,"" Mueller-Korenek said. ""We weren't supposed to go more than 175."" Mueller-Korenek's record-breaking feat saw her ride her custom-made bike across the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah on 16 September. She had set the women's record - 147 mph - in 2016, and apparently had her eye on the 167mph record set by Dutchman Fred Rompelberg back in 1995. And, as she followed a racing car driver in a dragster across the flats, Mueller-Korenek made toppling the record look easy. She released a video of the feat on her YouTube channel.

In order to reach her record-breaking speed, the former US national track, road and mountain bike champion was pulled along by tow rope at 100 mph, before being released to pedal herself. From that point she was riding in the slipstream of the dragster for 3.5 miles, achieving the record average of 183.9 mph over the last mile. To put that in context, that's about the same speed a Boeing 747 is travelling just before it leaves the runway during take-off. As a result of her feat, there are calls for Guinness World Records to stop listing separate men's and women's records for the event.

"Mylee Billingham was found with fatal stab wounds at her father's home An eight-year-old girl called for her mother and shouted ""no daddy"" as she was dragged into a house by her father who murdered her moments later, a court heard. Mylee Billingham suffered a fatal knife wound to her chest at her father's home near Walsall on 20 January. William Billingham, 55, stabbed her as her mother dialled 999 from outside, Birmingham Crown Court heard. Mr Billingham, of Valley View, Brownhills, denies murder. Outlining events after the stabbing, prosecutor Karim Khalil QC told the court the defendant, a father of six, spoke only about his own welfare as police tried to revive his daughter. Mr Billingham also denies making a threat to kill Mylee's mother, and his ex-partner, Tracey Taundry who had earlier arrived at his home to collect her daughter. Latest news and stories from the West Midlands Giving evidence, Miss Taundry said she had gone to get Mylee, who felt unwell, from Mr Billingham who was ""jittery in the mouth but normal"". As she waited at the front door for her daughter to collect a bag, she spotted a knife in her ex-boyfriend's hand before he held it to her throat, she told the jury. ""He said 'I'm going to kill you'. I started running backwards, away from the house... I slipped,"" she added. Tributes left outside the house in Brownhills where Mylee was found She then saw Mr Billingham take hold of Mylee by her coat hood and drag her towards the bungalow. ""All the time Mylee was shouting 'mummy, mummy' and 'please daddy, no daddy, stop it',"" Mr Khalil said. Miss Taundry tried to get back into the property but was unable to and, as she shouted to her daughter, she dialled 999. A transcript of the call was read out in court. ""He's got my baby inside,"" Miss Taundry said to the call handler. ""Please, he's making her scream. I can hear her. ""He's off his head. I think he's had a drink... She wanted to come home. She was screaming 'please daddy don't, I want my mummy."" Police were able to gain entry quickly, the trial was told, and were confronted with a ""terrible"" scene. The jury heard Mylee was stabbed with a 20cm kitchen knife and a pathologist believed severe force was used to inflict the wound, which ""penetrated the entire depth of her chest from front to back"".

"Mrs May spoke to EU leaders for 10 minutes over dinner in Salzburg Theresa May has urged EU leaders to focus their minds on getting a Brexit deal in the next two months, saying negotiations will not be extended. At a dinner in Salzburg, she told her 27 counterparts her priorities were maintaining economic ties and ensuring promises to Northern Ireland were kept. There are suggestions the UK will put forward new ideas for regulatory checks to address the current Irish deadlock. On Thursday the other EU leaders will discuss Brexit without Mrs May present. Arriving for the second day of the gathering Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, the host, said that ""away from the hard media statements, I think both sides are aware that they will only reach a solution if they move towards each other"". Negotiations over the terms of the UK's exit and future relations are at a critical stage, with about six months to go before the UK is scheduled to leave on 29 March 2019. Please upgrade your browser In her speech, Mrs May stressed her ""serious"" proposals for future co-operation between the UK and EU would ensure a ""shared close relationship"". The informal gathering of EU leaders in the Austrian city was the first opportunity the prime minister has had to make the case for her Chequers blueprint to other leaders collectively. Kuenssberg: The sound of ""no, no, no"" EU must 'evolve' Irish plans, insists May At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Brexit will have 'worse economic impact on UK than EU' Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, two EU leaders said they hoped the UK would hold another referendum on Brexit, in the hope of reversing the 2016 result. Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said most of his counterparts would like the ""almost impossible"" to happen. Andrej Babis, the Czech Republic's prime minister, added he hoped the British people might change their minds. Campaign group People's Vote is also calling for another referendum, arguing there should be a choice for voters between leaving with, or without, a deal or staying on current terms. Mrs May's proposal for the UK to sign up to a common rule book for trade in goods and a combined customs territory is unpopular with many in her own party, who believe it will erode British sovereignty and is not what people voted for when they backed Brexit in the 2016 poll. In a further sign of how difficult it might be for her to persuade the UK parliament to back the plans, former minister Sir Mike Penning, who worked under Mrs May at the Home Office and backed her for Conservative leader, told the Daily Telegraphthey were ""as dead as a dodo"",externaland that he could not back them. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Mrs May must delay Brexit beyond next March if there is not a detailed agreement on future trading arrangements. Ms Sturgeon told the BBC that it would be completely reckless to leave the EU without establishing a future relationship. She said that taking the UK off the ""Brexit cliff edge"" without an agreement ""would be the most irresponsible thing any PM has done in a very, very long time"". This video can not be played Theresa May on what can be achieved at Salzburg summit According to a senior government spokesman, the prime minister told her counterparts that Brexit was a ""uniquely complicated"" challenge, but one that could be completed on time. She said there was no question of the UK seeking to extend the negotiations beyond 29 March 2019, as Ms Sturgeon is calling for, thus delaying the moment of departure. She told them she has ""put forward serious proposals and the onus on all of us is to get this done"". Her three priorities, she said, were protecting Northern Ireland's place within the UK, safeguarding trading links with the EU and maintaining a close security relationship with the EU to deal with common threats. On Northern Ireland, there are suggestions the UK will present new proposals in the coming weeks aimed at helping break the impasse with the EU. Brussels has insisted Northern Ireland must stay aligned with its rules unless another solution can be found preventing physical checks on goods crossing to and from the Irish Republic. The UK has said the EU's so-called backstop is unacceptable and its position must ""evolve"". This video can not be played BBC News NI's political reporter Jayne McCormack explains why the border is an issue The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said the UK might accept a border for rules and regulations in time, amid suggestions new proposals on regulatory checks might be published in the coming weeks. But she said there was no chance, as things stand, they will go anywhere near touching a different customs system for Northern Ireland, which would create more friction on the border. And she said officials privately admit there is little chance that the solution is going to be found in any of the technical solutions, relying instead on a big political move by one or both sides. This might not become clear until Thursday when the EU's negotiator, Michel Barnier, will brief European leaders on progress in the negotiations. But Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite and Slovak Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini told Reuters there had been ""no progress"" on Brexit and the Irish border. Mrs May will meet with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and European Council president Donald Tusk on Thursday. The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler said EU leaders believed they ""held all the cards"", given that time was running out to seal a deal. Mrs May's trump card, she added, was the risk of a no deal - which the EU is increasingly concerned about - if her own proposals are rejected.

"MPs will have ""multiple"" opportunities to give the public the final say over whether the UK leaves the EU, the People's Vote campaign group has said. Theresa May has ruled out a referendum on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations under any circumstances. But People's Vote said there were six plausible scenarios in which Parliament could legislate for another vote. It said there should be a choice for voters between leaving with or without a deal or staying on current terms. The prime minister says the UK made its choice to leave in 2016 and that her plan for future co-operation with the EU - based on the Chequers blueprint agreed in July - respects the referendum result. She has said the choice facing Parliament is between leaving with or without a comprehensive agreement. But in a report calledRoadmap to a People's Vote,externalthe group campaigning for a referendum on any Brexit deal said there were no practical or legal barriers to giving the public the final say through a referendum and urged MPs not to hide behind ""logistical arguments"". Brexit is not inevitable - Cable It's my Brexit deal or no deal, May says Kuenssberg: Taking stock The British public voted to leave the EU by a margin of 51.89% to 48.11% in a referendum in June 2016. The UK is scheduled to leave on 29 March 2019, under the terms of the two-year Article 50 process. Negotiations on the terms of the UK's withdrawal, the so-called divorce settlement, as well as the shape of future relations between the two sides are now at a critical stage. European leaders meeting in Salzburg on Wednesday are expected to agree to hold a special summit in November at which any deal sealed in the next six weeks could be approved. Parliament will then be expected to vote on the terms of any agreement before the end of the year. People's Vote said this Commons showdown, when it happened, could be a catalyst for securing a referendum. The six ways it believes a referendum could be delivered are: Using a Commons motion when MPs vote on a Brexit deal the government has negotiated If MPs reject the deal or there is no deal by 21 January 2019 If MPs approve the deal - by amending the necessary legislation to make it conditional on a referendum Theresa May could decide to call a referendum herself if MPs reject the deal She might also call one if there's no deal, in the hope of securing a mandate to take the UK out of the EU on that basis In the ""possible chaos"" of a snap general election called by Mrs May or any possible successor Lord Kerr, the former top civil servant who wrote the report, said MPs who wanted a referendum faced a ""high bar"" given the government's control of the Parliamentary timetable. But he pointed out that Mrs May, who relies on the Democratic Unionist Party for her slim Commons majority, had already suffered two Brexit defeats and if Parliament did not act ""it will not be due to procedural impediments or a lack of time but because MPs have not chosen to take these opportunities"". Theresa May has said a new referendum will not be held in any circumstances The cross-bench peer said the government could easily seek an extension of the Article 50 process to allow for a referendum by ""withdrawing"" the letter sent on 29 March 2017 notifying the EU of its intention to leave. ""The die is not irrevocably cast,"" he wrote. ""There is still time. If there is a majority in Parliament for a People's Vote, there are multiple routes to securing one and, as the process unfolds, more opportunities for the House of Commons to assert its will may emerge."" In terms of what question would be asked, People's Vote said it did not rule out having three options on the ballot paper - namely any deal agreed by the two sides, leaving without a deal or staying in on current terms. But it said this was unlikely to get the backing of MPs and a ""binary choice"" between two options would be clearer, simpler and quicker. While there was a case for giving 16-year olds the vote and allowing EU nationals living in the UK to take part, it said there might be ""practical limits"" on any changes to the franchise given the timescale involved. The Lib Dems, the SNP and a growing number of Labour MPs back the idea of a referendum but Jeremy Corbyn has not committed to one as yet and only a handful of Tories support it.

"Watch Manager Norman Harrison said he was shocked by the severity of the fire A firefighter who pressed his supervisors to abandon the policy of telling residents to ""stay put"" during the Grenfell Tower fire has said he hopes victims' families get ""justice"". Norman Harrison, a watch manager with 25 years' experience, was called to the fire at 01:15 BST - more than 90 minutes before the advice was reversed. He said he made his case in a way that was ""impossible"" not to hear. Mr Harrison told the families: ""I hope you get the justice you deserve."" Senior fire officers initially told residents in Grenfell Tower to stay in their flats -  in accordance with the policy for high-rise buildings. However, as the blaze cut off upper floors from rescuers, the stay-put advice was abandoned at 02:47. Giving evidence at the Grenfell Inquiry, Mr Harrison said he tried to get the stay-put strategy abandoned much earlier. He said the advice was redundant by around 01:50. ""I was truly shocked at such a severe fire over so many floors,"" he said. ""The stay-put policy is predicated upon the assumption that someone can stay in their flat, safe, from the one compartment that is alight somewhere in the building and they're not going to be affected by the fire - either flames, heat or smoke. ""I could see that just didn't apply here any more."" He said the external face of Grenfell Tower reminded him ""of the surface of the Sun"", adding that he had ""never seen a fire like it"". However, any evacuation of the block would have been ""extremely difficult"", Mr Harrison added. ""I knew it was going to be an extremely difficult task to achieve and there was going to be no easy way to achieve it,"" he added.

"Officials say rivers in South Carolina could reach their highest levels by the end of this week or early next Two mental health patients have died when the police van they were being transported in got caught in floodwaters in the US, police say. The two officers escorting the pair were eventually rescued. The patients' deaths bring the death toll from Storm Florence to 37. Thousands of homes and roadways in the region remain underwater less than a week after the storm made landfall. President Donald Trump arrived in North Carolina on Wednesday to survey damage. Mr Trump praised the response to the ""devastating"" storm by federal and local disaster officials at a news conference in North Carolina on Wednesday morning. ""Unfortunately, the money will be a lot, but it's going to come as fast as you need it,"" Mr Trump said. ""We're going to take care of everybody."" Mr Trump will be heading to South Carolina next. The storm's latest victims in South Carolina were identified as Wendy Wenton, 45, and Nicolette Green, 43, by the Marion County Coroner, US media report. The Horry County Sheriff's Department said in a statement that when the waters overtook the van, they rose too quickly for the pair to be saved. Pig waste pools overflow after Florence A community cut off after 'terrifying' storm The numbers behind impact of Florence A high water team eventually rescued the two deputies who were escorting them.

""Despite persistent and ongoing efforts, floodwater rose rapidly and the deputies were unable to open the doors to reach the individuals inside the van,"" the police statement said,according to the Greenville News,external. ""At this time, the recovery effort is ongoing, and the transportation vehicle cannot be removed due to rising waters and dangerous conditions."" Florence has caused major flooding across the Carolinas The detainees were women being transported from Waccamaw Mental Health and Loris Hospital to a behavioural health hospital in Darlington, South Carolina, according to the Associated Press. ""Tonight's incident is a tragedy,"" Sheriff Phillip Thompson told the Greenville News. ""Just like you, we have questions we want answered. We are fully co-operating with the State Law Enforcement Division to support their investigation of this event."" The tragic incident occurred near the Little Pee Dee River, which continues to rise as water from upriver North Carolina makes its way into South Carolina's waterways. The Little Pee Dee has crested in some regions at over 46ft (14m) and its flooding has impacted town water supplies, officials say. Florence has claimed eight lives in South Carolina thus far, and flooding is expected to worsen later this week and into next. Thousands of homes are still underwater in the Carolinas and thousands of families have had to be rescued from the floods. As of Wednesday, more than 3,000 people had been rescued in North Carolina and 20,000 federal and military personnel are supporting state efforts. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper called Florence ""a storm like no other"" during a news conference with Mr Trump and federal officials on Wednesday. ""We are a beacon in the South and we have weathered storms before in our state. But Mr President, we have never seen one like this. This one has been epic. It has been disastrous. It has been widespread."" Brock Long, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), said the government is pushing disaster survivor assistance teams into the Carolinas. ""A disaster response like this takes all of us working together, not just the federal government,"" he said. ""This event's not over. The rivers are still cresting we still have a lot of work to do."" The president has promised to completely support the Carolinas' recovery efforts. ""We will be there 100%,"" he said.

"Mr Trump said in an inteview he was ""very disappointed"" in Mr Sessions US President Donald Trump has said he does not ""have an attorney general"" in his fiercest attack yet on Jeff Sessions. In an interview with Hill.TV, Mr Trump renewed criticism of Mr Sessions' decision to step aside from the inquiry into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. He also said he was unhappy with Mr Sessions' response to immigration. The attorney general is yet to respond to Mr Trump's comments. It is unusual for a sitting president to attack their attorney general and critics accuse Mr Trump of trying to meddle in the legal system. Afterthe president criticised Mr Sessions last month, two key Republican senators signalled that they would support Mr Trump if he were to fire Mr Sessions after the November mid-term elections. However, other Republicanstold Politico they thought this would be a bad move,externaland said they were standing by the attorney general. Mr Sessions has pushed back against previous criticism by Mr Trump. ""While I am attorney general, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations,"" he said in August. ""I demand the highest standards, and where they are not met, I take action."" Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Will Trump remain bulletproof? Mr Sessions was an early supporter of Mr Trump's presidential campaign. But he left the Russia investigation - which is reportedly looking into whether Mr Trump attempted to obstruct justice - in 2017, citing a potential conflict of interest, and handed control to his deputy, Rod Rosenstein. The president insists there was no collusion between his campaign and the Russian government, and denies he has attempted to obstruct justice. ""I don't have an attorney general. It's very sad,"" Mr Trump said during Tuesday's interview. He added that he was ""very disappointed"" about Mr Sessions' decision to leave the investigation. Asked whether he would consider firing Mr Sessions, the president responded: ""We'll see what happens. A lot of people have asked me to do that. This video can not be played Relations between the two soured in 2017 ""And I guess I study history, and I say I just want to leave things alone, but it was very unfair what he did [in recusing himself from the Russia investigation]."" Mr Trump also told Hill.TV that he was ""not happy"" with Mr Sessions on immigration and other issues, and said the attorney general had performed ""very poorly"" during the nomination process for the post. ""I mean, he was mixed up and confused, and people that worked with him for, you know, a long time in the Senate were not nice to him, but he was giving very confusing answers,"" he said. ""Answers that should have been easily answered. And that was a rough time for him."" ByAnthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Donald Trump no longer likes Jeff Sessions, one of his earliest, most prominent supporters. This is not news. There are also political reasons why the president has been unwilling to straight-up fire his attorney general. This is also not news. That Mr Trump went so far as to say he doesn't have an attorney general - a slightly tamer version of ""he's dead to me"" - is dramatic, but it's variations on a theme. What might be surprising, and might also be significant, is the president's decision to criticise Mr Sessions for more than just his recusal from the Russia probe. He doesn't like the way he's handling the immigration issue, for instance. Given that Mr Sessions was considered to be one of the hardest of the hard-liners on immigration while in the US Senate and the man who helped refine Mr Trump's anti-immigration strategy during the campaign, this is remarkable. It could also possibly be the beginning of the president's efforts to make a larger case for getting rid of Mr Sessions - after the mid-term elections removes the possibility of immediate political fallout, of course. If the president can frame axing Mr Sessions as part of a larger political disagreement, that could help deflect some of the intense criticism he will receive for the move. It's still going to be a rough ride, and confirming a replacement for the attorney general in the Senate will be a monumental task, but the pieces are being moved on the board. Mr Trump's comments mark just the latest stage of a torrid relationship: February 2016:Jeff Sessions becomes the first Republican senator to publicly endorse Mr Trump in the presidential race February 2017:He is confirmed as attorney general March 2017:He admits he met a Russian ambassador during the election. He insists the meeting only took place as part of his work as a senator, but recuses himself from the Russia investigation July 2017:Mr Trump tells the New York Times he never would have appointed Mr Sessions had he known he would recuse himself. Over the following year, he sends a number of tweets critical of Mr Sessions August 2018:Early in the month, Mr Trump tweets that Mr Sessions should ""stop this Rigged Witch Hunt"", in reference to the Russia inquiry. A few weeks later, he piles in again, saying ""the only reason I gave him the job"" was Mr Sessions' loyalty. Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas?

"A picture of the couple, posted on Ms Shapiro's Instagram account in 2015 A hoax is likely to be one line of inquiry after a couple apparently fell ill in a Salisbury restaurant on Sunday promptinga major incident, police sources have told the BBC. Alex King, 42, was admitted to hospital with his wife, six months after a nerve agent attack in the same city. Mr King is a convicted criminal and once hoaxed Prince Charles. Police sources said until the man had been spoken to, ""we can't rule anything in or out"". On Tuesday, Mr King's wife, Anna Shapiro, 30, told the Sun that the Russian state had poisoned her and her husband in Prezzo. The paper reported it was ""what security sources fear was a suspected rat poison attack"". Ms Shapiro is a model and an Israeli citizen of Russian heritage. A spokesman for the Sun told the BBC: ""Like any newspaper, we were keen to talk to those at the centre of the incident and give them the opportunity to share with the public their version of events."" The article has since been removed from the newspaper's website ""for legal reasons"". No arrests have been made and Wiltshire Police said on Wednesday: ""This is now a routine investigation. ""The woman from the restaurant has been interviewed once and is likely to be spoken to again. The next step is to speak to the man involved."" The BBC was unable to contact the couple. Wiltshire Police earlier confirmed the pair were not exposed to any nerve agent and that it wasnot linking their illnesswith the recent poisonings in Salisbury and Amesbury. ""Given recent events in Salisbury, the reporting of an event requiring the evacuation of bars and restaurants by police officers in bio-hazard suits, and that requires tests for the presence of Novichok, is of obvious public interest,"" a spokesman for the Sun added. Salisbury District Hospital said ""both patients are now medically fit"" and have been discharged from hospital. It is understood that the couple also tested negative for any other poisons, including rat poison. In 2006 Mr King carried out a ""prank"" on the Prince of Wales at a film premiere. He inserted himself into an official line-up of stars being greeted by Prince Charles and was later interviewed by the media about his deception. He claimed the ""prank"" was carried outas part of a Â£100,000 bet with his employer,external- the convicted fraudster Edward Davenport. In 2004, Mr King pleaded guilty at London's Horseferry Road Magistrates' Court to three counts of distributing indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs of children. In a statement on Wednesday, Lorna Wilkinson, director of nursing at Salisbury District Hospital, said ""given recent events"" they had tested Mr King and Ms Shapiro for nerve agents, when they were admitted on Sunday evening. ""Tests on both patients came back negative,"" she said. ""Both patients are now medically fit and there is no need for them to be in hospital."" ""While this incident did not involve nerve agents, it was still clearly very stressful for our staff who, once again, demonstrated the very best of the NHS. ""I want to thank them for rising to the occasion yet again,"" she added. On 4 March, Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yuliacollapsed in Salisburyhaving been exposed to the nerve agent Novichok. After weeks in hospital they were released, but in June, two Amesbury residents fell ill after being exposed to the same nerve agent. Dawn Sturgess, 44,later died. The UK government has accused two Russian men, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, of attempting to kill the Skripals. But in an interview on a Russian state-run news channel, they claimed to be tourists. Russia has denied any involvement in the poisoning.

"Primary school education has become a hot topic at Holyrood MSPs have defeated the Scottish government in a vote calling on ministers to ""halt"" national assessments for five-year-old pupils. The assessments were introduced across Scotland last year, but some teachers and parents have criticised them. Ministers insist they are not high-stakes tests, but help schools assess where pupils need help at an early age. Opposition parties say they are not in line with play-based early learning and could create league tables of schools. Members voted by 63 to 61 to pass a Conservative motion calling for a ""halt"" to the tests, with all of the opposition parties uniting against the SNP. The largely symbolic motion does not bind the government to any action, but Education Secretary John Swinney said he would ""reflect"" on the defeat. Opposition parties called on the government to ""respect the will of parliament"" and scrap the tests. Look back on the debate on Holyrood Live What are P1 assessments really like? Standardised assessments were introduced in 2017 in a bid to gather more data about the stages children have reached in their learning, with literacy and numeracy tests at P1, P4, P7 and S3 level. Howeverthere has been opposition to testsfor the youngest pupils, with the EIS teaching union claiming they have left some children distressed and parents group Upstart Scotland saying they are administered ""at an age when the overwhelming majority of European children aren't even at school"". Mr Swinney contends that it would be ""deeply irresponsible"" to scrap the tests, saying that ""many of the criticisms from opposition parties have ranged from ill-informed to hypocritical"". John Swinney defended the assessments During the debate, SNP members repeatedly highlighted the fact that the Scottish Conservative manifesto for the 2016 Holyrood elections backed having tests in P1. Mr Swinney said he was ""appalled"" at the ""deceit"" of the Conservative motion, accusing the biggest opposition party of ""playing politics"". Ms Smith said her party had ""made a mistake"" in backing P1 assessments in 2016, and had flagged up ""misgivings"" in the years since. She said: ""As a party we continue to have these misgivings. We are listening to what is being said by those who are being asked by deliver the tests, and it is why I am proposing this motion, which asks the government to stop and think. ""Halt the P1 tests so that we can reconsider the facts before us, and the whole approach to evaluating pupil progress in P1."" Liz Smith put forward the motion for debate Opposition MSPs were all critical of the assessments, albeit for different reasons, with the Greens and Lib Dems hitting out at the principle of standardised testing in general. Labour's Iain Gray hit out at the practical implementation, saying young pupils had been upset ""to the point of tears"" by ""daunting"" tests and ""questions they find incomprehensible"". He also claimed teachers don't find the data generated useful ""in any way"", saying: ""The government has managed to introduce assessments which feel like high-stakes tests to teachers and pupils, but don't produce statistically valid comparative measurements."" Green MSP Ross Greer said his party was ""unequivocally opposed"" to standardised assessments, and said Mr Swinney was ""developing a reputation for casting aside the views of elected members, as well as those of experts, teachers, parents and pupils"". And Lib Dem education spokesman Tavish Scott said the assessments ""skew learning away from play"", which he said should be at the heart of the early-years curriculum. He added that he was ""at a loss to understand why the government is deaf to the practical observations of teachers and parents"". Examples of assessment questions were shown to MSPs and the media on Tuesday In a point of order, Labour's Richard Leonard challenged ministers to obey the will of parliament. And Tavish Scott of the Lib Dems found a neat formula when he said that a child could work out that 63 is a bigger number than 61. But Mr Swinney is not, currently, for budging. He has promised to review the situation and to reflect upon the vote. Meanwhile he urged councils to continue with standardised testing, including at P1 level. My take? He'll come back with further suggested reforms - including, perhaps, revisions to the questions and methodology in an effort to address, again, concerns that the system is stressful. But, as things stand tonight, I do not see him abandoning the P1 assessments entirely. Which will generate a further debate about educational provision. And also about Parliamentary democracy. Read more from Brian here Mr Swinney argued that the assessments were ""absolutely vital"" to get information about children's learning ""as early as possible"", contending that they were ""designed to fit compatibly"" with a play-based curriculum. He said the tests had been going on for ""years"" at 29 out of Scotland's 32 local authorities, and were a ""key tool to inform a teacher's professional judgement"". However his amendment reflecting this point was voted down by members by 63 votes to 61. And MSPs subsequently passed Ms Smith's motion by the same margin. The motion passed calls on parliament to note ""the level of concern that has been raised by teachers and other education professionals regarding the introduction and delivery of new testing arrangements for P1 pupils"", and calls on ministers to ""halt the tests in P1 and to reconsider the evidence and the whole approach to evaluating the progress of P1 pupils"". Following the vote, Mr Swinney told BBC Scotland that the government ""remains absolutely committed to standardised assessment"". He said he would ""obviously reflect"" on the vote, but advised schools to continue with the current system in the meantime. What are P1 assessments really like?

""He said 'I'm going to kill you'. I started running backwards, away from the house... I slipped,"" she added. Tributes left outside the house in Brownhills where Mylee was found She then saw Mr Billingham take hold of Mylee by her coat hood and drag her towards the bungalow.

"HMS Endeavour landed in Australia in 1770 The hunt for the final resting place of Captain James Cook's HMS Endeavour may soon be over - in time for the 250th anniversary of its voyage to Australia. The Endeavour, then known as Lord Sandwich II, was sunk with 12 other ships off Rhode Island, in the US, in August 1778, but no-one was sure where. Now, following a 25-year archaeological study of the area, the search has been narrowed to just ""one or two"" sites. Experts are now hopeful it will be definitively identified by 2020. That would be just in time for the anniversary of Capt Cook arriving in Australia, following a two-year voyage of discovery which initially set out from Plymouth, England. Captain Cook's Endeavour replica comes 'home' to Whitby The Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project (Rimap), which has been working with the Australian National Maritime Museum (ANMM), said it would release a ""3-D photogrammetric image of a promising site"" on Friday. But it will still be some time until the true identity of the wreck is revealed.""Detailed work"" must be done during a planned excavation of the area,external, just off Goat Island, in 2019, it said in a statement. ""We're not in a position to identify it conclusively,"" Rimap's Kathy Aththas told News.com.au.,external ""Once excavated it will require sampling, testing of the type of wood and nails, and analysis which won't give us a definitive answer for another 18 months."" Capt Cook set sail on Endeavour - a British-built coal ship - in 1768 on a scientific voyage to map the Pacific Ocean. It was the ship in which the explorer charted New Zealand and Australia between 1769 and 1771. He arrived off the south-east coast of what is now Australia in 1770, eventually making landfall at Botany Bay. He later claimed the region for the British crown, despite the presence of large Indigenous communities. A replica of the Endeavour, which is to become a museum in Whitby, Yorkshire After sailing back to Britain, the Endeavour was renamed Lord Sandwich II and became a troop carrier. During the American War of Independence it was scuttled by the British Navy with the 12 other ships to form a blockade of the Narragansett Bay.

"With the UK on course to leave the European Union in March next year, the country faces four possible scenarios. The UK and the EU both insist they want as amicable a divorce as possible, with a legal agreement setting out the kind of relationship they will have when the UK is no longer a member of the club. MP quits as minister over Brexit vote Reality Check: What does the Brexit White Paper reveal? Brexit: All you need to know Prime Minister Theresa May wants to keep close ties with the EU in certain areas, such as trade in agricultural products and allowing skilled migrants access to jobs in the UK. She saysher plan,externalwill allow Britain to take back control of its laws, money and borders, just like people voted for in the 2016 EU referendum, while also allowing as ""frictionless"" trade as possible and avoiding a physical border for Northern Ireland. But it has been attacked as an unworkable compromise by people from both the Remain and Leave ends of the debate. The EU may also decide to reject it, but the two sides are still hoping to strike some kind of deal by the autumn and, despite criticism and ministerial resignations, Mrs May believes this is the best option. A clean break with the EU. The UK would fall back on its membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the global body governing international trade. UK exports to the EU would be subject to the same customs checks and taxes the EU currently imposes on countries like the United States. Those arguing for this option - the so-called ""hard Brexiteers"" - say it would create a truly independent nation able to strike its own beneficial trade deals around the world. But opponents say it would be catastrophic for British business and have warned about chaos at the borders, higher food prices and shortages in the shops. The UK has formally triggered the mechanism to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, 2019. To reverse that at this late stage would mean a huge loss of political face, and probably require a new prime minister, with the backing of voters in a general election. European Council President Donald Tusk has said he believes Brexit can be halted - but there is some debate about whether the Article 50 process, the two-year legal mechanism taking the UK out of the EU, is reversible. (You can read a fullBBC Reality Check on the debate here.) If the UK did leave and wanted to immediately rejoin, it would need all the other EU member states to agree. A less formal version of staying in the EU would be if the UK strikes a deal that keeps it in the EU's trade arrangements - the customs union and the single market - and agrees to free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. This would amount to staying in the EU, Brexiteers argue. The UK government has ruled this out but there have been a number of people calling for a fresh vote - includingJustine Greening. Reality Check: How would the UK hold a second EU referendum? With Parliament apparently split over what kind of Brexit it wants, a referendum on the final deal agreed by Theresa May in Brussels might yet end up being the only way to break the deadlock. Those campaigning for another referendum say voters should get the final say, including the option of staying in. Labour's leadership say a general election should be held rather than another referendum.

"Primary school education has become a hot topic at Holyrood MSPs have defeated the Scottish government in a vote calling on ministers to ""halt"" national assessments for five-year-old pupils. The assessments were introduced across Scotland last year, but some teachers and parents have criticised them. Ministers insist they are not high-stakes tests, but help schools assess where pupils need help at an early age. Opposition parties say they are not in line with play-based early learning and could create league tables of schools. Members voted by 63 to 61 to pass a Conservative motion calling for a ""halt"" to the tests, with all of the opposition parties uniting against the SNP. The largely symbolic motion does not bind the government to any action, but Education Secretary John Swinney said he would ""reflect"" on the defeat. Opposition parties called on the government to ""respect the will of parliament"" and scrap the tests. Look back on the debate on Holyrood Live What are P1 assessments really like? Standardised assessments were introduced in 2017 in a bid to gather more data about the stages children have reached in their learning, with literacy and numeracy tests at P1, P4, P7 and S3 level. Howeverthere has been opposition to testsfor the youngest pupils, with the EIS teaching union claiming they have left some children distressed and parents group Upstart Scotland saying they are administered ""at an age when the overwhelming majority of European children aren't even at school"". Mr Swinney contends that it would be ""deeply irresponsible"" to scrap the tests, saying that ""many of the criticisms from opposition parties have ranged from ill-informed to hypocritical"". John Swinney defended the assessments During the debate, SNP members repeatedly highlighted the fact that the Scottish Conservative manifesto for the 2016 Holyrood elections backed having tests in P1. Mr Swinney said he was ""appalled"" at the ""deceit"" of the Conservative motion, accusing the biggest opposition party of ""playing politics"". Ms Smith said her party had ""made a mistake"" in backing P1 assessments in 2016, and had flagged up ""misgivings"" in the years since. She said: ""As a party we continue to have these misgivings. We are listening to what is being said by those who are being asked by deliver the tests, and it is why I am proposing this motion, which asks the government to stop and think. ""Halt the P1 tests so that we can reconsider the facts before us, and the whole approach to evaluating pupil progress in P1."" Liz Smith put forward the motion for debate Opposition MSPs were all critical of the assessments, albeit for different reasons, with the Greens and Lib Dems hitting out at the principle of standardised testing in general. Labour's Iain Gray hit out at the practical implementation, saying young pupils had been upset ""to the point of tears"" by ""daunting"" tests and ""questions they find incomprehensible"". He also claimed teachers don't find the data generated useful ""in any way"", saying: ""The government has managed to introduce assessments which feel like high-stakes tests to teachers and pupils, but don't produce statistically valid comparative measurements."" Green MSP Ross Greer said his party was ""unequivocally opposed"" to standardised assessments, and said Mr Swinney was ""developing a reputation for casting aside the views of elected members, as well as those of experts, teachers, parents and pupils"". And Lib Dem education spokesman Tavish Scott said the assessments ""skew learning away from play"", which he said should be at the heart of the early-years curriculum. He added that he was ""at a loss to understand why the government is deaf to the practical observations of teachers and parents"". Examples of assessment questions were shown to MSPs and the media on Tuesday In a point of order, Labour's Richard Leonard challenged ministers to obey the will of parliament. And Tavish Scott of the Lib Dems found a neat formula when he said that a child could work out that 63 is a bigger number than 61. But Mr Swinney is not, currently, for budging. He has promised to review the situation and to reflect upon the vote. Meanwhile he urged councils to continue with standardised testing, including at P1 level. My take? He'll come back with further suggested reforms - including, perhaps, revisions to the questions and methodology in an effort to address, again, concerns that the system is stressful. But, as things stand tonight, I do not see him abandoning the P1 assessments entirely. Which will generate a further debate about educational provision. And also about Parliamentary democracy. Read more from Brian here Mr Swinney argued that the assessments were ""absolutely vital"" to get information about children's learning ""as early as possible"", contending that they were ""designed to fit compatibly"" with a play-based curriculum. He said the tests had been going on for ""years"" at 29 out of Scotland's 32 local authorities, and were a ""key tool to inform a teacher's professional judgement"". However his amendment reflecting this point was voted down by members by 63 votes to 61. And MSPs subsequently passed Ms Smith's motion by the same margin. The motion passed calls on parliament to note ""the level of concern that has been raised by teachers and other education professionals regarding the introduction and delivery of new testing arrangements for P1 pupils"", and calls on ministers to ""halt the tests in P1 and to reconsider the evidence and the whole approach to evaluating the progress of P1 pupils"". Following the vote, Mr Swinney told BBC Scotland that the government ""remains absolutely committed to standardised assessment"". He said he would ""obviously reflect"" on the vote, but advised schools to continue with the current system in the meantime. What are P1 assessments really like?

"This video can not be played Tesco says Jack's prices will be lower than Lidl and Aldi Tesco has unveiled its new discount chain called Jack's that aims to tackle the rising threat posed by German rivals Aldi and Lidl. The first store is in a mothballed former Tesco store in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire. Another outlet in Immingham, Lincolnshire also opens on Thursday. Between 10 and 15 stores are planned for new locations, next to existing Tesco stores, and a small number of converted Tesco stores. Chief executive Dave Lewis claimed that Jack's - named after Tesco founder Sir Jack Cohen - would be cheaper than Aldi or Lidl. ""We have been thinking about what customers want, and bringing it to them in the most cost-effective, value-orientated way possible,"" he told the BBC. ""The objective is to be the lowest cost for customers."" Jack's stores will sell 2,600 products - far fewer than the 35,000 carried by a Tesco supermarket - with 1,800 branded ""Jack's"". By comparison, Aldi sells around 1,800 products. It is understood that Aldi will review Jack's prices where the stores open and adjust them if required. Fraser McKevitt at Kantar Worldpanel said Jack's would have little immediate impact on its German rivals: ""There are already over 1,300 Aldi and Lidl stores across the country and the two have a combined market share of 13.1%, so Jack's is clearly playing a longer-term game. Like its two rivals, Jack's will also have a central aisle offering food and non-food bargains called WIGIG - When It's Gone It's Gone. Jack's will also have a Fresh Five fruit and veg offer that echoes Aldi's Super Six. Nicholas Carroll, senior retail analyst at Mintel, said: ""Aldi and Lidl can take much solace in that their new rival takes much inspiration from their own stores.

Although Jack's is ""part of the Tesco family"", Lawrence Harvey, the former Aldi UK executive in charge of Jack's, said it will not issue or accept Clubcard points. Neither will there be any online operation. As well as the discounters, Tesco faced being overtaken as the UK's biggest supermarket chain by a combined Sainsbury's and Asda.

This video can not be played Jack's: Will people switch to Tesco's new chain? Mr Lewis said that beyond the initial 10 to 15 stores, more could follow, but that was ""not a calculation we're currently making"". Five will be rebranded Metro stores, which are larger than an Tesco Express but smaller than its supermarkets. The Tesco boss said was not worried about the new chain cannibalising sales from Tesco outlets. It plans to build a Jack's in the car park of a Tesco Extra to see how consumers shop. Only two will come from stores mothballed in 2014-15 when Mr Lewis took over as chief executive, while the remainder will be new.

He has tried to find savings wherever possible: the freezers in Jack's cost 10% less than those used in Tesco, while flooring is polished concrete rather than tiles. Jack's also hopes to do things more efficiently. Aisles, for example, are wide enough so if the shop is busy workers still have room to replenish shelves. There will be just 20 to 25 workers at a Jack's store, which will feature more self-service tills than staffed checkouts.

"HMS Endeavour landed in Australia in 1770 The hunt for the final resting place of Captain James Cook's HMS Endeavour may soon be over - in time for the 250th anniversary of its voyage to Australia. The Endeavour, then known as Lord Sandwich II, was sunk with 12 other ships off Rhode Island, in the US, in August 1778, but no-one was sure where. Now, following a 25-year archaeological study of the area, the search has been narrowed to just ""one or two"" sites. Experts are now hopeful it will be definitively identified by 2020. That would be just in time for the anniversary of Capt Cook arriving in Australia, following a two-year voyage of discovery which initially set out from Plymouth, England. Captain Cook's Endeavour replica comes 'home' to Whitby The Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project (Rimap), which has been working with the Australian National Maritime Museum (ANMM), said it would release a ""3-D photogrammetric image of a promising site"" on Friday. But it will still be some time until the true identity of the wreck is revealed.""Detailed work"" must be done during a planned excavation of the area,external, just off Goat Island, in 2019, it said in a statement. ""We're not in a position to identify it conclusively,"" Rimap's Kathy Aththas told News.com.au.,external ""Once excavated it will require sampling, testing of the type of wood and nails, and analysis which won't give us a definitive answer for another 18 months."" Capt Cook set sail on Endeavour - a British-built coal ship - in 1768 on a scientific voyage to map the Pacific Ocean. It was the ship in which the explorer charted New Zealand and Australia between 1769 and 1771. He arrived off the south-east coast of what is now Australia in 1770, eventually making landfall at Botany Bay. He later claimed the region for the British crown, despite the presence of large Indigenous communities. A replica of the Endeavour, which is to become a museum in Whitby, Yorkshire After sailing back to Britain, the Endeavour was renamed Lord Sandwich II and became a troop carrier. During the American War of Independence it was scuttled by the British Navy with the 12 other ships to form a blockade of the Narragansett Bay.

"The robotic jellyfish propel themselves with rubber tentacles A fleet of robotic jellyfish has been designed to monitor delicate ecosystems, including coral reefs. The underwater drones were invented by engineers at Florida Atlantic University and are driven by rings of hydraulic tentacles. The robots can squeeze through tight holes without causing damage. One expert praised the design but warned that the man-made jellyfish might be eaten by turtles. Mystery over tiny robots left on beach The robot jellyfish shredders Drones hunt cocaine in Colombia The flexible, 20cm-wide bots are modelled on the appearance of the moon jellyfish during its larval stage. The design is intended to be less environmentally disruptive than a drone submarine, according to Prof Erik Engeberg, of Florida Atlantic University. ""Mini-submarines are rigid and typically use a propeller for locomotion,"" he said. ""The propellers can chop up the reef and the tough shell of a sub can cause damage to delicate ecosystems if there is a collision. ""The soft jellyfish robot can avoid these problems with its unorthodox design and locomotion strategy, inspired by biology."" The underwater bots can squeeze through tight holes To move, the robots use eight silicon rubber tentacles powered by pumps. Water flows into the tentacles, filling them up and then - as the pumps are switched off - it flows back into the surrounding sea again. This propels the robot jellyfish forward and produces a lifelike flapping motion. Other researchers have modelled robots after jellyfish. A team from the University of Texas at Dallas, for example,tested a hydrogen-powered bot, while engineers from Virginia Tech have experimented with amechanical jellyfish measuring 1.7 metres,external. The prototypes from Florida Atlantic University are much smaller than this - only 20cm wide. They can also swim untethered, although this does mean they could drift away if the engineers aren't careful. ""It is important to track their locations so that they can be retrieved after a mission,"" said Prof Engeberg. Basing a robot on a real organism is ""a great idea"", according to Prof John Turner, a marine biologist at Bangor University. The drone's jerky movement might not be ideal for recording video or sound, but Prof Turner said it could monitor the health of the reef, for example by spotting changes in oxygen levels, or evidence of erosion. ""Of course one risk might be the drone being consumed by turtles, sea mammals and large fish,"" he told the BBC, noting that the robot could have ""a harmful effect on the unfortunate animal that swallowed it"". He said the designers should consider adding an acoustic warning device, or giving the jellyfish an ""unpalatable taste"".

"The British Nutrition Foundation is launching a concept called the ""quality calorie"", to make people think more about the types of foods they eat. While most adults consume more than they need, simply counting calories and cutting down is not enough, it says. It wants people to look at nutritional values to select the best calories.

Calculate how many calories you need Can you lose weight without counting calories? 200-400 calories recipes,external Calories give people energy - women need about 2,000 a day and men 2,500.

A 30g handful of nuts contains about 174kcal, similar to a couple of chocolate digestives, but the British Nutrition Foundation (BNF) says nuts arequality calories,external, making them a good snack, while the biscuits are not An avocado contains lots of good nutrients even though it has more calorific value than many other fresh fruits and vegetables, making its calories ""quality"" too A low calorie beer is not nutritious High-calorie foods are often less healthy but not always. And those sold as low-calorie may not be the healthiest. Low-calorie means: 40 calories or less per serving if it is a food 20kcal per 100ml if it is a drink Manufacturers are allowed to say their food is calorie-free if a serving has fewer than five calories - but these still count. A can of diet ""zero"" fizzy drink contains about 10kcal - the same as a small (30g) carrot. The carrot has the quality calories, while the fizzy drink doesn't Experts often refer to alcohol - but any food or drink high in sugar but low in nutritional value can be said to have empty calories. A lollipop can contain about 45kcal, only slightly more than an apple - but these calories are empty, while the ones from an apple are quality When people say hidden calories, they mean foods or drinks higher in calories than most people might expect. A 125g pot of low-fat fruit yogurt can contain more than 100kcals- more than a chocolate-covered digestive biscuit. A plain yogurt with a few berries or a sprinkle of low-sugar granola would be a better quality calorie choice, says the BNF About a quarter of calories now come from food and drink consumed outside of the home, according togovernment research,external. Increasingly, cafes, coffee shops and restaurants are making calorie information more visible. But it can still be difficult to keep track, especially if you add extra ingredients and flavours to your purchase. A regular latte coffee (made with semi-skimmed milk) contains about 78kcal. Add some vanilla syrup, and you'll have more than doubled it to about 175kcal without gaining any quality calories According to Public Health England, ahealthy diet,externalshould include: lots of fruit and vegetables some starchy foods such as wholegrain bread, pasta and rice some protein from meat, fish, dairy or pulses a bit of fat Things to cut down on are: sugary fizzy drinks alcoholic drinks sugary breakfast cereals cakes biscuits pastries Abody mass index calculator,externalcan help you judge if you are a healthy weight or not. If you do need to lose weight, NHS Choices says aim to lose about 0.5-1kg (1-2lb) a week by consuming about 500-600kcal fewer a day than you need. Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE, said: ""We clearly need to improve the nation's diet but excess calories are the root cause of obesity - this is why we are working with the food industry to reduce sugar and calories in everyday foods."" Dr Frankie Phillips, from the British Dietetics Association, said: ""If you are eating too many calories, then you need to be cutting down but also making sure the ones you are consuming count for more in terms of nutrition.

"Leah Washington (left) and Vicky Balch were both badly injured on the ride Two women who lost legs after a crash on a ride at Alton Towers are suing the park's owners, their lawyers have said. Vicky Balch, 23, and Leah Washington, 20, were in the front seats of the Smiler ride which rammed into a stationary carriage in June 2015. They could each receive ""well in excess of Â£2m"" in compensation if the High Court claim is successful. The women are suing Merlin Attractions Operations Ltd for negligence and or breach of statutory duty. Merlin said it was ""on standby to conclude settlement discussions on the outstanding claims as soon as they are ready"". The Staffordshire theme park owner has already admitted breaching the Health and Safety Act, and was fined Â£5m in September 2016. Latest news and stories from the West Midlands Miss Balch, of Leyland, Lancashire, and Miss Washington, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, needed partial leg amputations after the crash. Both have been undergoing rehabilitation for their injuries. Lawyer Paul Paxton said: ""Our clients suffered life-changing injuries as a result of the accident. ""Whilst money cannot make up for what they have endured over the past three years, financial security can at least help the victims to lead a full and active life. ""Regrettably, where such serious injuries are sustained, it can take many years before the extent of losses can be established."" The Smiler crash happened in June 2015 A Merlin spokesman said: ""From the outset we have admitted liability and have engaged fully at all times to achieve settlement for all the claimants as quickly as possible. ""The claimants' lawyer has confirmed to us that this is a purely procedural filing to preserve their clients' rights in relation to the standard three-year limitation period, and that certain claims are not yet ready for settlement due to their complex nature."" He said settlements relied on receiving certain information from claimants, and Merlin had ""provided appropriate support including interim payments while the assessments continue"". Judge Michael Chambers QC said the crash on the Â£18m attraction was a""catastrophic failure and a ""needless and avoidable accident in which those who were injured were lucky not to be killed."" Miss Balch has said shedoes not see the point in being angry about what happened. Lawyers said Meera Chauhan, 52, and her daughter Vanisha Singh, 33, from Walsall, who were also injured in the crash, were preparing their own legal battle.

"Silent Witness's Liz Carr is one of the few disabled people with major on-screen roles National broadcasters and the UK government have backed a plan to double the number of disabled people working in television by 2020. The BBC, ITV and Sky are among those to support the initiative to increase the percentage of disabled people working on screen and behind the scenes. The scheme comes from the Creative Diversity Network (CDN). According to the CDN, 6.8% of people appearing on screen and 4.5% of the workforce off screen are disabled. The figures relate to programmes broadcast between August 2016 and July 2017. They are contained ina CDN report,external, which says 18% of the overall UK population are disabled. The CDN monitors inclusivity in UK broadcasting, and its Doubling Disability plan has the backing of the Department for Work and Pensions. Behind the scenes, the numbers of people with disabilities varies by genre. The highest proportions were in current affairs (12.1%) and children's programmes (9.3%). Lower representation was found in comedy (2.2%) and drama (1.9%), with the figures in arts and music too low to report. Sarah Newton, minister for disabled people, said: ""Doubling Disability will play an important role in ensuring that the UK's 14 million disabled people feel represented in the media, with the potential to change public perceptions of disability for the better."" BBC director general Lord Hall said: ""Diversity is vital to the BBC's commitment to serve the whole of the UK. As an industry we must do more to increase the number of disabled people working in broadcasting. ""We're fully committed to the CDN's Doubling Disability plan and want to do all we can to improve representation amongst our own staff and freelancers working across the industry.""

"This video can not be played Theresa May on what can be achieved at Salzburg summit Theresa May has said the EU must ""evolve"" its stance on the Irish border as she seeks to persuade fellow leaders about the viability of her Brexit plan. The PM is using a dinner in Salzburg to make the case for her controversial Chequers strategy for future relations. Before the event, she said it was the only credible plan to allay concerns on the Irish border and trade disruption. Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who is hosting the event, said both sides needed to make compromises. 'Multiple chances' for new Brexit vote It's my Brexit deal or no deal, May says Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop The UK and EU both want to avoid a hard border - meaning any physical infrastructure like cameras or guard posts - between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland but can't agree on how. Mrs May has previously rejected the EU's ""backstop"" plan - which involves keeping Northern Ireland aligned with its trading rules - saying it would divide up the UK. Ahead of the Salzburg summit, the EU's negotiator Michel Barnier said most checks could take place away from border areas, an apparent concession to the UK. Addressing reporters as she arrived for dinner in the Austrian city, Mrs May welcomed what she said was the EU's recognition its initial proposal were ""unacceptable"". ""If we're going to achieve a successful conclusion then, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to evolve its position too,"" she said. This video can not be played BBC News NI's political reporter Jayne McCormack explains why the border is an issue After Brexit, the 310 mile border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will become the UK's border with the EU. At the moment, thousands of people cross it every day for both work and pleasure - as do goods, like food and medicines, being delivered across the two countries. As part of the EU single market and customs union, these products do not need to be checked for customs and standards, but when the UK leaves these two arrangements, this all changes. Nobody wants a hard border for the checks - in fact the 1998 Good Friday agreement, which helped bring peace to Northern Ireland, got rid of security checks as part of the deal, and police in Northern Ireland have warned reinstating them could make crossings targets for violence. But there is no agreement between the UK and EU, or between Leavers and Remainers, about the answer. The border between the two countries has hundreds of crossing points Privately, EU officials say those checks could be carried out by British or EU officials, or by health inspectors rather than customs officials, to ""de-dramatise"" the border issue. Mrs May has insisted there needs to be ""friction-free movement of goods"", with no customs or regulatory checks, between Northern Ireland and the Republic, in order to avoid a hard border there. There are just over six months to go before the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. Negotiations are at a critical stage, with both sides hoping for an agreement on the terms of the UK's withdrawal and future trade relations by the start of November at the latest. Please upgrade your browser Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Barnier said the talks were in the ""home straight"" but there were still significant areas of disagreement - such as on the role of the European Court of Justice in enforcing the withdrawal agreement and intellectual property issues, including geographical protections for food and drink. ""October is the key point in time - it is the moment of truth,"" he added. The EU is still insisting on its own ""legally operationally backstop"" - what it describes as an insurance policy to prevent the return of physical infrastructure on the border in the event no other solution can be found. Will summit mark a Brexit turning point? Brexit: All you need to know At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Brussels put forward a proposal in February that would see Northern Ireland stay aligned with the EU in key areas, effectively staying in the customs union and single market and not needing those border checks. But the UK insisted this was unacceptable as it would split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK. On Tuesday Mr Barnier said the backstop should focus on a ""set of technical checks and controls"" to make sure standards are met and customs are paid, and not be about a sea or land border.

""We are ready to improve this proposal,"" he said. ""Work on the EU side is ongoing. We are clarifying which goods arriving in Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK would need to be checked and where, when and by whom these checks could be performed. ""We can also clarify that most checks can take place away from the border at a company premises or at the markets."" BBC Northern Ireland business editor John Campbell said that the fact the EU was prepared to ""improve"" the language of the backstop was not news as it hadbeen talked about before,external- so ""we need to wait and see what any improvements might amount to"". Speaking in Salzburg, Mr Tusk confirmed a special EU summit dedicated to Brexit would take place in mid-November. He welcomed some elements of the Chequers proposals - on security and policing - but said that on the Irish border and economic cooperation they will need to be ""reworked and further negotiated"". It has been reported Mrs May will have ten minutes to update her 27 counterparts At the dinner in Salzburg, Mrs May is expected to appeal for ""goodwill and determination"" from the EU, while stressing that ""no other country"" could accept the EU's backstop plan if they were in the same situation. The UK put forward rival backstop proposals in June, which would see the whole of the UK staying in a customs union with the EU after the end of the proposed Brexit transition period in December 2020. It also says its Chequers blueprint for a future trading relationship - involving a ""common rulebook"" for goods and treating the UK and the EU as a ""combined customs territory"" - would solve the border question. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the EU had to move closer to the UK's position or it would be a ""lose-lose"" for both sides. ""Chequers may not be perfect, but it's the most credible plan,"" he told LBC Radio. ""I think there is an understanding that we're approaching the endpoint of these negotiations, and there will need to be some movement on the EU side."" In an interview with theDaily Express,external, Mrs May said that going back on the 2016 vote to leave the EU would ""destroy trust in politicians"". MPs had decided to give people a vote on EU membership by a large margin, she said: ""People weren't saying it's the choice of the public except if we disagree with the answer we'll ask them again."" The People's Vote campaign wants the final terms of Brexit to be put to a referendum with the option of staying in the EU if it is rejected. ""My answer to the People's Vote is that we've had the people's vote - it was the referendum - and now we should deliver on it,"" the prime minister said. On Tuesday People's Vote set out ways they said a new referendum could be achieved through votes in Parliament.

"This video can not be played North Korea's agreed to shut one of the country's main missile launch sites. Laura Bicker considers what might happen next. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has agreed to shut one of the country's main missile testing and launch sites. He signed a pledge to permanently close the Tongchang-ri facility, after talks in Pyongyang with his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in. Both leaders also ""agreed on a way to achieve denuclearisation"" on the Korean peninsula, Mr Moon said. Mr Kim said he hoped to ""visit Seoul in the near future"" - he would be the first North Korean leader to do so. China has welcomed the outcome of the inter-Korean summit, saying both sides had found ""new and important common ground"". The main focus of the summit was the issue of denuclearisation. While the US and North Korea agreed in broad terms earlier this year to work towards that goal, negotiations have stalled. Pyongyang has now sought to reconfirm its commitment. Mr Kim expressed a readiness to shut down the Yongbyon nuclear facility - where North Korea is believed to have produced the material used in its nuclear tests - if the US took some reciprocal action. The details of that were not specified. Korea summit puts diplomacy back on track Moon: Caught between Trump and Kim North Korea's woeful human rights record North Korea crisis in 300 words But he went further on Tongchang-ri, saying the engine missile testing and launch facility would be permanently closed ""in the presence of experts from relevant nations"". The BBC's Seoul correspondent Laura Bicker said the announcement is a major step forward. Satellite images suggest Tongchang-ri is in the process of being destroyed, she added, but the declaration will allow inspectors to verify the process. Tongchang-ri has been North Korea's main satellite launch facility since 2012, according to monitoring group 38 North. It has also been used for testing engines for North Korean missiles capable of reaching the US.

""The outcome is a big win for Moon Jae-in, who has managed to extract a series of positive headlines from Kim Jong-un related to denuclearisation,"" Ankit Panda, editor of The Diplomat, told the BBC. ""None of the concessions are truly costly to Kim and won't help move North Korea toward short-term disarmament, but provide a further basis for confidence building on which US-North Korea talks can move forward."" The two countries also made advances on inter-Korean ties, announcing plans to link up their railways, allow more reunions for families separated by war and co-operate on health care. Mr Moon invited the North Korean leader to Seoul, suggesting the visit should take place before the end of this year. They will also seek to co-host the 2032 Summer Olympics. This video can not be played How North Korea welcomed the South Korean leader The South's defence minister and the head of the North Korean army also signed an agreement to reduce military tensions, with a buffer zone to be established along the border to prevent accidental clashes. The signing came mid-way through a three-day visit to Pyongyang by Mr Moon. While it is the first trip to the North Korean capital in a decade by a leader from the South, it is Mr Moon's third meeting with Kim Jong-un since their historic summit in April.

""The claimants' lawyer has confirmed to us that this is a purely procedural filing to preserve their clients' rights in relation to the standard three-year limitation period, and that certain claims are not yet ready for settlement due to their complex nature."" He said settlements relied on receiving certain information from claimants, and Merlin had ""provided appropriate support including interim payments while the assessments continue"". Judge Michael Chambers QC said the crash on the Â£18m attraction was a""catastrophic failure and a ""needless and avoidable accident in which those who were injured were lucky not to be killed."" Miss Balch has said shedoes not see the point in being angry about what happened. Lawyers said Meera Chauhan, 52, and her daughter Vanisha Singh, 33, from Walsall, who were also injured in the crash, were preparing their own legal battle.

"People who live in council houses should be made to feel proud of their homes, Theresa May has said. The PM announced Â£2bn to build new homes in England, in an attempt to remove the ""stigma"" of social housing. Under the plan, housing associations, councils and other organisations will be able to bid for the money to spend on new projects, starting from 2022. Labour said the announcement fell ""far short"" of what was needed for the social housing sector. BBC home editor Mark Easton said the government hopes the money will allow local authorities and housing associations to build schemes that would otherwise seem too risky. He said the sector's calls to provide more confidence about future funding - so the 300,000 extra homes required in England each year can be built - had appeared to have been listened to. 'More powers' for social housing tenants 'I've spent 18 years on housing waiting list' No affordable homes? We'll build them ourselves Mrs May told a National Housing Federation summit in London: ""Some residents feel marginalised and overlooked, and are ashamed to share the fact that their home belongs to a housing association or local authority. ""On the outside, many people in society - including too many politicians - continue to look down on social housing and, by extension, the people who call it their home."" She will encourage housing associations to change how tenants and society view social housing. ""We should never see social housing as something that need simply be 'good enough', nor think that the people who live in it should be grateful for their safety net and expect no better,"" she said. ""I want to see social housing that is so good people are proud to call it their home... our friends and neighbours who live in social housing are not second-rate citizens."" In mixed developments, she said it should be impossible to tell the difference between full-price and affordable housing, which should not be ""tucked away out of sight and out of mind"". Theresa May said too many politicians ""look down on social housing"" David Orr, chief executive of the National Housing Federation, said the prime minister's announcement was ""extremely welcome"". ""This represents a total step change. For years, the way that money was allocated meant housing associations couldn't be sure of long-term funding to build much-needed affordable housing,"" he said. He said that by changing the way the funding was allocated, ministers had given ""long-term confidence and confirmed that we are trusted partners in solving the housing crisis, building new homes and communities"". Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, said it was welcome that the government was ""starting to get serious"" about correcting the ""historic failure"" to build social homes. ""This must be the start and not the end,"" she said. Shadow housing secretary John Healey said the reality was spending on new affordable homes had been ""slashed"" and the number of new social rented homes built last year ""fell to the lowest level since records began"". ""If Conservative ministers are serious about fixing the housing crisis they should back Labour's plans to build a million genuinely affordable homes, including the biggest council house-building programme for more than 30 years,"" he said. The English housing survey for 2016/17 reported that 3.9 million households - about nine million people - lived in the social rented sector, which was 17% of households in the country. By Reality Check team While it's estimated that housing associations now build around 17% of homes, many people are on waiting lists for social housing. Over the last 20 years, the number of households in England on local authorities' waiting lists has increased from 1,021,664 to 1,155,285 in 2017. According togovernment figures,external, the number peaked in 2012 at 1,851,426. A study by housing charity Shelterfound that Newham in central London saw the highest demand for social housing in 2017. 588 homes were available for social rent, while over 25,000 households were on the waiting list for these properties. The charity says that longer waiting lists are forcing more people into private rented accommodation. It estimates that over 1.6 million people in England now rely on housing benefit to help with keeping up with rent payments. The funding covers the next spending review period, from 2021 through to 2028. Downing Street said the money was separate to the Â£9bn of public funding put toward the existing affordable homes programme until 2022. 'More powers' for social housing tenants No affordable homes?

"This video can not be played Jack Burn died hours after being born at Princess Royal Hospital in Telford A review into mother and baby deaths and injuries at hospitals in Shropshire is examining more than 100 cases, it is understood. In 2017, Jeremy Hunt ordered aninvestigation into maternity care relating to 23 casesat the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust (SaTH). That figure expanded to 40 but is now thought to include 104 families. Meanwhile, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) has taken urgent action against the maternity department. One mother whose daughter died at the trust said ""it is time to get justice"". The trust said it ""continues to engage fully"" with health watchdog the CQC ""during our current, ongoing inspection"". Latest news and updates from Midlands Live Tasha Turner and partner Jacob's baby Esmai died in 2013 at Royal Shrewsbury Hospital A specialist team led by Donna Ockenden is looking into the allegations that some babies born at the trust between 2000 and 2017 suffered avoidable harm due to errors by maternity staff. In August a spokesperson for NHS Improvement said it had agreed ""to consider additional historical investigations where women, infants and new-born babies had died or suffered harm"". At the time the trust said these were cases which were already in the public domain, but the BBC understands at least 104 families have now come forward wanting their cases to be considered. Dr Kathy McLean, Executive Medical Director and Chief Operating Officer of NHS Improvement, said: ""At this stage, we are unable to confirm how many historical cases will be considered under our independent review. ""We are examining in detail anything that may be relevant, ensuring that possible duplication is taken into account. ""Also, it is important that in any historical investigations that we consider, appropriate consent from the family members is obtained in advance."" Mother and baby deaths review widened Further review into maternity care Cluster of baby deaths probe ordered Professor Ted Baker, CQC's Chief Inspector of Hospitals, confirmed it is taking further enforcement action against SaTH. It followsan inspection last month, which highlighted safety fears""within the trust's maternity services"", Prof Baker said. ""This action is subject to a period of appeal and we will provide further information when the legal process allows."" A spokesman for SaTH said: ""In line with normal CQC processes, we will be making representations to them in respect of this matter within the permitted 28 day timeframe."" In 2013 Tasha Turner's first child Esmai was born by Caesarean section at 36 weeks at Royal Shrewsbury Hospital. Ms Turner, 25, said she was assured there was no cause for concern and her daughter was soon drinking her breast milk with the aid of a tube. But when she went to check on Esmai the following morning, she was on life support. Ms Turner said she was told Esmai had lactic acidosis, a build up of lactic acid in her body, and after four days Ms Turner and partner Jacob were advised to remove life support. The couple said when they asked what led to their daughter's death they were told by the hospital ""it happens"". Baby Esmai spent four days on life support The couple have since had two more children but said they are determined to know what happened to Esmai. ""I have so many questions,"" said Tasha. ""How was I told when she was born that she was fine, and then she dies four days later? I've looked up the condition she had - no way should it kill someone."" Deirdre Fowler, Director of Nursing, Midwifery and Quality at SaTH said: ""We recognise that, taken in isolation, the number of cases which are being considered may cause concern or anxiety for families currently using our services.

"This video can not be played ""If you carry a knife, you intend to use it"" London's violent crime is to be treated as a public health issue, the city's mayor has said. The capital saw its100th homicide so far this yearon Tuesday. Sadiq Khan said a Violence Reduction Unit would mirror the approach taken in Glasgow, where violence is treated as ""a disease infecting communities"". However, Steve O'Connell, the chairman of the London Assembly Police and Crime Committee, said there was a ""worrying lack of detail"" about the plan. A third of London's homicide victims in 2018 have been aged 16 to 24, and three in five of the deaths have involved knife attacks. There were 116 killings in the city in 2017. The mayor said the unit, which has been given Â£500,000 funding, would focus on ""early interventions"" involving schools, healthcare professionals, councils and the police. Scotland's public health approach to knife crime has caught the eye of Sadiq Khan and the Met's commissioner Cressida Dick He said the unit would work to divert young people away from crime by tackling ""deep-seated societal problems"" including poverty, alienation and mental health. Previous research has shown young violent criminals have often been excluded from school or exposed to domestic violence as a child. Mr Khan said: ""The causes of violent crime are many years in the making and the solutions will take time. That's why our new approach is focusing over the long term. ""This unit is not a substitute for the investment our public services need if London is to significantly cut levels of violent crime."" The mayor's schemeechoes an approach successfully used in Scotland, which sees police work with teachers, social workers and health professionals. Between them, they share knowledge and make lists of criminals and those at risk of offending. These people are offered jobs, housing, training and mentoring, in an effort to steer them away from violent crime. The mayor's office said it would be working on the exact details of its violence reduction unit over the ""coming months"". Mr O'Connell, chairman of the London Assembly Police and Crime Committee, said: ""Whilst we welcome this initiative it has been a long time coming. ""However, there is a worrying lack of detail as to how this unit will operate across such a vast area as the whole of London. ""We will be keeping a close eye on whether this new plan has an impact on the ground and does not end up a missed opportunity."" The Scottish Violence Reduction Unit (SVRU) was set up in 2005 and was inspired by a pioneering approach taken in Chicago in the 1990s, which treated violence in the same way as epidemics such as Aids. Niven Rennie, director of the SVRU, said staff were ""happy to support London in the development"" of its own unit. ""The SVRU started by treating violence as a disease which was infecting our communities,"" he said. ""From teachers and social workers, to doctors and dentists, police and government we have all worked together to make Scotland safer. ""The job isn't done and every single life lost is a tragedy, but... Scotland has shown that change is possible and we believe London can do the same."" The Met Police has also boosted theViolent Crime Taskforcetemporarily with an extra 122 officers drafted into work this week. The manpower was taken from the Met's traffic unit, and the taskforce will have 272 officers for the next three months.

"The UK inflation rate unexpectedly rose in August to 2.7%, the highest level in six months. Economists had expected a Consumer Prices Index rate of 2.4%. The pound rose after the data was released by the Office for National Statistics. Wages are still rising more than inflation, with data last week showing wages, excluding bonuses,grew by 2.9%in the three months to July. Rising prices for recreational goods, transport and clothing drove the rise. In July, CPI was 2.5%,, which had been the first jump in the index since November. Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: ""Consumers paid more for theatre shows, sea fares and new season autumn clothing last month. ""However, mobile phone charges, and furniture and household goods had a downward effect on inflation."" Bank of England raises UK interest rates Season tickets: 2019 annual rail fares could be more than Â£100 higher Prices rose less sharply for furniture, household goods and communications. The year-on-year rise in CPI in August meant that inflation was narrowing the gap with wage increases, with economists waiting for the August earnings figures. Alastair Neame, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: ""Today's inflation data show the rate of price growth accelerated in August, and may well prove to have exceeded total earnings growth in the same period. Unless UK workers can increase their productivity, this trend is likely to continue - squeezing living standards over the medium term."" The pound rose to $1.32 following the news, its highest level since July, beforefalling back under $1.3140following comments by Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, over the Irish border question. ""The numbers reinforce expectations that policymakers will gently lift interest rates over the next couple of years,"" said Ben Brettell at Hargreaves Lansdown. The Bank of England raised its key interest rate for only the second time in a decade last month. The current interest rate of 0.75% is the highest since March 2009. It has also forecast that inflation will fall back to the target rate of 2% by 2020. ""The figures won't come as welcome news to the Bank of England, though - they'll be desperate to leave policy unchanged until we get some clarity over Brexit and won't want to be forced into a rate rise by accelerating prices,"" said Mr Brettell. The CPI measure reached 3.1% in November 2017, when price rises were fuelled by the weakness in the pound following Brexit vote. In August, the largest change in prices was in the cultural services sector, where theatre tickets rose, and also games, toys and hobbies, while prices for computer goods rose after falling a year ago. The ONS said transport costs as a component of inflation increased, largely because of rises in sea and air fares. Petrol prices, though, rose by 1.4 pence between July and August, less than the 1.8 pence rise of a year earlier. The average price of clothing and footwear rose 3.1% between July and August, faster than the 2.4% a year before. While clothing prices usually rise between July and August, the ONS said women's and children's clothing drove the rise. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the fact that the inflation rise was fuelled by reaction and cultural goods meant it would be temporary: ""We would expect this to unwind in next month's release."" The Retail Prices Index (RPI), a separate measure of inflation, was 3.5% in August, up from 3.2% in July.

"This video can not be played North Korea's agreed to shut one of the country's main missile launch sites. Laura Bicker considers what might happen next. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has agreed to shut one of the country's main missile testing and launch sites. He signed a pledge to permanently close the Tongchang-ri facility, after talks in Pyongyang with his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in. Both leaders also ""agreed on a way to achieve denuclearisation"" on the Korean peninsula, Mr Moon said. Mr Kim said he hoped to ""visit Seoul in the near future"" - he would be the first North Korean leader to do so. China has welcomed the outcome of the inter-Korean summit, saying both sides had found ""new and important common ground"". The main focus of the summit was the issue of denuclearisation. While the US and North Korea agreed in broad terms earlier this year to work towards that goal, negotiations have stalled. Pyongyang has now sought to reconfirm its commitment. Mr Kim expressed a readiness to shut down the Yongbyon nuclear facility - where North Korea is believed to have produced the material used in its nuclear tests - if the US took some reciprocal action. The details of that were not specified. Korea summit puts diplomacy back on track Moon: Caught between Trump and Kim North Korea's woeful human rights record North Korea crisis in 300 words But he went further on Tongchang-ri, saying the engine missile testing and launch facility would be permanently closed ""in the presence of experts from relevant nations"". The BBC's Seoul correspondent Laura Bicker said the announcement is a major step forward. Satellite images suggest Tongchang-ri is in the process of being destroyed, she added, but the declaration will allow inspectors to verify the process. Tongchang-ri has been North Korea's main satellite launch facility since 2012, according to monitoring group 38 North. It has also been used for testing engines for North Korean missiles capable of reaching the US.

""The outcome is a big win for Moon Jae-in, who has managed to extract a series of positive headlines from Kim Jong-un related to denuclearisation,"" Ankit Panda, editor of The Diplomat, told the BBC. ""None of the concessions are truly costly to Kim and won't help move North Korea toward short-term disarmament, but provide a further basis for confidence building on which US-North Korea talks can move forward."" The two countries also made advances on inter-Korean ties, announcing plans to link up their railways, allow more reunions for families separated by war and co-operate on health care. Mr Moon invited the North Korean leader to Seoul, suggesting the visit should take place before the end of this year. They will also seek to co-host the 2032 Summer Olympics.

The signing came mid-way through a three-day visit to Pyongyang by Mr Moon.

"Eirian Hill suffered serious burns in an accident - which made dad Craig rethink his priorities ""Her dress just went up like it was dipped in paraffin."" It was the horrific moment that two-year-old Eirian fell into a fire - and changed the way her father Craig Hill thought about his own life for good. The dad-of-three from Cardiff gave up his job as a teacher and started a carpentry business out of his garage, so he could spend more time with his family. The move has just won him a Â£50,000 investment on TV's Dragons' Den. ""I became very aware I was spending less and less time with my own children,"" explained Mr Hill, 39. ""I was putting a lot of time and effort into teaching, staying behind and doing clubs, with other people's children."" Then came the accident. This video can not be played Daughter's fire fall led dad to Dragon's Den win Eirian was prone to drop fits - a precursor to epilepsy where she would fall to the ground. On this occasion, she was standing by the fireplace in the family home. ""She lost consciousness. I saw her eyes glaze over and she fell backwards,"" said Mr Hill. ""I saw my daughter but I also saw six-foot flames."" Eirian was rushed to hospital for treatment and has had to have repeated skin grafts to treat her burns. ""My priorities changed,"" said Eirian's father, who sustained burns himself as he ripped his daughter's flaming clothes from her back. Child's cerebral palsy book to help others understand her life Vinyl records, music and Dragons' Den As time went on and Eirian's wounds healed, Mr Hill became more and more disillusioned with his job. Then over one summer holiday he did some decking woodwork for a neighbour, which prompted another person to ask him to do work for them. A business was born. Craig Hill with one of his outdoor kitchens, which he says are built to last He decided to leave teaching, saying: ""When I started the carpentry, it was like someone pressed the reset switch. ""Looking back, I was suffering anxiety and depression but when I was working and on the job, my worries went to the back of my mind."" Cooking helped chef Carluccio with depression battle Mr Hill took a course and initially took up domestic carpentry but got fed up with just working to make money. ""I'd spent 13 years being a teacher and helping children to develop. I ended up doing a mud kitchen for a friend who had told me that her school was looking to develop the outdoor space but there was no funding available and no resources affordable. ""She told me they enjoyed this indoor kitchen and something similar outside would be beneficial. ""I did a bit of research online and built these mud kitchens which help develop fine and gross motor skills; there's numeracy skills involved in it. ""With a construction background we ensure everything we make is really robust and built to last."" He said his company, Landscapes for Learning, worked with schools to make sure the products they produced were ""meaningful and purposeful and will benefit the children within the school"". The kitchens tap into a growing trend for outdoor education TheDragon's Denconnection came after a middle of the night application to the entrepreneurial BBC programme, which got an immediate response and a screen test for Mr Hill. ""The next thing you know, I'm standing in front of five people being filmed for a television programme and they seemed to like what they heard. I was really grateful for that,"" he said. The experience was ""properly scary"". ""I was trying to get them to invest in an ethos, my vision if you like. ""Sandpits have been around for hundreds of years; I wasn't doing anything new, but my take on it, my version of it and linking it to the curriculum was ahead of just trying to sell them something."" He said as well as lots of communication about the business following Dragon's Den, the company had also been contacted by people suffering depression who had been prompted by his story to talk to someone about their own issues. Wrexham schoolgirl stars in Chinese version of Robot Wars The radio 'saved my little girl's life' Dragon Peter Jones, who backed the company for a 30% stake for his Â£50,000 investment, said: ""Getting children outside to continue their learning is vital and is rightly being emphasised in the curriculum. ""I know my own children would have loved Craig's products when they were younger and I recognised that, as well as his passion and determination, immediately. ""I want to help Craig make this type of learning accessible for everyone because ultimately if our children benefit, so do we all.""

"This video can not be played ""If you carry a knife, you intend to use it"" London's violent crime is to be treated as a public health issue, the city's mayor has said. The capital saw its100th homicide so far this yearon Tuesday. Sadiq Khan said a Violence Reduction Unit would mirror the approach taken in Glasgow, where violence is treated as ""a disease infecting communities"". However, Steve O'Connell, the chairman of the London Assembly Police and Crime Committee, said there was a ""worrying lack of detail"" about the plan. A third of London's homicide victims in 2018 have been aged 16 to 24, and three in five of the deaths have involved knife attacks. There were 116 killings in the city in 2017. The mayor said the unit, which has been given Â£500,000 funding, would focus on ""early interventions"" involving schools, healthcare professionals, councils and the police. Scotland's public health approach to knife crime has caught the eye of Sadiq Khan and the Met's commissioner Cressida Dick He said the unit would work to divert young people away from crime by tackling ""deep-seated societal problems"" including poverty, alienation and mental health. Previous research has shown young violent criminals have often been excluded from school or exposed to domestic violence as a child. Mr Khan said: ""The causes of violent crime are many years in the making and the solutions will take time. That's why our new approach is focusing over the long term. ""This unit is not a substitute for the investment our public services need if London is to significantly cut levels of violent crime."" The mayor's schemeechoes an approach successfully used in Scotland, which sees police work with teachers, social workers and health professionals. Between them, they share knowledge and make lists of criminals and those at risk of offending. These people are offered jobs, housing, training and mentoring, in an effort to steer them away from violent crime. The mayor's office said it would be working on the exact details of its violence reduction unit over the ""coming months"". Mr O'Connell, chairman of the London Assembly Police and Crime Committee, said: ""Whilst we welcome this initiative it has been a long time coming. ""However, there is a worrying lack of detail as to how this unit will operate across such a vast area as the whole of London. ""We will be keeping a close eye on whether this new plan has an impact on the ground and does not end up a missed opportunity."" The Scottish Violence Reduction Unit (SVRU) was set up in 2005 and was inspired by a pioneering approach taken in Chicago in the 1990s, which treated violence in the same way as epidemics such as Aids. Niven Rennie, director of the SVRU, said staff were ""happy to support London in the development"" of its own unit. ""The SVRU started by treating violence as a disease which was infecting our communities,"" he said. ""From teachers and social workers, to doctors and dentists, police and government we have all worked together to make Scotland safer. ""The job isn't done and every single life lost is a tragedy, but... Scotland has shown that change is possible and we believe London can do the same."" The Met Police has also boosted theViolent Crime Taskforcetemporarily with an extra 122 officers drafted into work this week. The manpower was taken from the Met's traffic unit, and the taskforce will have 272 officers for the next three months.

"This video can not be played North Korea's agreed to shut one of the country's main missile launch sites. Laura Bicker considers what might happen next. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has agreed to shut one of the country's main missile testing and launch sites. He signed a pledge to permanently close the Tongchang-ri facility, after talks in Pyongyang with his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in. Both leaders also ""agreed on a way to achieve denuclearisation"" on the Korean peninsula, Mr Moon said. Mr Kim said he hoped to ""visit Seoul in the near future"" - he would be the first North Korean leader to do so. China has welcomed the outcome of the inter-Korean summit, saying both sides had found ""new and important common ground"". The main focus of the summit was the issue of denuclearisation. While the US and North Korea agreed in broad terms earlier this year to work towards that goal, negotiations have stalled. Pyongyang has now sought to reconfirm its commitment. Mr Kim expressed a readiness to shut down the Yongbyon nuclear facility - where North Korea is believed to have produced the material used in its nuclear tests - if the US took some reciprocal action. The details of that were not specified. Korea summit puts diplomacy back on track Moon: Caught between Trump and Kim North Korea's woeful human rights record North Korea crisis in 300 words But he went further on Tongchang-ri, saying the engine missile testing and launch facility would be permanently closed ""in the presence of experts from relevant nations"". The BBC's Seoul correspondent Laura Bicker said the announcement is a major step forward. Satellite images suggest Tongchang-ri is in the process of being destroyed, she added, but the declaration will allow inspectors to verify the process. Tongchang-ri has been North Korea's main satellite launch facility since 2012, according to monitoring group 38 North. It has also been used for testing engines for North Korean missiles capable of reaching the US.

""The outcome is a big win for Moon Jae-in, who has managed to extract a series of positive headlines from Kim Jong-un related to denuclearisation,"" Ankit Panda, editor of The Diplomat, told the BBC. ""None of the concessions are truly costly to Kim and won't help move North Korea toward short-term disarmament, but provide a further basis for confidence building on which US-North Korea talks can move forward."" The two countries also made advances on inter-Korean ties, announcing plans to link up their railways, allow more reunions for families separated by war and co-operate on health care. Mr Moon invited the North Korean leader to Seoul, suggesting the visit should take place before the end of this year. They will also seek to co-host the 2032 Summer Olympics. This video can not be played How North Korea welcomed the South Korean leader The South's defence minister and the head of the North Korean army also signed an agreement to reduce military tensions, with a buffer zone to be established along the border to prevent accidental clashes. The signing came mid-way through a three-day visit to Pyongyang by Mr Moon. While it is the first trip to the North Korean capital in a decade by a leader from the South, it is Mr Moon's third meeting with Kim Jong-un since their historic summit in April. Sanitizers, salutes and other Korea summit moments Kim Jong-un: King of Pyongyang Will historic Koreas summit lead to peace? Efforts towards denuclearisation between the North and the US had recently hit a deadlock and this week's Pyongyang summit will bolster the South's role as a mediator.

"This video can not be played CCTV shows a car driving towards the Islamic Centre Three men were hurt when a car struck several people outside a north London Islamic centre. Witnesses described hearing the driver ""shouting anti-Islamic taunts"" at the Muslim prayer centre in Cricklewood. The Met Police said it was being dealt with as an Islamophobic hate crime but is not thought to be terrorist-related. The driver of the car failed to stop and two men were taken to hospital following the incident at about 00:35 BST. It happened at the Al-majlis Al-Hussaini centre at the junction of Oxgate Lane and Edgware Road. One witness said the driver ""was trying to kill people"". Ali Salman said he was ""milliseconds"" from injury as the car swerved into groups of people leaving the Islamic centre following a lecture. ""This was someone who was trying to take out as many people as possible. He swerved left right trying to hit people,"" he added. A man in his 50s remains in hospital and is being treated for a serious leg injury. Two other men, both in their 20s, suffered minor injuries. Ch Supt Simon Rose (left) said it was ""extremely fortunate"" that no-one was killed Before the attack a group of three men and a woman in their mid 20s were asked to leave a private car park at the premises by volunteer stewards, police said. The group had allegedly been behaving anti-socially, drinking and using drugs. Speaking at the scene, Ch Supt Simon Rose said when the stewards challenged the group, ""they were subjected to a tirade of Islamophobic and racist abuse"". The car then drove near the mosque and the group were involved in a confrontation with a large number of people outside. Their car was then reportedly damaged by some of the crowd before it sped off, colliding with three people. The collision happened outside the Al-majlis Al-Hussaini Islamic centre Ch Supt Rose said it was ""extremely fortunate"" that no-one was killed. ""It is being dealt with as an Islamophobic hate crime and it is being dealt with as a racist hate crime,"" he added. ""It is not at this time being dealt with as a counter-terrorism incident, as always subject to continuous review."" A spokesman for the Hussaini Association, which had been holding a series of lectures at the Islamic centre, said: ""We are in deep shock at such an attack taking place on our community. ""We remain proud to live in a diverse and tolerant society and as such we remain unintimidated."" Police officers remained at the Islamic centre on Wednesday Dawn Butler, MP for Brent Central,tweeted,external: ""This is a very sad and tragic event. There is no room for hate. ""Brent is the most diverse constituency in the UK and our diversity is our strength."" The Met has urged anyone with information to come forward and said inquiries are under way to trace the car. Det Sgt Kelly Schonhage said: ""Extra neighbourhood police patrols have been stepped up in the area and officers will be on hand to speak with those in the local community.""

"About four million people have been charged for mobile phones they already own, spending Â£500m extra on contracts, according to Citizens Advice. Three of Britain's biggest mobile networks, EE, Three and Vodafone, continue to charge for handsets even after the cost has been paid off. Many customers have no idea they are being charged for phones after their contracts have ended. The practice is ""unacceptable"", said Citizens Advice boss Gillian Guy. ""We need action,"" she said. ""Other companies have already stopped doing this so we're looking for these three major providers to follow suit."" Mobile users only need to continue paying for calls, texts and data, or ""airtime"", when contracts end - but millions get stung with unnecessary extra charges. Citizens Advice's research found that on average customers are overcharged Â£22 a month. The figure could be as high as Â£38 for high-end devices such as an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy. Vulnerable people are most at risk of being overcharged. Older people are twice as likely to be charged for a phone they already own longer than 12 months, which could cost them an average of Â£264. ""Consumers should check their phone bills to see if they can save money with a SIM-only contract or upgrade to a new phone,"" advised Ms Guy. Anyone who bought a contract from Three, Vodafone or EE that included a handset is being overcharged when their contract ends Users can ask their network to switch them to a cheaper SIM-only deal, or end the contract and move to another provider No-one is automatically entitled to compensation - consumers can only make a claim if it was not made clear in their contract that the deal would continue at the same price Source: Citizens Advice Regulator Ofcom is consulting on how to address the problem and has proposed sending a single notification to customers before their contract ends. Citizens Advice said that does not go far enough and that phone companies should separate the cost of mobile service and the phone. O2 has split the cost of its airtime and handset since 2013. Nina Bibby, chief marketing officer for O2, said: ""Charging for phones that have already been paid off does nothing but damage customer trust and the reputation of the industry."" EE said the splitting idea is ""overly simplistic and doesn't give the customers either the transparency or best deal that they deserve"". ""We agree that customers shouldn't overpay, but we believe that this is best achieved through clear communications with consumers about their options,"" it said. EE sends alerts before the end of customers' contracts that explain their options. Three said: ""We make the length of any contract very clear to new customers and make this information available through our customer service channels at all times."" It said it was working closely on the issue of handset financing with the government and regulators. Vodafone said: ""We already contact all of our customers when they are approaching the end of their minimum term to let them know their options. These include upgrading their handset or moving to a SIM-only contract so they are not paying anything for a handset."" It added that from next month, it will give extra data to people who do not opt for either option but stay on their contract after the end of their minimum term.

"This video can not be played ""If you carry a knife, you intend to use it"" London's violent crime is to be treated as a public health issue, the city's mayor has said. The capital saw its100th homicide so far this yearon Tuesday. Sadiq Khan said a Violence Reduction Unit would mirror the approach taken in Glasgow, where violence is treated as ""a disease infecting communities"". However, Steve O'Connell, the chairman of the London Assembly Police and Crime Committee, said there was a ""worrying lack of detail"" about the plan. A third of London's homicide victims in 2018 have been aged 16 to 24, and three in five of the deaths have involved knife attacks. There were 116 killings in the city in 2017. The mayor said the unit, which has been given Â£500,000 funding, would focus on ""early interventions"" involving schools, healthcare professionals, councils and the police. Scotland's public health approach to knife crime has caught the eye of Sadiq Khan and the Met's commissioner Cressida Dick He said the unit would work to divert young people away from crime by tackling ""deep-seated societal problems"" including poverty, alienation and mental health. Previous research has shown young violent criminals have often been excluded from school or exposed to domestic violence as a child. Mr Khan said: ""The causes of violent crime are many years in the making and the solutions will take time. That's why our new approach is focusing over the long term. ""This unit is not a substitute for the investment our public services need if London is to significantly cut levels of violent crime."" The mayor's schemeechoes an approach successfully used in Scotland, which sees police work with teachers, social workers and health professionals. Between them, they share knowledge and make lists of criminals and those at risk of offending. These people are offered jobs, housing, training and mentoring, in an effort to steer them away from violent crime. The mayor's office said it would be working on the exact details of its violence reduction unit over the ""coming months"". Mr O'Connell, chairman of the London Assembly Police and Crime Committee, said: ""Whilst we welcome this initiative it has been a long time coming. ""However, there is a worrying lack of detail as to how this unit will operate across such a vast area as the whole of London. ""We will be keeping a close eye on whether this new plan has an impact on the ground and does not end up a missed opportunity."" The Scottish Violence Reduction Unit (SVRU) was set up in 2005 and was inspired by a pioneering approach taken in Chicago in the 1990s, which treated violence in the same way as epidemics such as Aids. Niven Rennie, director of the SVRU, said staff were ""happy to support London in the development"" of its own unit. ""The SVRU started by treating violence as a disease which was infecting our communities,"" he said. ""From teachers and social workers, to doctors and dentists, police and government we have all worked together to make Scotland safer. ""The job isn't done and every single life lost is a tragedy, but... Scotland has shown that change is possible and we believe London can do the same."" The Met Police has also boosted theViolent Crime Taskforcetemporarily with an extra 122 officers drafted into work this week.

"Many yoghurts are full of sugar and the public should not be lulled into thinking they are eating healthy products, researchers say. The conclusion comes after a study of almost 900 yoghurts on sale in UK supermarkets. The Leeds University-led research found that organic yoghurts were among the most sugary types - containing more sugar per 100g than cola. Only natural and Greek-style yoghurts could be classed as low in sugar. The study - published in BMJ Open - comes as government health officials are encouraging manufacturers to reduce the amount of sugar consumed by the public. Yoghurts have been identified as one of the food types on which Public Health England wants to see progress. This research was undertaken shortly after the launch of the sugar-reduction programme. Unsurprisingly, yoghurt desserts contained the most sugar - an average of 16.4g per 100g. This category also included some products that did not contain yoghurt, such as chocolate mousse and creme caramel. The second most sugary product was organic yoghurts with a typical 13.1g per 100g. Children's yoghurts typically contained 10.8g per 100g, the equivalent of more than two sugar cubes, the study found. By comparison a 100g serving of a typical cola contains 9g of sugar. The NHS recommends that children aged four to six have no more than 19g of sugar, or five sugar cubes a day, and it is advised that those aged seven to 10 consume less than 24g daily. To be classed as low sugar there needs to be no more than 5g per 100g. Only 9% of products surveyed were below this threshold. Desserts - 16.4g per 100g Organic - 13.1g per 100g Flavoured - 12g per 100g Fruit - 11.9g per 100g Children's - 10.8g per 100g Dairy alternatives - 9.2g per 100g Drinks - 9.1g per 100g Natural and Greek - 5g per 100g Since the fieldwork for the study was carried out - at the end of 2016 - progress has been made on reducing sugar consumption from yoghurts. A report published in May showed sugar content in yoghurts had been reduced by 6% in the first year, making it the only food category to exceed the 5% target. By 2020, it is expected sugar will be reduced by 20%. PHE chief nutritionist Dr Alison Tedstone said this showed ""positive steps"" were being made. But Dr Bernadette Moore, lead researcher of this study, said: ""Even if we take the reduction into account, most of these yoghurts will still not be low in sugar. ""I think people, including parents, will be surprised to know just how much sugar there is in yoghurt. ""My advice would be to buy natural yoghurt and mix in your own fruit.""

"Eirian Hill suffered serious burns in an accident - which made dad Craig rethink his priorities ""Her dress just went up like it was dipped in paraffin."" It was the horrific moment that two-year-old Eirian fell into a fire - and changed the way her father Craig Hill thought about his own life for good. The dad-of-three from Cardiff gave up his job as a teacher and started a carpentry business out of his garage, so he could spend more time with his family. The move has just won him a Â£50,000 investment on TV's Dragons' Den. ""I became very aware I was spending less and less time with my own children,"" explained Mr Hill, 39. ""I was putting a lot of time and effort into teaching, staying behind and doing clubs, with other people's children."" Then came the accident. This video can not be played Daughter's fire fall led dad to Dragon's Den win Eirian was prone to drop fits - a precursor to epilepsy where she would fall to the ground. On this occasion, she was standing by the fireplace in the family home. ""She lost consciousness. I saw her eyes glaze over and she fell backwards,"" said Mr Hill. ""I saw my daughter but I also saw six-foot flames."" Eirian was rushed to hospital for treatment and has had to have repeated skin grafts to treat her burns. ""My priorities changed,"" said Eirian's father, who sustained burns himself as he ripped his daughter's flaming clothes from her back. Child's cerebral palsy book to help others understand her life Vinyl records, music and Dragons' Den As time went on and Eirian's wounds healed, Mr Hill became more and more disillusioned with his job. Then over one summer holiday he did some decking woodwork for a neighbour, which prompted another person to ask him to do work for them. A business was born. Craig Hill with one of his outdoor kitchens, which he says are built to last He decided to leave teaching, saying: ""When I started the carpentry, it was like someone pressed the reset switch. ""Looking back, I was suffering anxiety and depression but when I was working and on the job, my worries went to the back of my mind."" Cooking helped chef Carluccio with depression battle Mr Hill took a course and initially took up domestic carpentry but got fed up with just working to make money. ""I'd spent 13 years being a teacher and helping children to develop. I ended up doing a mud kitchen for a friend who had told me that her school was looking to develop the outdoor space but there was no funding available and no resources affordable. ""She told me they enjoyed this indoor kitchen and something similar outside would be beneficial. ""I did a bit of research online and built these mud kitchens which help develop fine and gross motor skills; there's numeracy skills involved in it. ""With a construction background we ensure everything we make is really robust and built to last.""

"Cerissa Riley and Grant Robicheaux may have met victims at music festivals, prosecutors say A California surgeon and his girlfriend have been charged with two sexual assaults, and investigators suspect there could be ""hundreds"" more victims. Grant William Robicheaux, 38, and Cerissa Laura Riley, 31, allegedly attacked two women they met at a bar and a restaurant in 2016. Prosecutors told the BBC ""thousands and thousands"" of videos of potential victims were on the defendants' phones. Investigators are trying to identify the women in the clips. At a news conference on Tuesday, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said the pair were suspected of using their ""clean-cut"" looks to lure targets into a false sense of security. ""We believe the defendants used their good looks and charms to lower the inhibitions of their potential prey,"" he said,reports KTLA-TV,external. Grant Robicheaux once appeared on reality TV show Online Dating Rituals of the American Male He added: ""There are several videos where the women in the videos appear to be highly intoxicated beyond the ability to consent or resist and they are barely responsive to the defendants' sexual advances. ""Based on this evidence we believe there might be many unidentified victims out there."" Mr Robicheaux is an orthopaedic surgeon from Newport Beach, 45 miles (72km) south of Los Angeles. He once appeared on the Bravo cable network's reality TV show Online Dating Rituals of the American Male. Investigators say the pair worked ""in tandem"" to meet women at bars, drug them or coerce them to drink large amounts of alcohol, and then bring them back to Mr Robicheaux's apartment to be assaulted. Two women have alleged encounters with Mr Robicheaux and Ms Riley two years ago. The first said she met the pair at a restaurant on 10 April 2016 and was invited by them to a boat party. The couple are also accused of drug and weapons offences Once intoxicated, the 32-year-old was allegedly taken back to Mr Robicheaux's apartment and raped. She contacted Newport Beach police the following day and tested positive for a number of unspecified drugs, the prosecutor said. Both defendants are accused of rape by use of drugs in that case. On 2 October 2016, another woman said she woke up in Mr Robicheaux's apartment after a night of drinking, and screamed for help until his neighbours called police. That woman told police she had been drinking at a bar in Newport Beach with the couple until she lost consciousness. Both defendants are accused of sexual assault with intent to commit rape in that case. Mr Robicheaux and Ms Riley are accused of possessing the date-rape drug GHB Investigators say they have recovered video of one of the two women being assaulted. Mr Robicheaux and Ms Riley are accused of possessing a large quantity of drugs, including GHB (considered a date-rape drug), psychedelic mushrooms, ecstasy and cocaine. Police said the illegal substances were found during a search of the surgeon's home in January 2018. Mr Robicheaux is further accused of possessing two unregistered semi-automatic rifles, four other firearms and magazines capable of carrying large amounts of ammunition,according to a press release,external. Newport Beach police passed the case for review to the Orange County district attorney on 6 September, and the couple were arrested at the man's home last Wednesday. The district attorney said the state's medical board has opened an investigation into Mr Robicheaux, but there is no evidence so far that any of his patients could be victims. Officials say the couple have attended music and art festivals such as Burning Man in Nevada and the Splash House Festival in Palm Springs, California. Both of the accused have been freed on $100,000 (Â£76,000) bail bonds. ""We've all heard of a wolf in sheep's clothing,"" said the district attorney. ""Well, a wolf can wear scrubs or doctor's clothing. Or a wolf can be a beautiful woman."" If convicted, Mr Robicheaux and Ms Riley could spend 40 years and 30 years in prison respectively, said the prosecutor. Mr Rackauckas added: ""People often assume that rapists are creepy, scary men who lunge out from hiding amongst bushes and attack unsuspecting women. ""The reality is that rapists come in all socioeconomic groups, of any background."" The pair are due to be formally charged in court on 24 October.

"This video can not be played CCTV shows a car driving towards the Islamic Centre Three men were hurt when a car struck several people outside a north London Islamic centre. Witnesses described hearing the driver ""shouting anti-Islamic taunts"" at the Muslim prayer centre in Cricklewood. The Met Police said it was being dealt with as an Islamophobic hate crime but is not thought to be terrorist-related. The driver of the car failed to stop and two men were taken to hospital following the incident at about 00:35 BST. It happened at the Al-majlis Al-Hussaini centre at the junction of Oxgate Lane and Edgware Road. One witness said the driver ""was trying to kill people"". Ali Salman said he was ""milliseconds"" from injury as the car swerved into groups of people leaving the Islamic centre following a lecture. ""This was someone who was trying to take out as many people as possible. He swerved left right trying to hit people,"" he added. A man in his 50s remains in hospital and is being treated for a serious leg injury. Two other men, both in their 20s, suffered minor injuries. Ch Supt Simon Rose (left) said it was ""extremely fortunate"" that no-one was killed Before the attack a group of three men and a woman in their mid 20s were asked to leave a private car park at the premises by volunteer stewards, police said. The group had allegedly been behaving anti-socially, drinking and using drugs. Speaking at the scene, Ch Supt Simon Rose said when the stewards challenged the group, ""they were subjected to a tirade of Islamophobic and racist abuse"". The car then drove near the mosque and the group were involved in a confrontation with a large number of people outside. Their car was then reportedly damaged by some of the crowd before it sped off, colliding with three people. The collision happened outside the Al-majlis Al-Hussaini Islamic centre Ch Supt Rose said it was ""extremely fortunate"" that no-one was killed. ""It is being dealt with as an Islamophobic hate crime and it is being dealt with as a racist hate crime,"" he added. ""It is not at this time being dealt with as a counter-terrorism incident, as always subject to continuous review."" A spokesman for the Hussaini Association, which had been holding a series of lectures at the Islamic centre, said: ""We are in deep shock at such an attack taking place on our community. ""We remain proud to live in a diverse and tolerant society and as such we remain unintimidated."" Police officers remained at the Islamic centre on Wednesday Dawn Butler, MP for Brent Central,tweeted,external: ""This is a very sad and tragic event. There is no room for hate. ""Brent is the most diverse constituency in the UK and our diversity is our strength."" The Met has urged anyone with information to come forward and said inquiries are under way to trace the car.

"Eirian Hill suffered serious burns in an accident - which made dad Craig rethink his priorities ""Her dress just went up like it was dipped in paraffin."" It was the horrific moment that two-year-old Eirian fell into a fire - and changed the way her father Craig Hill thought about his own life for good. The dad-of-three from Cardiff gave up his job as a teacher and started a carpentry business out of his garage, so he could spend more time with his family. The move has just won him a Â£50,000 investment on TV's Dragons' Den. ""I became very aware I was spending less and less time with my own children,"" explained Mr Hill, 39. ""I was putting a lot of time and effort into teaching, staying behind and doing clubs, with other people's children."" Then came the accident. This video can not be played Daughter's fire fall led dad to Dragon's Den win Eirian was prone to drop fits - a precursor to epilepsy where she would fall to the ground. On this occasion, she was standing by the fireplace in the family home. ""She lost consciousness. I saw her eyes glaze over and she fell backwards,"" said Mr Hill. ""I saw my daughter but I also saw six-foot flames."" Eirian was rushed to hospital for treatment and has had to have repeated skin grafts to treat her burns. ""My priorities changed,"" said Eirian's father, who sustained burns himself as he ripped his daughter's flaming clothes from her back.

"People who live in council houses should be made to feel proud of their homes, Theresa May has said. The PM announced Â£2bn to build new homes in England, in an attempt to remove the ""stigma"" of social housing. Under the plan, housing associations, councils and other organisations will be able to bid for the money to spend on new projects, starting from 2022. Labour said the announcement fell ""far short"" of what was needed for the social housing sector. BBC home editor Mark Easton said the government hopes the money will allow local authorities and housing associations to build schemes that would otherwise seem too risky. He said the sector's calls to provide more confidence about future funding - so the 300,000 extra homes required in England each year can be built - had appeared to have been listened to. 'More powers' for social housing tenants 'I've spent 18 years on housing waiting list' No affordable homes? We'll build them ourselves Mrs May told a National Housing Federation summit in London: ""Some residents feel marginalised and overlooked, and are ashamed to share the fact that their home belongs to a housing association or local authority. ""On the outside, many people in society - including too many politicians - continue to look down on social housing and, by extension, the people who call it their home."" She will encourage housing associations to change how tenants and society view social housing. ""We should never see social housing as something that need simply be 'good enough', nor think that the people who live in it should be grateful for their safety net and expect no better,"" she said. ""I want to see social housing that is so good people are proud to call it their home... our friends and neighbours who live in social housing are not second-rate citizens."" In mixed developments, she said it should be impossible to tell the difference between full-price and affordable housing, which should not be ""tucked away out of sight and out of mind"". Theresa May said too many politicians ""look down on social housing"" David Orr, chief executive of the National Housing Federation, said the prime minister's announcement was ""extremely welcome"". ""This represents a total step change. For years, the way that money was allocated meant housing associations couldn't be sure of long-term funding to build much-needed affordable housing,"" he said. He said that by changing the way the funding was allocated, ministers had given ""long-term confidence and confirmed that we are trusted partners in solving the housing crisis, building new homes and communities"". Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, said it was welcome that the government was ""starting to get serious"" about correcting the ""historic failure"" to build social homes. ""This must be the start and not the end,"" she said. Shadow housing secretary John Healey said the reality was spending on new affordable homes had been ""slashed"" and the number of new social rented homes built last year ""fell to the lowest level since records began"". ""If Conservative ministers are serious about fixing the housing crisis they should back Labour's plans to build a million genuinely affordable homes, including the biggest council house-building programme for more than 30 years,"" he said. The English housing survey for 2016/17 reported that 3.9 million households - about nine million people - lived in the social rented sector, which was 17% of households in the country. By Reality Check team While it's estimated that housing associations now build around 17% of homes, many people are on waiting lists for social housing. Over the last 20 years, the number of households in England on local authorities' waiting lists has increased from 1,021,664 to 1,155,285 in 2017. According togovernment figures,external, the number peaked in 2012 at 1,851,426. A study by housing charity Shelterfound that Newham in central London saw the highest demand for social housing in 2017. 588 homes were available for social rent, while over 25,000 households were on the waiting list for these properties. The charity says that longer waiting lists are forcing more people into private rented accommodation. It estimates that over 1.6 million people in England now rely on housing benefit to help with keeping up with rent payments. The funding covers the next spending review period, from 2021 through to 2028. Downing Street said the money was separate to the Â£9bn of public funding put toward the existing affordable homes programme until 2022. 'More powers' for social housing tenants No affordable homes?

"Wasps, often encountered on picnics, have a poor reputation with the public A new study reveals that wasps are largely disliked by the public, whereas bees are highly appreciated. The researchers involved say that this view is unfair because wasps are just as ecologically useful as bees. The scientists suggest a public relations campaign to restore the wasps' battered image. They'd like to see the same efforts made to conserve them as there currently are with bees. Thesurvey of 750 people from 46 countries,externalhas been published in Ecological Entomology. Despised by picnickers, feared for their painful stings - wasps are among the least loved of insects according to the new study. Researchers say that wasps carry out as many valuable ecological services as bees In the survey, participants were asked to rate the insects on a scale which ran from minus five, representing a strongly negative emotion to plus five, representing a strongly positive one. The vast majority of responses for bees were plus 3 or above, whereas it was the complete reverse for wasps, with the vast majority rating their feelings minus three or below. When asked to think of words associated with bees, the most popular for bees were ""honey"", ""flowers"" and ""pollination"". For wasps the most common words that came to mind were ""sting"", ""annoying"" and ""dangerous"". However wasps also pollinate flowers as well as killing pests and are just as important to the environment as bees. The problem, according to Dr Seirian Sumner, of University College London, who led the research, is that wasps have had a bad press. The public are unaware of all the good things they do so they are regarded as nuisances rather than an important ecological asset. Bees have enjoyed far more attention from research scientists ""People don't realise how incredibly valuable they are,"" she told BBC News. ""Although you might think they are after your beer or jam sandwich - they are, in fact, much more interested in finding insect prey to take back to their nest to feed their lavae."" Dr Sumner also discovered that there is a lack of research into the mostly positive impact wasps have on the environment. She analysed scientific research papers and conference presentations for bees and wasps over the last 37 years and 16 years respectively. Of 908 papers sampled, only 2.4% wasp publications were found since 1980, compared to 97.6% (886 papers) bee publications. Of the 2,543 conference abstracts on bees or wasps from the last twenty years, 81.3% were on bees. The sting of a wasp is feared but only one percent of the creatures sting This lack of research is stalling efforts to develop conservation strategies for wasps, whose numbers are declining because of loss of habitat and climate change according to Dr Alessandro Cini of the University of Florence, who collaborated on the study.

"The Â£15bn merger between supermarkets Sainsbury's and Asda is to be subjected to an in-depth competition investigation, it has been announced. The Competition and Markets Authority said the deal ""raises sufficient concerns to be referred for a more in-depth review"". The CMA undertook an initial review of the deal, which would createa business taking Â£1 in every Â£3 spent on groceries. The chains say prices will fall. But the CMA said: ""The companies are two of the largest grocery retailers in the UK and their stores overlap in hundreds of local areas, where shoppers could face higher prices or worse quality of service."" Sainsbury's-Asda may 'have to sell at least 73 shops' Sainsbury's-Asda deal in nine charts Sainsbury's boss sorry for singing We're in the Money The competition body said it would also look at issues relating to fuel, general merchandise such as clothing and what it describes as ""increased buyer power over suppliers"". It has been calculated that the deal, announced in April, between the UK's second and third-largest supermarkets would create the UK's biggest retail chain with a 31.4% market share and with 2,800 stores. Analysis by retail property experts Maximise UKhas estimated that the CMA will recommend that 6%, or 73, of the combined group's supermarkets should be sold off. Others have speculated that up to 300 sites could have to be divested. Suppliers havealso said they could suffer as a result of the merger, which comes at time when supermarkets are facing pressure from discounters. The CMA investigation was announced as rival Tesco, the biggest supermarket, prepared to unveilits new Jack's discount chain. Asda and Sainsbury's had asked the CMA to ""fast track"" the first stage of its inquiry,which began in August. The CMA said it had now moved to the second stage and would publish a detailed issues statement in the coming weeks. This will set out the key topics it will scrutinise by taking evidence from consumer surveys and information from retailers, suppliers and industry bodies. It has set a deadline of 5 March 2019 to complete this stage of its investigation. When Asda chief executive Roger Burnley and Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe gave evidence to MPs about the deal, they insisted they would have a 25% market share, rather than the 30% predicted by analysts. They said that small suppliers would not be hurt by their attempt to cut the price of every day items such as milk, bread and tinned tomatoes by 10%. US retail giant Walmart, which has owned Asda since 1999, will retain 42% of the combined business.

"This video can not be played North Korea's agreed to shut one of the country's main missile launch sites. Laura Bicker considers what might happen next. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has agreed to shut one of the country's main missile testing and launch sites. He signed a pledge to permanently close the Tongchang-ri facility, after talks in Pyongyang with his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in. Both leaders also ""agreed on a way to achieve denuclearisation"" on the Korean peninsula, Mr Moon said. Mr Kim said he hoped to ""visit Seoul in the near future"" - he would be the first North Korean leader to do so. China has welcomed the outcome of the inter-Korean summit, saying both sides had found ""new and important common ground"". The main focus of the summit was the issue of denuclearisation. While the US and North Korea agreed in broad terms earlier this year to work towards that goal, negotiations have stalled. Pyongyang has now sought to reconfirm its commitment. Mr Kim expressed a readiness to shut down the Yongbyon nuclear facility - where North Korea is believed to have produced the material used in its nuclear tests - if the US took some reciprocal action. The details of that were not specified. Korea summit puts diplomacy back on track Moon: Caught between Trump and Kim North Korea's woeful human rights record North Korea crisis in 300 words But he went further on Tongchang-ri, saying the engine missile testing and launch facility would be permanently closed ""in the presence of experts from relevant nations"". The BBC's Seoul correspondent Laura Bicker said the announcement is a major step forward. Satellite images suggest Tongchang-ri is in the process of being destroyed, she added, but the declaration will allow inspectors to verify the process. Tongchang-ri has been North Korea's main satellite launch facility since 2012, according to monitoring group 38 North. It has also been used for testing engines for North Korean missiles capable of reaching the US.

""The outcome is a big win for Moon Jae-in, who has managed to extract a series of positive headlines from Kim Jong-un related to denuclearisation,"" Ankit Panda, editor of The Diplomat, told the BBC. ""None of the concessions are truly costly to Kim and won't help move North Korea toward short-term disarmament, but provide a further basis for confidence building on which US-North Korea talks can move forward."" The two countries also made advances on inter-Korean ties, announcing plans to link up their railways, allow more reunions for families separated by war and co-operate on health care. Mr Moon invited the North Korean leader to Seoul, suggesting the visit should take place before the end of this year. They will also seek to co-host the 2032 Summer Olympics. This video can not be played How North Korea welcomed the South Korean leader The South's defence minister and the head of the North Korean army also signed an agreement to reduce military tensions, with a buffer zone to be established along the border to prevent accidental clashes. The signing came mid-way through a three-day visit to Pyongyang by Mr Moon. While it is the first trip to the North Korean capital in a decade by a leader from the South, it is Mr Moon's third meeting with Kim Jong-un since their historic summit in April.

"An ""alarmingly high"" number of girls and young women feel unsafe outside their home, according to annual research for Girlguiding UK. The survey of 1,903 13 to 21-year-olds in the UK found nearly two-thirds either felt unsafe, or knew someone who was fearful walking home alone. More than half had suffered harassment, or knew someone who had, it said. But girls are responding more robustly than before and were also more likely to call themselves feminists, it said. The research, the tenth over as many years, found more girls claim to understand what feminism means, with almost half saying they are feminists - up from a third in 2013. One young woman, from the 11 to 16-year-old age group, told researchers a feminist was ""a person who strongly believes in gender equality and that everyone no matter their background should be treated equally."" Another, aged between 17 and 21, described feminism as ""equal rights and opportunities between men and women in the workplace, education and society"". The researchers said they felt the increased understanding of gender equality and equal rights was down to recent intense media coverage of these areas. Perhaps linked to this greater awareness was the suggestion that fewer girls expected to encounter equality in all areas of life this year than in 2009. And more girls and young women say they are seeing or experiencing sexism across all areas of their lives. The researchers said: ""It might mean they are more aware of it in the media, online and in public - the result of campaigns like #MeToo and #TimesUp. ""However, it is also possible it may reflect an increase in the scale of sexism for girls."" Compared to three years ago, more girls aged seven to 10 think the way people treat girls and women is affected by ""naked pictures of women in the media, jokes about girls and more attention given to women's clothes than actions"". But there were also very real concerns about girls' safety. One young woman aged between 11 and 16, said: ""One thing that would improve girls' lives would be to make it safe for girls to walk down the street alone."" Another, aged 17 to 21, said: ""Girls' lives would be better if things like harassment and stalking were taken seriously and punished properly."" The survey also found that an increasing number of girls have experienced unkind, threatening and negative behaviour online compared to five years ago. But, it added: ""Girls are more likely to ignore abuse and report it more, as well as delete posts."" Girls 'less confident as they grow older' Has Girl Guiding stood the test of time?

"These ads were among those directed only at men on Facebook, according to the complaint Van driving, roofing, police work - all jobs for men. At least, thatâs what a cluster of job ads placed on Facebook seemed to suggest. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on Tuesdaysubmitted a complaint,externalto the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging that Facebookâs advertising system allows employers to target job ads based on gender - a practice the ACLU says is illegal. Specifically, the complaint refers to three women in the states of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Illinois who were not shown advertisements for what have traditionally been considered male-dominated professions. The complaint highlights 10 different employers who posted job adverts on Facebook - for roles such as mechanic, roofer and security engineer - but used the social networkâs targeting system to control who saw the ad. In one example, that targeting meant one job was promoted to âmenâ who were âages 25 to 35â, and lived ""or were recently near Philadelphia, Pennsylvaniaâ. A separate investigation by ProPublica,externaldiscovered what it said were more examples showing a similar pattern. Earlier this year the investigative journalism site released a tool which readers could use to collect data on the Facebook ads they had seen, and send that information directly to ProPublica for analysis. Using that method, the site said it discovered men were targeted specifically in dozens of cities around the US for driving jobs with Uber. This conclusion was based on 91 ads placed by Uber's recruitment arm, only one of which was targeted specifically at women, with three not targeting any particular gender. The rest were designed to be seen by men only. In a statement, Uber said: ""We use a variety of channels to reach prospective drivers - both offline and online - with the goal of enabling more people, not fewer, to earn on their own schedule."" However, this data should be treated with caution. It is not clear that any broad conclusions can be made about perceived discrimination on Facebook. While one advertisement in isolation may be targeting men specifically, there may have been an equivalent advertisement targeting women running in the same time frame - ads that may not have been picked up by ProPublica's tool. Furthermore, if a user clicks on an ad to see why it has been targeted - as in the ACLU complaint - they will be told why they specifically saw the ad, but not details on the entire audience for the ad. The BBC understands Facebook is in the process of putting together data to dispute the findings and respond to the ACLU's complaint. While targeting users based on gender may seem relatively harmless when it comes to, for instance, clothing brands, doing so for job advertisements may be against US law. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 specifically prohibits discriminating against a person because of ""race, colour, religion, sex, or national originâ. The law applies to every stage of employment, including recruitment. Facebook said it was looking into the complaint ""When employers in male-dominated fields advertise their jobs only to men, it prevents women from breaking into those fields,â said Galen Sherwin, from the ACLUâs Womenâs Rights Project, arguing that ânon-binaryâ people, those who choose not to identify with a specific gender, are also excluded. ""Whatâs more, clicking on the Facebook ads brought viewers to a page listing numerous other job opportunities at these companies for which job seekers might be qualified. ""Because no women saw these ads, they were shut out of learning not only about the jobs highlighted in the ads, but also about any of these other opportunities.â Facebook said it was reviewing the ACLUâs complaint and looked forward to âdefending our practicesâ. ""There is no place for discrimination on Facebook,â said spokesman Joe Osborne. ""Itâs strictly prohibited in our policies, and over the past year, weâve strengthened our systems to further protect against misuse.â The company has recently removed over 5,000 targeting options for advertisers. The move was prompted by a lawsuit accusing the firm of unlawfully targeting users based on race or sexual orientation.

"A 14-month-old child suffering from malnutrition receives treatment at a clinic in the city of Amran A further one million children are at risk of famine in Yemen, the charity Save the Children has warned. Rising food prices and the falling value of the country's currency as a result of a civil war are putting more families at risk of food insecurity.

Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the rebel Houthi movement seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, Saudi Arabia and eight other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. They have received logistical and intelligence support from the US, UK and France. Many families in rebel-held Yemen are reliant on food handouts from aid groups At least 6,660 civilians have been killed and 10,563 injured in the conflict, according to the UN. Thousands more civilians have died from preventable causes, including malnutrition, disease and poor health. The fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition have also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that is thought to have affected 1.1 million people. The war has also led to severe delays in paying the salaries of teachers and public servants, with some people receiving no wages for almost two years.

Fears also remain of potential damage to or a blockade of Hudaydah's port as a result of the fighting.

"Many yoghurts are full of sugar and the public should not be lulled into thinking they are eating healthy products, researchers say. The conclusion comes after a study of almost 900 yoghurts on sale in UK supermarkets. The Leeds University-led research found that organic yoghurts were among the most sugary types - containing more sugar per 100g than cola. Only natural and Greek-style yoghurts could be classed as low in sugar. The study - published in BMJ Open - comes as government health officials are encouraging manufacturers to reduce the amount of sugar consumed by the public. Yoghurts have been identified as one of the food types on which Public Health England wants to see progress. This research was undertaken shortly after the launch of the sugar-reduction programme. Unsurprisingly, yoghurt desserts contained the most sugar - an average of 16.4g per 100g. This category also included some products that did not contain yoghurt, such as chocolate mousse and creme caramel. The second most sugary product was organic yoghurts with a typical 13.1g per 100g. Children's yoghurts typically contained 10.8g per 100g, the equivalent of more than two sugar cubes, the study found. By comparison a 100g serving of a typical cola contains 9g of sugar. The NHS recommends that children aged four to six have no more than 19g of sugar, or five sugar cubes a day, and it is advised that those aged seven to 10 consume less than 24g daily. To be classed as low sugar there needs to be no more than 5g per 100g. Only 9% of products surveyed were below this threshold. Desserts - 16.4g per 100g Organic - 13.1g per 100g Flavoured - 12g per 100g Fruit - 11.9g per 100g Children's - 10.8g per 100g Dairy alternatives - 9.2g per 100g Drinks - 9.1g per 100g Natural and Greek - 5g per 100g Since the fieldwork for the study was carried out - at the end of 2016 - progress has been made on reducing sugar consumption from yoghurts. A report published in May showed sugar content in yoghurts had been reduced by 6% in the first year, making it the only food category to exceed the 5% target. By 2020, it is expected sugar will be reduced by 20%. PHE chief nutritionist Dr Alison Tedstone said this showed ""positive steps"" were being made. But Dr Bernadette Moore, lead researcher of this study, said: ""Even if we take the reduction into account, most of these yoghurts will still not be low in sugar. ""I think people, including parents, will be surprised to know just how much sugar there is in yoghurt. ""My advice would be to buy natural yoghurt and mix in your own fruit.""

"People who live in council houses should be made to feel proud of their homes, Theresa May has said. The PM announced Â£2bn to build new homes in England, in an attempt to remove the ""stigma"" of social housing. Under the plan, housing associations, councils and other organisations will be able to bid for the money to spend on new projects, starting from 2022. Labour said the announcement fell ""far short"" of what was needed for the social housing sector. BBC home editor Mark Easton said the government hopes the money will allow local authorities and housing associations to build schemes that would otherwise seem too risky. He said the sector's calls to provide more confidence about future funding - so the 300,000 extra homes required in England each year can be built - had appeared to have been listened to. 'More powers' for social housing tenants 'I've spent 18 years on housing waiting list' No affordable homes? We'll build them ourselves Mrs May told a National Housing Federation summit in London: ""Some residents feel marginalised and overlooked, and are ashamed to share the fact that their home belongs to a housing association or local authority. ""On the outside, many people in society - including too many politicians - continue to look down on social housing and, by extension, the people who call it their home."" She will encourage housing associations to change how tenants and society view social housing. ""We should never see social housing as something that need simply be 'good enough', nor think that the people who live in it should be grateful for their safety net and expect no better,"" she said. ""I want to see social housing that is so good people are proud to call it their home... our friends and neighbours who live in social housing are not second-rate citizens."" In mixed developments, she said it should be impossible to tell the difference between full-price and affordable housing, which should not be ""tucked away out of sight and out of mind"". Theresa May said too many politicians ""look down on social housing"" David Orr, chief executive of the National Housing Federation, said the prime minister's announcement was ""extremely welcome"". ""This represents a total step change. For years, the way that money was allocated meant housing associations couldn't be sure of long-term funding to build much-needed affordable housing,"" he said. He said that by changing the way the funding was allocated, ministers had given ""long-term confidence and confirmed that we are trusted partners in solving the housing crisis, building new homes and communities"". Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, said it was welcome that the government was ""starting to get serious"" about correcting the ""historic failure"" to build social homes. ""This must be the start and not the end,"" she said. Shadow housing secretary John Healey said the reality was spending on new affordable homes had been ""slashed"" and the number of new social rented homes built last year ""fell to the lowest level since records began"". ""If Conservative ministers are serious about fixing the housing crisis they should back Labour's plans to build a million genuinely affordable homes, including the biggest council house-building programme for more than 30 years,"" he said. The English housing survey for 2016/17 reported that 3.9 million households - about nine million people - lived in the social rented sector, which was 17% of households in the country. By Reality Check team While it's estimated that housing associations now build around 17% of homes, many people are on waiting lists for social housing. Over the last 20 years, the number of households in England on local authorities' waiting lists has increased from 1,021,664 to 1,155,285 in 2017. According togovernment figures,external, the number peaked in 2012 at 1,851,426. A study by housing charity Shelterfound that Newham in central London saw the highest demand for social housing in 2017. 588 homes were available for social rent, while over 25,000 households were on the waiting list for these properties. The charity says that longer waiting lists are forcing more people into private rented accommodation. It estimates that over 1.6 million people in England now rely on housing benefit to help with keeping up with rent payments. The funding covers the next spending review period, from 2021 through to 2028. Downing Street said the money was separate to the Â£9bn of public funding put toward the existing affordable homes programme until 2022. 'More powers' for social housing tenants No affordable homes?

"This video can not be played North Korea's agreed to shut one of the country's main missile launch sites. Laura Bicker considers what might happen next. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has agreed to shut one of the country's main missile testing and launch sites. He signed a pledge to permanently close the Tongchang-ri facility, after talks in Pyongyang with his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in. Both leaders also ""agreed on a way to achieve denuclearisation"" on the Korean peninsula, Mr Moon said. Mr Kim said he hoped to ""visit Seoul in the near future"" - he would be the first North Korean leader to do so. China has welcomed the outcome of the inter-Korean summit, saying both sides had found ""new and important common ground"". The main focus of the summit was the issue of denuclearisation. While the US and North Korea agreed in broad terms earlier this year to work towards that goal, negotiations have stalled. Pyongyang has now sought to reconfirm its commitment. Mr Kim expressed a readiness to shut down the Yongbyon nuclear facility - where North Korea is believed to have produced the material used in its nuclear tests - if the US took some reciprocal action. The details of that were not specified. Korea summit puts diplomacy back on track Moon: Caught between Trump and Kim North Korea's woeful human rights record North Korea crisis in 300 words But he went further on Tongchang-ri, saying the engine missile testing and launch facility would be permanently closed ""in the presence of experts from relevant nations"". The BBC's Seoul correspondent Laura Bicker said the announcement is a major step forward. Satellite images suggest Tongchang-ri is in the process of being destroyed, she added, but the declaration will allow inspectors to verify the process. Tongchang-ri has been North Korea's main satellite launch facility since 2012, according to monitoring group 38 North. It has also been used for testing engines for North Korean missiles capable of reaching the US.

""The outcome is a big win for Moon Jae-in, who has managed to extract a series of positive headlines from Kim Jong-un related to denuclearisation,"" Ankit Panda, editor of The Diplomat, told the BBC. ""None of the concessions are truly costly to Kim and won't help move North Korea toward short-term disarmament, but provide a further basis for confidence building on which US-North Korea talks can move forward."" The two countries also made advances on inter-Korean ties, announcing plans to link up their railways, allow more reunions for families separated by war and co-operate on health care. Mr Moon invited the North Korean leader to Seoul, suggesting the visit should take place before the end of this year. They will also seek to co-host the 2032 Summer Olympics. This video can not be played How North Korea welcomed the South Korean leader The South's defence minister and the head of the North Korean army also signed an agreement to reduce military tensions, with a buffer zone to be established along the border to prevent accidental clashes. The signing came mid-way through a three-day visit to Pyongyang by Mr Moon. While it is the first trip to the North Korean capital in a decade by a leader from the South, it is Mr Moon's third meeting with Kim Jong-un since their historic summit in April.

According togovernment figures,external, the number peaked in 2012 at 1,851,426. A study by housing charity Shelterfound that Newham in central London saw the highest demand for social housing in 2017. 588 homes were available for social rent, while over 25,000 households were on the waiting list for these properties. The charity says that longer waiting lists are forcing more people into private rented accommodation. It estimates that over 1.6 million people in England now rely on housing benefit to help with keeping up with rent payments. The funding covers the next spending review period, from 2021 through to 2028. Downing Street said the money was separate to the Â£9bn of public funding put toward the existing affordable homes programme until 2022. 'More powers' for social housing tenants No affordable homes?

"This video can not be played North Korea's agreed to shut one of the country's main missile launch sites. Laura Bicker considers what might happen next. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has agreed to shut one of the country's main missile testing and launch sites. He signed a pledge to permanently close the Tongchang-ri facility, after talks in Pyongyang with his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in. Both leaders also ""agreed on a way to achieve denuclearisation"" on the Korean peninsula, Mr Moon said. Mr Kim said he hoped to ""visit Seoul in the near future"" - he would be the first North Korean leader to do so. China has welcomed the outcome of the inter-Korean summit, saying both sides had found ""new and important common ground"". The main focus of the summit was the issue of denuclearisation. While the US and North Korea agreed in broad terms earlier this year to work towards that goal, negotiations have stalled. Pyongyang has now sought to reconfirm its commitment. Mr Kim expressed a readiness to shut down the Yongbyon nuclear facility - where North Korea is believed to have produced the material used in its nuclear tests - if the US took some reciprocal action. The details of that were not specified. Korea summit puts diplomacy back on track Moon: Caught between Trump and Kim North Korea's woeful human rights record North Korea crisis in 300 words But he went further on Tongchang-ri, saying the engine missile testing and launch facility would be permanently closed ""in the presence of experts from relevant nations"". The BBC's Seoul correspondent Laura Bicker said the announcement is a major step forward. Satellite images suggest Tongchang-ri is in the process of being destroyed, she added, but the declaration will allow inspectors to verify the process. Tongchang-ri has been North Korea's main satellite launch facility since 2012, according to monitoring group 38 North. It has also been used for testing engines for North Korean missiles capable of reaching the US.

""The outcome is a big win for Moon Jae-in, who has managed to extract a series of positive headlines from Kim Jong-un related to denuclearisation,"" Ankit Panda, editor of The Diplomat, told the BBC. ""None of the concessions are truly costly to Kim and won't help move North Korea toward short-term disarmament, but provide a further basis for confidence building on which US-North Korea talks can move forward."" The two countries also made advances on inter-Korean ties, announcing plans to link up their railways, allow more reunions for families separated by war and co-operate on health care. Mr Moon invited the North Korean leader to Seoul, suggesting the visit should take place before the end of this year. They will also seek to co-host the 2032 Summer Olympics. This video can not be played How North Korea welcomed the South Korean leader The South's defence minister and the head of the North Korean army also signed an agreement to reduce military tensions, with a buffer zone to be established along the border to prevent accidental clashes. The signing came mid-way through a three-day visit to Pyongyang by Mr Moon. While it is the first trip to the North Korean capital in a decade by a leader from the South, it is Mr Moon's third meeting with Kim Jong-un since their historic summit in April.

"Cryptocurrencies' trading prices have been extremely volatile Bitcoin and other digital currencies are a ""Wild West industry"" and need to be regulated to protect investors, a committee of MPs has urged. Problems include volatile prices, minimal consumer protection and risks of hacking and money-laundering, says the Treasury Committee. The committee said there were no well-functioning crypto-currencies and preferred to call them ""crypto-assets"". It urged City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority to supervise them. At present, the FCA has no power to regulate either the issuers of these assets or the exchanges on which they are traded. ""Crypto-asset investors are currently afforded very little protection from the litany of risks. Namely, there are no formal mechanisms for consumer redress, nor compensation,"" said the committee. There are now more than 1,500 varieties of crypto-asset being traded on about 190 exchanges around the world. Prices have soared and crashed alarmingly. In 2017, the price of a Bitcoin rocketed to nearly Â£15,000 before losing two-thirds of its value in just a few months. Crypto-fundraising schemes, known as Initial Coin Offerings, have posed challenges for regulators around the world. ""As the government and regulators decide whether the current Wild West situation is allowed to continue, or whether they are going to introduce regulation, consumers remain unprotected,"" said the Treasury Committee. Nicky Morgan, who chairs the committee, said: ""It's unsustainable for the government and regulators to bumble along issuing feeble warnings to potential investors, yet refrain from acting. ""At a minimum, regulation should address consumer protection and anti-money-laundering."" CryptoUK, which was set up in February as a self-regulatory body for the crypto-currency industry, said it welcomed the Treasury Committee's recommendations. Iqbal Gandham, who chairs it, said: ""Self-regulation by the industry was always intended to be a starting point - this must now be matched by government action. ""Regulatory oversight is essential to ensuring consumer safety, guarding against malpractice and providing much needed clarity to an industry that is fast maturing. ""It is therefore pleasing that the committee has endorsed our suggestion on how this can be delivered, by bringing responsibility within the FCA's perimeter of oversight."" Bitcoin buster?

"An ""alarmingly high"" number of girls and young women feel unsafe outside their home, according to annual research for Girlguiding UK. The survey of 1,903 13 to 21-year-olds in the UK found nearly two-thirds either felt unsafe, or knew someone who was fearful walking home alone. More than half had suffered harassment, or knew someone who had, it said. But girls are responding more robustly than before and were also more likely to call themselves feminists, it said. The research, the tenth over as many years, found more girls claim to understand what feminism means, with almost half saying they are feminists - up from a third in 2013. One young woman, from the 11 to 16-year-old age group, told researchers a feminist was ""a person who strongly believes in gender equality and that everyone no matter their background should be treated equally."" Another, aged between 17 and 21, described feminism as ""equal rights and opportunities between men and women in the workplace, education and society"". The researchers said they felt the increased understanding of gender equality and equal rights was down to recent intense media coverage of these areas. Perhaps linked to this greater awareness was the suggestion that fewer girls expected to encounter equality in all areas of life this year than in 2009. And more girls and young women say they are seeing or experiencing sexism across all areas of their lives. The researchers said: ""It might mean they are more aware of it in the media, online and in public - the result of campaigns like #MeToo and #TimesUp. ""However, it is also possible it may reflect an increase in the scale of sexism for girls."" Compared to three years ago, more girls aged seven to 10 think the way people treat girls and women is affected by ""naked pictures of women in the media, jokes about girls and more attention given to women's clothes than actions"". But there were also very real concerns about girls' safety. One young woman aged between 11 and 16, said: ""One thing that would improve girls' lives would be to make it safe for girls to walk down the street alone."" Another, aged 17 to 21, said: ""Girls' lives would be better if things like harassment and stalking were taken seriously and punished properly."" The survey also found that an increasing number of girls have experienced unkind, threatening and negative behaviour online compared to five years ago. But, it added: ""Girls are more likely to ignore abuse and report it more, as well as delete posts."" Girls 'less confident as they grow older' Has Girl Guiding stood the test of time?

The force has now said the incident was ""not being treated as suspicious"" following tests on the pair. A spokesman said: ""We are not linking their illness to the recent poisonings in Salisbury and Amesbury."" Inquiries into what caused the man and woman to fall ill are ongoing.

"Cerissa Riley and Grant Robicheaux may have met victims at music festivals, prosecutors say A California surgeon and his girlfriend have been charged with two sexual assaults, and investigators suspect there could be ""hundreds"" more victims. Grant William Robicheaux, 38, and Cerissa Laura Riley, 31, allegedly attacked two women they met at a bar and a restaurant in 2016. Prosecutors told the BBC ""thousands and thousands"" of videos of potential victims were on the defendants' phones. Investigators are trying to identify the women in the clips. At a news conference on Tuesday, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said the pair were suspected of using their ""clean-cut"" looks to lure targets into a false sense of security. ""We believe the defendants used their good looks and charms to lower the inhibitions of their potential prey,"" he said,reports KTLA-TV,external. Grant Robicheaux once appeared on reality TV show Online Dating Rituals of the American Male He added: ""There are several videos where the women in the videos appear to be highly intoxicated beyond the ability to consent or resist and they are barely responsive to the defendants' sexual advances. ""Based on this evidence we believe there might be many unidentified victims out there."" Mr Robicheaux is an orthopaedic surgeon from Newport Beach, 45 miles (72km) south of Los Angeles. He once appeared on the Bravo cable network's reality TV show Online Dating Rituals of the American Male. Investigators say the pair worked ""in tandem"" to meet women at bars, drug them or coerce them to drink large amounts of alcohol, and then bring them back to Mr Robicheaux's apartment to be assaulted. Two women have alleged encounters with Mr Robicheaux and Ms Riley two years ago. The first said she met the pair at a restaurant on 10 April 2016 and was invited by them to a boat party. The couple are also accused of drug and weapons offences Once intoxicated, the 32-year-old was allegedly taken back to Mr Robicheaux's apartment and raped. She contacted Newport Beach police the following day and tested positive for a number of unspecified drugs, the prosecutor said. Both defendants are accused of rape by use of drugs in that case. On 2 October 2016, another woman said she woke up in Mr Robicheaux's apartment after a night of drinking, and screamed for help until his neighbours called police. That woman told police she had been drinking at a bar in Newport Beach with the couple until she lost consciousness. Both defendants are accused of sexual assault with intent to commit rape in that case. Mr Robicheaux and Ms Riley are accused of possessing the date-rape drug GHB Investigators say they have recovered video of one of the two women being assaulted. Mr Robicheaux and Ms Riley are accused of possessing a large quantity of drugs, including GHB (considered a date-rape drug), psychedelic mushrooms, ecstasy and cocaine. Police said the illegal substances were found during a search of the surgeon's home in January 2018. Mr Robicheaux is further accused of possessing two unregistered semi-automatic rifles, four other firearms and magazines capable of carrying large amounts of ammunition,according to a press release,external. Newport Beach police passed the case for review to the Orange County district attorney on 6 September, and the couple were arrested at the man's home last Wednesday. The district attorney said the state's medical board has opened an investigation into Mr Robicheaux, but there is no evidence so far that any of his patients could be victims. Officials say the couple have attended music and art festivals such as Burning Man in Nevada and the Splash House Festival in Palm Springs, California. Both of the accused have been freed on $100,000 (Â£76,000) bail bonds. ""We've all heard of a wolf in sheep's clothing,"" said the district attorney. ""Well, a wolf can wear scrubs or doctor's clothing. Or a wolf can be a beautiful woman."" If convicted, Mr Robicheaux and Ms Riley could spend 40 years and 30 years in prison respectively, said the prosecutor. Mr Rackauckas added: ""People often assume that rapists are creepy, scary men who lunge out from hiding amongst bushes and attack unsuspecting women. ""The reality is that rapists come in all socioeconomic groups, of any background."" The pair are due to be formally charged in court on 24 October.

"About four million people have been charged for mobile phones they already own, spending Â£500m extra on contracts, according to Citizens Advice. Three of Britain's biggest mobile networks, EE, Three and Vodafone, continue to charge for handsets even after the cost has been paid off. Many customers have no idea they are being charged for phones after their contracts have ended. The practice is ""unacceptable"", said Citizens Advice boss Gillian Guy. ""We need action,"" she said. ""Other companies have already stopped doing this so we're looking for these three major providers to follow suit."" Mobile users only need to continue paying for calls, texts and data, or ""airtime"", when contracts end - but millions get stung with unnecessary extra charges. Citizens Advice's research found that on average customers are overcharged Â£22 a month. The figure could be as high as Â£38 for high-end devices such as an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy. Vulnerable people are most at risk of being overcharged. Older people are twice as likely to be charged for a phone they already own longer than 12 months, which could cost them an average of Â£264. ""Consumers should check their phone bills to see if they can save money with a SIM-only contract or upgrade to a new phone,"" advised Ms Guy. Anyone who bought a contract from Three, Vodafone or EE that included a handset is being overcharged when their contract ends Users can ask their network to switch them to a cheaper SIM-only deal, or end the contract and move to another provider No-one is automatically entitled to compensation - consumers can only make a claim if it was not made clear in their contract that the deal would continue at the same price Source: Citizens Advice Regulator Ofcom is consulting on how to address the problem and has proposed sending a single notification to customers before their contract ends. Citizens Advice said that does not go far enough and that phone companies should separate the cost of mobile service and the phone. O2 has split the cost of its airtime and handset since 2013. Nina Bibby, chief marketing officer for O2, said: ""Charging for phones that have already been paid off does nothing but damage customer trust and the reputation of the industry."" EE said the splitting idea is ""overly simplistic and doesn't give the customers either the transparency or best deal that they deserve"". ""We agree that customers shouldn't overpay, but we believe that this is best achieved through clear communications with consumers about their options,"" it said. EE sends alerts before the end of customers' contracts that explain their options. Three said: ""We make the length of any contract very clear to new customers and make this information available through our customer service channels at all times."" It said it was working closely on the issue of handset financing with the government and regulators. Vodafone said: ""We already contact all of our customers when they are approaching the end of their minimum term to let them know their options. These include upgrading their handset or moving to a SIM-only contract so they are not paying anything for a handset."" It added that from next month, it will give extra data to people who do not opt for either option but stay on their contract after the end of their minimum term.
