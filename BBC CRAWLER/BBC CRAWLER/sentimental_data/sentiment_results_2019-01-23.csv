"Former Barclays chief executive John Varley Senior Barclays bankers paid Qatar Â£322m in secret fees during the financial crisis in return for bailout funds, a court heard on Wednesday. The case against four former executives has been filed by the Serious Fraud Office over Barclays' Â£11.8bn rescue. The bank avoided a UK government bailout in 2008 by raising funds from Middle Eastern investors. The executives are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud. All four have pleaded not guilty. The defendants are John Varley, the bank's former boss; investment banking executive Roger Jenkins; Thomas Kalaris, head of the bank's wealth management business; and Richard Boath, former European Head of Financial Institutions Group at the lender's investment bank. The trial is expected to last from four to six months. The four accused were all granted bail. Why are four former Barclays executives on trial? At the opening of the trial, prosecutor Edward Brown told Southwark Crown Court that during the financial crisis, Barclays and other banks were ""under sometimes extreme pressure to raise further capital"". He said Barclays was ""very anxious"" to avoid accepting UK government money, believing that this would place it under greater control and scrutiny from the authorities. He added: ""It is no exaggeration to say that Barclays' future as an independent bank was in jeopardy in September and October of 2008."" Mr Brown said Barclays received about Â£4bn in investments from the Qatar Investment Authority and Qatar Holding during 2008. In exchange, he said, the bank paid fees to Qatar, some of which were additional commission fees that were hidden in two agreements described as Advisory Service Agreements. These were more than double the fees paid to other investors in the bank, which he said ""demonstrates that the Qataris drove a hard bargain"". While other, more junior bankers have been tried and even jailed in unrelated cases for their parts in the financial crisis of 2007-08, this is the first time criminal proceedings against senior executives have been brought. The trial continues. Why are four former Barclays executives on trial?

"Nathan Sutherland, 36, was responsible for the woman's care, authorities said A nurse in Arizona has been charged with sexual assault after a vulnerable patient under his care gave birth. The suspect has been named as Nathan Sutherland, 36, who worked at the Hacienda Healthcare clinic. The 29-year-old patient, who has reportedly been in the care of the clinic since she was a toddler, gave birth on 29 December. Staff at the facility said at the time that they were unaware she was pregnant until she went into labour. The child, a boy, is now in the care of the patient's family and is said to be doing well. ""We can't always choose how we come into this life, but we as a community can choose to love this child,"" Police Sgt Tommy Thompson told reporters. Phoenix police chief Jeri Williams said Mr Sutherland was identified through ""good old-fashioned police work"". After the birth, an investigation was launched into sexual assault because the woman's condition renders her unable to give consent. Mr Sutherland submitted a DNA sample under a court order. A test showed his DNA positively matched with the child. He has been charged with one count of sexual assault and one count of abusing a vulnerable adult. ""We owed this arrest to the victim,"" Chief Williams said. ""We owed this arrest to the newest member of our community, that innocent baby."" Police are also investigating whether Mr Sutherland has assaulted any other patients. It is unclear whether he was an employee or contractor who worked at any other facilities. A lawyer for the woman's family, John Michaels, said they were aware of Mr Sutherland's arrest but had no comment. The patient's family have described her as ""a beloved daughter"" with ""significant intellectual disabilities"" caused by seizures in childhood. Mr Michaels, told local media: ""She has feelings, likes to be read to, enjoys soft music and is capable of responding to people she is familiar with, especially family."" Court documents state that the woman is ""not alert"" and requires a ""maximum level of care"",the Arizona Republic reported,external. According to medical records presented to an Arizona court, a doctor gave a check-up to the woman 37 weeks before she gave birth and found no major changes to her health. Mr Sutherland is a licensed practical nurse and had worked at Hacienda Healthcare clinic since 2011, authorities said. At the time of the assault he had been responsible for care of the woman. On Wednesday, he appeared in court and was released on a cash-only $500,000 (Â£382,588) bond. His lawyer David Gregan described Mr Sutherland as a family man with young children who has lived in Arizona since 1993. ""There's no direct evidence that Mr Sutherland has committed these acts,"" Mr Gregan told reporters. ""I know at this point there's DNA. But he will have a right to his own DNA expert."" In a statement, Hacienda Healthcare said it was ""troubled beyond words"" by the news. The firm said it had given Mr Sutherland ""an extensive background check"" before starting at the clinic, and fired him as soon as its leadership team learned of the arrest. Its chief executive has resigned over the incident. Earlier this weekthe clinic said a doctor who led the woman's care had resigned, and another was suspended.

"Actor Alec Baldwin appears in court in the Manhattan borough of New York City Alec Baldwin has pleaded guilty to second-degree harassment for a fight over a New York City parking spot. The 60-year-old US actor appeared in court charged with punching the man on 2 November during the dispute in front of his Manhattan apartment. He agreed to take an anger management class and pay a $120 (Â£91) fine. Mr Baldwin, who portrays President Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live, has been arrested for disorderly conduct before. He initially faced a misdemeanour assault charge in this most recent case, though his lawyer said there was video evidence proving the actor had not punched the other driver, who US media have identified as 49-year-old Wojciech Cieszkowski. As a part of Wednesday's guilty plea, Mr Baldwin will need to complete the anger management programme by 22 March, his next court date. Alec Baldwin charged with assault The dispute arose when the driver apparently took a parking spot that a member of Mr Baldwin's family had been holding for him. The harassment violation Mr Baldwin pleaded guilty to is not technically a crime under New York law. In 2014, the actor's anger issues led to a disorderly conduct citation and bike violation when he was caught riding his bicycle the wrong way and began swearing at the officers who stopped him.

"Mr Trump said there were no security concerns ahead of the event US President Donald Trump says he will deliver a speech to Congress next week, despite calls from top Democrats for it to be postponed over security risks. Mr Trump insists the State of the Union will happen on 29 January since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi already invited him to address Congress this month. Mrs Pelosi said that was before the shutdown dragged into day 33. She shot back in a second letter that the lower chamber would not authorise the address before the shutdown ends. The president told reporters on Wednesday that Mrs Pelosi had cancelled the speech ""because she doesn't want to hear the truth"". ""She's afraid of the truth,"" Mr Trump said. ""She doesn't want the American public to see what's going on."" The impact of the government shutdown 'I can't get my meds' All you need to know about Trump's wall Mr Trump earlier said that he was not surprised by Mrs Pelosi's response, and said the Democrats had ""become radicalised"". ""It really is a shame. This will go on for a while. Ultimately the American people will have their way because they want to see no crime, they want to see what we're doing."" Democrats have argued that with so many federal employees furloughed - temporarily laid off - or working without pay, the high-profile State of the Union address, which involves both chambers of Congress and the president, would not be logistically feasible. But Mr Trump has denied that there were any security concerns posed by the ongoing partial shutdown. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has requested the address be postponed until the shutdown ends The Speaker, who is the third most powerful politician in the US, had invited Mr Trump at the start of January to address Congress on the agreed-upon date of 29 January. ""At that time, there was no thought that the government would still be shut down,"" Mrs Pelosi said in her letter on Wednesday. ""I am writing to inform you that the House of Representatives will not consider a concurrent resolution authorising the President's State of the Union address in the House Chamber until government has opened."" ""Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened."" This video can not be played The return of the woman Republicans love to hate Mrs Pelosi had first asked for the State of the Union,a keynote agenda-setting speech by the president, to be delayed on 16 January, citing an unfunded Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security. In retaliation, Mr Trump on Friday denied Mrs Pelosi use of military airplanes on a trip to Brussels and Afghanistan - less than an hour before her flight was due to depart. He asked her to stay to negotiate an end to the partial US government shutdown. On 23 January, Mr Trump dug his heels in over the annual address, telling Mrs Pelosi: ""It would be so very sad for our Country if the State of the Union were not delivered on time, on schedule, and very importantly, on location!"" Mr Trump says the State of the Union address will go ahead despite Democrat's protests He emphasised that Mrs Pelosi had already invited him to speak, he had accepted that invitation, and that security agencies informed him ""there would be absolutely no problem regarding security with respect to the event"". ""Therefore, I will be honouring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty,"" he added. A row between the Republican president and Democrats over border security has led to the longest government shutdown in US history. Mr Trump is demanding $5.7bn (Â£4.4bn) of congressional funding to build a wall on the US-Mexico border, but newly empowered Democrats have refused. Some 800,000 federal employees have been going unpaid since 22 December as a result of the shutdown. Donald Trump says he wants to deliver his State of the Union speech ""on time, on schedule and on location"". He can accomplish the first two without difficulty. The Constitution is silent on the how the president ""from time to time"" must communicate with Congress. The ""location"", however, could be tricky. As the president must know, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has near total control over her chamber of Congress. While she did invite the president to speak earlier this month, the legislative action to allow the president to give his joint address has yet to be implemented. Mrs Pelosi has said she's not budging until the government reopens - and in this particular case, her word is final. All this sets up a game of chicken over a speech within the game of chicken over the shutdown. Everything up to this point has been manoeuvring to gain tactical advantage and avoid the public's scorn. For the moment, polls show Americans holding the president responsible for the impasse. But the fallout from this unprecedented State of the Union drama, if it reaches a climax on Tuesday, is unpredictable, to say the least.

"The Daily Mail's website is calling for a browser alert that criticises its journalism to be changed. The NewsGuard plug-in currently brings up a warning that says dailymail.co.uk ""generally fails to maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability"". It has given this advice since August. But the matter came to prominence last week, after Microsoft updated its Edge browser app for Android and iOS devices andbuilt in NewsGuard,external. Thisprompted several,externalothermedia outlets,externaltoreport the story.,external ""We have only very recently become aware of the NewsGuard start-up and are in discussions with them to have this egregiously erroneous classification resolved as soon as possible,"" said a spokesman for Mail Online. At present, NewsGuard must be switched on by users of Microsoft's Edge app, but the BBC understands there are plans for it to become the default option in the future. The New York-based service - which is independent of Microsoft - also has ambitions to include its tool in further products from the Windows developer as well as other tech firms. But for now, it can be used as an add-on extension in the desktop version of web browsers including Edge, Google's Chrome, Mozilla's Firefox and Apple's Safari. Microsoft declined to comment on the dispute and referred the BBC to NewsGuard's developers. They said they had already tried to engage with the publisher.

"The paramilitary group EOKA fought a guerrilla campaign against the British presence in Cyprus Thirty-three Cypriots who claimed they were tortured by British forces during an armed uprising in the late 1950s are to be awarded Â£1m damages, to be shared between them, by the UK government. The group was arrested on suspicion of being part of paramilitary organisation EOKA, which fought a guerrilla campaign to overthrow British control in Cyprus. One woman, aged 16 at the time, said she was repeatedly raped by soldiers. The government said the settlement was not ""any admission of liability"". The 1955-59 rebellion was known as the Cyprus Emergency, during which the governor enacted draconian laws, flooding the island with thousands of soldiers and increasing the size of the police force. Some 371 British military personnel died during the emergency. Dark clouds of history over sun-kissed island,external The claimants - now in their 70s and 80s and in poor health - have had to wait almost 60 years to seek justice for their injuries, because the government documents outlining their treatment were classified and out of reach until 2012. Cristos Socratous says he still suffers nightmares after being beaten by British soldiers Cristos Socratous said he was about 18 when he was picked up by British soldiers, detained and beaten every day for 28 days. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that people in British uniforms and civilian clothes stripped him naked, deprived him of sleep and interrogated him about planting a bomb, which he denied. ""I was so tired I couldn't stand. The pain was very bad. They had these big police truncheons and they hit me on my arms, my stomach, my chest, my legs,"" he said. After four weeks they released him, his face bloodied. ""I didn't go back to my parents' house because I didn't want my parents to see me like that,"" he said. It took about six months to recover, but Mr Socratous, who now lives in Ilford, east London, said he still suffers nightmares. ""I'm still scared,"" he said. But he declined to say if he had any involvement with EOKA, the armed group that fought against British rule. ""Whatever I did, it was for myself,"" he said. The most serious case involved the 16-year-old, who said she was detained and repeatedly raped by men she described in court documents as soldiers. She said she was then beaten for days before being forced to wear a noose in a mock execution. Her medical report revealed she has suffered lifelong physical and mental torture which has made forming relationships difficult. Anti-British demonstrations took place in Greece in the late 1950s Another man lost a kidney as a result of his interrogation in a notorious facility in Limassol, known as the Red House, and was jailed for several months for carrying leaflets supporting the EOKA forces. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme in November 2017 Demetrios Glykis recalled being chased through the streets by British military police. ""They were swearing at me, I was very scared. They threw me in their car, the back of a Land Rover and said 'we will fix you up, you bastard Greek',"" he said. ""One of officers came up to me and gave me a slap in the face. My head almost came off. My eardrum broke. ""I can't get my health back. I just want justice."" Though it has taken since 2015 to reach this settlement, the government has consistently denied liability, saying too much time has passed for a court to decide who was responsible. In a written ministerial statement, Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan said: ""The settlement does not constitute any admission of liability and is not a precedent in respect of any potential future claims against the government. ""However, the government has settled the case in order to draw a line under this litigation and to avoid the further escalation of costs, which would ultimately be borne by the taxpayer."" He added: ""It is a matter of regret for the UK government that the transition of Cyprus from British administration to independence should have been preceded by five years of violence and loss of life, affecting all residents of the island."" The Army continues to operate military bases in Cyprus, not far from the city of Limassol The small firm of Birmingham solicitors which took on the case said there was ample evidence of violent treatment, but it welcomed the settlement which has brought to an end a lengthy, costly and occasionally bitter legal battle over a dark part of Britain's colonial history. The claimants described their suffering as a stain on British history that has now been put to bed. Sir Alan said that in reaching the settlement, the UK has reaffirmed its highest respect for the memory and sacrifice of British and Cypriot service personnel and employees of the Crown who gave their lives.

"Prince William has said that every celebrity he asked to back his Heads Together mental health initiative three years ago refused. The Duke of Cambridge told the Davos World Economic Forum that ""a lot"" of stars were approached, but none wanted to be associated with mental illness. He also said the wartime generation may have helped create some of the stigma. People preferred not talk about such ""horrendous"" events, a stoic attitude passed on to their children. The prince created Heads Together, launched to help combat the stigma of mental health, in 2017 with the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. The duke told his audience of business leaders about his own struggles with mental health, saying there was one traumatic incident that he didn't think he would ""ever get over"". He said if he hadn't opened up to colleagues about the situation, he would have ""gone down a slippery slope"" mentally. How do you tackle stress in the workplace? Prince talks of 'traumatic' 999 callouts Looking visibly emotional, he said he still found the incident ""very difficult to talk about"" because it was ""related very closely to my children"", George, Charlotte and Louis. The prince has spoken previously about""very traumatic"" callouts involving children while working for the air ambulance. But he said such feelings were ""only human"", adding: ""Yes, you put a suit of armour onâ¦ but one day something comes along closely related to your own personal life and it really takes you over a line."" The issue of mental health is a big theme at this year's Davos, with several sessions on the topic. Studies show one in four people will suffer from mental illness at some point in their life,external, but many people are still too afraid of the consequences of speaking out or seeking help. Despite a greater willingness to discuss the issue, the prince said that a lot of stigma remains, meaning ""so many people are suffering in silence"". He added: ""For some reason, people are embarrassed about their emotions - British people particularly,"" he told a packed audience at Davos. He feels the British stiff upper lip that was common in previous generations has a lot to do with it. The attitude was passed onto children, especially after the First and Second world wars when it became difficult to talk about ""such horrendous circumstances"". ""A whole generation inherited [this way of coping]. This was the way you deal with your problems: you don't talk about it."" But he said ""a new generation knows that's not normal"" and is becoming aware that it's better to be open about how they are feeling. Prince William was at the panel discussion with New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern The prince urged companies to do more. ""It should be so much easier to go to HR and talk about it. It has to come from the top."" During the debate, the audience was asked whether they or anyone they knew had suffered from a mental illness. Nearly everyone in the room raised a hand. Full coverage of Davos 2019,external The Duke of Cambridge was at the forum with New Zealand's prime minister Jacinda Ardern, who has made tackling mental health problems a priority for her government. She said it was a sad fact that everyone in New Zealand, a small country of less than 5 million people, knows of ""someone who has taken their own life"". HSBC bank boss John Flint, also on the panel, said that in the ""notoriously competitive"" banking industry mental health problems were common. He said it was imperative that people at the top spoke about it to allow those lower down in the organisation to open up. ""We all sit on the spectrum [of mental health]. I know there's a profound difference between when I'm feeling my best and when I'm not,"" he added. Mr Flint said the bank was training managers to spot signs of mental health problems so they could help staff deal with them.

"This video can not be played The voice message Emiliano Sala sent on missing plane The search for a missing plane carrying a pilot and a Premier League footballer has been called off for the night. Cardiff City striker Emiliano Sala and pilot David Ibbotsonwere in the plane that vanished from radaron Monday. Guernsey Police said an ""intensive"" nine-hour search found no trace of the missing aircraft. A decision on whether to resume will be taken on Thursday. A rescuer said there was ""no hope"" of finding the 28-year-old Argentine or pilot from Crowle, Lincolnshire, alive. Channel Islands Air Search chief officer John Fitzgerald said ""even the most fit person"" would only survive for a few hours in the water. David Ibbotson (right), from Lincolnshire, has been named by police as the pilot Guernsey Police said the search, involving ""multiple aircraft and one lifeboat"", was halted as the daylight had faded. As part of rescue efforts, police have been looking at satellite images and mobile phone data. Sala reportedly sent a WhatsApp voice message before the flight. Sounding conversational and jokey, he said he was ""so scared"". Media in Argentina reported he said: ""I'm on a plane that looks like it's going to fall apart.""

It lost contact while at 2,300ft (700m) and disappeared off radar near the Casquets lighthouse, infamous among mariners as the site of many shipwrecks, eight miles (13km) north-west of Alderney.

He also confirmed the club had not booked the plane and Sala had ""made his own arrangements"". French sports newspaper L'Equipe called the news: ""The disappearance of a warrior"" Nantes fans gathered in the city to pay tribute to their former striker Air and sea crews from the Channel Islands, France and the UK took part in a 15-hour search on Tuesday, but found no trace of the aircraft, Sala or Mr Ibbotson.

The PA-46-310P Malibu aircraft Sala and Mr Ibbotson were on board The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said a PA-46-310P Malibu aircraft, registered in the United States, had a pilot and one passenger on board when it vanished. It has begun an investigation, working with counterparts in the US, France and Argentina. A spokesman said: ""We will be gathering all the available evidence to conduct a thorough investigation. However, if the aircraft is not found it is likely to limit the scope of the investigation."" The plane is owned by Southern Aircraft Consultancy Inc Trustee, in Bungay, Suffolk, according to the US Federal Aviation Administration database. The company told the BBC it was the trustee of the plane but not its ultimate owner. Julian Bray, an aviation expert and journalist, said the aircraft was a single engine, six-seater plane. He said he had listened to the WhatsApp recording by Sala and ""was particularly listening to the engine sounds and I must admit it sounded slightly ropey - it didn't sound as smooth as it should be"". Mr Bray said the request to descend by the pilot could have been due to an issue with pressure onboard the aircraft, which did not deviate from its course. He added: ""They're [the plane] equipped with life jackets, but I'm not sure whether this one had life rafts on. ""Normally in light aircraft you wouldn't carry a life raft, but you will have floatation jackets.""

"Jacob Rees-Mogg says he believes Theresa May's Brexit deal could be ""reformed"" to win round opponents. The Brexiteer  - one of 118 Tory MPs who voted against the deal last week - said he had more optimism that ""things were going our way"". But he said as long as the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" was part of the deal he would not vote for it. The EU's negotiator Michel Barnier said there were currently only two Brexit options - the PM's deal or no deal. And he warned that even if MPs decided to take no deal off the table, it would not stop it from happening unless there was ""a positive majority for another solution"". Under current law, the UK will exit the EU on 29 March, whether or not a deal has been struck. The decision to leave was taken by 52% to 48% in a referendum in June 2016. The backstop element of Mrs May's deal seeks to keep a border open between Northern Ireland and Ireland with no checks on people or goods regardless of what deal is signed. But critics say it keeps Northern Ireland too closely aligned with the EU and separate from the rest of the UK - and that the UK would be permanently trapped in it. Brexit delay is 'most likely' - Osborne Far-right groups 'could exploit Brexit' Brexit prompts Sony's Europe HQ move MPs - many of whom oppose a no deal Brexit - are proposing alternative plans to the PM's deal with the EU, including seeking an extension to the UK's exit date. The UK is currently scheduled to leave at 23:00 GMT on 29 March. The other 27 EU member states would need to agree such an extension. Mr Rees-Mogg suggested that the government could use ""prorogation"" - a procedure to shut down Parliament - to stop any backbench bills trying to delay the UK's departure. The constitutional move would involve the agreement of the Queen to bring the current session of Parliament to an end early and Mr Rees-Mogg called it the ""government's backstop"" to ensuring Brexit went ahead. But Mrs May has said the ""right way"" to ensure Brexit, and rule out no-deal, was to approve her withdrawal agreement. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn asks PM about ""third of her government at the billionairesâ jamboree in Davos"". At Prime Minister's Questions, she told MPs delaying Brexit would not ""solve the situation"", adding: ""The decision remains the same - the deal, no-deal or no Brexit."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused her of having a ""closed mind"" to other Brexit options - such his party's plan for a customs union with the EU - which he believes a majority of MPs could get behind. He also repeated his call for the PM to rule out no deal. But Mrs May attacked the Labour leader for refusing to take part in cross-party talks with her on the way forward and accused him of not understanding his own policy and its ""implications"" for UK trade. The PM met the Scottish and Welsh first ministers for talks on the next steps for Brexit on Wednesday afternoon. But speaking after the meeting in Downing Street, Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon said there was ""no real sign of any willingness to compromise"". Nicola Sturgeon believes the UK should seek an extension to Article 50 which sees the country leave the EU on 29 March Ms Sturgeon, who wants to seek an extension to Article 50 - the mechanism that sees the UK leave the EU on 29 March - said: ""There wasn't much indication that the prime minister is listening to, or hearing the concerns of people in Scotland, and no doubt across the UK, about trade, the economy and population. ""It seems to me that her priority is trying to win support from the DUP and the hard-line Brexiteers in her party, rather than genuinely trying to compromise to bring others on side, and that strikes me as a course of action that is destined to fail."" Wales' First Minister, Mark Drakeford, said the prime minister ""repeated many of her red lines"" during his meeting at No 10. He said that if the House of Commons remained deadlocked, then ""going back to the people will have to be the way forward"" and ""a prosperous future for Wales is secured by continuing membership of the EU"". Mr Rees-Mogg - who is the chairman of the pro-Leave European Research Group - gave a speech in Westminster on Wednesday saying he wanted a deal, but could not vote for Mrs May's plan while the backstop was in place. ""Everybody wants a deal; the prime minister wants a deal, the EU wants a deal and the Irish wants a deal,"" he said. ""And if the only way to get it is by re-opening the text (of the withdrawal agreement), that is what they will have to do."" After leaving Downing Street after a meeting with the government's chief whip, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said: ""There is every chance that if the UK now negotiates with conviction and if we really mean it this time we can secure the changes that we need."" The prime minister's supporters say they believe some opponents of Mrs May's deal are now willing to consider backing it because of the moves by other MPs to delay Brexit. It's definitely a maybe. Neither Jacob Rees-Mogg nor Boris Johnson are ready to say they will back Theresa May's deal (and I don't suppose either of them have much in common with the Gallagher brothers either). But after weeks of behaving as if the prime minister's compromise agreement with the EU is a heinous political crime about to be inflicted on the country, they are singing a rather different tune. Yes, they are explicit. They absolutely do not want to accept the controversial backstop for reasons we've discussed here more times than I care to remember. But the band of Brexiteers are talking now about the possibility of being able to back the deal. Read more from Laura's blog here. Not on the Irish backstop - chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said the EU would not be willing to put a time limit on it. But he said the backstop was not the ""central issue"" and the debate was now about the future shape of the UK's relationship with the EU, after it leaves with a deal. ""We're cooperating with the British government. Things could start moving rapidly,"" Mr Barniertold The Luxembourg Times.,external ""We are ready to be more ambitious if the British decide to shift their red lines, for example by remaining in a customs union, or participating in the single market. I believe there is a readiness in London for that."" Speaking later, Mr Barnier said there appeared to be a majority in the House of Commons to oppose a no-deal ""but opposing no-deal will not stop no deal from happening at the end of March... a positive majority for another solution will need to emerge"". German Economic Minister Peter Altmeir said a no deal should be avoided at all costs, and that if it meant extending UK membership of the EU beyond 29 March, Germany would be supportive, adding: ""It would certainly be considered seriously."" Next Tuesday MPs will get to vote on Theresa May's way forward on Brexit, after rejecting her initial plan by a record-breaking 230 votes last Tuesday. Mrs May is hoping to tweak the deal to address concerns about the Northern Irish ""backstop"" among her own backbenchers and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which she relies on to keep her in power. But MPs are attempting to take control of the Brexit process by tabling amendments to Mrs May's plans. Labour MP Yvette Cooper has tabled an amendment that would give time for a bill to suspend the Article 50 process for leaving the EU if a new deal has not been agreed with Brussels by the end of February. It has been backed by several Remainer Conservatives and is the only amendment that would be legally binding on the government, if passed. A guide to MPs' Brexit amendments Other amendments would ask the government to consider a range of options over six full days in Parliament before the March deadline or set up a ""Citizens' Assembly"" to give the public more say. Another proposal seeks to win over some opponents of the prime minister's deal by insisting on ""an expiry date to the backstop"", the ""insurance policy"" intended to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. This video can not be played Liam Fox is questioned on the rationale behind a potentially disruptive no deal Brexit Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC's Newsnight that it was ""highly likely"" the party would back Yvette Cooper's amendment, which would significantly increase its chances of getting through. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said delaying or cancelling Brexit with such amendments would be a ""calamitous"" breach of trust with the electorate and worse than leaving the EU with no deal, accusing those of pushing for a delay of actually wanting to stop Brexit. But Conservative Remainer Anna Soubry said it was ""not true"" that Tory MPs backing the move wanted to stop Brexit as they had voted for Mrs May's deal. Her colleague, Nick Boles, said Mr Fox had ""never been very good at detail"". The backstop isa position of last resort, designed to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland whatever arrangement the UK and the EU end up with. At present, goods and services are traded between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland with few restrictions because the UK and Ireland are both part of the EU single market and customs union, so products do not need to be inspected for customs and standards. But, after Brexit, all that could change - the two parts of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which could mean products being checked at the border. Both the UK and the EU worry that having a visible border could put the peace process at risk. This video can not be played BBC News NI's political reporter Jayne McCormack explains why the border is an issue The backstop is opposed by some Conservative MPs and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party because it could mean keeping the UK in a customs union with the EU indefinitely and having different rules for different parts of the UK. But the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said he could not give up the formal guarantee of the backstop ""for a promise that it will be all right on the night"". The European Commission also warned thatit was ""obvious"" that a no-deal Brexit would mean a hard borderin Ireland.

"This video can not be played Facebook, which owns Instagram, says it is ""deeply upset"" by the death of Molly Russell Facebook has said it is ""deeply sorry"" after it emerged a teenager who took her own life had viewed disturbing content about suicide on social media. Molly Russell, 14, died in 2017.Her father Ian sayshe believes Instagram ""helped kill my daughter"". Facebook, which owns Instagram, said graphic content which sensationalises self-harm and suicide ""has no place on our platform"". Advertisers have also raised concerns over ads being next to such posts. According to a BBC investigation, adverts for some UK high street brands are appearing alongside graphic content about self-harm, depression and suicide on the social media app. Instagram says adverts are not targeted to appear next to certain videos or content. Mr Russell earlier told the BBC how after his daughter died, the family began to look at the Instagram accounts she had been following from people who were depressed, self-harming or suicidal. This video can not be played After Molly Russell took her own life, her family discovered distressing material about suicide on her Instagram account ""Some of that content is shocking in that it encourages self harm, it links self-harm to suicide and I have no doubt that Instagram helped kill my daughter."" On Wednesday, Facebook executive Steve Hatch responded, saying: ""The first thing I'd like to say is just what a difficult story it was to read and I, like anyone, was deeply upset. ""I'm deeply sorry for how this must have been such a devastating event for their family."" When confronted with print-outs of Instagram posts showing graphic photos of self-harm, he said: ""We'd have to make sure that we look at these and ensure that those are taken down if they are against our policies. ""If people are posting in order to seek help and in order to seek support from communities, the experts in this area tell us that is a valuable thing for them to do. It can help with recovery, it can help with support. ""If it's there to sensationalise and glamourise, of course it has no place on our platform, it shouldn't be on our platform. And if we need to work harder to make sure it isn't on our platform then we certainly will."" Separately a BBC investigation found that some of the brands whose ads appeared next to disturbing images and videos include Dune, Marks and Spencer, the Post Office and the British Heart Foundation charity. They were all unaware of the problem, said they would never deliberately advertise next to such content and were committed to working with social media companies to tackle the issue. Some hashtags on Instagram lead to a world of self harm, the BBC investigation found ISBA - the trade body for advertisers - has raised concerns about adverts appearing alongside Instagram posts. Phil Smith, the head of ISBA, said: ""Brands do not want to see their advertising appearing in this context. ""What we need is an independent oversight body funded by the industry potentially international in scope which stops the platforms marking their own homework and that can give confidence to the public, the politicians and the advertisers that content is being properly independently moderated."" Molly's father said: ""The truth is that the internet is making money out of other people's misery and it shouldn't be. ""I mean that's just dreadful, that's immoral - and it's not taking enough steps to prevent that - it's not taking enough steps to safeguard young people's lives."" Reality TV 'harms youngsters' body image' University switches off social media Almost half of UK internet users 'harmed' Asked how brands can trust Facebook and Instagram, Mr Hatch said companies ""want to make sure that we're living up to the responsibilities that they have of us and I think we can always improve"". ""But there are areas where we've made significant amounts of investment, huge amounts of focus on trying to get this right. But it is recognised that this is a complex area."" Footwear retailer Dune said it was deeply shocked and saddened by the issue and would never deliberately advertise alongside such content, while Marks and Spencer said it would be ""seeking additional assurances from Instagram"". The Post Office said it would ""never target ads based on inappropriate or harmful content"" and the British Heart Foundation said ""we will be asking Instagram to act swiftly to prevent such content from being so easily accessible, shared and to protect people from viewing it"". Instagram said: ""We do not allow content that promotes or glorifies eating disorders, self-harm or suicide and work hard to remove it. ""However, for many young people, discussing their mental health journey or connecting with others who have battled similar issues, is an important part of their recovery. ""This is why we don't remove certain content and instead offer people looking at, or posting it, support when they might need it most."" Responding to concern over the placement of adverts, it said: ""Ads on Instagram are not targeted to appear next to certain videos or content. ""Ads people see are based on interests, not the content you see above and below those ads."" A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May called Molly's death a ""tragic case"", adding that she had made clear social media companies had ""a responsibility to regulate content on their platforms"" and needed to ""step up and address these concerns"". It comes after suicide prevention minister Jackie Doyle-Price announced that the government was aiming to reduce suicides by at least 10% by 2020 - in part by working ""collaboratively"" with social media and tech companies.

"Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself ""acting president"" on Wednesday US President Donald Trump has said he recognises Venezuelan opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ as interim president. The announcement came minutes after the 35-year-old declared himself acting leader in Caracas on Wednesday. A number of South American countries, including Brazil, Colombia and Peru, have also recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as Venezuela's legitimate president. It comes amid mass protests against President NicolÃ¡s Maduro who has overseen years of economic freefall. Hyperinflation, power cuts and shortages of basic items have driven millions of people out of Venezuela. Mr Maduro was sworn in for a second term earlier this month, after a vote marred by an opposition boycott and widespread claims of vote-rigging. How Venezuela's crisis developed The country that has lost three million people Mothers giving away babies, children living on streets In response to Mr Trump's recognition of the opposition leader, Mr Maduro broke diplomatic ties with the US and gave its diplomatic staff 72 hours to leave Venezuela. He accused Washington of trying to govern Venezuela from afar and said the opposition was seeking to stage a coup. ""We've had enough interventionism, here we have dignity, damn it!"" he said in a televised address from the presidential palace. Tens of thousands of people have been demonstrating against President Maduro Some counter-demonstrations are also being held in support of Mr Maduro, but these are reported to be on a much smaller scale. Earlier on Wednesday, Mr GuaidÃ³ told a cheering crowd in Caracas that the protests would continue ""until Venezuela is liberated"". ""I swear to formally assume the national executive powers as acting president,"" he said, while raising his right hand. Mr GuaidÃ³, who is head of the National Assembly, called on the armed forces - who have so far backed Mr Maduro - to disobey the government. But Venezuela's defence minister has condemned Mr GuaidÃ³, who has promised to lead a transitional government and hold free elections. The BBC's Latin America Editor Candace Piette says Mr Maduro has worked hard to keep the military leadership on his side, giving officers key government posts and offering lucrative oilfield services contracts to military-linked firms. Some 13 people had been killed during Wednesday's protests, the rights group the Venezuelan Observatory of Social Conflicts said. This video can not be played Thousands gather for rally against Venezuela's Maduro In a statement,Mr Trump described Mr Maduro's leadership as ""illegitimate"",externaland said the country's congress was the only ""legitimate branch of government"" in the country. ""The people of Venezuela have courageously spoken out against Maduro and his regime and demanded freedom and the rule of law,"" his statement said. The statement also said the US would hold Mr Maduro's regime ""directly responsible"" for any threats to the safety  of the Venezuelan people. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rejected Mr Maduro's move to cut ties with the US, saying that the US did not recognise him as leader and would instead conduct relations ""through the government of interim President GuaidÃ³"". Mr Pompeo urged Venezuela's military to support efforts to restore democracy and said the US would back Mr GuaidÃ³ in his attempts to establish a government. A senior US official also said ""all options are on the table"" and suggested tougher sanctions could be imposed on Venezuela. In the announcement, Mr Trump also urged other nations to follow suit in supporting Mr GuaidÃ³. So far, seven South American countries - Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Argentina and Paraguay - have done so. Canada has also given its backing to Mr GuaidÃ³, while European Council President Donald Tusk said he hoped the EU would ""unite in support of democratic forces"". But Mexico, Bolivia and Cuba have expressed support for Mr Maduro. This video can not be played How to get by in Venezuela, when money is in short supply The Organization of American States (OAS) has also recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as president. ""Our congratulations to @jguaido as acting President of #Venezuela,"" Secretary General Luis Almagro said in a tweet. In 2017 Venezuela announced it would withdraw from the organisation, which aims to aid co-operation across the continent - accusing it of meddling in its internal affairs. By Jonathan Marcus, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Several Latin American countries have followed the US lead, underscoring the regional antipathy to a regime that has compounded Venezuela's many problems. The question is what happens next? Does the Trump administration have a coherent plan for raising the pressure on the Maduro regime - freezing assets and so on? Crisis could simply lead to a greater calamity for the Venezuelan people. Much will depend on which way the Venezuelan military jumps. For now, its generals may be backing the current regime. But will the lower ranks remain loyal to Mr Maduro or will they heed the growing unrest inside the country and the chorus of powerful voices coming from abroad? Mr GuaidÃ³ has energised Venezuela's opposition since he became head of the National Assembly Mr GuaidÃ³ was a relatively unknown figure until he became president of Venezuela's opposition-controlled parliament earlier this month. Upon taking up the role, he said he had a constitutional right to assume the presidency until fresh elections were held. As a student, he led protests against the late socialist leader Hugo Chavez who handpicked Mr Maduro as his successor. His appointment as National Assembly leader has energised the opposition, which has been fragmented in recent years. The opposition won parliamentary elections in 2015, but in 2017 Mr Maduro set up a separate body, the constituent assembly, which has taken over legislative powers. The bridge of desperation Venezuela's migration crisis: Is enough being done? Venezuela hospitals at 'breaking point' This video can not be played What drives someone to cross South America on foot? Mr Maduro, who took office in 2013 after the death of Hugo Chavez, has been condemned at home and abroad for alleged human rights abuses and for his handling of the economy. There are severe shortages of basic items such as medicine and food, and an estimated three million people have fled the country. The annual inflation rate reached 1,300,000% in the 12 months to November 2018, according to a study by the National Assembly. Wednesday's demonstrations come just two days after27 National Guard soldiers were reported to have revolted against the governmentat a guard post in the capital, Caracas. But there is still a loyal core of people who support the government and say that Venezuela's problems are caused by a right-wing opposition supported by the US and hostile neighbours.

"Prince William has said that every celebrity he asked to back his Heads Together mental health initiative three years ago refused. The Duke of Cambridge told the Davos World Economic Forum that ""a lot"" of stars were approached, but none wanted to be associated with mental illness. He also said the wartime generation may have helped create some of the stigma. People preferred not talk about such ""horrendous"" events, a stoic attitude passed on to their children. The prince created Heads Together, launched to help combat the stigma of mental health, in 2017 with the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. The duke told his audience of business leaders about his own struggles with mental health, saying there was one traumatic incident that he didn't think he would ""ever get over"". He said if he hadn't opened up to colleagues about the situation, he would have ""gone down a slippery slope"" mentally. How do you tackle stress in the workplace? Prince talks of 'traumatic' 999 callouts Looking visibly emotional, he said he still found the incident ""very difficult to talk about"" because it was ""related very closely to my children"", George, Charlotte and Louis. The prince has spoken previously about""very traumatic"" callouts involving children while working for the air ambulance. But he said such feelings were ""only human"", adding: ""Yes, you put a suit of armour onâ¦ but one day something comes along closely related to your own personal life and it really takes you over a line."" The issue of mental health is a big theme at this year's Davos, with several sessions on the topic. Studies show one in four people will suffer from mental illness at some point in their life,external, but many people are still too afraid of the consequences of speaking out or seeking help. Despite a greater willingness to discuss the issue, the prince said that a lot of stigma remains, meaning ""so many people are suffering in silence"". He added: ""For some reason, people are embarrassed about their emotions - British people particularly,"" he told a packed audience at Davos. He feels the British stiff upper lip that was common in previous generations has a lot to do with it. The attitude was passed onto children, especially after the First and Second world wars when it became difficult to talk about ""such horrendous circumstances"". ""A whole generation inherited [this way of coping]. This was the way you deal with your problems: you don't talk about it."" But he said ""a new generation knows that's not normal"" and is becoming aware that it's better to be open about how they are feeling. Prince William was at the panel discussion with New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern The prince urged companies to do more. ""It should be so much easier to go to HR and talk about it. It has to come from the top."" During the debate, the audience was asked whether they or anyone they knew had suffered from a mental illness. Nearly everyone in the room raised a hand. Full coverage of Davos 2019,external The Duke of Cambridge was at the forum with New Zealand's prime minister Jacinda Ardern, who has made tackling mental health problems a priority for her government. She said it was a sad fact that everyone in New Zealand, a small country of less than 5 million people, knows of ""someone who has taken their own life"". HSBC bank boss John Flint, also on the panel, said that in the ""notoriously competitive"" banking industry mental health problems were common. He said it was imperative that people at the top spoke about it to allow those lower down in the organisation to open up. ""We all sit on the spectrum [of mental health]. I know there's a profound difference between when I'm feeling my best and when I'm not,"" he added. Mr Flint said the bank was training managers to spot signs of mental health problems so they could help staff deal with them. He said it made business sense given the impact problems had on workers' performance. How do you tackle stress in the workplace?

"The Knight & Lee store opened in Southsea in 1865 and was acquired by the John Lewis Partnership in 1933 John Lewis is to close its first store since 2006. The retailer said the 35,000 sq ft Knight & Lee outlet in Southsea in Hampshire was its smallest full-range department store and could not easily be modernised. John Lewis has previously acknowledged the ""challenges"" facing the High Street in the current retail climate. However, it insisted it was not planning any other closures at the moment. The store, which will close in July, is one of only two John Lewis shops in the UK to retain its original name. The retailer said the size and condition of the building ""restricts the customer offer"". John Lewis staff bonus in doubt Christmas on the High Street: Retail winners and losers Earlier this year, Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, outlined the challenges facing shopkeepers: ""Two main factors are affecting the retail sector - oversupply of physical space and relatively weak consumer demand."" He said full-year profits would be ""substantially"" lower this year and that staff, known as partners, might not be receiving an annual bonus this year, for the first time since 1953. Other retailers have been harder hit by the downturn on the nation's High Streets. Online giants such as Amazon have had a huge impact, as more consumers see online shopping as cheaper and easier than going to the shops. The trade body for shops, the British Retail Consortium, said 2018 saw the worst Christmas for retailers in 10 years. John Lewis actually saw a rise in Christmas sales year-on-year, but it has previously said that its profit margins are being squeezed by the need to match rivals' discounts. Despite this, it has dismissed the suggestion that it should abandon its ""never knowingly undersold"" price pledge. The Knight & Lee store opened in Southsea in 1865 and was acquired by the John Lewis Partnership in 1933. It was closed on Wednesday for a staff meeting, when employees were told of the plans. A statement from the company said it would require ""significant investment"" to modernise. John Lewis has acknowledged that it faces challenges Dino Rocos, partner and operations director, said: ""We have not taken this decision lightly and we considered every implication for our partners, customers and the community. ""However, a unique combination of factors, including the significant investment required and the opportunity to sell the property freehold, makes this the right decision for the financial sustainability of our business."" Portsmouth South MP Stephen Morgan said the closure would ""rip the heart out"" of Southsea. In a letter to the company, Mr Morgan said the shop was a ""well-loved asset"" in the area. ""John Lewis is much cherished and causes a significant footfall which has a beneficial impact on the surrounding businesses and our local economy,"" he said. The retailer said every effort would be made to find the 127 staff roles in nearby John Lewis and Waitrose stores.

"Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself ""acting president"" on Wednesday US President Donald Trump has said he recognises Venezuelan opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ as interim president. The announcement came minutes after the 35-year-old declared himself acting leader in Caracas on Wednesday. A number of South American countries, including Brazil, Colombia and Peru, have also recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as Venezuela's legitimate president. It comes amid mass protests against President NicolÃ¡s Maduro who has overseen years of economic freefall. Hyperinflation, power cuts and shortages of basic items have driven millions of people out of Venezuela. Mr Maduro was sworn in for a second term earlier this month, after a vote marred by an opposition boycott and widespread claims of vote-rigging. How Venezuela's crisis developed The country that has lost three million people Mothers giving away babies, children living on streets In response to Mr Trump's recognition of the opposition leader, Mr Maduro broke diplomatic ties with the US and gave its diplomatic staff 72 hours to leave Venezuela. He accused Washington of trying to govern Venezuela from afar and said the opposition was seeking to stage a coup. ""We've had enough interventionism, here we have dignity, damn it!"" he said in a televised address from the presidential palace. Tens of thousands of people have been demonstrating against President Maduro Some counter-demonstrations are also being held in support of Mr Maduro, but these are reported to be on a much smaller scale. Earlier on Wednesday, Mr GuaidÃ³ told a cheering crowd in Caracas that the protests would continue ""until Venezuela is liberated"". ""I swear to formally assume the national executive powers as acting president,"" he said, while raising his right hand. Mr GuaidÃ³, who is head of the National Assembly, called on the armed forces - who have so far backed Mr Maduro - to disobey the government. But Venezuela's defence minister has condemned Mr GuaidÃ³, who has promised to lead a transitional government and hold free elections. The BBC's Latin America Editor Candace Piette says Mr Maduro has worked hard to keep the military leadership on his side, giving officers key government posts and offering lucrative oilfield services contracts to military-linked firms. Some 13 people had been killed during Wednesday's protests, the rights group the Venezuelan Observatory of Social Conflicts said. This video can not be played Thousands gather for rally against Venezuela's Maduro In a statement,Mr Trump described Mr Maduro's leadership as ""illegitimate"",externaland said the country's congress was the only ""legitimate branch of government"" in the country. ""The people of Venezuela have courageously spoken out against Maduro and his regime and demanded freedom and the rule of law,"" his statement said. The statement also said the US would hold Mr Maduro's regime ""directly responsible"" for any threats to the safety  of the Venezuelan people. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rejected Mr Maduro's move to cut ties with the US, saying that the US did not recognise him as leader and would instead conduct relations ""through the government of interim President GuaidÃ³"". Mr Pompeo urged Venezuela's military to support efforts to restore democracy and said the US would back Mr GuaidÃ³ in his attempts to establish a government. A senior US official also said ""all options are on the table"" and suggested tougher sanctions could be imposed on Venezuela. In the announcement, Mr Trump also urged other nations to follow suit in supporting Mr GuaidÃ³. So far, seven South American countries - Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Argentina and Paraguay - have done so. Canada has also given its backing to Mr GuaidÃ³, while European Council President Donald Tusk said he hoped the EU would ""unite in support of democratic forces"". But Mexico, Bolivia and Cuba have expressed support for Mr Maduro. This video can not be played How to get by in Venezuela, when money is in short supply The Organization of American States (OAS) has also recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as president. ""Our congratulations to @jguaido as acting President of #Venezuela,"" Secretary General Luis Almagro said in a tweet. In 2017 Venezuela announced it would withdraw from the organisation, which aims to aid co-operation across the continent - accusing it of meddling in its internal affairs. By Jonathan Marcus, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Several Latin American countries have followed the US lead, underscoring the regional antipathy to a regime that has compounded Venezuela's many problems. The question is what happens next? Does the Trump administration have a coherent plan for raising the pressure on the Maduro regime - freezing assets and so on? Crisis could simply lead to a greater calamity for the Venezuelan people. Much will depend on which way the Venezuelan military jumps. For now, its generals may be backing the current regime. But will the lower ranks remain loyal to Mr Maduro or will they heed the growing unrest inside the country and the chorus of powerful voices coming from abroad? Mr GuaidÃ³ has energised Venezuela's opposition since he became head of the National Assembly Mr GuaidÃ³ was a relatively unknown figure until he became president of Venezuela's opposition-controlled parliament earlier this month. Upon taking up the role, he said he had a constitutional right to assume the presidency until fresh elections were held. As a student, he led protests against the late socialist leader Hugo Chavez who handpicked Mr Maduro as his successor. His appointment as National Assembly leader has energised the opposition, which has been fragmented in recent years. The opposition won parliamentary elections in 2015, but in 2017 Mr Maduro set up a separate body, the constituent assembly, which has taken over legislative powers. The bridge of desperation Venezuela's migration crisis: Is enough being done? Venezuela hospitals at 'breaking point' This video can not be played What drives someone to cross South America on foot? Mr Maduro, who took office in 2013 after the death of Hugo Chavez, has been condemned at home and abroad for alleged human rights abuses and for his handling of the economy. There are severe shortages of basic items such as medicine and food, and an estimated three million people have fled the country. The annual inflation rate reached 1,300,000% in the 12 months to November 2018, according to a study by the National Assembly. Wednesday's demonstrations come just two days after27 National Guard soldiers were reported to have revolted against the governmentat a guard post in the capital, Caracas. But there is still a loyal core of people who support the government and say that Venezuela's problems are caused by a right-wing opposition supported by the US and hostile neighbours. They say that US sanctions have hampered the government by making it hard to restructure its debt. Latest footage of protests.

"Administrators of Patisserie Holdings have named the 71 outlets that will close following the firm's collapse. KPMG said that 902 jobs will go due to the closure of 27 Patisserie Valerie stores, 19 Druckers and 25 Patisserie Valerie concessions. However, KPMG said it is ""business as usual"" at the remaining 122 outlets. The administrator said it was ""pleased"" with the level of interest it had received from potential buyers of the surviving parts of the business. Patisserie Valerie was forced into administration on Tuesday after it failed to reach a rescue deal with its banks. Is your local branch closing?Click here to find out Entrepreneur Luke Johnson, who bought the business in 2006, has committed more money to ensure staff are paid this month. The first signs of trouble came back in October after accounting ""irregularities"" were announced.That included ""secret overdrafts""unknown to Mr Johnson and the board. Shares in Patisserie Holdings were suspended and finance directorChris Marsh was arrested and later released on bail without charge. Mr Johnson, who owned 37% of Patisserie Holdings, kept the business going by extending it a loan, and money was raised from other shareholders. But earlier this month the company said the accounting scandal was worse than it thought. A member of staff, who did not want to be identified, told the BBC that Patisserie Valerie's collapse had come as a complete shock to them. ""Apparently everything at work was fine since October. ""I was always asking the managers, 'are you going to close the shop?' and they said no, no, no,"" said the employee. ""I'm still in shock - I couldn't sleep last night."" Employees of stores that are closing were informed by phone on Tuesday evening, and asked to attend meetings on Wednesday where they will receive further information. ""Everyone was thinking that everything was fine,"" the employee added. ""Last Wednesday, they had a meeting with all the big managers and they were making plans to make the shops better. Everyone was quite positive last week."" Are you a Patisserie Valerie employee affected by this news? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Closure notices have already appeared in some outlets Now the company that owns Patisserie Valerie could be facing legal action from investors over the collapse of the cafe chain. Chris Boxall, co-founder of Fundamental Asset Management, said he was ""flabbergasted"" by the situation. He told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme he was considering legal action as he had a ""moral duty"" to his clients. Mr Boxall questioned Mr Johnson's oversight of the business. ""What has he and the board been doing? What questions were they asking at meetings, what things were they looking at, did they ever roll up their sleeves and have look at the heart of the business which you would expect from a so-called executive director which he was in this business,"" he said. It is not clear if the target of any action might be the company or its former directors, including Mr Johnson. ""This business has gone from half a billion [pounds] valuation to nothing in a matter of months,"" Mr Boxall said. While he had questions for the former directors, he also said there were questions for the banks and the auditors. ""We're very, very angry,"" he said. There are hopes the stores which continue trading might find a buyer. Julie Palmer, regional managing partner at Begbies Traynor, is optimistic. She told BBC Radio 5's Wake Up To Money: ""It is a good brand, it has got good High Street presence, it was making good profits over a long period of time. However, she said potential buyers would be sceptical about the company's figures. In addition to Patisserie Valerie, the company's other brands include Druckers Vienna Patisserie, Philpotts, Baker & Spice and Flour Power City. Is your Patisserie Valerie branch closing?

"Snow dusted trees near Rochdale in northern England Motorists are being told to expect icy conditions and allow more time for journeys in large parts of the UK, with temperatures due to drop overnight. A Met Office yellow warning for ice,externalis in place from 18:00 GMT on Wednesday until 11:00 GMT on Thursday. The warning covers much of Scotland and northern and eastern England. The Met Office said temperatures could drop as low as -7C overnight, with wintry showers and sleet expected and the possibility of snow in some areas. It said temperatures of below freezing were expected in most areas, excluding Wales and south-west England, and clear skies would cause wet surfaces to ""freeze quite readily"". There is also a chance of snow, mainly in areas above 200m. Met Office meteorologist Martin Bowles said those travelling on Thursday morning should allow more time for journeys and take extra care on untreated roads and pavements. BBC weather presenter Ben Rich said that overnight wintry showers would move from Scotland across northern England, which could bring more snow in places, causing problems for the morning commuter period. How cold is it where you are? Check the weather where you are Snow and ice leads to 'several' car crashes Sunrise in the Lancashire town of Bacup Icy conditions caused travel disruption to some parts of the country earlier on Wednesday. The worst-affected area was north-west England, where flights and rail services were hit by delays and cancellations. The runway at Liverpool Airport was temporarily closed due to icy conditions while passengers using Manchester Airport also faced delays because of thick freezing fog. Merseyrail said there was severe disruption to its services caused by ice preventing electricity from reaching the trains. It said services had now returned to normal, with the exception of replacement buses operating between Hooton and Ellesmere Port. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played The European Commission says citizenship for sale poses security risks The EU Commission has told EU states to tighten checks on non-EU nationals who acquire citizenship - so-called ""golden passports"" - through investments. The Commission plans closer monitoring of those schemes and of ""golden visas"" granting residence in exchange for big investments. It says they can be abused for tax evasion and money-laundering. EU citizenship gives an individual free movement in most of the EU, easy access to the single market and other rights. Twenty EU countries have such schemes. Cyprus, Malta and Bulgaria give passports to non-EU nationals who make sufficient investments in their countries. Rich foreigners can buy passports there for between â¬1m (Â£870,000; $1.1m) and â¬2m. They and 17 other EU member states, including the UK, also grant residence rights to investors. That right puts an individual on the path to citizenship. The scale of investment required to obtain residence ranges from about â¬13,500 in Croatia to more than â¬5m in Luxembourg and Slovakia. In a new reportthe Commission says there is not enough information,externalabout how the schemes work. It is setting up a special team to monitor the schemes and boost information-sharing. The report says applicants can acquire citizenship of Bulgaria, Cyprus or Malta, and hence EU citizenship, ""without ever having resided in practice in the member state"". What price would you put on a passport? Are golden visas losing their sparkle? Is Malta really Europe's 'pirate base' for tax? Tax havens and the new politics The anti-corruption campaign group Global Witness said the EU had raised the alarm but not offered solutions, the BBC's Adam Fleming reports from Brussels. Cyprus has made a big effort to attract Russian investors In areport last October another anti-corruption group, Transparency International, said,externalSpain, Hungary, Latvia, Portugal and the UK had granted the most golden visas to investors and their families, ahead of Greece, Cyprus and Malta. ""Such programmes are big business. Around â¬25bn in foreign direct investment has flowed into the EU through these schemes over the past 10 years,"" it said. The Commission says the schemes often advertise the benefits of EU citizenship, such as free movement rights, in order to attract rich investors. EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova argued that people obtaining an EU nationality ""must have a genuine connection to the member state concerned"". ""We want more transparency on how nationality is granted and more co-operation between member states. There should be no weak link in the EU, where people could shop around for the most lenient scheme."" The Commission says it has several areas of concern: Security: checks run on applicants are not sufficiently robust and the EU's own centralised information systems, such as the Schengen Information System (SIS), are not being used systematically enough Money-laundering: extra checks - called ""due diligence"" - are necessary to ensure that EU rules against money-laundering are not avoided Tax evasion: monitoring and reporting is necessary to make sure that individuals do not exploit these schemes in order to gain tax advantages Transparency and information: there is a lack of clear information on how the schemes are run, including on the number of applications received, granted or rejected and the origins of the applicants; EU states are failing to inform each other about applicants ""Under none of the three investor citizenship schemes is comprehensive information available about the identity of people who successfully obtain citizenship on the basis of investment, and their countries of origin,"" the Commission report says. It also voices concern about similar schemes run by countries with ambitions to join the EU. Moldova, close to EU member Romania, is among them - its citizens enjoy visa-free travel to the EU for short stays. A non-EU national who acquires Moldovan citizenship can use it to bypass EU visa rules, the report points out. What price would you put on a passport?

"Prof Mohamed Abdel-fattah has now corrected his funding disclosure A high-profile academic has admitted he failed to declare Â£100,000 from the manufacturer making one of the types of vaginal mesh implant he was assessing. Aberdeen University's Prof Mohamed Abdel-fattah has published a correction to his original research paper almost seven years on. The change follows a complaint to the General Medical Council about him. The doctor who made the complaint said it was ""shocking"" the funding had not been declared at the time. Prof Abdel-fattah denied that there was any link between the funding and the study. Mesh implants are used by surgeons to treat conditions which some women suffer after childbirth. The synthetic mesh is used to repair damaged or weakened tissue in the woman's body. Many women have been left suffering chronic pain following the surgery. About 40,000 women across the UK have had the transobturator mesh tape procedure Tens of thousands of women across the UK have been given them over the past 20 years. However, the use of mesh in Scotland was suspended in all but ""exceptional circumstances"" in 2014 after it emerged some women had suffered painful side-effects. Prof Abdel-fattah was the lead clinician on a 2012 study that concluded that no patients were suffering thigh pain three years after their surgery. His study had compared two types of ""transobturator"" mesh tapes. In his original declaration Prof Abdel-fattah said funding, about Â£65,000, came from The Henry Smith Charity - but he did not mention the Â£100,000 received from the manufacturer of one of the devices used in the study, Coloplast. Figures show around 40,000 women across the UK have had the transobturator mesh procedure. It was the most commonly performed bladder surgery in Scotland and is also used in England. A complaint was made to the GMC in 2018 with allegations of research misconduct at various levels. Prof Abdel-fattah has now published a correction to his 2012 report,externaladmitting funding from the manufacturer but denied any link to ""any aspect of the study at any time from design to publication"". He said the research grant from Coloplast was ""inadvertently omitted"" from the original disclosure. The correction also contains a link to Prof Abdel-fattah's own declaration of interests. These include receiving money from a number of mesh manufacturers for being a consultant and trainer for mesh manufacturers including Ethicon and Coloplast. It is an implant used to treat incontinence and repair pelvic organ prolapse. The mesh - which can be synthetic or biological - can support the vaginal wall or internal organs. It is estimated more than 100,000 women have had a mesh fitted in the UK. About 27,000 were in the past 10 years - but 211 women have had it removed. Some say the implant has caused them severe pain by cutting into internal tissue. More than 800 women are taking legal action against the NHS and mesh manufacturers over the mesh. However, the vast majority have suffered no side-effects. In Scotland, health boards were ordered to stop the use of implants last year. Health guidelines in England say women should only be offered mesh surgery as a last resort, or for research purposes. Physiotherapy and traditional surgery are also an option, depending on the severity of the problem. Dr Wael Agur made the complaint to the GMC Dr Wael Agur, a consultant urogynaecologist and expert in mesh, made the original complaint to the GMC. He said Prof Abdel-fattah's study was ""highly influential"". Dr Agur said it was ""shocking"" that the funding from Coloplast had not been declared at the time. He said: ""This study had reassured us seven years ago that the use of mesh is safe - so we continued using it. ""Now we find out that the researchers had received Â£100,000 from the mesh manufacturers. Why was this money never declared at the time? ""The women trusted us to do the right thing and we thought at the time that we were doing the right thing."" Lorna Farrell is in constant pain and needs a wheelchair to get about Lorna Farrell had transobturator mesh fitted in 2008. She says she now lives in constant pain and uses a wheelchair to get about. She says her life has been ""ruined"" by mesh. Lorna told BBC Scotland: ""We need to have research into it but how can it be that the research is part-funded by the manufacturers? ""If they want to fund research why don't they speak to those who have been damaged by what they have done."" The GMC said it could not comment on individual cases. But the BBC understands a failure to declare funding from a pharmaceutical company in a research study could potentially raise an allegation about the fitness to practise of a doctor. A statement from Aberdeen University said: ""Prof Abdel-fattah has been informed by the GMC that they looked into a complaint made against him but the investigation has now been closed as of December 2018. ""Neither Prof Abdel-fattah nor the university are aware of any further ongoing investigation."" The statement added: ""The GMC did not ask him to make the amendment to the paper, he did so of his own volition in the interests of increased transparency. ""The amendment clearly stated that Coloplast had no input to the study in any form and at any stage."" The university pointed out that transobturator tapes had been the most common procedure of this sort worldwide since at least 2009. The use of mesh in Scotland has been controversial. It has been used hundreds of times since the partial suspension in 2014. Last year, transabdominal mesh was cited as an underlying factor in the death of a Scottish woman and the Scottish government called for an immediate halt to its use until a new ""restricted use protocol"" is drawn up. NHS England has also recently curbed the use of mesh on safety grounds, although it is still available as a treatment of last resort for some.

"Nathan Sutherland, 36, was responsible for the woman's care, authorities said A nurse in Arizona has been charged with sexual assault after a vulnerable patient under his care gave birth. The suspect has been named as Nathan Sutherland, 36, who worked at the Hacienda Healthcare clinic. The 29-year-old patient, who has reportedly been in the care of the clinic since she was a toddler, gave birth on 29 December. Staff at the facility said at the time that they were unaware she was pregnant until she went into labour. The child, a boy, is now in the care of the patient's family and is said to be doing well. ""We can't always choose how we come into this life, but we as a community can choose to love this child,"" Police Sgt Tommy Thompson told reporters. Phoenix police chief Jeri Williams said Mr Sutherland was identified through ""good old-fashioned police work"". After the birth, an investigation was launched into sexual assault because the woman's condition renders her unable to give consent. Mr Sutherland submitted a DNA sample under a court order. A test showed his DNA positively matched with the child. He has been charged with one count of sexual assault and one count of abusing a vulnerable adult. ""We owed this arrest to the victim,"" Chief Williams said. ""We owed this arrest to the newest member of our community, that innocent baby."" Police are also investigating whether Mr Sutherland has assaulted any other patients. It is unclear whether he was an employee or contractor who worked at any other facilities. A lawyer for the woman's family, John Michaels, said they were aware of Mr Sutherland's arrest but had no comment. The patient's family have described her as ""a beloved daughter"" with ""significant intellectual disabilities"" caused by seizures in childhood. Mr Michaels, told local media: ""She has feelings, likes to be read to, enjoys soft music and is capable of responding to people she is familiar with, especially family."" Court documents state that the woman is ""not alert"" and requires a ""maximum level of care"",the Arizona Republic reported,external. According to medical records presented to an Arizona court, a doctor gave a check-up to the woman 37 weeks before she gave birth and found no major changes to her health. Mr Sutherland is a licensed practical nurse and had worked at Hacienda Healthcare clinic since 2011, authorities said. At the time of the assault he had been responsible for care of the woman. On Wednesday, he appeared in court and was released on a cash-only $500,000 (Â£382,588) bond. His lawyer David Gregan described Mr Sutherland as a family man with young children who has lived in Arizona since 1993. ""There's no direct evidence that Mr Sutherland has committed these acts,"" Mr Gregan told reporters. ""I know at this point there's DNA. But he will have a right to his own DNA expert."" In a statement, Hacienda Healthcare said it was ""troubled beyond words"" by the news. The firm said it had given Mr Sutherland ""an extensive background check"" before starting at the clinic, and fired him as soon as its leadership team learned of the arrest. Its chief executive has resigned over the incident. Earlier this weekthe clinic said a doctor who led the woman's care had resigned, and another was suspended.

"Shepherd let Charlotte Brown drive his speedboat for a ""thrill"", the Old Bailey heard Jack Shepherd had a polished seduction routine. He would take women out for expensive meals and thrilling rides on his speedboat. But one night his fixation on trying to impress went horribly wrong when he killed his date, Charlotte Brown. Shepherd met Charlotte - or Charli, as she was known - for the first time on a December night in 2015. Before that, they'd got to know each other online through the dating website OkCupid. The 28-year-old web designer took his 24-year-old date to the Oblix restaurant on the 32nd floor of London's Shard - an unmissable skyscraper with stunning views across the capital. They ordered two bottles of wine and flatbread. When the Â£150 bill came, he paid. Man guilty of first date speedboat death They then went back to his houseboat, 10 miles away in Hammersmith, west London, by taxi, where they drank more alcohol. During the evening, Shepherd told Charlotte he had a speedboat. Later, in a police interview, he admitted: ""I think I was probably, you know, wanting to sleep with her basically, and so that was probably what I wanted to do and she wanted to go in the boat so I've gone 'OK'."" Charlotte Brown, known as Charli, was a business development consultant from London The pair headed out on his 1980s, red, 14ft Fletcher Arrowflyte GTO which he'd bought from Gumtree. The court heard the boat was badly maintained. Witnesses for the prosecution, who examined it after the accident, said it had a number of pre-existing defects, including ""poor and sloppy steering"" and a ""partially opaque"" windscreen. On the night of the accident, Shepherd sped along the Thames towards the Houses of Parliament at 30 knots - well above the 12 knot limit for that part of the river. It was cold and dark. He'd taken champagne on board, and according to his account, he let Charlotte take over the steering on their way back for a ""thrill"". Prosecutor Aftab Jafferjee QC described that decision as ""sheer madness"". Not long after Charlotte took the controls the boat crashed and capsized by Plantation Wharf. It's thought it hit a floating piece of timber or tree. Jack Shepherd told police he bought the speedboat to ""pull women"" Steven Morrissey, who lives in a flat close to Wandsworth Bridge, said in a witness statement he heard Shepherd calling out. ""He just kept saying, 'Help me, help me, somebody help me.' It was just 'help me' - not 'us', or 'her'."" Shepherd was found clinging to the upturned hull of the boat near the bridge at about 23:40. Charlotte was found in the water close by just before midnight. She was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead, with a post-mortem examination later finding she had died from cold water immersion. When emergency crews spoke to Shepherd after he was pulled from the water they said he appeared extremely confused and drunk. Jurors heard how he asked them where Charlotte was, but he couldn't remember her name. Charlotte's family sat through every day of the trial, hearing the events of that awful night retold. Shepherd didn't. All the jury knew was that he had chosen not to give evidence in his defence, but in a pre-trial hearing, which we can now report, Shepherd's defence team said they last saw him in May. The day before the trial he told them over the phone he did not intend to attend. ""Was he still in the country?"" Judge Richard Marks asked. ""We really don't know where he is,"" replied barrister Andrew McGee. When Charlotte got onto Shepherd's speedboat that night she probably didn't know he had used the same routine with several other women. But he told police after the accident he had invited 10 other dates back to his houseboat in the year he lived there and most of them had been out on his speedboat. An interviewing officer asked him: ""Don't get me wrong, is that part of your evening's events, shall we say?"" Shepherd replied: ""Yeah, I mean, I got it with the intention of, you know, trying to pull women with it, basically."" Amy Warner was one of those women. She came to court to tell the jury how she also went on a first date with Shepherd on a summer's evening just over three months before the tragedy. He had messaged her through a dating app, and later took her out on his speedboat which she described as red and ""quite old looking"". She told jurors they headed towards the Shard where they got off and had dinner at a sushi restaurant in Heron Tower, another well-known skyscraper in the City of London. ""He was driving quite fast. Obviously, from other surroundings, like boat traffic coming towards us, the water was quite choppy. I asked Jack to slow down,"" she said. He did, but Ms Warner told the court they were stopped by the river police, who spoke to Shepherd about his speeding and advised him about wearing life jackets. He didn't take that advice when he took Charlotte out though. ""Neither of us were wearing life jackets, although there were two between the seats,"" he told police afterwards. ""I did not even ask if she could swim."" A prosecution witness showed jurors various alleged defects with the boat, such as a ""wobbly"" steering wheel Although life jackets are not mandatory, jurors were told if Charlotte had been wearing one, it would have ""increased the probability"" of her survival in the water. Shepherd had also been warned by the river police for speeding on another occasion and there were others who spotted him going too fast. Glyn Richmond, pier master of Imperial Wharf, saw Shepherd's speedboat during that same summer on the Thames. He described seeing the boat going fast on three to four occasions and had spotted a girl sitting on the bow. The jury found Shepherd guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence by a majority of 11-1. Charlotte's mother, Roz Wickens, said: ""There are no words in the universe to describe how wonderful Charlotte was... the best daughter ever, my best friend. We'll never get over losing her. ""Life won't be the same. Every breath that I take, is a guilty breath, that I'm taking breath and she's not."" Shepherd is also wanted by police for failing to attend court over another unrelated matter.

"This video can not be played Cardiff City signed the 28-year-old from French club Nantes Cardiff City chairman Mehmet Dalman says there are no plans to rearrange their match at Arsenal as the search continues for a missing aircraft carrying their striker Emiliano Sala. The Argentine, 28, was one of two people on board theplane,which lost contact off Alderney in the Channel Islands on Monday night. Cardiff's next Premier League game is away at Arsenal on Tuesday, 29 January. Dalman said: ""I would be very surprised if there's any change to the schedule."" Five aircraft and two lifeboats scoured more than 1,000 square miles for traces of the Piper Malibu plane on Tuesday. The search was suspended overnight and continued from first light on Wednesday. Guernsey Police was not able to confirm if floating objects seen belonged to the aircraft and warned that chances of passenger survival were ""slim"". Sala was heading to Cardiff aftersigning for the Bluebirds from French club Nantes in a Â£15m deal. Sala - born in Argentina, made in France Sala - timeline of Cardiff City signing The striker had been in south Wales on Friday and Saturday to complete his transfer and while at Cardiff City Stadium Sala met the club's manager, Neil Warnock, and chief executive, Ken Choo. Dalman said he, Warnock, Choo and Cardiff's owner Vincent Tan have all been ""affected"" by the news of Sala's disappearance. ""Neil is human and he's as affected as we all are,"" Dalman told BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales. ""He's in the same position as we all are, very upset. It has affected the club enormously. It's a distressing time. ""This was a big decision for this club and we were in the process of negotiating something which would have been a game-changer for the club. ""Vincent is emotional, as we all are."" Earlier this season, Cardiff hosted Leicester City in theFoxes' first match since the death of their owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabhaand four other people in a helicopter crash. The Bluebirds were praised for their sensitivity on that occasion, with the club paying for Leicester fans' food and drink at the game, while Cardiff's supporters shared a specially-made banner with their Leicester counterparts. Now, following the news regarding Sala, it is Cardiff receiving the well-wishes of the football community. ""The reaction we've had from the football world - and outside the football world - has been really overwhelming,"" said Dalman. ""I've had emails and text messages from right across the world, from politicians to supporters. The family of football has a way of coming together at times of tragedy.

"Clockwise from top left: Holly Tandy, Michael Rice, Kerrie-Anne, Anisa, Maid and Jordan Clarke Six contestants will battle it out to represent the UK at the Eurovision Song Contest in Israel this May. The hopefuls, mostly drawn from the ranks of TV reality shows, were unveiled on BBC Radio 2 on Wednesday. They include Michael Rice, who won BBC singing competition All Together Now last year, and 2017 X Factor competitor Holly Tandy. Unusually, the six contestants share three songs - each putting their own spin on one of the potential entries. The public will choose who goes through to the final in a live TV show, Eurovision: You Decide, on Friday, 8 February. SuRie represented the UK in 2018 Last year, the UK fared particularly badly - with singer SuRie finishing 24th out of 26. Her performance wasinterrupted by a stage invader, who grabbed her microphone and shouted slogans about the media. The contest was eventuallywon by Israeli singer Nettawith her quirky song Toy, which encouraged people to celebrate their differences. Here's a guide to the UK's hopefuls for Tel Aviv in 2019. This video can not be played Holly Tandy's version of Bigger Than Us Who are they?Holly Tandy, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, took part in The X Factor in 2017 when she was just 16. Nicole Scherzinger praised her ""big voice"", but she struggled in the live shows, eventually finishing seventh. She has a nice hat. Hartlepool busker Michael Rice won All Together Now - that's the singing contest with 100 judges (and Geri Halliwell) - in 2018. He was working on his debut single when the opportunity to enter Eurovision came along. Is the song any good?Kind of. It's a cliche-ridden love ballad whose verses owe a sizeable melodic debt to Bonnie Raitt's infinitely superior I Can't Make You Love Me. How do the two versions differ?Michael has made it into a piano ballad that showcases his soulful vocals. It goes a bit haywire at the end with an OTT gospel choir and an unnecessary key change. Holly's version is more up-tempo with a pleasant acoustic guitar and that weird ""ghost cat"" noise that's been on every pop single since Justin Bieber's What Do You Mean. For good measure, she's thrown in a handclap-assisted breakdown for the final chorus, which could play well in front of an audience. Who wrote it?The four writers include Eurovision veterans Laurell Barker and Jonas Thander - who also played saxophone on Taylor Swift's Shake It Off. Key lyric:""I can feel the Universe when I'm feeling you breathe."" The verdict:Cinq points. This video can not be played Michael Rice's version of Bigger Than Us This video can not be played Jordan Clarke's version of Freaks Who are they?Jordan Clarke competed in series seven of Britain's Got Talent as part of the band Luminites, reaching the semi-final; and later played with short-lived pop band Chasing Midnight. He's been making music solo since they split. Maid are a newly-formed girl group consisting of the ornately-named Miracle Chance, Kat Kleve and Blythe Jandoo. They met at drama school and have stage credits including Starlight Express, The Wizard of Oz and The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Blythe will also appear in Guy Ritchie's live-action remake of Aladdin later this year. What about the song?Freaks picks up on the pop trend of celebrating people's differences - with the twist that the lyrics are totally bananas. ""I don't see the difference between me, you, your, tu or moi, vous,"" it observes, obliterating all the grammar lessons we were taught in French class. How do the two versions differ?Jordan gives Freaks a pop twist with sprightly piano chords and a chugging beat that recalls Take That's Shine. Your mum will like it. Maid describe their version as ""ethereal and dark"" - and they deliver some impressive harmonies. But the arrangement is too intricate for a Eurovision audience who prefer their songs to come withclucking chickens. Who wrote it?This one has a good pedigree: Rick Parkhouse and George Tizzard have written and produced songs for Take That, Cheryl, James Arthur, 5 Seconds of Summer and (this is not a joke) Green Day. Key lyric:It's a toss-up between ""I've been locked in a locker, I was picked last at soccer"" and ""We could all be disciples, and we'll write our own bibles"". The verdict:Deux points This video can not be played Maid's version of Freaks This video can not be played Kerrie-Anne's version of Sweet Lies Who are they?Former teacher Kerrie-Anne Phillips took part in The X Factor in 2015. She was mentored by Simon Cowell, but was eliminated at the judges' houses stage. Anisa Moghaddam was named by the BBC Asian Network as one of its Future Sounds in 2016. She's since supported Ne-Yo, Brandy and James Arthur in concert and recorded a track,Music,external, with Wretch 32. What about the song?Sweet Lies finds Anisa and Kerrie-Anne papering over the cracks of a crumbling relationship. How have they interpreted it?Kerrie-Anne takes the heartbreak and turns it into a Gloria Gaynor-style dance anthem full of house piano and bass drops. Anisa goes in the opposite direction, delivering a stripped-back ballad that clearly draws inspiration from Alicia Keys and Lauryn Hill. Who wrote it?Among the song's three writers is Lise Cabble, whose song Only Teardrops helped Denmark's Emmelie de Forest win Eurovision 2013. Key lyric:""Our love is paper thin/I need you skin to skin."" The verdict:Dix points.

"This video can not be played Jack Shepherd told police he never asked if Charlotte Brown could swim A man convicted of killing his date in a speedboat crash on the River Thames has handed himself in to police in Georgia after months on the run. Jack Shepherd was sentenced to six years in July for the manslaughter of 24-year-old Charlotte Brown. The 31-year-old had been in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi since March and was absent throughout his trial. Ms Brown's father Graham Brown said: ""I feel very emotional at the fact that my daughter will get some justice."" Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, he added: ""I do think the family will be in a much better position to deal with our loss and heartbreak over the last three years."" Mr Brown,who earlier on Wednesday gave an interview to the Victoria Derbyshire programmeurging Shepherd to hand himself in, described the fugitive as ""a very crass, reckless man who stuck two fingers up to the judiciary system"". ""He's done the right thing and thank goodness he has handed himself in,"" he added. This video can not be played Charlotte Brownâs father Graham told BBC Radio 5 Live he felt an âoverwhelming sense of emotionâ following the arrest A spokesman for the Georgian Embassy in London confirmed Shepherd's arrest, which comes afterMs Brown's family met the Home Secretary Sajid Javid on Tuesday. Under current diplomatic agreements between Georgia and the UK, Shepherd is eligible for extradition. Georgian Rustavi TV has shown footage of him before he handed himself in, during an ""exclusive interview"" in his final minutes as a ""free man"". Speaking in English, which was then voiced over and translated into Georgian, Shepherd described it as ""a tragic accident"". Jack Shepherd let Charlotte Brown drive his speedboat for a ""thrill"", the Old Bailey heard Ms Brown's sister Katie Brown said her family were ""relieved"" Shepherd had handed himself in but described him as ""arrogant"". ""To just stroll in with a very smug look on his face and to claim innocence is unbelievable. This is a small amount of justice for my sister."" The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia, the law enforcement agency in the country, previously told the BBC it was working with the Met Police to track Shepherd. Victim's father appeals to speedboat killer The speedboat seducer who made a fatal error Anger over on-the-run speedboat killer The Met said it was informed by the National Crime Agency that Shepherd was in the custody of police in Georgia. A Home Office spokesman added: ""It is now for the Crown Prosecution Service to decide on whether to make an extradition request to the Georgian authorities, via the Home Office."" Charlotte's father Graham Brown said Shepherd was ""a very crass reckless man"" After meeting on the dating website OkCupid, Shepherd took Ms Brown on a date on 8 December 2015. Shepherd spent Â£150 on wine and food at a restaurant in The Shard before taking her on a speedboat he claimed he owned. Ms Brown and Shepherd were thrown from the boat when it hit branches in the water near Wandsworth Bridge at about midnight. Shepherd was found clinging to the hull and Ms Brown, from Clacton in Essex, was pulled from the water unconscious and unresponsive. A post-mortem examination found she died from cold water immersion. By BBC correspondent Rayhan Demytrie I am outside the police station where Jack Shepherd, who is now officially under arrest, is currently being held. He will be moved to a temporary detention centre and his lawyer says according to Georgian law the detention period in this kind of case can be up to nine months. But it will be up to a judge to decide how long Shepherd will be in the custody of the Georgian police. Shepherd gave an interview to a local television station where he maintains his innocence. He says he does not agree with the court's decision and that he is now ready to co-operate with the investigation. Shepherd made his first appearance at the Old Bailey on 26 January, when he entered a not guilty plea to a charge of manslaughter by gross negligence. He was released on unconditional bail by Judge Richard Marks QC, but failed to show up for his trial in July. After his conviction an international arrest warrant was issued. Despite being on the run, Shepherdhas won the right to appeal against his conviction. Shepherd's solicitor Richard Egan said: ""In the light of today's developments I don't think it would be appropriate to comment further until Mr Shepherd is back in the jurisdiction.""

"Nathan Sutherland, 36, was responsible for the woman's care, authorities said A nurse in Arizona has been charged with sexual assault after a vulnerable patient under his care gave birth. The suspect has been named as Nathan Sutherland, 36, who worked at the Hacienda Healthcare clinic. The 29-year-old patient, who has reportedly been in the care of the clinic since she was a toddler, gave birth on 29 December. Staff at the facility said at the time that they were unaware she was pregnant until she went into labour. The child, a boy, is now in the care of the patient's family and is said to be doing well. ""We can't always choose how we come into this life, but we as a community can choose to love this child,"" Police Sgt Tommy Thompson told reporters. Phoenix police chief Jeri Williams said Mr Sutherland was identified through ""good old-fashioned police work"". After the birth, an investigation was launched into sexual assault because the woman's condition renders her unable to give consent. Mr Sutherland submitted a DNA sample under a court order. A test showed his DNA positively matched with the child. He has been charged with one count of sexual assault and one count of abusing a vulnerable adult. ""We owed this arrest to the victim,"" Chief Williams said. ""We owed this arrest to the newest member of our community, that innocent baby."" Police are also investigating whether Mr Sutherland has assaulted any other patients. It is unclear whether he was an employee or contractor who worked at any other facilities. A lawyer for the woman's family, John Michaels, said they were aware of Mr Sutherland's arrest but had no comment. The patient's family have described her as ""a beloved daughter"" with ""significant intellectual disabilities"" caused by seizures in childhood. Mr Michaels, told local media: ""She has feelings, likes to be read to, enjoys soft music and is capable of responding to people she is familiar with, especially family."" Court documents state that the woman is ""not alert"" and requires a ""maximum level of care"",the Arizona Republic reported,external. According to medical records presented to an Arizona court, a doctor gave a check-up to the woman 37 weeks before she gave birth and found no major changes to her health. Mr Sutherland is a licensed practical nurse and had worked at Hacienda Healthcare clinic since 2011, authorities said. At the time of the assault he had been responsible for care of the woman. On Wednesday, he appeared in court and was released on a cash-only $500,000 (Â£382,588) bond. His lawyer David Gregan described Mr Sutherland as a family man with young children who has lived in Arizona since 1993. ""There's no direct evidence that Mr Sutherland has committed these acts,"" Mr Gregan told reporters. ""I know at this point there's DNA. But he will have a right to his own DNA expert."" In a statement, Hacienda Healthcare said it was ""troubled beyond words"" by the news. The firm said it had given Mr Sutherland ""an extensive background check"" before starting at the clinic, and fired him as soon as its leadership team learned of the arrest. Its chief executive has resigned over the incident. Earlier this weekthe clinic said a doctor who led the woman's care had resigned, and another was suspended.

"The woman was hit by the marked car in Walthamstow shortly before midnight A 26-year-old refugee from Eritrea died when she was hit by a police car responding to a 999 call. The pedestrian was struck by the marked vehicle on Forest Road, Walthamstow, east London, at 23:45 GMT on Tuesday. Officers stopped and tried to help the woman, but she was pronounced dead at the scene when paramedics arrived, the Met said. The YMCA St Paul's Group confirmed the woman had been a resident at YMCA Walthamstow for the past 18 months. It said it was ""shocked and saddened"" by her death and was supporting its residents and staff with counselling. Gilbert James, 44, who lives on Forest Road, said he ""heard a loud bang and police sirens"". When he came out to investigate he said he ""saw the person lying on the floor"" and the police car windscreen ""completely smashed"". Forest Road was closed while investigations took place Pav Kaur, who lives nearby, said there was ""a very sombre atmosphere"" in the area. Police are trying to trace the woman's next of kin, who are thought to live outside the UK. The car had been responding to reports of a man threatening members of the public, Scotland Yard said. By the time officers arrived the man had left the scene. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which has launched an investigation, said ""two people apparently walked into the road"" as the police vehicle travelled along Forest Road. ""One of the pedestrians was struck and sadly passed away,"" the IOPC said. By Thomas Mackintosh, BBC London Forest Road reopened shortly after 09:00 this morning and traffic has been flowing through like it would on any morning. The remnants of blue and red police tape attached to a few lampposts are the only sign of what happened. Residents of the YMCA where the victim was staying believe she was Eritrean. They described seeing people looking visibly upset and crying this morning during breakfast. One resident told me the situation many of the residents living here are in meant they became close friends, which was why so many were shocked and saddened. The Met said it had referred itself to the IOPC and informed its own Directorate of Professional Standards. There were 29 police-related fatalities on the roads in 2017-18, of which 17 were ""pursuit-related"", according to IOPC and eight involved police vehicles responding to emergency calls. Five fatalities involved police vehicles hitting pedestrians while responding to an emergency call and one pedestrian death related to a pursuit. In the previous year, 2016-17, were there 32 fatalities on the roads involving the police. Of those, 28 related to pursuits and none involved police responding to emergency calls. Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy said the woman's death was ""terrible news"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

His lawyer David Gregan described Mr Sutherland as a family man with young children who has lived in Arizona since 1993. ""There's no direct evidence that Mr Sutherland has committed these acts,"" Mr Gregan told reporters. ""I know at this point there's DNA. But he will have a right to his own DNA expert."" In a statement, Hacienda Healthcare said it was ""troubled beyond words"" by the news. The firm said it had given Mr Sutherland ""an extensive background check"" before starting at the clinic, and fired him as soon as its leadership team learned of the arrest. Its chief executive has resigned over the incident. Earlier this weekthe clinic said a doctor who led the woman's care had resigned, and another was suspended.

"Mr Lewis announced his intention to sue Facebook in April 2018 Consumer campaigner Martin Lewis has dropped his legal action against Facebook over a series of ads that ran on its platform, falsely claiming he backed several investment schemes. The MoneySavingExpert website founderhad claimed the fake endorsementshad caused him reputational damage. He saidhe had dropped the case,externalbecause Facebook had agreed to introduce a scam ads reporting button. As part of the deal, Facebook will also give Â£3m to Citizens Advice. The organisation will use the money for a scheme to identify and fight online scams and support their victims. The project is set to launch in May. It will include work to develop tools to help the public identify such fraudulent activity. Facebook's investment will be made over a three-year period and consist of Â£2.5m in cash and a further Â£500,000 worth of advertising credit. ""The amount being donated to set up the Citizens Advice scams action project is far above anything I could've won had I succeeded in a court,"" Mr Lewis said in a statement. ""The aim of my campaigning lawsuit was always to stop scam ads and to help those who have fallen victim to them. ""What we're announcing today does that at a far bigger scale than I could've hoped for."" Mr Lewis announced his decision at a joint press conference with Facebook in London, which waslive-streamed on Facebook.,external These adverts were among several that appeared on Facebook He said that more than 1,000 bogus adverts had appeared on Facebook bearing his image and/or name. Some of these had pictured him giving advice on ITV's This Morning programme, while others bore the BBC logo as part of efforts to give the schemes credibility. Several claimed to involve crypto-currency speculation but Mr Lewis said they were often fronts for binary trading companies based outside of the EU, which the public would be ill advised to get involved with. Fake BBC News page used to promote Bitcoin-themed scheme Martin Lewis seeks damages for 'fake' Facebook ads Inside the TalkTalk 'Indian scam call centre' The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has warnedconsumers to be wary of binary option trading,external, saying it is a form of fixed-odds betting that typically results in losses. Facebook had initially defended its role, saying it would deal with any ads brought to its attention that infringed Mr Lewis's rights. But the campaigner accused the US company of being ineffective due to its reliance on user reports. Mr Lewis and Facebook held a joint press conference at one of the US firm's London offices At Wednesday's press conference, however, Mr Lewis said that after he had threatened to sue Facebook, the company had ""quickly realised the scale of the problem"" and agreed to commit resources to tackle the issue. Facebook's new scam ad reporting button promises to make it easier for users to flag promotions they suspect to be scams. The tech firm has pledged to support the service with a ""dedicated internal operations team"" whose job it will be to investigate the reports as well as to proactively identify related ad trends that amount to an abuse of its platforms. Facebook's regional director for northern Europe, Steve Hatch, said: ""We're grateful to Martin Lewis for bringing attention to this important issue and for his guidance over the last eight months."" Mr Lewis added that he hoped Google and other advertising platforms would also accept they needed to make improvements and should ""put their hands in their pockets"" to support Citizen Advice's work.

""Neil is human and he's as affected as we all are,"" Dalman told BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales. ""He's in the same position as we all are, very upset. It has affected the club enormously.

"Zoe Sugg (Zoella), singer Rita Ora and model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley are among those who have agreed changes Sixteen social media stars including singers Ellie Goulding and Rita Ora, models Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Alexa Chung, and vlogger Zoella have agreed to change how they post online. They will have to clearly state if they have been paid or received any gifts or loans of products they endorse. It follows warnings from the Competition and Markets Authority that their posts could break consumer law. Online endorsements can boost brands but can also mislead, said the CMA. The CMA has not made a finding on whether the influencers named breached consumer law, but said all of them volunteered to change their practices following an investigation. However, if they fail to comply with the agreement reached with the CMA, they could be taken to court and face heavy fines or prison sentences of up to two years. Actress Michelle Keegan, vlogger Jim Chapman and reality TV personality Chloe Sims were also named The celebrities named by the CMA are: Pop starRita Ora ActressMichelle Keegan SingerEllie Goulding Writer and modelAlexa Chung Designer and modelRosie Huntington-Whiteley Video bloggerZoe Sugg(who vlogs under the name Zoella) Mario Falconefrom The Only Way Is Essex Alexandra 'Binky' Felsteadfrom Made In Chelsea Holly Haganfrom Geordie Shore ModelIskra Lawrence Camilla 'Milly' Macintoshfrom Made In Chelsea Reality TV personalityMegan McKenna Chloe Simsfrom The Only Way Is Essex Louise Thompsonfrom Made In Chelsea Fashion video bloggerJames Chapman(who vlogs as Jim Chapman) Fashion bloggerDina Torkia Warning letters have been sent to a number of other unidentified celebrities, urging them to review their social media posts. by Chris Fox, technology reporter Usually when celebrities post an advert without being clear they were paid to do so, it's the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) that gives them a slap on the wrist - if a complaint is made. But while the ASA takes action against individual advertisements or campaigns, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) can take action against people. Alexa Chung, Binky Felstead and Iskra Lawrence were all named Social media platforms including Instagram already have built-in tools, such as the paid-partnership tool, which make it clear that a post is an advertorial. All 16 of the celebrities named by the CMA were being investigated because they may have broken the rules repeatedly. By agreeing to change their ways they have avoided court action, which could have led to unlimited fines or even up to two years in jail. Officially, no ruling was made on whether the stars broke the rules, because they were not taken to court this time. But the CMA says its investigation is not finished. It has sent warning letters to more influencers, and is going to investigate the social networks too. Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, said: ""Influencers can have a huge impact on what their fans decide to buy. People could, quite rightly, feel misled if what they thought was a recommendation from someone they admired turns out to be a marketing ploy. ""You should be able to tell as soon as you look at a post if there is some form of payment or reward involved, so you can decide whether something is really worth spending your hard-earned money on."" influencers must clearly label content that has been paid-for or for which they have received gifts or loans. #ad or #sponsored are examples, and must now be prominently displayed at the beginning of the post, rather than buried away among other hashtags even gifts that are made without a requirement to post about them afterwards  must be declared if they appear in social media content. #freebie is suggested as a  label it is no longer enough for influencers to declare the companies they work for in their profile. Each post must be treated in isolation and all paid-content or commercial relationships declared if an influencer is engaged in various commercial relationships related to an individual post, each one must be declared But one lawyer told the BBC that the UK's rules were still complex. ""The CMA has portrayed these posts as if some celebrities are deliberately trying to pull the wool over the eyes of their fans, but often it is just that the various guidance is difficult to follow,"" said Geraint Lloyd-Taylor, legal director at law firm Lewis Silkin. ""I think the hashtag #ad will become the default, but it seems that the CMA intends to also look more at what the platforms are doing and it might be that we see more built-in tools and other changes from them as well."" The practice of endorsing products, from clothes to cars, hotels to holidays, is widespread among so-called social media influencers who can earn tens of thousands of pounds from companies for a single post on sites such as Instagram. How much do social influencers earn? Has Fyre Festival burned influencers? Most shoppers mistrust influencers, says survey The risk is that consumers will place more trust in a product that has been recommended by someone they admire on social media. Some celebrities do use hashtags such as #ad or #sponsored to indicate that they have been paid to post content. The Advertising Standards Authority has previously flagged several of reality star Louise Thompson's posts as product endorsement The CMA will be conducting further investigations into the role and responsibilities of social media platforms. The Advertising Standards Authority launched its own investigation into advertising on social media following complaints about the practice and has flagged up content from reality TV star Louise Thompson about product endorsement on two occasions.

"This video can not be played The European Commission says citizenship for sale poses security risks The EU Commission has told EU states to tighten checks on non-EU nationals who acquire citizenship - so-called ""golden passports"" - through investments. The Commission plans closer monitoring of those schemes and of ""golden visas"" granting residence in exchange for big investments. It says they can be abused for tax evasion and money-laundering. EU citizenship gives an individual free movement in most of the EU, easy access to the single market and other rights. Twenty EU countries have such schemes. Cyprus, Malta and Bulgaria give passports to non-EU nationals who make sufficient investments in their countries. Rich foreigners can buy passports there for between â¬1m (Â£870,000; $1.1m) and â¬2m. They and 17 other EU member states, including the UK, also grant residence rights to investors. That right puts an individual on the path to citizenship. The scale of investment required to obtain residence ranges from about â¬13,500 in Croatia to more than â¬5m in Luxembourg and Slovakia. In a new reportthe Commission says there is not enough information,externalabout how the schemes work. It is setting up a special team to monitor the schemes and boost information-sharing. The report says applicants can acquire citizenship of Bulgaria, Cyprus or Malta, and hence EU citizenship, ""without ever having resided in practice in the member state"". What price would you put on a passport? Are golden visas losing their sparkle? Is Malta really Europe's 'pirate base' for tax? Tax havens and the new politics The anti-corruption campaign group Global Witness said the EU had raised the alarm but not offered solutions, the BBC's Adam Fleming reports from Brussels. Cyprus has made a big effort to attract Russian investors In areport last October another anti-corruption group, Transparency International, said,externalSpain, Hungary, Latvia, Portugal and the UK had granted the most golden visas to investors and their families, ahead of Greece, Cyprus and Malta. ""Such programmes are big business. Around â¬25bn in foreign direct investment has flowed into the EU through these schemes over the past 10 years,"" it said. The Commission says the schemes often advertise the benefits of EU citizenship, such as free movement rights, in order to attract rich investors. EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova argued that people obtaining an EU nationality ""must have a genuine connection to the member state concerned"". ""We want more transparency on how nationality is granted and more co-operation between member states. There should be no weak link in the EU, where people could shop around for the most lenient scheme."" The Commission says it has several areas of concern: Security: checks run on applicants are not sufficiently robust and the EU's own centralised information systems, such as the Schengen Information System (SIS), are not being used systematically enough Money-laundering: extra checks - called ""due diligence"" - are necessary to ensure that EU rules against money-laundering are not avoided Tax evasion: monitoring and reporting is necessary to make sure that individuals do not exploit these schemes in order to gain tax advantages Transparency and information: there is a lack of clear information on how the schemes are run, including on the number of applications received, granted or rejected and the origins of the applicants; EU states are failing to inform each other about applicants ""Under none of the three investor citizenship schemes is comprehensive information available about the identity of people who successfully obtain citizenship on the basis of investment, and their countries of origin,"" the Commission report says. It also voices concern about similar schemes run by countries with ambitions to join the EU. Moldova, close to EU member Romania, is among them - its citizens enjoy visa-free travel to the EU for short stays. A non-EU national who acquires Moldovan citizenship can use it to bypass EU visa rules, the report points out. What price would you put on a passport?

"This video can not be played Former Tesco director Carl Rogberg says there was ""never any evidence"" of wrongdoing against him A former director of Tesco has said he should never have been charged after being acquitted of fraud at the supermarket chain. Carl Rogberg also questioned why Tesco had agreed two years agoto a fine for overstating its profits in 2014. On Wednesday he was acquitted of the charges, which date back to 2014. He is the last of three former directors who had been charged to be acquitted, in a blow to the Serious Fraud Office. Last month, a judge, Sir John Royce dismissed cases against Chris Bush and John Scouler, saying ""in certain crucial areas the prosecution case was so weak it should not be left for a jury's consideration"". The investigation was sparked byan announcement by Tesco in September  2014that its profits were overstated by Â£250m. Mr Rogberg said: ""It's a huge relief that this day has finally come. While I always had faith that it would, the journey here has not been an easy one. The trial has had enormous consequences on my health and exemplary career, as well as for my wife, my son, my family and my friends."" He had not been well enough to stand trail with his former colleagues,after he suffered heart-attack during the first trial. After Wednesday's developments in Southwark Crown Court, Mr Rogberg said he had ""serious questions"" for the SFO and Tesco about the way the case had been handled. ""In short, there was never any evidence of my wrong-doing and I should never have been charged,"" he said. Chris Bush (left) and John Scouler (right) have already been acquitted In the trial of Mr Bush and Mr Scouler, the SFO had described them as ""generals"". It claimed ""foot-soldiers"" working below them were ""pressurised and coerced"" into wrongly booking income to hit targets and make the Tesco look healthier than it was. Tesco agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the SFO in 2014 and the Â£129m fine. By Jonty Bloom, business correspondent At first sight it seems like an impossible contradiction. A huge company admits its accounts have been fiddled and avoids prosecution and pays a fine of Â£129m through a deferred prosecution agreement; yet when three of its top executives are prosecuted for faking the accounts the judge throws out the case for lack of evidence. But while a company might admit guilt and even pay a large fine that doesn't necessarily mean an individual working for that company is guilty. For instance it may well be in the interests of the firm to avoid a long, costly and embarrassing trial; quickly draw a line under a crisis and concentrate on putting the company back on its feet. In this case, Tesco stresses that the DPA was approved by a High Court judge as being in the public interest. However, Mr Rogberg said today: ""Truth and justice were abandoned for their (Tesco's) commercial imperatives."" The collapse of this case exposes a question of common justice. The deferred prosecution agreement that Tesco signed when it paid that huge fine named the three defendants as the guilty men, directly contradicting the not guilty verdicts. An outcome that one of the men's lawyers described as ""an unfair and extraordinary outcome"". Mr Rogberg said Tesco had rushed its investigation and, by agreeing to the fine, had damaged employees, shareholders and pension funds which invest in the company's shares. ""Truth and justice were abandoned for their commercial imperatives,"" he said. Tesco defended the DPA -  a type of a punishment without a conviction - saying it had been ""separately approved by a senior High Court judge as being in the interests of justice"". The supermarket said the overstatement of its profits in September 2014 had been ""independently investigated and verified by [accountants] Deloitte"". Since then, Tesco said it had introduced a new model for buying and selling products, changed its management and had stronger relationships with suppliers. Mr Rogberg also criticised the SFO for making errors and described the case as a ""dreadful waste of taxpayers' money"". Tesco paid Â£3m in costs for the DPA but the other costs of the case have not yet been published. Mr Rogberg's lawyer, Neil O'May, partner at Norton Rose Fulbright, said this situation was significant as it was an acquittal that occurred as a result of insufficient evidence rather an acquittal by a jury. ""It is a finding that there was insufficient evidence on which the case could have been brought. This is unprecedented in high profile serious fraud cases,"" Mr O'May said. The SFOpublished the DPA,externalfor the first time, in which it sets out three members of Tesco's ""senior leadership team"" - Mr Bush, Mr Rogberg and Mr Scouler - who ""were aware of and dishonestly perpetuated"" the misstatement of the accounts for a six month period. Mr O'May said the DPA ""was plainly wrong as it was based on the assumption of guilt of Carl Rogberg and his colleagues"". ""Its release now, after it has been shown to be false, remains deeply prejudicial and distressing to Mr Rogberg,"" he said The DPA reveals why the SFO thought the three defendants had a case to answer but the trial judge found that there was not even enough evidence to put before the jury. Lisa Osofsky, director of the SFO, said Tesco ""dishonestly created a false account of its financial position by overstating its profits"". ""The DPA clearly outlines the extent of this criminal conduct for which the company has accepted full responsibility."" According to the DPA, Tesco expected its employees to meet financial targets when they were set which ""gave rise to a culture in which... employees were under great pressure to deliver in line with the budget"". It states that between 1 February 2014 and 18 September 2014 employees misstated commercial income by Â£257m. Ms Osofsky has been the head of the SFO since August.

" Conjoined twins - you're unlikely to see them. Only a tiny number are born each year, the vast majority of which are stillborn or die soon after birth. Marieme and Ndeye are the exceptions. At two years and eight months, they live in Cardiff, having moved with their father, Ibrahima Ndiaye, 50, from their birth place of Senegal. It's been a journey of hardship, with the family swapping a prosperous existence for one of hostels and food banks. The girls are now safe, but a shadow looms. Marieme's heart is weak - so weak, she may die. If this happens, her stronger sister Ndeye will die with her. At the moment, the twins grow each day and delight in life. But in the coming years, an unimaginable choice may lie before Ibrahima. Should he let surgeons attempt separation - risking the life of both girls, but particularly Marieme's? Or should he let both girls die together? Dakar - the capital of Senegal. A bustling city on Africa's west coast and one which gave Ibrahima a good life. A successful project manager, he worked organising holidays and events across the region, largely for French and British tourists. He was the father of older teenagers from his first marriage, and in 2015, his second wife fell pregnant. “Scans showed a girl,” Ibrahima says. “Just one girl.” Even when his wife went into labour three weeks early, a precautionary caesarean advised due to the large “bump”, nothing untoward was expected. “I was waving to my wife from behind the glass, signalling everything would be okay,” he explains. “The doctors removed the baby, then whisked it away, telling me all was fine.” Clinique Niang in Dakar, where the twins were born It was two in the morning and, like everyone else, Ibrahima was shattered, still dressed in his work suit and shoes. In fact, he was meant to be in Belgium that day, collecting an award from Brussels Airlines for his efforts in organising a charity bike tour. Reassured and relieved, he wandered outside on to the busy boulevard, breathing in the humid night air. He leaned back against a wall, thanking God for the safe delivery of his daughter. But as he did, a message came for him to return inside to meet Dr Lamine Cissé, a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology. Dr Lamine Cissé Ibrahima knew this doctor well as he had delivered two of his older children. But this time, his face was serious. Ibrahima says: “He sat me down and said, ‘We need to talk about the twins’.” Twins? Ibrahima's mind began spinning. The scans hadn't detected twins. Had his babies been swapped? Stranger things happened in Senegal... Thirty minutes later, just as Ibrahima began to accept the news, there was more to come. “So tell me... what is wrong with the twins?” he asked, slowly. “Conjoined,” Dr Cissé said. “They are conjoined.” And it was at that moment, on 18 May 2016, that Ibrahima's world changed forever. “I couldn't take it in,” Ibrahima explains. “I was silent, trying to figure out how this had been missed. “I was so angry at the people who had done the scans. “I couldn't speak, tears were coming. I was kicking things and raging against God.” It wasn't until five in the morning that Dr Cissé took Ibrahima to meet his girls, as his wife lay recovering. Ibrahima says: “I hoped it would be something simple, and that they could be separated easily. “I remember walking into the room, feeling overwhelmed but curious. “They were on scales being weighed, so the first I saw was their faces peeping upside down at me. Then I saw the conjoined arm. “I walked around the scales. They were tiny, weighing just over half a stone (3.8kg). “I couldn't understand how they were built. I was expecting four feet, instead there were two. “They were both looking at me and I froze.” It was here Dr Cissé temporarily abandoned his role as doctor and took on the mantle of counsellor. Seeing Ibrahima's desperation, he reminded him of his faith as a Sufi Muslim. Sufism is a form of Islam, which, Ibrahima explains, places strong emphasis on being a good person with an open mind. This faith had prepared him for this moment, said Dr Cissé. Bad experiences were there to be learned from. Still Ibrahima could not stop weeping. So that's when Dr Cissé told him: “If you keep doing that, what will the girls' life be? What will happen to them if you are weak?” He ordered Ibrahima to go to the toilet, to wash his face, dry his tears, then come back. Then he had one more thing to say: “This is the challenge of your life, and you have to be ready.” And so a new life began. Already parental love had engulfed Ibrahima, gripping him in a wave of protectiveness for his beautiful daughters. But Marieme, in particular, was ill - dehydrated and struggling to breathe. Options were needed and fast. Yet staff seemed confused and unsure, with the risk of the girls dying extremely high. Ibrahima raced home, grabbed some clothes then returned immediately, ready to escort his twins to the local children's hospital. Once there, the girls were linked up to machines and oxygen. But beyond the medical difficulties posed by the situation, Ibrahima faced a different problem. In a country where superstitions run deep, word of the rare birth was already leaking out. “The girls were left in a corridor where anyone could see them,” Ibrahima says. “I overheard a complete stranger saying she had a photo of them.” Enraged, Ibrahima asked to see the photo, then grabbed the phone, taking it to the management board of the hospital. “It was like a knock to the head,” he says. “It was finally dawning on me how much they needed my protection. “I couldn't calm down. I broke the phone, something I shouldn't have done, but I was furious.” Ibrahima had every reason to be worried. In many ways, since gaining independence from France in 1960, Senegal has proved to be one of Africa's success stories. It has a tradition of stable democracy, with high female representation in parliament. There is a strong love of sport, particularly basketball and wrestling, while the country is known for its warmth and generosity, the national football team dubbed the Lions of Teranga or Lions of Hospitality. But there is also a problem with how some communities view disability. “There is ignorance,” Ibrahima explains. “People might see it as a punishment from God, or believe witchcraft is involved. “This view is widespread and taboo to talk about. “There are dangerous sacrifices, and certain children can be targeted. “People would not see Marieme and Ndeye as conjoined twins. “They would see them as a baby with two heads and their lives would definitely be at risk.” And so Ibrahima's fight to protect his girls began. Following his complaints, they were moved to a secure room, away from prying eyes. There, as the girls grew, so too did a clearer picture of their bodies. They each had a healthy brain, plus their own heart and lungs. But they shared a single liver, bladder and digestive system. They had a stomach each, but these were linked, and three kidneys between them. They both had control of the conjoined arm, though mostly it was Ndeye, the stronger twin, who used it. But just as Ibrahima began to understand more about the twins' condition, so it became clear there was no plan to help them. “No-one was contacting experts,” he says. “No-one was helping them or on their side. “They were just waiting for them to die.” So this is when he finally took control. At three weeks old, the girls were sent home to where their mother was still recovering from her caesarean. Unable to tell the truth, the couple lied to friends and neighbours, explaining their child was still in hospital. But as Ibrahima returned to work, liaising with international partners to organise tourist excursions across the region, his mind was consumed. “Every break, I researched conjoined twins,” he says. “I had a challenge - out of respect for the girls, I don't wish to call it a problem - and I needed help.” An organised person, with a degree in modern languages, Ibrahima began contacting hospitals one by one, seeking out if separation might be possible. First, due to his work connection with Brussels, he tried Belgium, but he was told there was no hospital that could help. Next he tried Germany, where two of his sisters were living, but there were no hospitals with experience of such complex cases. He tried Zimbabwe, Norway, Sweden, and hospitals in America - Seattle in Washington, Jacksonville in Florida and Baltimore in Maryland. Doctors at one hospital informed him he would need to provide a million dollars before the girls could be seen. As a last resort, he tried France, hopeful because of the country's strong links to Senegal. He emailed scans and medical documents. But the reply was blunt. It told him not to bother seeking help, that the girls would die and there was no clinical solution. “I cannot tell you how much that email hurt me,” Ibrahima says. “It was so arrogant, treating the girls and I with such contempt. “Those doctors didn't have the intellectual curiosity to engage because it was a complicated case. “But challenges are where the beauty of life is, where we learn and grow. “You cannot imagine how low those doctors put me, how dark life was. “They had closed every single window of hope.” Yet as Ibrahima mourned, still Marieme and Ndeye confounded expectations. Day by day, they grew stronger, beginning to smile, then babble, their bright eyes focusing, tiny fingers gripping. In desperation, Ibrahima renewed his search. Then one day, when the girls were a few months old, he found inspiration - a video on the web of Abby and Brittany Hensel, from the US state of Minnesota. Joined in a similar way, they are now in their twenties, working as teachers and able to drive a car and play sport. For Ibrahima, the video was an astonishing discovery - proof that conjoined twins could not only survive, but thrive. In his smart Dakar office, he watched the video four, five times, slowly processing the potential implications for his own girls. “If something inspired me, it was this documentary,” he says. “I saw the determination of the family, how they had protected the children and fought for them. “I said to myself, ‘I will do this for my girls’. It boosted my determination.” His extra research led him to one place - Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, which has a strong expertise in conjoined twins. Ibrahima says: “I had never heard of it, but I contacted a consultant, Paolo De Coppi, and sent him the girls' information. “He read it over and replied so simply. “He said, ‘Come’.” Relief flooded over Ibrahima; finally someone was willing to help. Still, making a trip to London was not going to be easy. “All my financial resources had already gone on medicines, treatment and consultation fees for the girls,” he explains. “I had medical insurance through my work, but it didn't cover this.” Help was on hand, however. Senegal's first lady, Marieme Faye Sall, had heard about the girls' birth through her charity foundation, Servir Le Sénégal. Senegal's president, Macky Sall, with his wife, Marieme Faye Sall Ibrahima says: “She contacted me almost immediately offering to help with whatever I needed. “I was so grateful, when it came to naming the girls a few weeks later, I named Marieme after her.” Landing in January 2017, the family met with Dr De Coppi, a consultant paediatric surgeon. Ibrahima says: “You cannot imagine the hope and relief he gave me the first day he met  my daughters. “In Senegal, if you respect someone you lower your eyes, looking away or down. “This is how I treat him because I can see the passion he has for what he is doing. “He made me feel so strong. He said he would try to help, to just take a look. This is all I ever wanted.” Dr De Coppi, a consultant paediatric surgeon at Great Ormond Street Hospital And so the medical procedures began - the 3D scans and ultrasounds to see if the girls could possibly be separated. But as they did, so Ibrahima's personal life began to unravel. The money gifted by Senegal's first lady for flights and accommodation dried up, making the family effectively homeless in London. Due to his caring responsibilities, Ibrahima was also forced to resign from his job, rendering him without income. With the girls' safety and wellbeing paramount, he decided to seek asylum in the UK. He knew that the healthcare would not be as good in Senegal, and that the girls' lives could be at risk if they went out in public. But this was not an easy decision to make. Back in Senegal, Ibrahima's teenage children from his first marriage relied on him for money. Unable to provide it, they were now in arrears on the family's rental property and facing eviction. Meanwhile, the twins' mother, Ibrahima's second wife, decided to return to Senegal to look after her other child, leaving Ibrahima as the twins' sole carer. Now a family of three, they moved into a Home Office hostel in Croydon, south London. Ibrahima says: “I had no job, not even a single penny to my name, and both I, my girls and my older children in Senegal were homeless. “By moving to the UK, I had lost my career and home, my life and community. “But I did it willingly, to give them life.” A solution was eventually found for his children in Senegal, but back in the UK the situation did not abate. “I was very grateful for the hostel,” Ibrahima explains. “But it wasn't suitable for young children.” Without food, Ibrahima was given vouchers for a food bank. He says: “I thought they were for a supermarket. “I was fasting that day to feel closer to my faith, but I walked 40 minutes and ended up at a church in west London. “Most of the people there were homeless and I realised what it was. “I remember feeling so humiliated. How had my life come to this? “I began to cry in front of everyone, but a nun saw me and took me to a room. “I explained about the twins and why I was there. “She knew I was Muslim but asked if she could pray for us, so we sat and prayed together for 15 minutes. “Then she packed up bags with as much as I could carry and told me to come back whenever I needed.” Then, in spring 2017, news came from the consultant. Marieme's heart was too weak for surgery. If separation was attempted, she would most likely die. Ibrahima says: “As soon as I knew the situation, I did not want to proceed. How could I choose this? “But I remember feeling so sorry for the girls. “Not for me. I was not upset for me. I was just upset for their futures. “The consultant told me he would support me in their continuing care, so this is all I wanted.” It was roughly a year after this, in March 2018,that Ibrahima and the twins were moved by the Home Office to Cardiff - asylum seekers can be moved anywhere in the UK. Granted discretionary leave to remain in the UK, they now live together in a small, functional flat, close to the city centre. Here, they make their way around by bus, trying not to draw attention to themselves - tricky enough given Ibrahima's 6ft 8in (2.03m) frame. Sometimes, when the girls are spotted, people follow them down the street, or begin to pray, something Ibrahima hopes will stop. In many ways, life here is simple and joyful, albeit isolated. The girls’ speech is developing, and they can enjoy play groups and respite at Tŷ Hafan, a children's hospice. They cannot currently walk, but this may come. Like most two year olds, they both love to sing, laugh and watch CBeebies. Yet doctors know that, as each month and year passes, Marieme's heart grows weaker. At present, she is mainly being kept alive by Ndeye. She receives oxygen from Ndeye’s stronger heart and food via their linked stomachs. This situation, however, is now putting strain on Ndeye's heart and body. In late 2018, doctors told Ibrahima that if Marieme does die suddenly, it will be too late to save Ndeye. So now the ethics surrounding this case are changing and the question being asked; should separation be attempted in order to save Ndeye's life? This, at present, is not something that Ibrahima can think about. He describes it as a “black hole”, with each possible scenario putting the girls' existence at risk. His comfort comes from cooking traditional stew, singing with a small Senegalese community he has met in Bristol and his daily routine - caring for and spending time with his girls. As he prepares their dinner, he says: “To be honest, I find life here very humiliating and humbling, not having a job or salary. “But I try to remember to use this difficult time to become a better person. “I need to go through this hard time with dignity.” He adds: “For me, I need to know, in my heart, that I have done everything for them, provided them with safety and the best possible healthcare. “When I look in the mirror, I need to be at peace. “Beyond this, I have no control. “The future is uncertain but my girls battle every day for life and I feel very blessed. “I have found out through their lives what life is. “My girls are warriors and the world needs to know this.” Built with Shorthand",Positive,0.9999987
"Supermarket giant Iceland has continued to sell own-brand products containing palm oil despite pledging to stop doing so by the end of 2018. The retailermade the promise last April, saying demand for the oil was devastating rainforests in Asia. But Iceland still sells 28 own-brand products with palm oil or fat, as well as more than 600 from other brands. Iceland said it had ""fulfilled"" its promise and no longer made own-brand products containing palm oil. It added that own-brand products still available were old stock, including frozen desserts and frozen pastry products, which ""obviously have a longer shelf life than fresh and chilled food lines"". However, the BBC also found non-frozen perishable goods such as fairy cakes, hot cross buns and jam tarts - all made with palm oil - available to buy online. One product carried a logo saying it was ""new"". The BBC was also able to purchase frozen own-brand products containing palm oil in store, though not fresh ones. Palm oil banned by Iceland supermarkets Warning of palm oil threat to primates Is beauty killing the beasts? Iceland said: ""If there is fresh food on our website that is labelled as still containing palm oil, this is a website issue and our team are working quickly to resolve."" It insisted there were no Iceland own-label fresh items available that still contained palm oil. Since the BBC contacted the retailer, a number of products containing palm oil have been marked as ""currently unavailable"" on the website. The BBC was able to purchase numerous Iceland products containing palm oil in store Iceland has spent weeks telling its customers on social media that it has achieved that goal while its website states the company is ""simply saying no to palm oil"". In some stores, a cartoon orangutan featured in the supermarket's ""No palm oil"" promotional campaign appears at checkouts. Even before the end of 2018, Iceland tweeted one customer to say: ""There's no palm oil in our own-brand products."" It has repeated this claim on social media multiple times since. When the BBC put it to Iceland that there was in fact still palm oil in its own-brand products, it said it now expected there to be no more products available to buy with palm oil ""within the next few weeks"". ""The Iceland no palm oil pledge is that by the end of 2018, 100 per cent of the supermarket's own label food lines will contain no palm oil, reducing demand for palm oil by more than 500 tonnes per year."" A supposedly ""new"" product containing palm oil for sale on the Iceland website on 23 January John Sauven, executive director of environmental charity Greenpeace UK, said: ""If they still have old stock on their shelves, they need to make that clear to consumers in order to fulfil the promise they made."" In November, Iceland attempted to run a Christmas advert - originally a short film made by Greenpeace - telling the story of an orangutan whose home had been destroyed by deforestation caused by the palm oil trade. Due to UK legislation surrounding political messaging on TV, the advert was never broadcast - yet the supermarket received significant attention and praise from consumers online. The Iceland/Greenpeace advert highlights the impact that palm oil production is having on the planet Responding to the news Iceland was still selling products containing palm oil, a spokesman for consumer organisation Ethical Consumer said: ""If the target has been missed, it should now be revised and the company should be transparent about how they are dealing with problems they have faced in their supply chain. ""This transparency would have two positive effects - firstly it would maintain customer trust and secondly it could help other producers overcome similar difficulties."" Iceland became the first UK supermarket to announce the removal of palm oil from its products when it made the pledge last year. Palm oil cultivation can destroy habitats for orangutans Palm oil production is said to have been responsible for about 8% of the world's deforestation between 1990 and 2008 Burning large areas of forests to clear areas where oil palms can be grown has also been blamed for high levels of air pollution in South East Asia Palm oil is used in almost half the products stocked by UK supermarkets and can be found in everything from shampoos to biscuits, as well as biofuels Some experts say eating palm oil is unhealthy because it is high in saturated fat EU labelling laws were changed in 2014 so products must now state specifically if they contain palm oil Palm oil banned by Iceland supermarkets Is beauty killing the beasts?

"Jacob Rees-Mogg says he believes Theresa May's Brexit deal could be ""reformed"" to win round opponents. The Brexiteer  - one of 118 Tory MPs who voted against the deal last week - said he had more optimism that ""things were going our way"". But he said as long as the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" was part of the deal he would not vote for it. The EU's negotiator Michel Barnier said there were currently only two Brexit options - the PM's deal or no deal. And he warned that even if MPs decided to take no deal off the table, it would not stop it from happening unless there was ""a positive majority for another solution"". Under current law, the UK will exit the EU on 29 March, whether or not a deal has been struck. The decision to leave was taken by 52% to 48% in a referendum in June 2016. The backstop element of Mrs May's deal seeks to keep a border open between Northern Ireland and Ireland with no checks on people or goods regardless of what deal is signed. But critics say it keeps Northern Ireland too closely aligned with the EU and separate from the rest of the UK - and that the UK would be permanently trapped in it. Brexit delay is 'most likely' - Osborne Far-right groups 'could exploit Brexit' Brexit prompts Sony's Europe HQ move MPs - many of whom oppose a no deal Brexit - are proposing alternative plans to the PM's deal with the EU, including seeking an extension to the UK's exit date. The UK is currently scheduled to leave at 23:00 GMT on 29 March. The other 27 EU member states would need to agree such an extension. Mr Rees-Mogg suggested that the government could use ""prorogation"" - a procedure to shut down Parliament - to stop any backbench bills trying to delay the UK's departure. The constitutional move would involve the agreement of the Queen to bring the current session of Parliament to an end early and Mr Rees-Mogg called it the ""government's backstop"" to ensuring Brexit went ahead. But Mrs May has said the ""right way"" to ensure Brexit, and rule out no-deal, was to approve her withdrawal agreement. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn asks PM about ""third of her government at the billionairesâ jamboree in Davos"". At Prime Minister's Questions, she told MPs delaying Brexit would not ""solve the situation"", adding: ""The decision remains the same - the deal, no-deal or no Brexit."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused her of having a ""closed mind"" to other Brexit options - such his party's plan for a customs union with the EU - which he believes a majority of MPs could get behind. He also repeated his call for the PM to rule out no deal. But Mrs May attacked the Labour leader for refusing to take part in cross-party talks with her on the way forward and accused him of not understanding his own policy and its ""implications"" for UK trade. The PM met the Scottish and Welsh first ministers for talks on the next steps for Brexit on Wednesday afternoon. But speaking after the meeting in Downing Street, Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon said there was ""no real sign of any willingness to compromise"". Nicola Sturgeon believes the UK should seek an extension to Article 50 which sees the country leave the EU on 29 March Ms Sturgeon, who wants to seek an extension to Article 50 - the mechanism that sees the UK leave the EU on 29 March - said: ""There wasn't much indication that the prime minister is listening to, or hearing the concerns of people in Scotland, and no doubt across the UK, about trade, the economy and population. ""It seems to me that her priority is trying to win support from the DUP and the hard-line Brexiteers in her party, rather than genuinely trying to compromise to bring others on side, and that strikes me as a course of action that is destined to fail."" Wales' First Minister, Mark Drakeford, said the prime minister ""repeated many of her red lines"" during his meeting at No 10. He said that if the House of Commons remained deadlocked, then ""going back to the people will have to be the way forward"" and ""a prosperous future for Wales is secured by continuing membership of the EU"". Mr Rees-Mogg - who is the chairman of the pro-Leave European Research Group - gave a speech in Westminster on Wednesday saying he wanted a deal, but could not vote for Mrs May's plan while the backstop was in place. ""Everybody wants a deal; the prime minister wants a deal, the EU wants a deal and the Irish wants a deal,"" he said. ""And if the only way to get it is by re-opening the text (of the withdrawal agreement), that is what they will have to do."" After leaving Downing Street after a meeting with the government's chief whip, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said: ""There is every chance that if the UK now negotiates with conviction and if we really mean it this time we can secure the changes that we need."" The prime minister's supporters say they believe some opponents of Mrs May's deal are now willing to consider backing it because of the moves by other MPs to delay Brexit. It's definitely a maybe. Neither Jacob Rees-Mogg nor Boris Johnson are ready to say they will back Theresa May's deal (and I don't suppose either of them have much in common with the Gallagher brothers either). But after weeks of behaving as if the prime minister's compromise agreement with the EU is a heinous political crime about to be inflicted on the country, they are singing a rather different tune. Yes, they are explicit. They absolutely do not want to accept the controversial backstop for reasons we've discussed here more times than I care to remember. But the band of Brexiteers are talking now about the possibility of being able to back the deal. Read more from Laura's blog here. Not on the Irish backstop - chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said the EU would not be willing to put a time limit on it. But he said the backstop was not the ""central issue"" and the debate was now about the future shape of the UK's relationship with the EU, after it leaves with a deal. ""We're cooperating with the British government. Things could start moving rapidly,"" Mr Barniertold The Luxembourg Times.,external ""We are ready to be more ambitious if the British decide to shift their red lines, for example by remaining in a customs union, or participating in the single market. I believe there is a readiness in London for that."" Speaking later, Mr Barnier said there appeared to be a majority in the House of Commons to oppose a no-deal ""but opposing no-deal will not stop no deal from happening at the end of March... a positive majority for another solution will need to emerge"". German Economic Minister Peter Altmeir said a no deal should be avoided at all costs, and that if it meant extending UK membership of the EU beyond 29 March, Germany would be supportive, adding: ""It would certainly be considered seriously."" Next Tuesday MPs will get to vote on Theresa May's way forward on Brexit, after rejecting her initial plan by a record-breaking 230 votes last Tuesday. Mrs May is hoping to tweak the deal to address concerns about the Northern Irish ""backstop"" among her own backbenchers and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which she relies on to keep her in power. But MPs are attempting to take control of the Brexit process by tabling amendments to Mrs May's plans. Labour MP Yvette Cooper has tabled an amendment that would give time for a bill to suspend the Article 50 process for leaving the EU if a new deal has not been agreed with Brussels by the end of February. It has been backed by several Remainer Conservatives and is the only amendment that would be legally binding on the government, if passed. A guide to MPs' Brexit amendments Other amendments would ask the government to consider a range of options over six full days in Parliament before the March deadline or set up a ""Citizens' Assembly"" to give the public more say. Another proposal seeks to win over some opponents of the prime minister's deal by insisting on ""an expiry date to the backstop"", the ""insurance policy"" intended to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. This video can not be played Liam Fox is questioned on the rationale behind a potentially disruptive no deal Brexit Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC's Newsnight that it was ""highly likely"" the party would back Yvette Cooper's amendment, which would significantly increase its chances of getting through. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said delaying or cancelling Brexit with such amendments would be a ""calamitous"" breach of trust with the electorate and worse than leaving the EU with no deal, accusing those of pushing for a delay of actually wanting to stop Brexit. But Conservative Remainer Anna Soubry said it was ""not true"" that Tory MPs backing the move wanted to stop Brexit as they had voted for Mrs May's deal. Her colleague, Nick Boles, said Mr Fox had ""never been very good at detail"". The backstop isa position of last resort, designed to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland whatever arrangement the UK and the EU end up with. At present, goods and services are traded between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland with few restrictions because the UK and Ireland are both part of the EU single market and customs union, so products do not need to be inspected for customs and standards. But, after Brexit, all that could change - the two parts of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which could mean products being checked at the border. Both the UK and the EU worry that having a visible border could put the peace process at risk. This video can not be played BBC News NI's political reporter Jayne McCormack explains why the border is an issue The backstop is opposed by some Conservative MPs and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party because it could mean keeping the UK in a customs union with the EU indefinitely and having different rules for different parts of the UK.

"Spanish-owned bank Santander is slashing its branch network by almost a fifth, putting 1,270 jobs at risk. The bank blamed the closures on ""changes in how customers are choosing to carry out their banking"". It said branch transactions have fallen 23% in the last three years, while digital transactions have soared 99%. ""We have had to take some very difficult decisions over our less visited branches,"" said Susan Allen, head of retail and business banking. The bank said its remaining network of 614 branches will be made up of larger branches offering improved community facilities and smaller branches using the latest technology to offer more convenience. Is your local branch closing?Click here to find out. '60 bank branches closing each month' Bank closure 'last one for 15 miles' Millions have lost half their local banks It plans to spend Â£55m over the next two years refurbishing 100 branches to fit its new branch vision. ""We continue to believe that branches have a vital role to play,"" said Ms Allen. ""We are confident that following these changes we will have the right branch network to serve our customers' changing needs, and we expect the size of our network to remain stable for the foreseeable future."" Santander said it has consulted trade unions on the closures and will seek to find alternative roles for the 1,270 workers hit. The closures start on 25 April when branches at Bathgate, Bideford, Clitheroe, Corby, Eastcote, Helensburgh, Oakham and two in London will shut their doors. The shut down programme will continue throughout the year with the last of the planned closures hitting branches in Edinburgh, Guildford, London, Norwich and Nottingham on 12 December. Britain's High Street banks have been busy shutting down branches in recent years. Consumer group Which? has calculated that at least 3,101 closures have been announced since 2015, which works out at more than 60 disappearing every month. Gareth Shaw, head of Which? Money, said: ""These closures will come as a blow for all those who rely on access to traditional banking services."" He warned that even though the use of online banking is on the rise, a third of the country still does not bank online. Mr Shaw also pointed out that recent IT failures shows ""such systems are not infallible"". Millions of consumers still need access to cash, he said. ""It is vital for a regulator to be given responsibility for ensuring that people have access to the services they rely on,"" Mr Shaw said. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that nearly 6,000 local branches have shut since 2010: that's a fall of a third. It's mainly to do with cost. Maintaining a bank branch and paying staff is an expensive business. Closing branches and selling the properties can also generate funds that can be used elsewhere in the business. Customers are also becoming less likely to set foot in a branch, preferring to use their smartphone or computer. The Way We Bank Now report, published last year by UK Finance, revealed that there were about 5.5 billion log-ins to banking apps in the previous year, up 13%.

"Jacob Rees-Mogg says he believes Theresa May's Brexit deal could be ""reformed"" to win round opponents. The Brexiteer  - one of 118 Tory MPs who voted against the deal last week - said he had more optimism that ""things were going our way"". But he said as long as the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" was part of the deal he would not vote for it. The EU's negotiator Michel Barnier said there were currently only two Brexit options - the PM's deal or no deal. And he warned that even if MPs decided to take no deal off the table, it would not stop it from happening unless there was ""a positive majority for another solution"". Under current law, the UK will exit the EU on 29 March, whether or not a deal has been struck. The decision to leave was taken by 52% to 48% in a referendum in June 2016. The backstop element of Mrs May's deal seeks to keep a border open between Northern Ireland and Ireland with no checks on people or goods regardless of what deal is signed. But critics say it keeps Northern Ireland too closely aligned with the EU and separate from the rest of the UK - and that the UK would be permanently trapped in it. Brexit delay is 'most likely' - Osborne Far-right groups 'could exploit Brexit' Brexit prompts Sony's Europe HQ move MPs - many of whom oppose a no deal Brexit - are proposing alternative plans to the PM's deal with the EU, including seeking an extension to the UK's exit date. The UK is currently scheduled to leave at 23:00 GMT on 29 March. The other 27 EU member states would need to agree such an extension. Mr Rees-Mogg suggested that the government could use ""prorogation"" - a procedure to shut down Parliament - to stop any backbench bills trying to delay the UK's departure. The constitutional move would involve the agreement of the Queen to bring the current session of Parliament to an end early and Mr Rees-Mogg called it the ""government's backstop"" to ensuring Brexit went ahead. But Mrs May has said the ""right way"" to ensure Brexit, and rule out no-deal, was to approve her withdrawal agreement. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn asks PM about ""third of her government at the billionairesâ jamboree in Davos"". At Prime Minister's Questions, she told MPs delaying Brexit would not ""solve the situation"", adding: ""The decision remains the same - the deal, no-deal or no Brexit."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused her of having a ""closed mind"" to other Brexit options - such his party's plan for a customs union with the EU - which he believes a majority of MPs could get behind. He also repeated his call for the PM to rule out no deal. But Mrs May attacked the Labour leader for refusing to take part in cross-party talks with her on the way forward and accused him of not understanding his own policy and its ""implications"" for UK trade. The PM met the Scottish and Welsh first ministers for talks on the next steps for Brexit on Wednesday afternoon. But speaking after the meeting in Downing Street, Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon said there was ""no real sign of any willingness to compromise"". Nicola Sturgeon believes the UK should seek an extension to Article 50 which sees the country leave the EU on 29 March Ms Sturgeon, who wants to seek an extension to Article 50 - the mechanism that sees the UK leave the EU on 29 March - said: ""There wasn't much indication that the prime minister is listening to, or hearing the concerns of people in Scotland, and no doubt across the UK, about trade, the economy and population. ""It seems to me that her priority is trying to win support from the DUP and the hard-line Brexiteers in her party, rather than genuinely trying to compromise to bring others on side, and that strikes me as a course of action that is destined to fail."" Wales' First Minister, Mark Drakeford, said the prime minister ""repeated many of her red lines"" during his meeting at No 10. He said that if the House of Commons remained deadlocked, then ""going back to the people will have to be the way forward"" and ""a prosperous future for Wales is secured by continuing membership of the EU"". Mr Rees-Mogg - who is the chairman of the pro-Leave European Research Group - gave a speech in Westminster on Wednesday saying he wanted a deal, but could not vote for Mrs May's plan while the backstop was in place. ""Everybody wants a deal; the prime minister wants a deal, the EU wants a deal and the Irish wants a deal,"" he said. ""And if the only way to get it is by re-opening the text (of the withdrawal agreement), that is what they will have to do."" After leaving Downing Street after a meeting with the government's chief whip, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said: ""There is every chance that if the UK now negotiates with conviction and if we really mean it this time we can secure the changes that we need."" The prime minister's supporters say they believe some opponents of Mrs May's deal are now willing to consider backing it because of the moves by other MPs to delay Brexit. It's definitely a maybe. Neither Jacob Rees-Mogg nor Boris Johnson are ready to say they will back Theresa May's deal (and I don't suppose either of them have much in common with the Gallagher brothers either). But after weeks of behaving as if the prime minister's compromise agreement with the EU is a heinous political crime about to be inflicted on the country, they are singing a rather different tune. Yes, they are explicit. They absolutely do not want to accept the controversial backstop for reasons we've discussed here more times than I care to remember. But the band of Brexiteers are talking now about the possibility of being able to back the deal. Read more from Laura's blog here. Not on the Irish backstop - chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said the EU would not be willing to put a time limit on it. But he said the backstop was not the ""central issue"" and the debate was now about the future shape of the UK's relationship with the EU, after it leaves with a deal. ""We're cooperating with the British government. Things could start moving rapidly,"" Mr Barniertold The Luxembourg Times.,external ""We are ready to be more ambitious if the British decide to shift their red lines, for example by remaining in a customs union, or participating in the single market. I believe there is a readiness in London for that."" Speaking later, Mr Barnier said there appeared to be a majority in the House of Commons to oppose a no-deal ""but opposing no-deal will not stop no deal from happening at the end of March... a positive majority for another solution will need to emerge"". German Economic Minister Peter Altmeir said a no deal should be avoided at all costs, and that if it meant extending UK membership of the EU beyond 29 March, Germany would be supportive, adding: ""It would certainly be considered seriously."" Next Tuesday MPs will get to vote on Theresa May's way forward on Brexit, after rejecting her initial plan by a record-breaking 230 votes last Tuesday. Mrs May is hoping to tweak the deal to address concerns about the Northern Irish ""backstop"" among her own backbenchers and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which she relies on to keep her in power.

"This video can not be played The voice message Emiliano Sala sent on missing plane The search for a missing plane carrying a pilot and a Premier League footballer has been called off for the night. Cardiff City striker Emiliano Sala and pilot David Ibbotsonwere in the plane that vanished from radaron Monday. Guernsey Police said an ""intensive"" nine-hour search found no trace of the missing aircraft. A decision on whether to resume will be taken on Thursday. A rescuer said there was ""no hope"" of finding the 28-year-old Argentine or pilot from Crowle, Lincolnshire, alive. Channel Islands Air Search chief officer John Fitzgerald said ""even the most fit person"" would only survive for a few hours in the water. David Ibbotson (right), from Lincolnshire, has been named by police as the pilot Guernsey Police said the search, involving ""multiple aircraft and one lifeboat"", was halted as the daylight had faded. As part of rescue efforts, police have been looking at satellite images and mobile phone data. Sala reportedly sent a WhatsApp voice message before the flight.

However, if the aircraft is not found it is likely to limit the scope of the investigation."" The plane is owned by Southern Aircraft Consultancy Inc Trustee, in Bungay, Suffolk, according to the US Federal Aviation Administration database. The company told the BBC it was the trustee of the plane but not its ultimate owner. Julian Bray, an aviation expert and journalist, said the aircraft was a single engine, six-seater plane. He said he had listened to the WhatsApp recording by Sala and ""was particularly listening to the engine sounds and I must admit it sounded slightly ropey - it didn't sound as smooth as it should be"". Mr Bray said the request to descend by the pilot could have been due to an issue with pressure onboard the aircraft, which did not deviate from its course. He added: ""They're [the plane] equipped with life jackets, but I'm not sure whether this one had life rafts on.

"This video can not be played Former UK chancellor George Osborne Former Chancellor George Osborne has said delaying the UK's exit from the EU is now the ""most likely"" option. The UK has to choose between no deal - which he compared to Russian roulette - or no Brexit for now, he told the BBC. But Theresa May says the best option is to approve her withdrawal agreement, which MPs rejected last week. And International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told the BBC that if MPs blocked Brexit it could have ""calamitous"" and ""unforeseen consequences"". Under current law, the UK will exit the EU on 29 March, whether or not a deal has been struck. The decision to leave was taken by 52% to 48% in a referendum in June 2016. Mr Osborne, now a newspaper editor, was chancellor and a key Remain campaigner at the time. Speaking to BBC business editor Simon Jack in Davos, Mr Osborne said that the prospect of no deal meant ""the gun is held to the British economy's head"". ""Russian roulette is a game which you should never play because there's a one-in-six chance that the bullet goes into your head,"" he said. No-deal Brexit 'means hard border' Brexit prompts Sony's Europe HQ move Far-right groups 'could exploit Brexit' Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Mr Osborne, who was sacked by Mrs May when she became prime minister after the referendum, said his successor Philip Hammond had ""sensibly"" told businesses that leaving without a deal was not a possibility. ""But we now need to hear it from the British prime minister,"" he said. Mr Osborne said that although there might be a majority in Parliament to prevent no deal, it was not clear how MPs would achieve it. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC's Newsnight that it was ""highly likely"" the party would back an amendment put forward by Labour MP Yvette Cooper, with support from MPs in other parties. It would give time for a bill to suspend the Article 50 process for leaving the EU if a new deal has not been agreed with Brussels by the end of February.

A guide to MPs' Brexit amendments Brexit: A really simple guide Why are MPs putting forward amendments? It is one ofseveral alternative plansby MPs that will be put forward when Mrs May returns to the Commons on 29 January to set out her own proposed next steps. Among the MPs' plans are to consider a range of options over six full days in Parliament before the March deadline or hold a representative ""Citizens' Assembly"" to give the public more say. Another proposal seeks to win over some opponents of the prime minister's deal by insisting on ""an expiry date to the backstop"", the ""insurance policy"" intended to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. The backstop is opposed by some Conservative MPs and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party because it could mean keeping the UK in a customs union with the EU indefinitely and having different rules for different parts of the UK. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics But the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said he could not give up the formal guarantee of the backstop ""for a promise that it will be all right on the night"".

Instructed the government to rule out a ""disastrous no deal"" scenario (this optionwas supported by some Brexiteers but many MPs feared it would cause chaos at ports and disruption for businesses) and allowed Parliament to consider - and vote on - options including: An alternative Brexit deal involvingLabour's plan for a permanent customs unionwith Brussels and a version of the EU's single market Legislating to hold a public vote on either a deal or a proposition that has MPs' support Called for an extension of Article 50 Ruled out a no-deal Brexit Emphasised the role of the UK nations in the Brexit process Forced the government to make time for MPs to discuss a range of alternatives to the prime minister's Brexit plan on six full days in the Commons before 26 March. MPs would have been able to table amendments to be voted on at the end of the debate, which could have included alternative Brexit options such as Labour's plan, a second referendum,no dealand theNorway-style relationshippreferred by some MPs. This had the backing of some Labour backbenchers, as well as the SNP's Philippa Whitford, Lib Dem Tom Brake, Plaid Cymru's Jonathan Edwards and Caroline Lucas, of the Greens. Attempted to rule out the UK leaving the EUwithout a formal dealby allowing Parliament time to pass a new law. The bill to bring in the new law would have required Theresa May to seek to postpone Brexit day (currently 29 March) until 31 December, if MPs did not approve her deal by 26 February. The prime minister would have had to do this by asking the EU to agree to extend the two-year limit on Article 50 - the mechanism paving the way for the UK to leave the EU. It had the backing of senior Conservative backbenchers such as Nicky Morgan and Oliver Letwin, former Lib Dem health minister Norman Lamb and Plaid Cymru's Ben Lake. The Labour leadership had also decided to get behind this amendment and ordered Labour MPs to vote for it. But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said he backed limiting any extension to a ""short window"" of three months to allow time for renegotiation. Required the government to ask the EU to postpone Brexit day (without specifying for how long). Seeks to prevent a""no-deal"" Brexitby adding to the PM's motion that Parliament ""rejects the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without aWithdrawal Agreementand aFramework for the Future Relationship"". The two MPs are in neighbouring constituencies and have raised concerns over local manufacturing supply chains. Calls for Parliament to require the backstop to be replaced with ""alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border"" but otherwise supports the prime minister's deal. Theresa May ordered Conservative MPs to vote for this amendment. Some Conservative rebels, who voted against the prime minister two weeks ago, said it was too vague and did not address their other concerns about her deal. Others, such as former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, said they would support it if Mrs May indicated that she would press the EU to re-open the withdrawal agreement to make changes to the backstop that would be legally binding - something she has told MPs that she will do. Northern Ireland's DUP, which keeps Mrs May in power, also indicated they would back the Brady amendment. Neither of the Spelman nor the Brady amendments are binding on the government, although support for them puts political pressure on Theresa May to follow their direction. Theresa May has already said she will return to Brussels to reopen negotiations on legally-binding alternatives to the ""backstop"".

"This video can not be played The voice message Emiliano Sala sent on missing plane The search for a missing plane carrying a pilot and a Premier League footballer has been called off for the night. Cardiff City striker Emiliano Sala and pilot David Ibbotsonwere in the plane that vanished from radaron Monday. Guernsey Police said an ""intensive"" nine-hour search found no trace of the missing aircraft. A decision on whether to resume will be taken on Thursday. A rescuer said there was ""no hope"" of finding the 28-year-old Argentine or pilot from Crowle, Lincolnshire, alive. Channel Islands Air Search chief officer John Fitzgerald said ""even the most fit person"" would only survive for a few hours in the water. David Ibbotson (right), from Lincolnshire, has been named by police as the pilot Guernsey Police said the search, involving ""multiple aircraft and one lifeboat"", was halted as the daylight had faded. As part of rescue efforts, police have been looking at satellite images and mobile phone data. Sala reportedly sent a WhatsApp voice message before the flight. Sounding conversational and jokey, he said he was ""so scared"". Media in Argentina reported he said: ""I'm on a plane that looks like it's going to fall apart."" This video can not be played Emiliano Sala signed for Cardiff City FC on Saturday Sala was heading to the Welsh capital aftersigning for the Bluebirds from French club Nantes in a Â£15m deal. The single-engine plane left Nantes, north-west France, at 19:15 on Monday and had been flying at 5,000ft (1,500m) over the Channel Islands when it contacted Jersey air traffic control requesting descent. It lost contact while at 2,300ft (700m) and disappeared off radar near the Casquets lighthouse, infamous among mariners as the site of many shipwrecks, eight miles (13km) north-west of Alderney. Flowers and tributes have been left outside Cardiff City Stadium Fans in Nantes have left their own tributes in the city's main square Mr Fitzgerald said: ""Sadly, I really don't think, personally, there is any hope. At this time of year the conditions out there are pretty horrendous if you are actually in the water.""

The ""family of football has a way of coming together at times of tragedy,"" he told BBC Radio Wales'Good Morning Wales. He also confirmed the club had not booked the plane and Sala had ""made his own arrangements"". French sports newspaper L'Equipe called the news: ""The disappearance of a warrior"" Nantes fans gathered in the city to pay tribute to their former striker Air and sea crews from the Channel Islands, France and the UK took part in a 15-hour search on Tuesday, but found no trace of the aircraft, Sala or Mr Ibbotson. Meanwhile Sala's father Horacio told Argentine media on Tuesday: ""The hours go by and it makes me think of the worst. ""I just want them to find him.

The PA-46-310P Malibu aircraft Sala and Mr Ibbotson were on board The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said a PA-46-310P Malibu aircraft, registered in the United States, had a pilot and one passenger on board when it vanished. It has begun an investigation, working with counterparts in the US, France and Argentina. A spokesman said: ""We will be gathering all the available evidence to conduct a thorough investigation. However, if the aircraft is not found it is likely to limit the scope of the investigation."" The plane is owned by Southern Aircraft Consultancy Inc Trustee, in Bungay, Suffolk, according to the US Federal Aviation Administration database. The company told the BBC it was the trustee of the plane but not its ultimate owner. Julian Bray, an aviation expert and journalist, said the aircraft was a single engine, six-seater plane. He said he had listened to the WhatsApp recording by Sala and ""was particularly listening to the engine sounds and I must admit it sounded slightly ropey - it didn't sound as smooth as it should be"". Mr Bray said the request to descend by the pilot could have been due to an issue with pressure onboard the aircraft, which did not deviate from its course. He added: ""They're [the plane] equipped with life jackets, but I'm not sure whether this one had life rafts on. ""Normally in light aircraft you wouldn't carry a life raft, but you will have floatation jackets.""

"Survivors of violent and sexual crime are being ""re-traumatised"" by the government's compensation body, the victims' commissioner has said. Baroness Newlove said her review found the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) was needlessly forcing survivors to repeat traumatic details. That body seemed ""calculated to frustrate and alienate"" those it should be helping, she said. The Ministry of Justice, which oversees the CICA, is considering the findings. Victims of sexual or violent crimes, including bereaved relatives of murder victims, are able to claim money from the CICA to help them recover. That financial support can help them access counselling or improve safety measures around their home. 'Same roof' crime compensation rule ended Sex assault forensic centres 'failing victims' Recorded crime up in England and Wales However, Baroness Newlove said the process of claiming support is often having a ""detrimental impact"" on their wellbeing. Under the system, people need to provide details of the crimes against them including times, dates and addresses. ""Evidence demonstrates that completing this part of the CICA application form is highly traumatic as it re-triggers memories of the incident,"" the Conservative peer wrote. ""Yet, in every case, the CICA apply to the police for a full copy of the victim statement and reports so the need for the victim to repeat their story on their application form is unclear."" Holly Brannigan said the compensation process forced her to repeatedly ""relive"" the attack Holly Brannigan, whose fiance Daniel Murphy had his jaw broken in three places in an unprovoked attack in 2014, said the compensation process forced her to repeatedly ""relive"" the attack. Almost four years after the couple began their compensation claim, they have not reached an agreement and are going to a tribunal over the case. Ms Brannigan said the authority queried that Mr Murphy had undergone surgery - she says X-rays show three metal plates in his jaw. ""Every time that they contact me wanting more information, which they already have, I have to relive it,"" Ms Brannigan said. ""I have to get out medical records and it's just a constant reminder for me and for Dan of what we had to go through."" The CICA has previously been criticised by campaigners for withholding compensation on arbitrary grounds. In 2017 it emergedthe authority was being investigated over concerns it had refused compensation to victims of child sexual abuseon the basis that they ""consented"" to the attack. The authority changed its guidelines after pressure from charities. In her report, Baroness Newlove called for the Ministry of Justice to review a rule that withheld compensation from victims who had criminal convictions. Baroness Newlove said claiming compensation can have a ""detrimental impact"" on victims' wellbeing She spoke to more than 200 victims, as well as police commissioners, support services and lawyers. Fewer than two-in-five people could remember being told about their entitlement to claim by the police or victim services. ""This raises a question as to whether there are potentially thousands of victims who fail to claim compensation,"" Baroness Newlove said. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""Whilst no amount of compensation can make up for the immense suffering endured by victims of violent crime, we are committed to ensuring that they receive the help and support needed to rebuild their lives. ""We take this duty very seriously, which is why as part of our victims strategy last year we pledged to look at the difficulties faced by some when applying for compensation."" Its own review of the system is scheduled to report back later this year.

"Mason is studying for his GCSEs Fifteen-year-old Mason Kettley, who has a rare brain cancer, is about to become one of the first NHS UK patients to have proton-beam therapy, at a new dedicated treatment centre. He is starting treatment at the Â£125m centre at Manchester's Christie hospital. Previously, most patients needing the treatment had to travel abroad. The specialist radiotherapy targets cancers without damaging tissues around the tumours. This is good for children who are at risk of lasting damage to organs that are still growing but it is available in only a handful of countries around the world. Radiographers David Kirk and Melissa Bentley with a test dummy as they demonstrates the new proton-beam therapy centre at the Christie hospital, in Manchester Mason, from Angmering, West Sussex, was diagnosed with a brain tumour in October. ""I had some headaches and stomach pains and usual things, and got check-ups at the doctors,"" he said. ""My mum said, 'He's not gaining weight or growing.'"" An MRI scan showed he had a rare pilomyxoid astrocytoma brain tumour. It couldn't be operated on because of a risk of blindness and other ""catastrophic"" complications. ""The machine is intimidating because of its size,"" he said. ""It's a bit nerve-wracking but this is a better choice than chemo because it's more effective. ""Because of my age, [doctors] thought radiation would be a better choice."" Patients have been able to travel overseas for NHS funded treatment since 2008. But some haven't been able to travel because they are too ill or their treatment need was too urgent. The travel also caused major upheaval to families at a very stressful time. This video can not be played What is proton-beam therapy? The Christie hospital centre opened in autumn 2018. The first patient to have PBT there, who is still undergoing treatment, did not want publicity. A second health service PBT centre is also set to open in the UK, at London's University College Hospital, offering the therapy from 2020. It is hoped that each will each treat up to 750 patients every year. The Clatterbridge Cancer Centre in Merseyside has been delivering low-energy proton therapy specifically for NHS patients with eye tumours. But the two new centres will be the first to deliver higher doses to a broader range of cancers - including brain, head and neck cancers and sarcoma, a rare cancer of soft tissue. Both will carry out research to assess PBT's suitability for treating other cancers. Proton-beam therapy made headlines around the world in 2014, whenthe parents of five-year-old Ashya King were arrestedafter taking him abroad for the treatment in Prague. Oncologist Gillian Whitfield is leading Mason's care. She said his was a low grade (slow growing) tumour with a ""high chance of cure"". ""For Mason, in comparison to conventional radiotherapy, PBT should carry a lower risk of some important long-term side-effects of treatment - particularly effects on short-term memory and learning ability - and the risk over the next eight decades of the radiation causing other tumours. ""This is particularly important for children and teenagers with curable tumours, who will survive decades after treatment and are at much greater risk of serious long-term effects of treatment than adults."" Mason, who lives with his mother, step-father, and four siblings, and is in the middle of preparing for his GCSEs, will have 28 treatment sessions taking place Monday to Friday for almost six weeks. He has had a specially made radiotherapy mask created to keep his head perfectly still during the therapy. And while he may get short-term side effects such as vomiting and headaches, long-term side-effects are rare. And he said his experiences as a patient had influenced his future career plans. ""I'm so grateful to all the doctors involved in my care and I'd love to do what they do one day - it will be my way of giving something back.""

"Mr Lewis announced his intention to sue Facebook in April 2018 Consumer campaigner Martin Lewis has dropped his legal action against Facebook over a series of ads that ran on its platform, falsely claiming he backed several investment schemes. The MoneySavingExpert website founderhad claimed the fake endorsementshad caused him reputational damage. He saidhe had dropped the case,externalbecause Facebook had agreed to introduce a scam ads reporting button. As part of the deal, Facebook will also give Â£3m to Citizens Advice. The organisation will use the money for a scheme to identify and fight online scams and support their victims. The project is set to launch in May. It will include work to develop tools to help the public identify such fraudulent activity. Facebook's investment will be made over a three-year period and consist of Â£2.5m in cash and a further Â£500,000 worth of advertising credit. ""The amount being donated to set up the Citizens Advice scams action project is far above anything I could've won had I succeeded in a court,"" Mr Lewis said in a statement. ""The aim of my campaigning lawsuit was always to stop scam ads and to help those who have fallen victim to them. ""What we're announcing today does that at a far bigger scale than I could've hoped for."" Mr Lewis announced his decision at a joint press conference with Facebook in London, which waslive-streamed on Facebook.,external These adverts were among several that appeared on Facebook He said that more than 1,000 bogus adverts had appeared on Facebook bearing his image and/or name. Some of these had pictured him giving advice on ITV's This Morning programme, while others bore the BBC logo as part of efforts to give the schemes credibility. Several claimed to involve crypto-currency speculation but Mr Lewis said they were often fronts for binary trading companies based outside of the EU, which the public would be ill advised to get involved with. Fake BBC News page used to promote Bitcoin-themed scheme Martin Lewis seeks damages for 'fake' Facebook ads Inside the TalkTalk 'Indian scam call centre' The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has warnedconsumers to be wary of binary option trading,external, saying it is a form of fixed-odds betting that typically results in losses. Facebook had initially defended its role, saying it would deal with any ads brought to its attention that infringed Mr Lewis's rights. But the campaigner accused the US company of being ineffective due to its reliance on user reports. Mr Lewis and Facebook held a joint press conference at one of the US firm's London offices At Wednesday's press conference, however, Mr Lewis said that after he had threatened to sue Facebook, the company had ""quickly realised the scale of the problem"" and agreed to commit resources to tackle the issue. Facebook's new scam ad reporting button promises to make it easier for users to flag promotions they suspect to be scams. The tech firm has pledged to support the service with a ""dedicated internal operations team"" whose job it will be to investigate the reports as well as to proactively identify related ad trends that amount to an abuse of its platforms. Facebook's regional director for northern Europe, Steve Hatch, said: ""We're grateful to Martin Lewis for bringing attention to this important issue and for his guidance over the last eight months."" Mr Lewis added that he hoped Google and other advertising platforms would also accept they needed to make improvements and should ""put their hands in their pockets"" to support Citizen Advice's work.

"Protests erupted over a steep increase in fuel prices A government-appointed human rights group in Zimbabwe has accused soldiers of using ""systematic torture"" in a crackdown on protests. The Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission strongly criticised authorities,externalfor using troops to quell demonstrations. Unrest broke out more than a week ago following a sharp rise in fuel prices. A government spokesman defended the crackdown, telling the BBC: ""When things get out of hand, a bit of firmness is needed."" Reports have emerged of assaults allegedly carried out by the military in various parts of the capital, Harare. Soldiers in Harare were seen beating a large group of minibus drivers on Tuesday. The BBC's Andrew Harding in Harare spoke to a man who said he and about 30 others had been rounded up and beaten by soldiers for ""more than two hours"". When you wait seven hours and still get no fuel The most expensive fuel in the world? The continuing violence raises further questions about President Emmerson Mnangagwa's control over the military, which helped bring him to power 14 months ago, our correspondent adds. President Mnangagwa has promised that abuses against civilians will not be tolerated. This video can not be played Roads were barricaded by protesters last week In a blunt statement, the commission said at least eight deaths had been reported since last week, ""mostly attributed to use of live ammunition"". ""Armed and uniformed members of the Zimbabwe National Army and the Zimbabwe Republic Police instigated systematic torture."" It said the torture was ""organised"" in that security forces targeted men close to where barricades had been erected, and near areas torched by protesters or looted. The commission detailed reports of security forces entering houses at night and making men, and even boys as young as 11, lie on the ground where they were then beaten. ""The deployment of the army in quelling civilian disturbances leads to loss of life and serious bodily injuries and other human rights violations, yet the government continues to make such deployments,"" the statement said. Other reports say at least 12 people have been killed and scores treated for gunshot injuries. More than 600 people have been arrested in relation to the protests - with rights groups and opposition lawmakers saying many have been detained arbitrarily. Pastor Evan Mawarire, a prominent activistwho led the 2016 protests against Robert Mugabe, was arrested on 16 January and remains in detention. On Monday Mr Mnangagwa, 76, broke off a trip to Europe to deal with the continuing unrest. He had been due to attend the Davos economic summit where he was expected to seek investment for Zimbabwe. Back in Harare, he took to Twitter to urge all sides to work together to fix a broken economy. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a series of tweets, he said violence or misconduct by security forces was ""unacceptable  and a betrayal of the new Zimbabwe"", adding: ""If required, heads will roll."" Mr Mnangagwa announced a steep increase in the fuel price earlier this month. The price rises were meant to tackle fuel shortages, but mean that Zimbabwe now has the most expensive fuel in the world, according toGlobalPetrolPrices.com,external. Many Zimbabweans, worn down by years of economic hardship, have suddenly found they cannot even afford the bus fare to work. This led to angry protests in Harare and the south-western city of Bulawayo. Ellen Ngwenia, a pre-school teacher in Epworth, told the BBC: ""I'm not afraid to protest, because we are hungry."" Her mother, the school's headteacher, was killed in last week's protests after being hit by an army truck. Teacher Ellen Ngwenia insists she will carry on protesting Ms Ngwenia, who blames the government for her mother's death, said ""we will continue protesting until things [are] settled."" It accuses the opposition MDC party of using the protests for political means. Presidential spokesman George Charamba said on Sunday: ""The MDC leadership has been consistently pushing out the message that they will use violent street action to overturn the results of [last year's] ballot."" The opposition rejected a court ruling in August 2018 that confirmed President Mnangagwa had defeated MDC leader Nelson Chamisa The MDC said on Tuesday that five of its MPs had been detained and refused bail. Party official Morgen Komichi dismissed Mr Mnangagwa's announcement of an investigation into security forces, saying: ""We don't trust his word. We don't regard him as an honest leader."" The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, the umbrella group that called the protests, says its leader, Japhet Moyo, has also been arrested. Mr Chamisa told the BBC there was ""no justification whatsoever of having soldiers with live ammunition, with guns, machine guns, AK47 on the streets, beating up citizens"". ""People are being approached in their homes, they are being taken out of their homes with their families even if they are sleeping... a lot of people have been arrested for no apparent reason,"" he said.

"Children are turning their backs on sugary drinks, with the numbers drinking them falling by a third over the past nine years, a survey suggests. About half of children do not drink them - and those that do are drinking fewer than children in 2008-09 did. The shift has contributed to an overall reduction in sugar consumption. However, all age groups still consumed above the recommended levels, according to the nine-year analysis of theUK National Diet and Nutrition Survey,external. The lifesaving food 90% arenât eating enough of Healthy eating: What is a correct food portion? Climate change food calculator: What's your diet's carbon footprint? Meat, veg, nuts - a diet designed to feed 10bn But on other measures, diet has not improved, the report, from the Food Standards Agency and Public Health England, said. Fruit and vegetable consumption remains largely unchanged and is still under the recommended five-a-day level. Fibre intake has fallen slightly, while vitamin and mineral consumption is down. And there has been little change in oily fish intake. Emer Delaney, of the British Dietetic Association, said she was pleased with the progress that has been made. She said the reduction in sugary drinks consumption was ""important"", adding: ""It shows change can be made - and it is happening slowly, but surely."" But she conceded more needed to be done to get people to increase fruit and vegetable consumption. ""Frozen and tinned fruit and vegetables are just as good - we need to encourage people to use them as well as fresh products."" There is a long way to go yet. The first thing to note is the definition of being a ""consumer"" used by the survey team. They asked people to keep diaries over four days and those who did not have a sugary drink over that time period were classed as a non-consumer. On that basis, half of children were classed as having them in the latest survey. Nonetheless, the drop in consumption levels is welcome news for health experts who have spent the past decade warning about the dangers of them. The tax on sugary drinks was introduced in 2018 - after this survey was carried out - but the change in the law was preceded by a number of years of debate about the sugar content of these drinks. A typical can of cola is enough to breach the recommended daily sugar intake for children in one go. The warnings appear to have had an impact. Around three-quarters of children were consumers of sugary drinks at the start of the period. But despite this progress, sugar consumption is still too high. Official health advice recommends that no more than 5% of calories should come from sugar, but children are getting more than twice this amount. The five-a-day message has been around for a long-time - the government campaign was launched in 2003. But it seems to be having little impact. Over the nine years there has been hardly any change in the amount people consume. Adults under 65 are eating around four portions a day on average. Older adults and children even less. The five-a-day campaign is based on advice from the World Health Organization, which recommends eating a minimum of 400g of fruit and vegetables a day to lower the risk of serious health problems, such as heart disease, stroke and some types of cancer. Five-a-day was chosen because it was viewed as realistic. Research has suggested that to get maximum benefit people should be eating twice that amount. Apples and pears, citrus fruits, salads and green leafy vegetables and vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower were found to be best.

"This video can not be played Former Tesco director Carl Rogberg says there was ""never any evidence"" of wrongdoing against him A former director of Tesco has said he should never have been charged after being acquitted of fraud at the supermarket chain. Carl Rogberg also questioned why Tesco had agreed two years agoto a fine for overstating its profits in 2014. On Wednesday he was acquitted of the charges, which date back to 2014. He is the last of three former directors who had been charged to be acquitted, in a blow to the Serious Fraud Office. Last month, a judge, Sir John Royce dismissed cases against Chris Bush and John Scouler, saying ""in certain crucial areas the prosecution case was so weak it should not be left for a jury's consideration"". The investigation was sparked byan announcement by Tesco in September  2014that its profits were overstated by Â£250m. Mr Rogberg said: ""It's a huge relief that this day has finally come. While I always had faith that it would, the journey here has not been an easy one. The trial has had enormous consequences on my health and exemplary career, as well as for my wife, my son, my family and my friends."" He had not been well enough to stand trail with his former colleagues,after he suffered heart-attack during the first trial. After Wednesday's developments in Southwark Crown Court, Mr Rogberg said he had ""serious questions"" for the SFO and Tesco about the way the case had been handled. ""In short, there was never any evidence of my wrong-doing and I should never have been charged,"" he said. Chris Bush (left) and John Scouler (right) have already been acquitted In the trial of Mr Bush and Mr Scouler, the SFO had described them as ""generals"". It claimed ""foot-soldiers"" working below them were ""pressurised and coerced"" into wrongly booking income to hit targets and make the Tesco look healthier than it was. Tesco agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the SFO in 2014 and the Â£129m fine. By Jonty Bloom, business correspondent At first sight it seems like an impossible contradiction. A huge company admits its accounts have been fiddled and avoids prosecution and pays a fine of Â£129m through a deferred prosecution agreement; yet when three of its top executives are prosecuted for faking the accounts the judge throws out the case for lack of evidence. But while a company might admit guilt and even pay a large fine that doesn't necessarily mean an individual working for that company is guilty. For instance it may well be in the interests of the firm to avoid a long, costly and embarrassing trial; quickly draw a line under a crisis and concentrate on putting the company back on its feet. In this case, Tesco stresses that the DPA was approved by a High Court judge as being in the public interest. However, Mr Rogberg said today: ""Truth and justice were abandoned for their (Tesco's) commercial imperatives."" The collapse of this case exposes a question of common justice. The deferred prosecution agreement that Tesco signed when it paid that huge fine named the three defendants as the guilty men, directly contradicting the not guilty verdicts. An outcome that one of the men's lawyers described as ""an unfair and extraordinary outcome"". Mr Rogberg said Tesco had rushed its investigation and, by agreeing to the fine, had damaged employees, shareholders and pension funds which invest in the company's shares. ""Truth and justice were abandoned for their commercial imperatives,"" he said. Tesco defended the DPA -  a type of a punishment without a conviction - saying it had been ""separately approved by a senior High Court judge as being in the interests of justice"". The supermarket said the overstatement of its profits in September 2014 had been ""independently investigated and verified by [accountants] Deloitte"". Since then, Tesco said it had introduced a new model for buying and selling products, changed its management and had stronger relationships with suppliers. Mr Rogberg also criticised the SFO for making errors and described the case as a ""dreadful waste of taxpayers' money"". Tesco paid Â£3m in costs for the DPA but the other costs of the case have not yet been published. Mr Rogberg's lawyer, Neil O'May, partner at Norton Rose Fulbright, said this situation was significant as it was an acquittal that occurred as a result of insufficient evidence rather an acquittal by a jury. ""It is a finding that there was insufficient evidence on which the case could have been brought. This is unprecedented in high profile serious fraud cases,"" Mr O'May said. The SFOpublished the DPA,externalfor the first time, in which it sets out three members of Tesco's ""senior leadership team"" - Mr Bush, Mr Rogberg and Mr Scouler - who ""were aware of and dishonestly perpetuated"" the misstatement of the accounts for a six month period. Mr O'May said the DPA ""was plainly wrong as it was based on the assumption of guilt of Carl Rogberg and his colleagues"". ""Its release now, after it has been shown to be false, remains deeply prejudicial and distressing to Mr Rogberg,"" he said The DPA reveals why the SFO thought the three defendants had a case to answer but the trial judge found that there was not even enough evidence to put before the jury. Lisa Osofsky, director of the SFO, said Tesco ""dishonestly created a false account of its financial position by overstating its profits"". ""The DPA clearly outlines the extent of this criminal conduct for which the company has accepted full responsibility."" According to the DPA, Tesco expected its employees to meet financial targets when they were set which ""gave rise to a culture in which... employees were under great pressure to deliver in line with the budget"". It states that between 1 February 2014 and 18 September 2014 employees misstated commercial income by Â£257m. Ms Osofsky has been the head of the SFO since August.

"The ad was supposed to show that '#DGLovesChina' The Chinese model featured in a Dolce & Gabbana ad campaign accused of racism has said the controversy almost ruined her career. Three videos, released in November, showed Zuo Ye struggling to eat Italian food including cannoli and pizza with chopsticks. Widely seen as offensive it led to a severe backlash in China with several retailers pulling the brand's products. Ms Zuo said she felt ""guilty and ashamed"" but asked for understanding. Following her statement on Chinese social media network Weibo, the debate has flared up again with some people saying they hope that she can continue her career as a model and that they understand her hands were tied working with D&G. In a long post on Monday, Ms Zuo said that usually working for an international brand like D&G would be an exciting career step but that in this case ""it nearly killed off my modelling career"". She explains she understands that ""it's about representing the national image of China and Chinese culture"" and that she ""therefore feels even more guilty and ashamed"". She also vowed to ""improve my behaviour"" in the future. Consumers called for a boycott of D&G products in China Dolce & Gabbana products pulled in China D&G cancels show amid racism accusations According to her statement, she knew the shoot was about trying Italian delicacies but that she felt very awkward when she was asked to eat food like pizza and pasta with chopsticks. The director told her to show first shock and disbelief, then roll her eyes, and eventually delight and satisfaction at the presumed tastiness of said Italian dishes, she said. The model explains that she didn't see the final clip before it was released. She also writes she didn't receive any support during the backlash, even when she, her family and agent were all targeted in widespread attacks on social media. Since Ms Zuo's post, opinion has been divided on Chinese social media. While some see her as a victim of the Italian brand and sympathise with her experience, others remain critical saying she only had herself to blame. Others again point out the problem with the powerlessness of models in the industry as a whole where they are often made to do things they might not necessarily want to do. Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana asked for forgiveness In November last year, D&G released the videos on social media ahead of a fashion show in Shanghai. The entire campaign was accused of trivialising Chinese culture and promoting unflattering stereotypes. ""Chinese consumers are not naÃ¯ve; they will spot insincerity and tokenism a mile off, and respond accordingly,"" Dr Julie Bilby of the department of media and communication at RMIT University in Melbourne told the BBC. The controversy escalated further when screenshots were circulated showing designer Stefano Gabbana allegedly insulting China in an Instagram chat. D&G insisted the account had been hacked and apologised publicly for the controversial ad campaign. The Italian luxury company was forced to cancel the fashion show in Shanghai and their products were removed from several Chinese online retailers. Consumers in China also called for a boycott of the brand.

However, if the aircraft is not found it is likely to limit the scope of the investigation."" The plane is owned by Southern Aircraft Consultancy Inc Trustee, in Bungay, Suffolk, according to the US Federal Aviation Administration database. The company told the BBC it was the trustee of the plane but not its ultimate owner. Julian Bray, an aviation expert and journalist, said the aircraft was a single engine, six-seater plane. He said he had listened to the WhatsApp recording by Sala and ""was particularly listening to the engine sounds and I must admit it sounded slightly ropey - it didn't sound as smooth as it should be"". Mr Bray said the request to descend by the pilot could have been due to an issue with pressure onboard the aircraft, which did not deviate from its course. He added: ""They're [the plane] equipped with life jackets, but I'm not sure whether this one had life rafts on.

"The woman was hit by the marked car in Walthamstow shortly before midnight A 26-year-old refugee from Eritrea died when she was hit by a police car responding to a 999 call. The pedestrian was struck by the marked vehicle on Forest Road, Walthamstow, east London, at 23:45 GMT on Tuesday. Officers stopped and tried to help the woman, but she was pronounced dead at the scene when paramedics arrived, the Met said. The YMCA St Paul's Group confirmed the woman had been a resident at YMCA Walthamstow for the past 18 months. It said it was ""shocked and saddened"" by her death and was supporting its residents and staff with counselling. Gilbert James, 44, who lives on Forest Road, said he ""heard a loud bang and police sirens"". When he came out to investigate he said he ""saw the person lying on the floor"" and the police car windscreen ""completely smashed"". Forest Road was closed while investigations took place Pav Kaur, who lives nearby, said there was ""a very sombre atmosphere"" in the area. Police are trying to trace the woman's next of kin, who are thought to live outside the UK. The car had been responding to reports of a man threatening members of the public, Scotland Yard said. By the time officers arrived the man had left the scene. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which has launched an investigation, said ""two people apparently walked into the road"" as the police vehicle travelled along Forest Road. ""One of the pedestrians was struck and sadly passed away,"" the IOPC said. By Thomas Mackintosh, BBC London Forest Road reopened shortly after 09:00 this morning and traffic has been flowing through like it would on any morning. The remnants of blue and red police tape attached to a few lampposts are the only sign of what happened. Residents of the YMCA where the victim was staying believe she was Eritrean. They described seeing people looking visibly upset and crying this morning during breakfast. One resident told me the situation many of the residents living here are in meant they became close friends, which was why so many were shocked and saddened. The Met said it had referred itself to the IOPC and informed its own Directorate of Professional Standards. There were 29 police-related fatalities on the roads in 2017-18, of which 17 were ""pursuit-related"", according to IOPC and eight involved police vehicles responding to emergency calls. Five fatalities involved police vehicles hitting pedestrians while responding to an emergency call and one pedestrian death related to a pursuit. In the previous year, 2016-17, were there 32 fatalities on the roads involving the police. Of those, 28 related to pursuits and none involved police responding to emergency calls.

"The ""febrile"" atmosphere around Brexit could be exploited by far-right extremists, the UK's most senior counter-terrorism officer has warned. Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said 18 terror plots were foiled in Britain since 2017, four of them far-right. He said a ""far-right drift into extreme right-wing terrorism"" was a concern but officers were working to ensure groups did not gain a ""foothold"". Mr Basu added leaving the EU with no deal would be ""very bad"" for policing. The head of the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism operations was speaking at the launch of a new cinema advert aimed at encouraging people to report their suspicions about all forms of terrorism. The 60-second film portrays a series of scenarios, including a man stockpiling hazardous material and another buying weapons. The new cinema advert will be shown across the UK until March Mr Basu revealed that a record 700 terror investigations are currently taking place, up from about 500 in March 2017. Fourteen of the attacks foiled since 2017 involved Islamist suspects, Mr Basu said, adding that he was concerned about the possibility of radicalised fighters returning from abroad. Met Police chief warns over no-deal Brexit Far-right terror threat 'growing' in UK Another concern was the spread of propaganda online. Mr Basu said while extreme right-wing activity was still a ""relatively small threat"", it was also ""something we've got to pay very close attention to in this country - that we don't let that kind of far-right drift into extreme right-wing terrorism and we're working very hard to stop that"". Asked about the background of Brexit, Mr Basu told the BBC: ""We saw a spike in hate crime after the referendum, that's never really receded. ""So there's always a possibility people are being radicalised by the kind of febrile atmosphere we've got at the moment. ""We want people to report anything that we think is going to lead to violent confrontation and people need to calm down and understand that we are paying very close attention to that and we will stop it wherever we see it."" Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu heads the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism operations Mr Basu said there was no intelligence pointing to an increased level of attacks after Brexit, but added: ""What's most concerning me... is its potential to divide communities and set communities against each other."" His warning comes as Labour MP Melanie Onn revealed she had been threatened with being ""gunned down"". The MP for Great Grimsby quoted the threatening email on Twitter, which was filled with swear words and called her a ""traitor"". Ms Onn, who came out against another referendum on Brexit this week, said: ""Everyone in Grimsby knows I've never backed down from a debate, even when I've had unpopular POV (including in referendum), but we must be allowed to have an opinion without this nonsense."" The threat against Ms Onn echoes the murder of Jo Cox, MP for Batley and Spen, who was shot and stabbed in 2016. Her killer, Thomas Mair, gave his name in court as ""death to traitors, freedom for Britain"". It also follows concerns from a cross-party group of MPs that police were failing to prevent them being abused outside Parliament, with pro-EU Tory MP Anna Soubry being taunted with chants of ""Nazi"" during a live interview. Mr Basu also told the BBC the possibility of a no-deal Brexit was ""incredibly concerning"" for police operations. Echoing comments from Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick in December, he said the UK and Europe would be in a ""very bad place"" if police could not exchange data or biometrics on suspected criminals and terrorists. Mr Basu said the Met was working on contingency arrangements with police forces and agencies in Europe. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said this week that he was confident that with or without a Brexit deal Britain would ""continue to be a very safe country"".

"This video can not be played The voice message Emiliano Sala sent on missing plane The search for a missing plane carrying a pilot and a Premier League footballer has been called off for the night. Cardiff City striker Emiliano Sala and pilot David Ibbotsonwere in the plane that vanished from radaron Monday. Guernsey Police said an ""intensive"" nine-hour search found no trace of the missing aircraft. A decision on whether to resume will be taken on Thursday. A rescuer said there was ""no hope"" of finding the 28-year-old Argentine or pilot from Crowle, Lincolnshire, alive. Channel Islands Air Search chief officer John Fitzgerald said ""even the most fit person"" would only survive for a few hours in the water. David Ibbotson (right), from Lincolnshire, has been named by police as the pilot Guernsey Police said the search, involving ""multiple aircraft and one lifeboat"", was halted as the daylight had faded. As part of rescue efforts, police have been looking at satellite images and mobile phone data. Sala reportedly sent a WhatsApp voice message before the flight. Sounding conversational and jokey, he said he was ""so scared"". Media in Argentina reported he said: ""I'm on a plane that looks like it's going to fall apart."" This video can not be played Emiliano Sala signed for Cardiff City FC on Saturday Sala was heading to the Welsh capital aftersigning for the Bluebirds from French club Nantes in a Â£15m deal. The single-engine plane left Nantes, north-west France, at 19:15 on Monday and had been flying at 5,000ft (1,500m) over the Channel Islands when it contacted Jersey air traffic control requesting descent. It lost contact while at 2,300ft (700m) and disappeared off radar near the Casquets lighthouse, infamous among mariners as the site of many shipwrecks, eight miles (13km) north-west of Alderney. Flowers and tributes have been left outside Cardiff City Stadium Fans in Nantes have left their own tributes in the city's main square Mr Fitzgerald said: ""Sadly, I really don't think, personally, there is any hope. At this time of year the conditions out there are pretty horrendous if you are actually in the water."" Humberside Police said specially trained officers were supporting Mr Ibbotson's family, adding they had ""asked for privacy at this difficult time"". Allow Twitter content?

Mr Dalman said players and fans were in a ""state of shock"" and the club had received messages of support from around the world. The ""family of football has a way of coming together at times of tragedy,"" he told BBC Radio Wales'Good Morning Wales. He also confirmed the club had not booked the plane and Sala had ""made his own arrangements"". French sports newspaper L'Equipe called the news: ""The disappearance of a warrior"" Nantes fans gathered in the city to pay tribute to their former striker Air and sea crews from the Channel Islands, France and the UK took part in a 15-hour search on Tuesday, but found no trace of the aircraft, Sala or Mr Ibbotson. Meanwhile Sala's father Horacio told Argentine media on Tuesday: ""The hours go by and it makes me think of the worst. ""I just want them to find him. The last thing they said is that the communication ended when they crossed the river [English Channel]."" Emiliano Sala was on board a plane bound for Cardiff from Nantes when it disappeared from radar On Tuesday evening, football fans in Nantes laid flowers at a fountain as a tribute to Sala and Mr Ibbotson, with floral tributes also left at Cardiff City Stadium. Sala's former club Nanteshas changed its Twitter profile picture to a photo of the striker,externaland tweeted: ""OÃ¹ que tu sois, on pense Ã  toi"" which translates to: ""Wherever you are, we're thinking of you."" The PA-46-310P Malibu aircraft Sala and Mr Ibbotson were on board The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said a PA-46-310P Malibu aircraft, registered in the United States, had a pilot and one passenger on board when it vanished. It has begun an investigation, working with counterparts in the US, France and Argentina. A spokesman said: ""We will be gathering all the available evidence to conduct a thorough investigation. However, if the aircraft is not found it is likely to limit the scope of the investigation."" The plane is owned by Southern Aircraft Consultancy Inc Trustee, in Bungay, Suffolk, according to the US Federal Aviation Administration database. The company told the BBC it was the trustee of the plane but not its ultimate owner. Julian Bray, an aviation expert and journalist, said the aircraft was a single engine, six-seater plane. He said he had listened to the WhatsApp recording by Sala and ""was particularly listening to the engine sounds and I must admit it sounded slightly ropey - it didn't sound as smooth as it should be"". Mr Bray said the request to descend by the pilot could have been due to an issue with pressure onboard the aircraft, which did not deviate from its course. He added: ""They're [the plane] equipped with life jackets, but I'm not sure whether this one had life rafts on. ""Normally in light aircraft you wouldn't carry a life raft, but you will have floatation jackets.""

"Zoe Sugg (Zoella), singer Rita Ora and model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley are among those who have agreed changes Sixteen social media stars including singers Ellie Goulding and Rita Ora, models Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Alexa Chung, and vlogger Zoella have agreed to change how they post online. They will have to clearly state if they have been paid or received any gifts or loans of products they endorse. It follows warnings from the Competition and Markets Authority that their posts could break consumer law. Online endorsements can boost brands but can also mislead, said the CMA. The CMA has not made a finding on whether the influencers named breached consumer law, but said all of them volunteered to change their practices following an investigation. However, if they fail to comply with the agreement reached with the CMA, they could be taken to court and face heavy fines or prison sentences of up to two years. Actress Michelle Keegan, vlogger Jim Chapman and reality TV personality Chloe Sims were also named The celebrities named by the CMA are: Pop starRita Ora ActressMichelle Keegan SingerEllie Goulding Writer and modelAlexa Chung Designer and modelRosie Huntington-Whiteley Video bloggerZoe Sugg(who vlogs under the name Zoella) Mario Falconefrom The Only Way Is Essex Alexandra 'Binky' Felsteadfrom Made In Chelsea Holly Haganfrom Geordie Shore ModelIskra Lawrence Camilla 'Milly' Macintoshfrom Made In Chelsea Reality TV personalityMegan McKenna Chloe Simsfrom The Only Way Is Essex Louise Thompsonfrom Made In Chelsea Fashion video bloggerJames Chapman(who vlogs as Jim Chapman) Fashion bloggerDina Torkia Warning letters have been sent to a number of other unidentified celebrities, urging them to review their social media posts. by Chris Fox, technology reporter Usually when celebrities post an advert without being clear they were paid to do so, it's the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) that gives them a slap on the wrist - if a complaint is made. But while the ASA takes action against individual advertisements or campaigns, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) can take action against people. Alexa Chung, Binky Felstead and Iskra Lawrence were all named Social media platforms including Instagram already have built-in tools, such as the paid-partnership tool, which make it clear that a post is an advertorial. All 16 of the celebrities named by the CMA were being investigated because they may have broken the rules repeatedly. By agreeing to change their ways they have avoided court action, which could have led to unlimited fines or even up to two years in jail. Officially, no ruling was made on whether the stars broke the rules, because they were not taken to court this time. But the CMA says its investigation is not finished. It has sent warning letters to more influencers, and is going to investigate the social networks too. Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, said: ""Influencers can have a huge impact on what their fans decide to buy. People could, quite rightly, feel misled if what they thought was a recommendation from someone they admired turns out to be a marketing ploy. ""You should be able to tell as soon as you look at a post if there is some form of payment or reward involved, so you can decide whether something is really worth spending your hard-earned money on."" influencers must clearly label content that has been paid-for or for which they have received gifts or loans. #ad or #sponsored are examples, and must now be prominently displayed at the beginning of the post, rather than buried away among other hashtags even gifts that are made without a requirement to post about them afterwards  must be declared if they appear in social media content. #freebie is suggested as a  label it is no longer enough for influencers to declare the companies they work for in their profile. Each post must be treated in isolation and all paid-content or commercial relationships declared if an influencer is engaged in various commercial relationships related to an individual post, each one must be declared But one lawyer told the BBC that the UK's rules were still complex. ""The CMA has portrayed these posts as if some celebrities are deliberately trying to pull the wool over the eyes of their fans, but often it is just that the various guidance is difficult to follow,"" said Geraint Lloyd-Taylor, legal director at law firm Lewis Silkin. ""I think the hashtag #ad will become the default, but it seems that the CMA intends to also look more at what the platforms are doing and it might be that we see more built-in tools and other changes from them as well."" The practice of endorsing products, from clothes to cars, hotels to holidays, is widespread among so-called social media influencers who can earn tens of thousands of pounds from companies for a single post on sites such as Instagram. How much do social influencers earn? Has Fyre Festival burned influencers? Most shoppers mistrust influencers, says survey The risk is that consumers will place more trust in a product that has been recommended by someone they admire on social media. Some celebrities do use hashtags such as #ad or #sponsored to indicate that they have been paid to post content. The Advertising Standards Authority has previously flagged several of reality star Louise Thompson's posts as product endorsement The CMA will be conducting further investigations into the role and responsibilities of social media platforms.

"Mason is studying for his GCSEs Fifteen-year-old Mason Kettley, who has a rare brain cancer, is about to become one of the first NHS UK patients to have proton-beam therapy, at a new dedicated treatment centre. He is starting treatment at the Â£125m centre at Manchester's Christie hospital. Previously, most patients needing the treatment had to travel abroad. The specialist radiotherapy targets cancers without damaging tissues around the tumours. This is good for children who are at risk of lasting damage to organs that are still growing but it is available in only a handful of countries around the world. Radiographers David Kirk and Melissa Bentley with a test dummy as they demonstrates the new proton-beam therapy centre at the Christie hospital, in Manchester Mason, from Angmering, West Sussex, was diagnosed with a brain tumour in October. ""I had some headaches and stomach pains and usual things, and got check-ups at the doctors,"" he said. ""My mum said, 'He's not gaining weight or growing.'"" An MRI scan showed he had a rare pilomyxoid astrocytoma brain tumour. It couldn't be operated on because of a risk of blindness and other ""catastrophic"" complications. ""The machine is intimidating because of its size,"" he said. ""It's a bit nerve-wracking but this is a better choice than chemo because it's more effective. ""Because of my age, [doctors] thought radiation would be a better choice."" Patients have been able to travel overseas for NHS funded treatment since 2008. But some haven't been able to travel because they are too ill or their treatment need was too urgent. The travel also caused major upheaval to families at a very stressful time. This video can not be played What is proton-beam therapy? The Christie hospital centre opened in autumn 2018. The first patient to have PBT there, who is still undergoing treatment, did not want publicity. A second health service PBT centre is also set to open in the UK, at London's University College Hospital, offering the therapy from 2020. It is hoped that each will each treat up to 750 patients every year. The Clatterbridge Cancer Centre in Merseyside has been delivering low-energy proton therapy specifically for NHS patients with eye tumours. But the two new centres will be the first to deliver higher doses to a broader range of cancers - including brain, head and neck cancers and sarcoma, a rare cancer of soft tissue. Both will carry out research to assess PBT's suitability for treating other cancers. Proton-beam therapy made headlines around the world in 2014, whenthe parents of five-year-old Ashya King were arrestedafter taking him abroad for the treatment in Prague. Oncologist Gillian Whitfield is leading Mason's care. She said his was a low grade (slow growing) tumour with a ""high chance of cure"". ""For Mason, in comparison to conventional radiotherapy, PBT should carry a lower risk of some important long-term side-effects of treatment - particularly effects on short-term memory and learning ability - and the risk over the next eight decades of the radiation causing other tumours. ""This is particularly important for children and teenagers with curable tumours, who will survive decades after treatment and are at much greater risk of serious long-term effects of treatment than adults."" Mason, who lives with his mother, step-father, and four siblings, and is in the middle of preparing for his GCSEs, will have 28 treatment sessions taking place Monday to Friday for almost six weeks. He has had a specially made radiotherapy mask created to keep his head perfectly still during the therapy. And while he may get short-term side effects such as vomiting and headaches, long-term side-effects are rare. And he said his experiences as a patient had influenced his future career plans. ""I'm so grateful to all the doctors involved in my care and I'd love to do what they do one day - it will be my way of giving something back.""

"Zoe Sugg (Zoella), singer Rita Ora and model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley are among those who have agreed changes Sixteen social media stars including singers Ellie Goulding and Rita Ora, models Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Alexa Chung, and vlogger Zoella have agreed to change how they post online. They will have to clearly state if they have been paid or received any gifts or loans of products they endorse. It follows warnings from the Competition and Markets Authority that their posts could break consumer law. Online endorsements can boost brands but can also mislead, said the CMA. The CMA has not made a finding on whether the influencers named breached consumer law, but said all of them volunteered to change their practices following an investigation. However, if they fail to comply with the agreement reached with the CMA, they could be taken to court and face heavy fines or prison sentences of up to two years. Actress Michelle Keegan, vlogger Jim Chapman and reality TV personality Chloe Sims were also named The celebrities named by the CMA are: Pop starRita Ora ActressMichelle Keegan SingerEllie Goulding Writer and modelAlexa Chung Designer and modelRosie Huntington-Whiteley Video bloggerZoe Sugg(who vlogs under the name Zoella) Mario Falconefrom The Only Way Is Essex Alexandra 'Binky' Felsteadfrom Made In Chelsea Holly Haganfrom Geordie Shore ModelIskra Lawrence Camilla 'Milly' Macintoshfrom Made In Chelsea Reality TV personalityMegan McKenna Chloe Simsfrom The Only Way Is Essex Louise Thompsonfrom Made In Chelsea Fashion video bloggerJames Chapman(who vlogs as Jim Chapman) Fashion bloggerDina Torkia Warning letters have been sent to a number of other unidentified celebrities, urging them to review their social media posts. by Chris Fox, technology reporter Usually when celebrities post an advert without being clear they were paid to do so, it's the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) that gives them a slap on the wrist - if a complaint is made. But while the ASA takes action against individual advertisements or campaigns, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) can take action against people. Alexa Chung, Binky Felstead and Iskra Lawrence were all named Social media platforms including Instagram already have built-in tools, such as the paid-partnership tool, which make it clear that a post is an advertorial. All 16 of the celebrities named by the CMA were being investigated because they may have broken the rules repeatedly. By agreeing to change their ways they have avoided court action, which could have led to unlimited fines or even up to two years in jail. Officially, no ruling was made on whether the stars broke the rules, because they were not taken to court this time. But the CMA says its investigation is not finished. It has sent warning letters to more influencers, and is going to investigate the social networks too. Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, said: ""Influencers can have a huge impact on what their fans decide to buy. People could, quite rightly, feel misled if what they thought was a recommendation from someone they admired turns out to be a marketing ploy. ""You should be able to tell as soon as you look at a post if there is some form of payment or reward involved, so you can decide whether something is really worth spending your hard-earned money on."" influencers must clearly label content that has been paid-for or for which they have received gifts or loans. #ad or #sponsored are examples, and must now be prominently displayed at the beginning of the post, rather than buried away among other hashtags even gifts that are made without a requirement to post about them afterwards  must be declared if they appear in social media content. #freebie is suggested as a  label it is no longer enough for influencers to declare the companies they work for in their profile. Each post must be treated in isolation and all paid-content or commercial relationships declared if an influencer is engaged in various commercial relationships related to an individual post, each one must be declared But one lawyer told the BBC that the UK's rules were still complex. ""The CMA has portrayed these posts as if some celebrities are deliberately trying to pull the wool over the eyes of their fans, but often it is just that the various guidance is difficult to follow,"" said Geraint Lloyd-Taylor, legal director at law firm Lewis Silkin. ""I think the hashtag #ad will become the default, but it seems that the CMA intends to also look more at what the platforms are doing and it might be that we see more built-in tools and other changes from them as well."" The practice of endorsing products, from clothes to cars, hotels to holidays, is widespread among so-called social media influencers who can earn tens of thousands of pounds from companies for a single post on sites such as Instagram. How much do social influencers earn? Has Fyre Festival burned influencers? Most shoppers mistrust influencers, says survey The risk is that consumers will place more trust in a product that has been recommended by someone they admire on social media. Some celebrities do use hashtags such as #ad or #sponsored to indicate that they have been paid to post content. The Advertising Standards Authority has previously flagged several of reality star Louise Thompson's posts as product endorsement The CMA will be conducting further investigations into the role and responsibilities of social media platforms.

"Newark International Airport handles around 20 million passengers a year Flights were grounded at Newark International Airport in the US state of New Jersey after two drones were spotted flying nearby. A pilot told air traffic control that one of the drones came within 30ft (9m) of his aircraft. He was flying at Teterboro Airport, a nearby private facility, but officials closed Newark International as a precaution. The airport is the 11th busiest in the US, with 20m boarding there each year. The incident follows major disruption over the Christmas period at Londonâs Gatwick airport, where apparent drone sightings grounded hundreds of flights over the course of three days. How can a drone cause so much chaos? How will police catch the drone menace? Speaking about Tuesday's drone scare in New Jersey, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said in a statement: ""At approximately 5pm, we received two reports from incoming flights into Newark that a drone was sighted at about 3,500ft above Teterboro, New Jersey. âAt that point, flights arriving into Newark were held for a short duration. Since then, and with no further drone sightings, arrivals have been resumed. âHowever, we still have a ground stop in place at other airports departing for Newark until a backlog of arrivals can be cleared. We expect that to be lifted soon."" United Airlines. which uses Newark as a hub, said: ""The impact to our operations has been minimal so far. We are working closely with the airport and the FAA to return our operations to normal as quickly as possible."" Drones have become a considerable menace for the aviation industry. Earlier this month, London's Heathrow airport, the country's busiest, held flights for about an hour after a sighting - but was soon operating as normal. Gatwick, however, was far hit far worse. It grounded flights between 19-21 December, affecting the travel of an estimated 140,000 people. Two people were arrested over the attack but released without charge. No other arrests have been made. This latest incident, which the FAA said is now being investigated by police, will energise calls to develop and deploy technologies to block drone activity in the vicinity of airports. The chief executive of easyJet,Johan Lundgren, said recent incidents were a ""wake-up call"". Police and airport staff at Gatwickwill later this year take part in drillsin the hope of being better prepared should there be another drone sighting. Last week, the British government announced measures to give police extra powers to combat drones, including extending the exclusion zone around airports to a 3 mile (5km) radius. Ministers also announced that from 30 November, operators of drones weighing between 250g and 20kg will be required to register and take an online drone pilot competency test. In the US, a drone registry is already in place, with more than 1.3m crafts registered by around 116,000 licensed operators. However, officials have said they suspect there may be hundreds of thousands of drones that have not been registered by their owners.

"The ""febrile"" atmosphere around Brexit could be exploited by far-right extremists, the UK's most senior counter-terrorism officer has warned. Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said 18 terror plots were foiled in Britain since 2017, four of them far-right. He said a ""far-right drift into extreme right-wing terrorism"" was a concern but officers were working to ensure groups did not gain a ""foothold"". Mr Basu added leaving the EU with no deal would be ""very bad"" for policing. The head of the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism operations was speaking at the launch of a new cinema advert aimed at encouraging people to report their suspicions about all forms of terrorism. The 60-second film portrays a series of scenarios, including a man stockpiling hazardous material and another buying weapons. The new cinema advert will be shown across the UK until March Mr Basu revealed that a record 700 terror investigations are currently taking place, up from about 500 in March 2017. Fourteen of the attacks foiled since 2017 involved Islamist suspects, Mr Basu said, adding that he was concerned about the possibility of radicalised fighters returning from abroad. Met Police chief warns over no-deal Brexit Far-right terror threat 'growing' in UK Another concern was the spread of propaganda online. Mr Basu said while extreme right-wing activity was still a ""relatively small threat"", it was also ""something we've got to pay very close attention to in this country - that we don't let that kind of far-right drift into extreme right-wing terrorism and we're working very hard to stop that"". Asked about the background of Brexit, Mr Basu told the BBC: ""We saw a spike in hate crime after the referendum, that's never really receded. ""So there's always a possibility people are being radicalised by the kind of febrile atmosphere we've got at the moment. ""We want people to report anything that we think is going to lead to violent confrontation and people need to calm down and understand that we are paying very close attention to that and we will stop it wherever we see it."" Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu heads the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism operations Mr Basu said there was no intelligence pointing to an increased level of attacks after Brexit, but added: ""What's most concerning me... is its potential to divide communities and set communities against each other."" His warning comes as Labour MP Melanie Onn revealed she had been threatened with being ""gunned down"". The MP for Great Grimsby quoted the threatening email on Twitter, which was filled with swear words and called her a ""traitor"". Ms Onn, who came out against another referendum on Brexit this week, said: ""Everyone in Grimsby knows I've never backed down from a debate, even when I've had unpopular POV (including in referendum), but we must be allowed to have an opinion without this nonsense."" The threat against Ms Onn echoes the murder of Jo Cox, MP for Batley and Spen, who was shot and stabbed in 2016. Her killer, Thomas Mair, gave his name in court as ""death to traitors, freedom for Britain"". It also follows concerns from a cross-party group of MPs that police were failing to prevent them being abused outside Parliament, with pro-EU Tory MP Anna Soubry being taunted with chants of ""Nazi"" during a live interview. Mr Basu also told the BBC the possibility of a no-deal Brexit was ""incredibly concerning"" for police operations. Echoing comments from Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick in December, he said the UK and Europe would be in a ""very bad place"" if police could not exchange data or biometrics on suspected criminals and terrorists. Mr Basu said the Met was working on contingency arrangements with police forces and agencies in Europe. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said this week that he was confident that with or without a Brexit deal Britain would ""continue to be a very safe country"".

"The ad was supposed to show that '#DGLovesChina' The Chinese model featured in a Dolce & Gabbana ad campaign accused of racism has said the controversy almost ruined her career. Three videos, released in November, showed Zuo Ye struggling to eat Italian food including cannoli and pizza with chopsticks. Widely seen as offensive it led to a severe backlash in China with several retailers pulling the brand's products. Ms Zuo said she felt ""guilty and ashamed"" but asked for understanding. Following her statement on Chinese social media network Weibo, the debate has flared up again with some people saying they hope that she can continue her career as a model and that they understand her hands were tied working with D&G. In a long post on Monday, Ms Zuo said that usually working for an international brand like D&G would be an exciting career step but that in this case ""it nearly killed off my modelling career"". She explains she understands that ""it's about representing the national image of China and Chinese culture"" and that she ""therefore feels even more guilty and ashamed"". She also vowed to ""improve my behaviour"" in the future. Consumers called for a boycott of D&G products in China Dolce & Gabbana products pulled in China D&G cancels show amid racism accusations According to her statement, she knew the shoot was about trying Italian delicacies but that she felt very awkward when she was asked to eat food like pizza and pasta with chopsticks. The director told her to show first shock and disbelief, then roll her eyes, and eventually delight and satisfaction at the presumed tastiness of said Italian dishes, she said. The model explains that she didn't see the final clip before it was released. She also writes she didn't receive any support during the backlash, even when she, her family and agent were all targeted in widespread attacks on social media. Since Ms Zuo's post, opinion has been divided on Chinese social media. While some see her as a victim of the Italian brand and sympathise with her experience, others remain critical saying she only had herself to blame. Others again point out the problem with the powerlessness of models in the industry as a whole where they are often made to do things they might not necessarily want to do. Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana asked for forgiveness In November last year, D&G released the videos on social media ahead of a fashion show in Shanghai. The entire campaign was accused of trivialising Chinese culture and promoting unflattering stereotypes. ""Chinese consumers are not naÃ¯ve; they will spot insincerity and tokenism a mile off, and respond accordingly,"" Dr Julie Bilby of the department of media and communication at RMIT University in Melbourne told the BBC. The controversy escalated further when screenshots were circulated showing designer Stefano Gabbana allegedly insulting China in an Instagram chat. D&G insisted the account had been hacked and apologised publicly for the controversial ad campaign. The Italian luxury company was forced to cancel the fashion show in Shanghai and their products were removed from several Chinese online retailers. Consumers in China also called for a boycott of the brand.

"Justine Greening's radical plan for fees ended when she was ""reshuffled"" out of her job Justine Greening says she had plans to scrap tuition fees, before she lost the job of education secretary a year ago. She says she wanted a graduate contribution scheme to fund England's universities where ""you wouldn't have a loan, you wouldn't have tuition fees"". Ms Greening says she was worried that tuition fees of Â£9,250 per year could start to put off poorer students. The government said its review of fees would make sure there was ""value for money for both students and taxpayers"". Ms Greening, education secretary until last January's reshuffle, says she had concerns that excessively high fees and levels of debt could become a barrier to social mobility. She says she had been working on a radically different system which would have removed fees - but instead the prime minister launched a review of student finance, chaired by financier Philip Augar. Ms Greening is scathing about the review, which is expected to report back next month. She says its public remit is confused - without any ""clear objectives of the problem it was trying to fix"". And she says its private purpose was to buy time and only ""tweak"" a few of the most politically toxic aspects of the current system. Even if, as suggested, it lowers tuition fees to Â£6,500, she says it will still be a temporary sticking plaster. ""What happens if they creep back up to Â£9,000? Would they re-reduce them again?"" says Ms Greening. ""We need a long-term sustainable approach, not a short-term fix that may unravel and then be taken over by the next short-term fix."" Ms Greening, hailed as the first Conservative education secretary to have attended a comprehensive school, said she realised there had to be a different approach after hearing what students were saying about fees during the 2017 general election. It was a campaign in which Labour promised to scrap fees entirely and the Conservatives saw big swings against them in university seats. Rich students saving by paying tuition fees up front Biggest winners and losers from degrees Tuition fees could be cut to Â£6,500 Student loan ruling adds Â£12bn to deficit ""There was a real desire within the DfE to take a fresh look at some of these issues - and to challenge ourselves with being ahead of the curve, even if the rest of government had little interest in broader reform,"" she said. ""I felt that we should be looking and asking ourselves some tough questions - about what it might look like."" Theresa May commissioned the review to find better value for money for students In the months before her departure from office, she said the ""basic architecture"" of an alternative funding system was worked up. The proposal was for a system without fees, loans, debts or interest rates. Instead, graduates would pay back a proportion of earnings over a fixed number of years, with this graduate contribution funding universities. She likens it to a time-limited form of National Insurance deductions, but only for graduates. It would remove negative perceptions over high fees and Â£50,000 average debts on graduation - and would prevent a cap on the number of places. Ms Greening says poorer students had so far not been significantly deterred by fees, but it was ""getting to the point where it felt that they were too high"". She argues her graduate contribution proposals would be more progressive - as higher earners would pay more. ""There could be someone going off into the City and paying off their loan and avoiding all the interest with one bonus cheque - compared to a nurse,"" she says, who could be paying it off for 30 years. The graduate contribution would keep the principle of students paying towards higher education. ""Most students recognise they should make a contribution, because they're getting an opportunity,"" she says. But it would mean ditching the idea of a higher education marketplace in fees, which was at the heart of the reforms that created the tuition fee system. ""You have to confront the fact - did universities compete on price? No,"" she says. But her plans for such a massive change went nowhere. ""We were working up this proposal before the reshuffle,"" she says. ""Of course, it had tons of work to be done, all sorts to refine and understand the trade-offs,"" but she believed it to be a ""more sensible approach"". Instead she was replaced as education secretary and a review of student finance was announced. She has since set up the ""Social Mobility Pledge"", working to improve opportunities in the workplace, and is on the front lines of arguments over Brexit - supporting calls for a second referendum. Looking at policy over tuition fees, she says the divisions over Brexit show how ineffective the party political system has become at reaching long-term decisions. ""I don't think Britain or British politics will ever be the same again. ""I think it's a sea change. It's a call to action to genuinely create a different country to tackle some of the problems that sat behind a lot of the Brexit vote. ""And I think for British politics, we've got to ask ourselves some difficult questions about why party politics seemingly cannot rise to the challenge of delivering on long-term problems."" A Department for Education spokesman said: ""Students rightly expect value for money from their degree, which is why the government is conducting a major review of post-18 education and funding - to ensure we have a system that is joined up, accessible to all and provides value for money for both students and taxpayers. ""Work on the review is still ongoing, and more information will be available in due course.""

"Nearly a quarter of schools in England (23%) have not told the government how much asbestos they have in their buildings and how they are managing the risks, a committee of MPs is warning. Schools were asked to provide details to the government by 31 May last year. But the Public Accounts Committee says it is ""seriously concerned"" about the Department for Education's lack of information about asbestos in schools. It says schools that have not reported back should be ""named and shamed"". Asbestos was banned in 1999 but was regularly used in construction until this date, including for some schools built between the 1950s and 1980s. According to the National Education Union,more than 200 teachers have died,externalsince 2001 from mesothelioma, a form of cancer associated with asbestos. In March last year, the DfE started to collect data on how asbestos in England's schools was being managed and to check academy trusts and local authorities were responding appropriately. ""The department asked schools to respond by 31 May 2018. Due to the poor response rate, it extended the deadline to 25 June 2018 and then extended it again to 27 July 2018,"" the PAC report says. Asbestos in schools: Is it a danger? ""Despite this, only 77% of schools have responded and the department has extended the deadline yet again, to 15 February 2019, to allow the remaining 23% of schools to respond."" The committee adds: ""We are not convinced that extending the survey deadline again will result in a much higher response rate."" The committee says the government needs to ""understand fully the extent of asbestos in school buildings and how the risks are being managed"" and should release the names of those schools that have not replied. ""In March 2019, the department should name and shame those schools which did not meet the February 2019 deadline and which have therefore repeatedly failed to respond to its asbestos-management survey,"" it says. Meg Hillier, who chairs the committee, said: ""It is not acceptable for schools to continue ignoring requests for details of asbestos in their buildings. ""Government needs to be clear how asbestos removal will be funded as it is not possible for schools to fund this from their existing budgets. ""Asbestos in schools can pose a significant threat to the health of pupils, staff and visitors. ""Where the risks are not being managed correctly, government must be prepared to step in."" Asbestos was used in many school buildings But Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said naming and shaming schools was not the right response and that the government must understand that schools needed money to address the issue. ""The committee suggests naming and shaming those bodies which have not responded but it would surely be more productive to understand what factors are holding up responses,"" he said. ""The real problem is not response rates but the fact that there is no clear plan at government level over how to fund the removal of asbestos from school buildings and schools are desperately short of the money they need to finance such work."" Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: ""Failure to provide the DfE with information about management of asbestos in schools is putting lives at risk. ""These delays show that academy trusts and local authorities who bear overall responsibility for health and safety in schools are not facing up to their legal responsibilities."" The asbestos warning comes in a report by the PAC about academy schools' accounts and performance. It says children's education has been damaged by academy failures and the misuse of funds and calls for the governance of academy trusts to be strengthened and the DfE's oversight to be more rigorous. The report also criticises academy chains for not communicating properly with parents and local communities, saying they have to fight to get ""even basic information"" about what's going on in individual academies. Ms Hillier added: ""When things go wrong in schools, pupils can be badly affected. ""We have seen the troubling consequences of poor governance and oversight of academy trusts. ""Government must raise its game to ensure the failures of the past are not repeated."" A spokeswoman for the DfE said: ""We do not accept the PAC's negative characterisation of academies, in which standards of education have risen for thousands of pupils. ""Academies are subject to higher levels of accountability and transparency than local authority schools.""

"Newark International Airport handles around 20 million passengers a year Flights were grounded at Newark International Airport in the US state of New Jersey after two drones were spotted flying nearby. A pilot told air traffic control that one of the drones came within 30ft (9m) of his aircraft. He was flying at Teterboro Airport, a nearby private facility, but officials closed Newark International as a precaution. The airport is the 11th busiest in the US, with 20m boarding there each year. The incident follows major disruption over the Christmas period at Londonâs Gatwick airport, where apparent drone sightings grounded hundreds of flights over the course of three days. How can a drone cause so much chaos? How will police catch the drone menace? Speaking about Tuesday's drone scare in New Jersey, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said in a statement: ""At approximately 5pm, we received two reports from incoming flights into Newark that a drone was sighted at about 3,500ft above Teterboro, New Jersey. âAt that point, flights arriving into Newark were held for a short duration. Since then, and with no further drone sightings, arrivals have been resumed. âHowever, we still have a ground stop in place at other airports departing for Newark until a backlog of arrivals can be cleared. We expect that to be lifted soon."" United Airlines. which uses Newark as a hub, said: ""The impact to our operations has been minimal so far. We are working closely with the airport and the FAA to return our operations to normal as quickly as possible."" Drones have become a considerable menace for the aviation industry. Earlier this month, London's Heathrow airport, the country's busiest, held flights for about an hour after a sighting - but was soon operating as normal. Gatwick, however, was far hit far worse. It grounded flights between 19-21 December, affecting the travel of an estimated 140,000 people. Two people were arrested over the attack but released without charge. No other arrests have been made. This latest incident, which the FAA said is now being investigated by police, will energise calls to develop and deploy technologies to block drone activity in the vicinity of airports. The chief executive of easyJet,Johan Lundgren, said recent incidents were a ""wake-up call"". Police and airport staff at Gatwickwill later this year take part in drillsin the hope of being better prepared should there be another drone sighting. Last week, the British government announced measures to give police extra powers to combat drones, including extending the exclusion zone around airports to a 3 mile (5km) radius. Ministers also announced that from 30 November, operators of drones weighing between 250g and 20kg will be required to register and take an online drone pilot competency test. In the US, a drone registry is already in place, with more than 1.3m crafts registered by around 116,000 licensed operators. However, officials have said they suspect there may be hundreds of thousands of drones that have not been registered by their owners.

"This video can not be played The girls slipped out of the nursery unnoticed Two five-year-old girls who left their nursery in Siberia in bitterly cold temperatures unnoticed by their teachers have been found. The two, who wanted to surprise their parents, suffered frostbite and hypothermia. They walked home on one of the coldest days of the year in temperatures of -45C (-49F). They were caught on camera as they slipped out - one clutching a cuddly toy and with no mittens on. Growing up in -60C Siberian pupils go to school at -50C Toddler survives alone in Siberia wood One girl is now in hospital in the regional capital, Yakutsk, with three fingers frostbitten,external, the Siberian Times reports. Her mother, Evdokia Kutukova, said: ""Three of her fingers froze hard. She is crying. ""The children are still in shock."" She noticed her daughter Lena had gone missing in the village of Namtsy when she went to the nursery to collect her and saw her coat was missing. She raised the alarm with staff, and then it was noticed her daughter's best friend, who has not been named, was also missing. Her parents did not know where she was either. But Ms Kutukova said the family's grandfather then called to say Lena had just arrived home, alone, in tears and frozen. Her husband said a passing stranger had given their daughter a scarf, which had helped her. ""How cold it was without gloves, it's hard to imagine, and with a toy in her hand!"" The other girl got lost on the way home in the village in darkness and was found an hour later. She had taken shelter in a nearby house. ""Thank God, she [thought of entering] someone else's house,"" Ms Kutukova told the Siberian Times. ""It is good that she was not frostbitten, just extremely cold."" The girl suffered from hypothermia, but went home after being checked over by doctors. The girls had never left the nursery by themselves before. An investigation has been opened to find out how the incident happened.
