"Sir Roger Moore has died at the age of 89 following ""a short but brave battle with cancer"" Sir Roger Moore, who has died aged 89, brought a lighter touch to the role of James Bond, the role for which he was most famous. Out went the harder, crueller edge of Sean Connery's 007 to be succeeded by sardonic humour and the inevitable raised eyebrow. He eventually became the longest-serving actor in the role, his seven Bond films becoming the most commercially successful of the franchise. His tenure in the role also showcased an array of implausible gadgets and a host of new characters, designed to flesh out Ian Fleming's original plots. Roger George Moore was born in Stockwell, south London on 14 October 1927, the son of a policeman. At 15, he entered art college, and later became an apprentice at an animation studio, where it seems much fun was had at his expense. ""I was probably the lowliest in the entire building,"" he said. ""They sent me on errands for things like tins of sprocket holes, and the guy in stores would say he didn't have any - and would rainbow paint do instead?"" The actor made something of a name as a male model in the 1950s Sir Roger was sacked for incompetence, but soon had a stroke of luck. His father, by now a detective sergeant, was called to investigate a robbery at the home of the film director, Brian Desmond Hurst. DS Moore managed to effect an introduction that led to his son being hired as an extra for the epic, Caesar and Cleopatra. Sir Roger Moore, James Bond actor, dies aged 89 Roger Moore's classic quotes A life in pictures Sir Roger Moore on Desert Island Discs Q&A: one lucky fellow Hurst paid for Sir Roger to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, before a spell of National Service with the Army where he rose to the rank of captain. On his return to the theatre, he found acting roles hard to come by but his well-toned physique meant he was in demand as a model. One of his engagements was playing the doctor in Woman's Own medical features. He also appeared, suitably attired in a sweater, on a number of knitting patterns, prompting at least one wag to christen him the Big Knit. And in 1953, his looks and his minor roles in theatre and television plays impressed an MGM talent scout and Sir Roger set off for America. Married at 17 to a fellow Rada student, Doorn Van Steyn, he was by now living with the singer Dorothy Squires, 12 years his senior, who soon became his second wife at a ceremony in New Jersey. Ivanhoe brought Sir Roger to a wider audience While Squires was popular in Britain, Sir Roger was rubbing shoulders with stars in the States, making his film debut with Elizabeth Taylor in The Last Time I Saw Paris and playing Lana Turner's leading man in Diane. But it was through television that he first made his mark, as the dashing hero Ivanhoe in a 1950s series that had only a tentative connection with Sir Walter Scott's original novel. He followed that with the lead role in an American TV series The Alaskans. It was not a great success. Despite being set in Alaska, it was filmed on a hot Hollywood set with the cast dressed up in furs. Moore found the filming difficult and an affair with actress Dorothy Provine did nothing to relieve the pressure. He also appeared in the successful Western series Maverick, where he had the role of Beau Maverick, supposedly the English cousin of the lead character Brett, played by James Garner. Ironically Sir Sean Connery had also tested for the part but turned it down. Sir Roger's big breakthrough came in 1962 when the impresario Lew Grade cast him as the dashing Simon Templar aka The Saint, in a television adaptation of the Leslie Charteris stories. The series, which ran for seven years, made Sir Roger a star on both sides of the Atlantic. Many of the Saint's characteristics, the easygoing manner, mocking eyebrow and ability to successfully charm every passing female, would later be incorporated into his role as James Bond. Sir Roger's suave character in The Persuaders contrasted with Tony Curtis's rough diamond In 1971 he teamed up with Tony Curtis in the TV series The Persuaders, as one of two wise-cracking millionaire playboys who floated around the fleshpots of the globe as a pair of freelance secret agents. The success of the series owed a lot to the contrast of the rough-hewn New Yorker Danny Wilde, played by Curtis, and Sir Roger's suave Lord Brett Sinclair. Sir Roger always denied that he had been considered as James Bond when the franchise launched in 1962 and was only aware of interest in him when Sir Sean announced, in 1966, that he would no longer play the role. There was a long wait. George Lazenby was cast in the 1969 film On Her Majesty's Secret Service and Sir Sean was tempted back with an offer of Â£1.5m, a huge sum in those days, to make Diamonds Are Forever. It really was the last appearance for Sir Sean and Sir Roger finally picked up the Walther PPK in 1973 for Live and Let Die. He went on to make six more films, including The Spy Who Loved Me and Octopussy, before bowing out of the role at the age of 57 with A View to a Kill. It was his last film appearance for five years. Sir Roger had some success in films such as Shout at the Devil, The Wild Geese and North Sea Hijack, but many of the newspaper headlines after he retired as Bond were about his life off screen. He brought a lighter touch to the role of James Bond In 1963, he became a father, when his partner, Luisa Mattioli, had a daughter, but it was to be another five years before Dorothy Squires agreed to give Sir Roger a divorce. He married Luisa and they had two sons, but after 38 years, Sir Roger left her and they were divorced.  He married his fourth wife, Kiki Tholstrup, in March 2002. Sir Roger recovered from an operation for prostate cancer in 1993 and said he had led ""an extraordinarily lucky, charmed life"". He had homes in Switzerland and Monte Carlo, but devoted much of his time to travelling the globe as a roving ambassador for the United Nations children's organisation Unicef, a role prompted by the scenes of child poverty he had witnessed in India while filming Octopussy. He took up the position at the request of his friend and predecessor, Audrey Hepburn. His work was recognised by a CBE in 1998 and he was knighted in 2003. Throughout his life Sir Roger cut a suave figure, always immaculately dressed. In 2015 he was awarded the accolade of one of GQ magazine's best-dressed men. He would also remain associated with James Bond He was a lifelong supporter of the Conservative Party, giving his backing to David Cameron in 2011 when the prime minister faced criticism over his policy on the EU. Despite his other work and achievements, Roger Moore never managed to quite shrug off the mantle of 007. ""Of course I do not regret the Bond days,"" he once remarked.  ""I regret that sadly heroes in general are depicted with guns in their hands, and to tell the truth I have always hated guns and what they represent.""

"One in five children in the UK are said to be negatively affected by their parents' drinking, and the effects can last well into adulthood. Four women - Karen, Liz, Hilary and Lynne - spoke to Jo Morris about growing up with a parent dependent on alcohol. ""Some people talk about what books they've read, or films they've been to see, but instead we talk about how drunk our parents were,"" says Karen. Karen and her friend Liz met at work in their late 20s and quickly bonded when they realised they had a shared history. ""It's not the same talking to somebody who doesn't know what it's like,"" says Liz. Gallows humour helps to deal with the horrible memories. Like the time Liz's mum sold her toys to get money for alcohol. Or the time Karen's alcoholic dad went to the pub instead of collecting her from after-school club. ""It's a bit like Top Trumps - alcoholic-parent Top Trumps,"" Karen laughs. They both remember dreading the walk home from school. ""It's so disheartening,"" says Karen. ""You think: 'OK, I've had a nice break at school, but here we go again. I'm going to be really polite and be really nice, make sure that I don't say anything out of turn or give you any reason to have a go at me.'"" It was only when Liz was eight or nine that she noticed her friends did not have any such concerns and lived very different lives. ""I thought: 'Oh, you have your dinner cooked for you? I don't even have dinner.' ""That's when you realise it's horrendous and you feel very alone going through it."" Once, her mum spent all her benefit money on alcohol, and all she could afford was a sack of potatoes. ""Potato weekend!"" Liz laughs. ""We literally had potatoes to live on for the weekend. So we had mashed potato, potato cakes, chips wrapped up in newspaper - she was very resourceful."" ""Potato weekend"" - when Liz' mum spent all the money on drink Food - or the lack of it - is a common theme. Hilary, 55, grew up in an upper-middle class family in Sunderland, with a respected surgeon as a father. The family kept up appearances - but her mother drank. ""I can remember being at school, and a girl in my form opening up her lunch and saying: 'Oh my sandwiches haven't been buttered to the edge.' It was like Planet Zorg compared to my life,"" she remembers. No-one was making sandwiches for Hilary. In fact it was left to her to look after her younger brother - putting him to bed, getting him ready for school, making sure he was fed. Her mum's drinking started out with a glass of wine ""while cooking"" but soon escalated to a bottle of vodka a day. ""She was hiding bottles, they were all over the place - in her shoeboxes, you'd find glasses of neat vodka behind curtains and if you put the oven on you checked there wasn't a bottle hidden in there. Watching her elegant and educated mother fade away was very painful. ""You couldn't hold a conversation with her because she was drunk,"" Hilary says. ""It was like she wasn't there really - she went from being very present to becoming a ghost."" Liz's mother had been a model, but after she began to drink she never quite knew where to put on her make-up. ""She looked like Aunt Sally from Worzel Gummidge,"" she says. Liz's own life began to spin out of control, as a result of neglect. By the age of 15, Liz had become involved in an abusive relationship, and was put into foster care. It was thanks to her friends that she survived, she says. ""I've been good at choosing good friends who helped me through it, friends who weren't into drugs and drinking."" Then, when she saw her friends go to university she decided she would, too - the only child in Surrey social services at the time who did. ""I definitely deserve a prize for that,"" she says. ""It's like walking on eggshells"" For Jabs, 22, living with her alcoholic father was like ""walking on eggshells"". All this week Woman's Hour will be hearing from adult children of alcoholics. Jo Morris spoke to six women of different ages and backgrounds, from all over the UK. Listen to Hilary:'It was like she wasn't there in many ways' Listen to Lynne:'I used to think that I wasn't entitled to anything nice' You can find all the interviews on theWoman's Hour website Now 37, with a young family, she visits her mother a few times a year but wants no further involvement - one reason why she has put off marriage to her long-term partner. ""I don't want her at my wedding,"" she says. ""But I'm too nice to think of her sat at home alone."" Lynne's mother died 13 years ago from complications caused by her alcoholism. She rummages through a box of her mother's things that she put together after bereavement counselling. ""What was hard was that everyone in the church all stood up and said how great she was,"" she says, remembering their complicated relationship. ""Every childhood memory is laced with the memory of my mum drinking. ""I cannot recall a day when she didn't send me and my sister with a note to the shop: 'Please sell my children two bottles of Olde English and four cans of Special Brew' - and I wasn't the only kid on the council estate doing that."" Her mother could get nasty when she was drunk, and even violent. ""It was so confusing and upsetting. Sometimes I'd barricade myself inside my bedroom. Even now, talking about it, I get that feeling in my gut that I want to leave the house."" Today her flat is cosy and welcoming - the polar opposite, she says, of the home she grew up in. And this is important to her. ""I used to feel that I wasn't entitled to anything that was wholesome or good,"" she says - but that's no longer the case. After moving to London she built the life she wanted to have. She feels loved by her husband and friends. ""I'm just basking in that,"" she says. When Lynne's mother died, she collected her belongings in a box She pulls out something else from her bereavement box - a ticket from the hospital from when she was born, saying how much she weighed. ""I was amazed that she still kept this,"" she says, clearly moved. ""Consciously making the decision to not have a child myself is the legacy of it all. ""In my heart I was so afraid I wouldn't be able to look after someone else, and I might repeat her mistakes. Is it in the genes, could this come out in me? That is something I've always thought."" Hilary does have a child, a teenager, and relishes the opportunity to be the attentive mother she herself lacked. She has also made sure that, unlike her own mother - a former nurse, who ended up spending her life at home - she is always busy. ""I learned my lesson from my mum,"" she says. ""I play a lot of sport, and I work - I need structure. ""I think mum was lonely and sad. That gets me. I think she could have been helped."" She remembers coming home from a Christmas party as a teenager to find her mum at the bottom of her stairs holding a carving knife, threatening to kill herself. She had drunk the Christmas port and replaced it with Ribena, which led to a row with her husband. Hilary's mother hid bottles all over the house Hilary drove her mother to hospital and got her admitted to the alcohol dependency unit there. The next day at Christmas lunch nobody in the family acknowledged what had happened. ""It was the great lie. We never spoke about anything in the family."" Today she still hates liars. ""And I loathe people who fraudulently present themselves as something they're not, because that is how I was brought up. ""The fact that I couldn't talk about how it was probably contributed to my hideous depression,"" Hilary says. Shame and secrecy are words that come up often, talking to these women. All of them wish they'd had someone to talk to about their parents' drinking when they were growing up. Liz and Karen, who find comfort in sharing stories with each other now, had nobody to turn to as children, and couldn't see a way out. ""When you're eight or nine you can't go anywhere,"" says Liz, who was bullied about her mum's drinking. ""It's not your fault if your parent is alcoholic."" Karen nods in agreement. ""How many kids go through this? Keeping all this pressure, stress and anxiety to themselves because they have nobody at school to talk to - it's really sad and horrid and there are kids going through this now,"" she says. Lynne feels badly let down by the authorities. ""I find it staggering that my mum was sectioned and no-one said: 'What is happening to this young teenager?' ""Actually that is what makes me the angriest. All that support system in society - school, doctor, social services - where were they?"" NACOA,external- The National Association For Children Of Alcoholics ADFAM,external- Supporting families affected by drugs and alcohol Al-Anon,external- For families and friends of alcoholics For Hilary, there was help of sorts in the shape of her Uncle David - her mother's brother. ""No other adult had helped me up to that point, no other adult intervened."" She describes how he bundled her and her siblings into his car and drove them round and round, so that they relaxed and started to tell him stories about her mother's drinking. He convinced Hilary's mum to stop drinking for three months so that Hilary could concentrate on her A-levels. ""He made us feel safe, suddenly the sun shone in my life."" Her mum only remained sober for those three months, but it meant Hilary passed her A-levels, and then she escaped the stresses of home for university. She has never forgotten Uncle David's kindness, and she still visits him every week. Karen's dad stopped drinking 13 years ago, but she still has a recurring nightmare that he's started up again. ""I still have that panic of: here we go again."" Does she talk to her parents about what happened? ""It's never discussed."" ""Now I'm a parent, the thought of acting like that to my child is unbelievable,"" she adds. ""The stress we get into about what to feed our children."" Liz agrees: ""Yes, five a day."" ""And you got a sack of potatoes to last the weekend!"" jokes Karen. And they both erupt into laughter again.

"This video can not be played Would you eat this reindeer? Alaskan farmers hope so. As a warming climate threatens traditional food supplies in the Arctic, one rural Alaskan village is flying in hundreds of reindeer by cargo plane. James Cook went to find out why. Only 12,000 years late, on an experimental farm outside Fairbanks in central Alaska, Greg Finstad is proposing an agricultural revolution. For the indigenous communities of the north, he is advocating a move from hunting to farming, in particular to farming reindeer. Finstad, who runs the reindeer research programme at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, says the subsistence lifestyle of rural communities on the Yukon river is under serious threat in a time of tumultuous change. Softly spoken, his eyes shaded from the sunshine by a baseball cap, Finstad is a disarming mix of wit, charm and frankness. ""They're off the road system,"" he says. ""They have to ship very expensive food. They're very worried about starving and it's a legitimate concern."" For those who have traditionally relied on subsistence hunting, these are indeed challenging times. Polar bears arescarcer than everand, even for the few with permits to hunt the animals, tracking them on thinning ice is becoming ever more dangerous. Wildcaribou herds have been shrinking,externalfor reasons that are not entirely clear. And last year saw thelowest harvest of pink salmon since 1977,external, although sockeye salmon have been more resilient. A more unpredictable climate may be affecting the animals' migration patterns and food sources, although some recent evidencesuggests,externalthey may now be adapting to those changes. Melting water on glacier in Alaska What is not in doubt, according to more than 90 scientists who contributed to arecent report by an Arctic Council working group,external, is ""rising concentrations of greenhouse gases are driving widespread changes in the Arctic's sensitive climate"". According to the report, ice on sea and land is declining; permafrost is warming; and spring snow cover is retreating. ""With each additional year of data, it becomes increasingly clear that the Arctic as we know it is being replaced by a warmer, wetter, and more variable environment,"" say the authors, who add that the transformation has ""profound implications for people, resources, and ecosystems worldwide"". One Yukon river community - Steven's Village - has purchased a 2,000-acre (800-hectare) farm. The plan is to raise some 1,500 to 2,000 reindeer to feed the village, to sell, and to act as a staging area for livestock for other settlements. Finstad thinks deer are hardier than cattle, and in any case he is not a fan of the beef industry, which he accuses of trying to stymie reindeer production. ""If you compare beef to reindeer we flat out kick their butt every time in flavour,"" he insists. He says the plan is to load hundreds of reindeer on to a Douglas DC-6 transport plane and fly them from the west coast of Alaska to the interior to start the new farm. This ""seed stock"" for Steven's Village may come from Nome on the Seward peninsula, which juts out towards Russia between the Bering and Chukchi seas. There is a historical twist here. The Seward peninsula is the region where reindeerwere first introduced to the United States,externalfrom Siberia in 1892 because Alaskan whaling communities were struggling to survive. Maintaining the reindeer population on the peninsula has been difficult. Stopping animals running off with migrating caribou herds is a particular challenge. Caribou and reindeer are the same species -Rangifer tarandus- but in North America, the semi-domesticated variety are known as reindeer, and the wild herds are known as caribou (in Europe the word caribou is not used at all). Ann and Bruce Davis, who have a thriving reindeer herd in Nome at their Midnite Sun Reindeer Ranch, also rhapsodise about the properties of the meat. ""The fat is deposited on the outside of the reindeer and not marbled within the meat so the meat is very lean,"" says Bruce Davis. The fat doesn't go to waste though. The Inupiat people mix it with a variety of berries to make a concoction which the Davises say is known locally as ""Eskimo ice cream"". ""It's very high in carbs and fat and so it's a good source of energy and it's pretty good to eat too,"" says Ann Davis before offering a word of caution. ""It's nothing like American ice cream!"" Two Inuit hunters in Canada strip the meat from a pair of reindeer carcasses, March 1924. There are plenty of other ways to eat reindeer, including roasting it with garlic and herbs, frying the animal's heart or in a traditional Sami bidu, or feast stew. Before reindeer consumption becomes widespread though, there is a problem to overcome. Reindeer have rather good PR, Greg Finstad admits. ""It's the perception that reindeer are on this planet to pull a sled with this chubby guy in a red suit and a white beardâ¦ but that's actually not true,"" he says. ""Reindeer are on this planet to feed people."" ""So I guess it's my job to take the magic of Christmas."" ""We have to eat Rudolph?"" I ask. ""Yes,"" answers Finstad, his expression somewhere between weary and mischievous. ""I actually got in trouble saying we are going to eat rump of Rudolph. ""So I try not to say that any more.""

"This video can not be played Ian Hopkins, from Greater Manchester Police, said it was the ""most horrific incident"" the city has faced The UK has not seen a bomb attack like theManchester outragesince 2005 for three simple reasons: It takes some expertise, which is difficult to come by without help. It requires a lot of planning and preparation, both of which increase the chances that MI5 and other agencies will discover what is going on. Individuals who are sufficiently organised to put the first two together and determined enough to see the plan through to its awful conclusion are very rare. Manchester explosion: Latest updates Eyewitnesses tell of blast horror What we know so far General election campaigning suspended For more than a decade, the BBC Home Affairs Unit has monitored every single terrorist incident, attempted or failed, that has made it into the public domain. Quite simply, most of the people we have seen dragged through the courts are not capable of this kind of incident. Many aspire to ""martyrdom"" and talk about building bombs. But they are either, to be frank, too stupid and disorganised to turn their fantasies into reality or, alternatively, they get caught because they don't know how to cover their tracks. Most jihadists discount a bomb attack at the early stages: they realise that it's too difficult to pull off. They might accidentally kill themselves while making the device. Their purchasing patterns might raise suspicions in a local pharmacy or, online, prompt GCHQ to have a closer look at their digital life. They may turn to someone else for help who, unbeknown to both, is already on the MI5 radar. And so, asthe 2013 killing of Fusilier Lee Rigbyshowed - exactly four years before the Manchester attack - most aspiring attackers opt for a different course. Vehicles and knives became the weapons of choice. We saw it in 2014 when a London man planned a knife attack to coincide with the annual act of remembrance. We saw it again with theKhalid Masood Westminster attack. Khalid Masood was shot at the scene of the Westminster attack But while knives and vehicles - and to a lesser extent guns - have featured in recent terrorism plots, there are people who still want to build bombs to attack crowded places. Just recently, the younger brother of the man in the Remembrance Sunday incidentpleaded guilty to trying to find bomb-making help- and one of his potential targets was an Elton John concert. So the big question for investigators is given that bomb-making requires expertise, how did the attacker, 22-year-old Salman Abedi, get hold of such a device? As Tuesday dawned, there were three possibilities: He was taught how to make it He taught himself He was provided with the device by someone else If Abedi was taught, this could point to someone who has returned from so-called Islamic State territory in Syria and Iraq or another jiahdist theatre, such as Libya, where his father is from. The militants have constructed devices involving the type of DIY shrapnel of metal nuts that has been reported from the scene at the Manchester Arena. Al-Qaeda and its offshoots have deployed those devices too. Reaching those camps is a harder journey to make - but don't rule it out. Twenty-two people, including children, have been killed and 59 injured in the attack Either way, these are sophisticated devices, particularly if made to a well-known recipe that is circulated among extremists. It takes engineering skill. Sometimes the process of making a bomb can't easily be hidden. For instance, the 7/7 devices contained a chemical that bleached the hair of one of the bomb-makers. The fumes can kill plants. So if Abedi taught himself, how did he go about it in complete secrecy? Such an outcome would demonstrate how difficult it is to learn about a threat if the individual is acting entirely alone and taking exceptionally well planned precautions to avoid surveillance. It's not hard to find bomb-making plans online - don't go looking, it's an offence to possess this information - but many of them are useless. So, again, the attacker would have spent some time thinking and planning this - and that reduces the likelihood that he was acting entirely alone. The third scenario is the worst-possible because it would point to an active bomb-making technician on the loose in the UK. Someone who is completely beneath the security services radar. Someone who has found ways of reaching out to potential recruits without compromising themselves. Someone who could strike again. That, of course, is quite a worrying prospect - but by the end of Tuesday, security chiefs could not rule it out. So they had no choice but to raise the official ""threat level"", published by MI5, to the maximum level of ""critical"". That means an attack may be imminent. Nobody can say for sure because the intelligence business involves glimpsing at things in the shadows, hints and suspicions. It's less of a jigsaw with missing pieces, it's more like an impressionist's picture: one can only ever see part of what's going on. So, this is very much a manhunt for helpers - even though nobody may know for sure at this stage who, if anyone, they are actually hunting. Forensic teams are now working at the site The police know the identity of the attacker - this was a very early breakthrough. It took days back in 2005 for the police to be sure who carried out the London attacks. So as the hours progress, inside Thames House, the home of MI5, and its regional units, a large post-incident operation will be under way. Officers, supported by GCHQ and where necessary counterparts in foreign agencies, will be examining any piece of intelligence to build up a greater sense of the attacker, his life and those around him. The North West Counter Terrorism Unit, a joint team of MI5 and police officers, will be looking at anything it can glean from the attacker's own devices. Search teams will identify addresses to search - two have already been raided. Experts from the national Forensic Explosives Laboratory in Kent will begin the astonishingly difficult work of recovering the remains of the device so they can reconstruct it.  These scientists have performed this task on every bomb recovered in modern times. What they find may, in time, yield vital intelligence - such as the origins of the bomb recipe or its technical construction.

"This video can not be played The mum whose home-based business is blooming More and more women in the UK are setting up their own businesses as a way of reconciling the demands of work and family. How to balance those differing pressures? Dani Bolser thought she'd finally cracked it when she started her new job as a receptionist for an events company. ""It started off quite well, but suddenly my bosses were asking me to come in a little bit earlier or can you work a little bit later,"" she says. ""It just turned into something very high-pressured."" It wasn't her first attempt to get back into work. ""After the birth of my first child, I've tried part-time, full-time and working weekends. And no matter what I tried, it either broke into precious family time or it just wasn't financially viable for our family."" So at the age of 28, Dani started her own business, DeluxeBlooms, last year. She now designs and sells luxury faux flowers from her kitchen table in Ilkley, west Yorkshire. Dani Bolsover is working to establish her business ""My husband encouraged me,"" she says. ""I've always been creative. It kind of fits with my love of flowers. Now I can choose how much work I do. ""It's basically about that flexibility, to say, for instance, you know what, the kids are sick, work just gets put on hold and allows you to be a mum first and for me that's just priceless."" It turns out there are thousands of women just like Dani, who are shunning the traditional nine-to-five job in search of flexibility and more control over their working lives. New research from Oxford Economics shows that one in 170 people in the UK now works for a small creative business, making and selling unique products or gifts. The report was commissioned by notonthehighstreet.com, the online marketplace. Since it was founded 10 years ago, it's seen a huge growth in partners, or creative entrepreneurs, using its services to sell their products, up from 287 in 2006 to more than 5,700 today. ""In the last 10 years, thousands of creative small businesses have emerged all over the UK, creating jobs, driving wealth creation and contributing significantly to the economy,"" says notonthehighstreet.com's chief executive Simon Belsham. ""Perhaps most importantly, however, these businesses are highlighting the huge change under way in the UK workforce - a transformation that is seeing more women in work and more people turning to self-employment and flexible working."" Some 89% of notonthehighstreet.com partners are owned by women like Dani Bolser. But can they make a living out of it? ""Absolutely,"" says Simon Belsham. ""Last year, we had more than 20 businesses which made more than Â£1m in sales. It's a genuine way to make a living. It doesn't matter with age or gender. ""We've seen opportunities for recent graduates to people who have retired - 'second-halfers' as we like to call them - who are starting a business once they've retired from their first career."" Technology is driving these new ways of working. Laura Hutton realised she needed to keep up with the digital world For 53-year-old Laura Hutton, going digital was her route back into work. She took a career break from publishing once she became a mum. Laura then dabbled in estate agency work, as well as writing a host of cookbooks. But last year, she decided to gain some new skills through Digital Mums, a company which trains mums to be ""job-ready"", to kick-start their careers in digital and social media, and crucially to keep a healthy work-life balance. ""I realised that the world was moving, that the kind of jobs I wanted to get, I wasn't going to get unless I kept up with the digital world,"" says Laura. She now manages social media for Wyevale Garden Centres and says she can work from anywhere. Digital Mums has so far helped nearly 1,000 mums and businesses. Work on the go: Laura loves the flexibility her job offers ""I'm not chained to a desk,"" says Laura. ""I do work at home, but being freelance and mobile means I can go to a cafe if I have to meet someone. ""I can work as I go. Having that flexibility is important. It means I am there when my family is there. It's important to be around, especially as children grow up."" And she's not concerned about working remotely. ""I've never actually met my boss,"" she says. ""I work within marketing and for the head of marketing, who I've never met. So I miss out on the office banter. ""It doesn't bother me because I feel I've done that bit, the office job. I'm not interested any more. I like the fact that it doesn't really matter what I wear or whether I've brushed my hair in the morning. ""I'm lucky because I have a nice working relationship with my company."" Laura definitely isn't chained to a desk Laura and Dani are thriving on their newfound paths as they set their own work-life agenda. ""It's pushed me into assessing my life a bit more, what do I really want to do? I think the minute you strip that back and look at what makes you happy, you can achieve great things,"" says Dani. She admits her turnover is tiny so far, but she hopes perhaps one day to have her own shop and employ a mum like her who has struggled to get back into work.

"Julia Bell has no genetics background but has an extensive knowledge of how to analyse data A man left abandoned as a baby in a cinema toilet 61 years ago has tracked down his siblings with the help of a so-called ""DNA detective"". But what do they do? ""There's an analogy I like to use: I can crack any safe, some will just take longer than others,"" Julia Bell tells theVictoria Derbyshire programme. She helps people - many of whom have no knowledge of who their parents or siblings are - track down their long-lost relatives. Julia recently helpedRobert Weston, who was found in a ladies toilet in an Odeon cinema in Birmingham in 1956,find his half-brothers and sister for the first time. Many of her cases involve American soldiers, or GIs, who were stationed in the UK during World War Two, she says. Indeed, Julia says she is approached by someone who has discovered their father was in fact an American GI about once a month. ""More children were fathered by American servicemen than many people imagine,"" she says. Julia is also currently helping a woman who, as a baby, was left in a box at London's Kings Cross railway station, while another case involves a baby left on a train in 1928. So how does it work? ""It starts with a spit test, a DNA test, which I get people to do,"" Julia says. ""That's sent away for testing."" She then uses uses three direct-to-consumer DNA databases to cross-reference the data and then the detective work begins. Julia - who currently is not charging clients - says she begins looking at patterns within the database to try and establish matches. She then uses contacts around the world to try to identify relatives - however distant they may be. Tommy Chalmers (left), Pat McBain (centre) and Robert Weston (right) outside the house where their father lived When Robert Weston contacted her - 61 years after being abandoned in a cinema - he said he ""had been searching for a long, long time - 44 years or so"" without success. Julia asked him to provide a DNA saliva test and searched on the database in the hope of finding a distant relative. ""There will be somebody on there - fourth cousins or something - for nearly everyone out there,"" she explains. Initially there were more distant matches, but Julia was able to find and test a second cousin. ""I asked her if she had any male cousins and she said 'Tommy',"" Robert explains. ""He agreed to be tested and he turned out to be my half-brother."" But he says: ""You need a huge dollop of luck with all this."" The Birmingham Evening Despatch carried the story of Robert being found on its front page in 1956 On occasion, it is possible to trace relatives even further back. The Salvation Army's family tracing service has reunited relatives who have been out of touch for more than 80 years. It says it reunites 10 people every single working day, with an 89% success rate. It also protects the privacy of the person being sought by promising it will not pass on personal details unless permission is granted. Julia says while most cases can eventually be solved, a small number will permanently draw a blank. Even then, she says a person can get some information, including an estimate about their ethnicity. But she says as DNA databases increase in size, the odds of closer matches get better all the time. Julia has no genetics background, saying you instead need to be ""smart and logical"" and know how to work with data. ""I have a knowledge of science but my background was in teaching in Singapore,"" she says. ""My mother didn't know who her father was and that's how I got into this, helping to look for her dad."" She adds: ""I found someone in the states [US] who works in ancestry who helped show me how to do this. ""She helped me with seeing the patterns and using my intuition. She put the pieces together and I realised I was good at this. ""[My mum] found her father had died four years earlier. But she had a sister and now she's in touch with her family in the south of the US."" Where there is a success, she says third parties are ""generally"" positive when they find out they have relatives they never knew - although cases of abandoned babies can be ""very sensitive"". ""I might not always be the one to break the news, sometimes it could be a social worker."" A running theme, however, is that many long-lost relatives - despite their different upbringings - often share habits or interests. ""One set of people I matched turned out to both be astrophysicists,"" she says. Robert Weston and his half-bother Tommy share the same sense of humour, she adds. ""It's like they've known each other their whole life."" Watch theVictoria Derbyshire programmeon weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel.

"When Briton Tom Stewart retired to Malta with his wife, they were expecting an idyllic life in the Mediterranean. But a year ago Tom fled from a hospital and his whereabouts remain a mystery. The last time Phyllis Stewart saw her husband, he was climbing up an orange tree and clambering over the eight-foot high wall of a Maltese hospital. He had no money, phone, passport or medication for his type 2 diabetes. Since then, there have only been a couple of possible sightings of him on this tiny island, which is smaller than the Isle of Wight. This is despite the fact that, at 6ft 5in, he will stand out in any crowd. ""At first we thought he was dead, but now we don't think he is,"" Phyllis says. ""He's either hiding or being used to work for someone."" The 60-year-old had voluntarily entered Mount Carmel Hospital, which deals with mental health, on 21 May 2016, under the advice of a doctor, but abandoned it two days later. ""He kept asking to go for a walk in the hospital's garden,"" says Phyllis, 69. ""Then he turned to me and said, 'this isn't helping me. I can't be here'."" Moments later, despite Phyllis's pleas, Tom was over the wall and gone. The Maltese police's investigation into his whereabouts is still ongoing andone of the officers involved,externalhas described it as one of the force's most ""mysterious"" cases. In addition to their search, Phyllis has been joined by Tom's family and friends, who have travelled around the island to look for him. Phyllis says she is finding the situation particularly hard to deal with because Tom has never disappeared before. ""I think he's confused. He worked with a lot of Bulgarian people at a warehouse in Luton and got on well with them. There's a big community of them here and I think he might be with them."" Tom Stewart was a warehouse worker for Ocado in Luton before he retired Phyllis, who is originally from Dundee, has been with Tom, from Luton, for 26 years, and married for the past 10. The couple came to Malta for the first time on honeymoon in 2000 and retired there 18 months ago. She says there were no marital difficulties and that, while Tom was under stress at the time of his disappearance, he was not suicidal. ""We had problems with the building work on our flat and then I fell over and broke my shoulder in two places. Things were getting on top of him. ""He was not sleeping and had been given pills for anxiety. But he wasn't taking them."" Phyllis says staff at the psychiatric hospital described him as depressed, but she firmly disagrees. ""He went to the hospital voluntarily. He needed help, but he wasn't depressed. ""We've put up posters in lots of places. I've been on the television and in the newspapers and set up aFacebook page,,external"" she said. ""I've spoken to walking groups and asked that they keep an eye out for him. I'm offering a reward of 1,000 euros to anyone who can find him. ""I've done everything that I can to find my husband."" Phyllis Stewart says she is convinced her husband is still alive When people take their own lives in Malta, their bodies are usually discovered, not least because there are few deserted areas on the island, which is less than 17 miles long and only nine miles wide, with a population of 420,000 - although those numbers swell considerably during the tourist season. The two other islands in the Maltese archipelago, Gozo and Comino, are even smaller, and the bodies of those who drown are usually returned to shore by the sea. There were two possible sightings of Tom in the first few days after his disappearance. One of the couple's neighbours says he spoke to Tom at a bus stop and a member of the public claims he spotted him in a supermarket. But there has been nothing since then. Phyllis now intends to target her search to specific towns to see if she can track down her husband. In the meantime, she is keeping busy by volunteering in the children's section of a library. As she waits, she is being supported by family and ""fantastic"" friends in Malta. ""Tom's brother said to me that 'he'll get his head together and he'll be back'.

"Children and young people were directly affected by last month's attack in Manchester News of a terrorist attack is always frightening, but for parents there is the added dilemma of what to say to their children. Should I shield them from the news? Is it best just to turn off the television? Will the images they see traumatise them? Or should I tell my children exactly what's happened? The advice from professionals is that talking about these issues is better than avoiding them. Theattack on worshippers near a mosquein north London comes in the wake of that inManchester,which directly affected many children and young people, and of the attacks onLondon BridgeandWestminster Bridge. Consultant clinical psychologist Emma Citron, who specialises in children and trauma, says families should not shy away from talking about such events. ""Give children basic facts, tell them what it is they want to know, ask them what they would like to know and then give them access to that,"" she says. ""Support them and comfort them and be there for them, hug them, cry with them if they're crying, just respond to how they're responding emotionally. ""Take the lead from them - we need to know what it is they want answers to."" While turning off the television and radio might be a natural protective instinct, Dr Bernadka Dubicka, from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, says shielding children from traumatic events in the news isn't practical in today's society. ""Parents can't shield children from these events completely,"" she says. ""The reality is that children and young people are bombarded by 24/7 news."" Dr Dubicka says the most important thing is for parents to be there and to try to help their children manage their emotions. ""Trying to hide the news isn't helpful because they'll hear about it elsewhere and parents won't then be there to take them through it."" While it's important to talk about the news, parents should avoid unnecessary detail, adds Ms Citron. ""Avoid nasty details, there's no need for them, they're unnecessary. ""You don't want to be describing the scene, describing the bloodshed, describing what it looked like, showing them images - I would be avoiding all of that, because that can traumatise the child."" Ms Citron also advises parents to be firm with older children about how much they read on the internet. ""Tell your young person not to go scouring the internet for all the inside stories, it's just not necessary - we need to protect our young people as well."" Ms Citron says parents should take the lead from their children in how the conversation develops, but should try to include as many calm and reassuring phrases as possible. ""General comments like, 'This is a very rare occurrence', 'It's absolutely awful, but thank goodness it's extremely rare', and 'Security is going to be tightened even more', are really reassuring. ""We don't want our children feeling afraid to go out, we don't want them not to grow up to lead normal, happy, healthy, well-adjusted lives."" If faced with the question, ""Could this happen again, mummy?"", Ms Citron recommends telling the truth, but also giving children lots of reassurance about their normal, everyday activities. ""I would be saying, 'Of course it could' - and don't lie about that - 'But it's very unlikely, these are very, very rare events and we are sure the police are going to up security even more. ""'It'll be absolutely fine to still go to your football or your netball, it'll be absolutely fine to still go on your scout camp', or whatever it is they do. ""'We have to to carry on living our lives in a normal way and not be cowed by these bad people.'"" ""I'd be surprised if schools weren't giving pupils a chance to talk about the attack,"" says Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. ""If students want to talk, teachers will let them ask questions and they will be talking to them about how they can look at appropriate, reliable sources for information."" Mr Barton says schools will also be working hard to emphasise a sense of community cohesion. ""Schools will be wanting to emphasise the sense of community and shared values - they'll be using every opportunity to celebrate what they have in their own community."" But, in his 15-year experience as a head teacher, he says schools will be keeping a ""business as usual"" approach in the wake of this attack, unless they are directly affected. ""Routines are important and can carry people through - they keep a sense of calm purpose."" The signs of trauma depend very much on the individual, however, symptoms to watch for include: child becoming fearful, clingy and anxious bedwetting child becoming preoccupied with thoughts and memories being unable to concentrate becoming irritable and disobedient physical symptoms such as headaches and stomach-aches If you are concerned about your child and think he or she is traumatised by events in the news, you can approach your GP. If the problems go on, the doctor may suggest accessing some extra help from the local child and adolescent mental health service (Camhs). But parents should try not to be overly anxious, as Dr Dubicka says: ""The vast majority of young people will cope with this and will be OK.""

"This video can not be played Why Ajax are the most important club in football Europa League final: Ajax v Manchester United Venue:Friends Arena, StockholmDate:24 May, 19:45 BST Coverage:Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live and online (from 18:30 BST), live text commentary on BBC Sport and app No matter the outcome of the Europa League final on Wednesday against Manchester United, 24 May will always have a special sentiment for Ajax and its fans. On 24 May, 1995, Ajax managed to achieve the unthinkable; winning the Champions League with a team that was only 25 years old on average, beating Italian giants AC Milan 1-0 in the final. Exactly 22 years later, Ajax have the opportunity once again to do something the club and its fans could not have possibly imagined. It is fitting, then, that the teams of then and now share so many connections beyond the iconic red and white jersey, as the Netherlands' most successful club will try to end its longest title drought in continental competition. Edwin van der Sar, who was the goalkeeper in that famous Ajax side and won a Champions League with Manchester United to boot, is now the general director of the club from the capital. Former Arsenal player Marc Overmars, currently the director of football at Ajax, was another starter that night in Vienna, taking up duties on the left wing. Kluivert - whose son now plays for Ajax - scored against Milan 22 years ago And with 18-year old Justin Kluivert in the side 22 years after his father Patrick became the youngest player to score a winner in a Champions League final, there might even be some historic on-pitch involvement, although the Dutch will be fearful of Manchester United's Daley Blind denying the club that his father Danny captained to the Amsterdammers' last European triumph. The shadow of a team managed by another mutual acquaintance of both Manchester United and Ajax lingers over the final in Sweden - in 1995, Louis van Gaal was in charge of the Dutch club. Yet the current manager who has revitalized Ajax after a few stale years considers himself a disciple of the late Johan Cruyff. Phil Neville analysis: Man Utd must be on the front foot Chance to make history excites Herrera Peter Bosz made a career for himself as a combative midfielder at Vitesse and Feyenoord, but at an early age, he was captured by the magic of Johan Cruyff. When playing with Vitesse in the early 1980s, Bosz would regularly go to watch Ajax ""because Cruyff was a football legend, returning to the Netherlands, and you wanted to see that with your own eyes. See as much of him as you could."" Talking to FC Afkicken, he added: ""I realised I wouldn't become the best player in the world, but I wanted to try and become one of the best managers in the future. So I tracked everything Cruyff-related, going through magazines, papers, collecting all the articles I could find."" The Ajax side which started the 1995 Champions League final. Household names everywhere - and Patrick Kluivert and Kanu came off the bench Bosz, 53, won the title as a player and eight caps for the Netherlands but faced a lot of criticism for his period as technical director of Feyenoord, during a dark period for the Rotterdam club. Bosz has gone from an on-field pragmatist to an off-field protagonist when it comes to the football he admires. Returning to Heracles Almelo in 2010, Bosz dared to play a 3-4-3 formation at a team destined for a bottom-half finish. He even managed to reach the Europa League play-offs and a KNVB Cup final with theHeraclieden. He then transformed Vitesse into one of the most entertaining sides of the league and even - albeit briefly -  threatened the establishment after picking up the joint-most points in the first half of the 2013-14 season, giving Ajax a run for their money. Bosz then headed to Maccabi Tel Aviv, working together with Jordi Cruyff and spending a week with Johan, learning and polishing his skills and philosophy. ""Peter and Johan spent many hours, talking about football, about organization, everything and I think there was a clear mutual respect,"" Jordi told Dutch broadcaster NOS. Bosz had no background at Ajax but has recreated the ""style of old"" at the club Even before Bosz was appointed at Maccabi, Johan had told Jordi that Bosz would be a great choice, but thought he would be out of reach for a club like Maccabi. ""He could hardly believe it when we managed to appoint him,"" added Jordi. When Frank de Boer announced his departure from Ajax last summer, Bosz in many ways seemed a perfect replacement despite his Feyenoord past and lack of involvement at Ajax in the past. Bosz inherited a team more in the image of Van Gaal's Manchester United than a Cruyffian Ajax - and replaced a club legend in De Boer who had won four titles in five-and-a-half years. After a wobbly first two months, during which many outlets of the media called for Bosz's head, he has been able to design a team more capable of executing a style of football that Ajax's godfather Cruyff would appreciate. Ajax finished the Dutch season in second place, but playing attacking football en route to 81 points - a tally that would have been good enough for an Eredivisie title win in seven of the last 10 seasons. The Europa League run has for a large part washed away previous criticism as well. This video can not be played Who are Ajax's young academy stars making history? Over the last decade the Eredivisie's average age has decreased by two years, but instead of seeing that as a disadvantage, the Ajax manager has turned it into a strength. He has shaped the squad comprising largely of early twenty-somethings and teenagers in his image, resulting to an affectionate labelling of the team as 'the Bosz Babes'. Bosz recently named the youngest team in Eredivisie history, with an average age of 20 years and 139 days. Only one player was older than 21 - and yet the club easily defeated Willem II 3-1. Legendary Ajax defender Ruud Krol, who won three European Cups alongside Cruyff in the 1970s, was full of praise talking to De Telegraaf last week. ""'I recognize the Ajax style of old in this team,"" he said. ""The pressing, the tenacity, the enthusiasm. These are the characteristics that once made the club great and is what I really enjoy."" There have been many changes - of the team that started the last game of the 2015/16 season only four are still regularly called upon. As well as Cruyff, Bosz has often cited Pep Guardiola's 2011 Barcelona team as his main inspiration. Kasper Dolberg, Hakim Ziyech, Davinson Sanchez and Andra Onana have all been pivotal in their debut season for the club to implement that style of play. The starting XI which Ajax fielded against Willem II earlier this month - with an average age of just over 20 Dolberg has been the main talking point. The 19-year-old striker is amongst hottest young strikers in European football, the first Ajax teenager with 16 league goals in a season since Patrick Kluivert in 1995 and already the joint-top goalscoring teenager in Europa League history with six goals. Former Barcelona goalkeeper AndrÃ© Onanahas traded in shaky performances with the second team for a very assured presence in the first team, allowing his defenders to play a high line, being alert and comfortable with both feet. Hakim Ziyech has slowly transformed from a fancy number 10 into an industrious yet creative pressing machine.  Colombian Sanchez - described as ""a beast, an absolute pleasure to play alongside"" by team-mate Kenny Tete - has developed into an all-round modern centre-back. A 15m euro investment in the pair will almost certainly be doubled, at the very least, should either leave. It's not all youth products though. Marc Overmars spent over 35m euros in the transfer market last summer. A fraction compared to opponents Manchester United, but more than Ajax had in the previous three seasons combined and something that clearly marks a change of approach. As well as Sanchez and Ziyech, money has been splashed on South American talents David Neres and Mateo Cassierra, while Chelsea received a loan fee of 2m euros for Bertrand Traore. On average, United are four years older and wiser, and that's before we even consider United's greater European experience. But Ajax have revelled in their underdog status already this season. Schalke were swept away with ease (2-0), as were Lyon (4-1) in the home legs for the Dutch club. For Manchester United, the game will be a chance to redeem an otherwise unremarkable season. For Ajax, it would be a new jewel in their crown, 22 years and a generation on from their last.

"Sam Allardyce won eight of his 21 Premier League games as Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce has resigned as Crystal Palace manager five months after he joined the Premier League club. Allardyce replaced Alan Pardew in December on a two-and-half-year deal with the Eagles one point above the relegation zone. The 62-year-old, who had an ill-fatedone-game spell as England boss,led the club to eight wins in 21 games to guide them to a 14th-place finish. ""I have no ambitions to take another job,"" Allardyce said in a statement. ""I want to be able to savour life while I am still relatively young, and when I am still relatively healthy enough to do all the things I want to do, like travel, spend more time with my family and grandchildren without the huge pressure that comes with being a football manager. ""This is the right time for me. I simply want to be able to enjoy all the things you cannot really enjoy with the 24/7 demands of managing any football club, let alone one in the Premier League."" Listen - 'Allardyce looks set to retire' Allardyce revealed his decision to chairman Steve Parish at a meeting in London on Tuesday. The Eagles are now looking for their eighth manager in seven years. Although it took Allardyce six games to get his first victory - with BBC Sport asking if the'Big Sam bounce had deserted Palace'- the former Bolton, Blackburn, Newcastle and West Ham boss maintained his record of never being relegated from the Premier League. Only Sir Alex Ferguson, Arsene Wenger, Harry Redknapp and David Moyes have managed more games in the Premier League. Allardyce's final game in charge of Palace came on Sunday, a2-0 loss at Manchester United,having guaranteed safety the previous week bythrashing Hull 4-0. Following defeat at Old Trafford, Allardyce indicated his plans to improve the squad in the summer. He had told BBC Sport: ""We now need to grow, develop and invest. You need to choose the right players and not the wrong ones. Recruitment is the difficult task in the summer.""

I believe the club are heading in the right direction with a hugely supportive board of directors, a great squad of players and some of the most passionate fans I've ever met. ""But there comes a time when you have to take stock of what direction you want your life to take - and that's been the simple part for me.

"This video can not be played Would you eat this reindeer? Alaskan farmers hope so. As a warming climate threatens traditional food supplies in the Arctic, one rural Alaskan village is flying in hundreds of reindeer by cargo plane. James Cook went to find out why. Only 12,000 years late, on an experimental farm outside Fairbanks in central Alaska, Greg Finstad is proposing an agricultural revolution. For the indigenous communities of the north, he is advocating a move from hunting to farming, in particular to farming reindeer. Finstad, who runs the reindeer research programme at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, says the subsistence lifestyle of rural communities on the Yukon river is under serious threat in a time of tumultuous change. Softly spoken, his eyes shaded from the sunshine by a baseball cap, Finstad is a disarming mix of wit, charm and frankness. ""They're off the road system,"" he says. ""They have to ship very expensive food. They're very worried about starving and it's a legitimate concern."" For those who have traditionally relied on subsistence hunting, these are indeed challenging times. Polar bears arescarcer than everand, even for the few with permits to hunt the animals, tracking them on thinning ice is becoming ever more dangerous. Wildcaribou herds have been shrinking,externalfor reasons that are not entirely clear. And last year saw thelowest harvest of pink salmon since 1977,external, although sockeye salmon have been more resilient. A more unpredictable climate may be affecting the animals' migration patterns and food sources, although some recent evidencesuggests,externalthey may now be adapting to those changes. Melting water on glacier in Alaska What is not in doubt, according to more than 90 scientists who contributed to arecent report by an Arctic Council working group,external, is ""rising concentrations of greenhouse gases are driving widespread changes in the Arctic's sensitive climate"". According to the report, ice on sea and land is declining; permafrost is warming; and spring snow cover is retreating. ""With each additional year of data, it becomes increasingly clear that the Arctic as we know it is being replaced by a warmer, wetter, and more variable environment,"" say the authors, who add that the transformation has ""profound implications for people, resources, and ecosystems worldwide"". One Yukon river community - Steven's Village - has purchased a 2,000-acre (800-hectare) farm. The plan is to raise some 1,500 to 2,000 reindeer to feed the village, to sell, and to act as a staging area for livestock for other settlements. Finstad thinks deer are hardier than cattle, and in any case he is not a fan of the beef industry, which he accuses of trying to stymie reindeer production. ""If you compare beef to reindeer we flat out kick their butt every time in flavour,"" he insists. He says the plan is to load hundreds of reindeer on to a Douglas DC-6 transport plane and fly them from the west coast of Alaska to the interior to start the new farm. This ""seed stock"" for Steven's Village may come from Nome on the Seward peninsula, which juts out towards Russia between the Bering and Chukchi seas. There is a historical twist here. The Seward peninsula is the region where reindeerwere first introduced to the United States,externalfrom Siberia in 1892 because Alaskan whaling communities were struggling to survive. Maintaining the reindeer population on the peninsula has been difficult. Stopping animals running off with migrating caribou herds is a particular challenge. Caribou and reindeer are the same species -Rangifer tarandus- but in North America, the semi-domesticated variety are known as reindeer, and the wild herds are known as caribou (in Europe the word caribou is not used at all). Ann and Bruce Davis, who have a thriving reindeer herd in Nome at their Midnite Sun Reindeer Ranch, also rhapsodise about the properties of the meat. ""The fat is deposited on the outside of the reindeer and not marbled within the meat so the meat is very lean,"" says Bruce Davis. The fat doesn't go to waste though. The Inupiat people mix it with a variety of berries to make a concoction which the Davises say is known locally as ""Eskimo ice cream"". ""It's very high in carbs and fat and so it's a good source of energy and it's pretty good to eat too,"" says Ann Davis before offering a word of caution. ""It's nothing like American ice cream!"" Two Inuit hunters in Canada strip the meat from a pair of reindeer carcasses, March 1924. There are plenty of other ways to eat reindeer, including roasting it with garlic and herbs, frying the animal's heart or in a traditional Sami bidu, or feast stew. Before reindeer consumption becomes widespread though, there is a problem to overcome. Reindeer have rather good PR, Greg Finstad admits. ""It's the perception that reindeer are on this planet to pull a sled with this chubby guy in a red suit and a white beardâ¦ but that's actually not true,"" he says. ""Reindeer are on this planet to feed people."" ""So I guess it's my job to take the magic of Christmas."" ""We have to eat Rudolph?"" I ask. ""Yes,"" answers Finstad, his expression somewhere between weary and mischievous. ""I actually got in trouble saying we are going to eat rump of Rudolph. ""So I try not to say that any more.""

"This video can not be played Chris Wood wins 2016 PGA Championship BMW PGA Championship Venue:WentworthDates:25-28 May Coverage:Score updates on Radio 5 live plus highlights from 18:00 BST on BBC Two, Saturday 27 & Sunday 28 May Defending champion Chris Wood predicts lower scoring at this week's PGA Championship at Wentworth. But success will not only be measured on scorecards at Britain's biggest golf gathering outside the Open Championship. This is a huge week for the European Tour as they use the Wentworth tournament to launch an elevated strata of events designed to compete with the might of the PGA Tour. And be in no doubt, the American circuit's influence continues to grow. It is relentlessly dominant and ready to make its already wealthy players even richer. So, on this side of the pond, the Â£5.4m Wentworth extravaganza needs to succeed as it tees up the newly branded Rolex Series of elite events on the European Tour. This week should prove a turning point after recent PGAs left disgruntled players muttering about the West Course's suitability to hold such tournaments. ""There were murmurs a couple of years ago if we didn't do something drastic that the Tour could look elsewhere,"" Stephen Gibson, Wentworth's CEO, told BBC Sport. ""I don't think they have reason to now."" Gibson has overseen more than Â£5m worth of investment, which has been poured into renovating the West Course over the past year. All 18 greens have been relaid with 007 creeping bentgrass, while sub-air technology, as used at Augusta, has been installed under every putting surface to control moisture. Defending champion Woodagrees. The Bristolian shot nine under par to claim the biggest title of his career, and is convinced a lower score will be required for a successful title defence. ""I hope the changes don't affect my results too much,"" said a smiling Wood, who has been a consistent Wentworth performer in recent years. ""But they are really good changes and the big thing is the condition of the greens. They really needed looking at and you can't fault them. ""The greens are a shot easier purely because of the surfaces and I think the bunkers are not so severe."" There are 25% fewer bunkers, and those that remain are shallower and easier to get out of. There are fewer bunkers in an effort to make the course fairer and encourage lower scoring ""Guys can hit irons onto the greens now instead of having to lay up,"" Wood told me. ""And that feeds back to the tee, where people will think, 'actually, I don't mind going in that bunker now, so I'll be a little bit more aggressive with my drive'. I can see lower scores."" Wood does not see any problem with that, but back in 2009 it was felt the West Course had become too easy. Ernie Els' design team sought to toughen up the layout where the average winning score had been nearly 15 under. In the following seven years, that average fell to 11.6 under despite An Byeong-hun's record 21-under victory in 2015. The changes were unpopular. Wentworth lost its charm and became a slog for anyone other than the best players. Now it is more like its old self, and Wood believes players and fans will be delighted. ""You finish with two par-fives and there should be the opportunity for a birdie/eagle finish to change the tournament and that's not really been there the last few years,"" he said. ""For people watching, that takes away a lot of the drama and entertainment, so I'm quite happy to see lower scores."" European Tour boss Keith Pelley concurs. ""I think people love to see birdies, love to see long drives,"" he told BBC Sport. ""In terms of the score, I'm not fussed by that."" Fans will see the biggest changes on the eighth, 11th, 14th and 16th greens, which have been completely remodelled. The biggest improvement is at the eighth, where the putting surface has been lowered closer to the water level in front and left of the green. A ludicrously deep bunker to the right has disappeared and is replaced by subtle mounding, more in keeping with the original design ethos. ""We created something which I believe is what the players wanted, and brought it back to that old Harry Colt design with some modernisation to it,"" Pelley added. ""The professionals say it is far more playable. It is definitely an elite golf course but also I think the members will really enjoy playing it."" Most important will be whether the new design provides a fitting stage for one of the tour's biggest tournaments. It has attracted a strong field butRory McIlroy's absence through a recurrence of his rib injuryis a big blow. His initial commitment was significant because the world number two gave immediate and vocal backing to the concept of the new Rolex Series, even though he is a paid ambassador for a rival luxury watchmaker. Now the series will begin in the absence of the tour's biggest star, but it helps that July's Irish Open, backed by McIlroy's charitable foundation, also features, as do the French, Scottish, Italian and Turkish Opens. ""We want to say, 'look we play in iconic cities and great venues',"" Pelley added. ""The golf course itself is absolutely critical and that's why the changes at Wentworth were so imperative."" Wentworth has hosted the PGA Championship every year since 1984, with the late Seve Ballesteros the winner in 1991 Creating a viable alternative to the PGA Tour is Pelley's primary objective, and he remains optimistic about the progress being made. ""Maybe you don't have to go to America,"" he said. ""When you look at the fields for our Rolex Series events compared to the previous years, the strength of field is stronger across the board. That's a positive sign."" But the competitive environment becomes no easier for Pelley and his Wentworth-based colleagues. The PGA Tour recently unveiled a massive new deal for their FedEx Cup play-offs which currently carries a $10m (Â£7.7m) first prize. ""Just wait until we announce the increase in prize money,"" a leading official told me last week. ""It will blow your mind."" Furthermore, the Florida organisation has pitched its stars and stripes in the European Tour's backyardby opening an office in central London.,external This is aimed at making it easier to further develop sponsor ties and broadcast deals on Pelley's turf. Be under no illusion, this is a vital week for his European Tour to demonstrate its wares and put on a tournament fit for the world's best, regardless of how low the scoring might be.

"Phil Neville is co-commentating on the Europa League final for BBC Radio 5 live on Wednesday, 24 May. Build-up to Ajax v Manchester United starts at 18:30 BST, with kick-off at 19:45. My fear for Manchester United in the Europa League final is they are weighed down by the pressure of having to win it to get into next season's Champions League. If United were heading to Stockholm having already qualified by finishing in the Premier League top four on top of having the EFL Cup in the bag, then I think their players would be a lot more relaxed. Instead, all of United's eggs are now in one basket, which is a dangerous situation to be in against a really good young Ajax team. This video can not be played Who are Ajax's young academy stars making history? Ajax are very impressive technically and they have lots of energy too. Their front five - with Bertrand Traore and Amin Younes either side of Kasper Dolberg in attack, and Davy Klaassen and Hakim Ziyech in the centre of midfield - give them goals and creativity, and a good mixture of pace and skill. Traore is very quick down the right but a little bit erratic, while Younes on the left is a good dribbler - he is not rapid but he is pretty sharp. This video can not be played 'No mixed feelings' - Van der Sar wants Ajax to beat Man Utd What Peter Bosz's team do well is play a high-tempo game - they like to press and win the ball back early. To counter that, United have to be really brave and mirror the approach they hadwhen they beat Chelsea at Old Trafford in April. They tore out of the blocks in that game and went toe to toe with Antonio Conte's side. They were positive and they put the champions under pressure, and never allowed them to settle. United played on the front foot that day and used the speed of Jesse Lingard and Marcus Rashford to pester Chelsea. The energy in midfield of Ander Herrera, Marouane Fellaini and Paul Pogba overpowered them. If they do the same again on Wednesday, I don't think Ajax will be able to live with them. Watch: Can Man Utd win the Europa League final? Danish striker Kasper Dolberg, 19, has scored a total of 23 goals in 47 games in all competitions for Ajax in 2016-17, including six in the Europa League Klaassen and Ziyech, in particular, are capable of dictating play if you let them, but if United get in their faces early on then they will not be able to find their rhythm. And Ajax's defence is definitely their weakness. They press on transition - whenever they lose the ball - but if you get past that initial press then there are some big spaces behind it, and their back line looks vulnerable. Kenny Tete at right-back is not quick, and centre-back Matthijs de Ligt is only 17 and erratic. The Europa League final is going to be a huge occasion for him. What United definitely shouldn't do is sit back like they did at Old Trafford in the second legs of their quarter-final and semi-final. When they did that againstAnderlechtandCelta Vigo,they got nervous. United were not playing well and it became a struggle as their opponents grew in confidence. United cannot allow that to happen again. They should see this as a game where they have to go out and start fast. If they put Ajax under pressure early on, and do some damage, they can seize control of the game. Jose Mourinho has won all three of his European finals so far - the 2003 Uefa Cup and 2004 Champions League with Porto, and the 2010 Champions League with Inter Milan. Including domestic competition, he has been in 13 finals - and won 11 of them Ajax's inexperience is definitely something United should try to exploit - none of their players have featured in a game as big as this before. But the Dutch team also do not have to deal with the same expectation of winning that United do, and they are already into the third qualifying round of next season's Champions League after finishing second in the Eredivisie - so the final is not make or break for them. On occasions like this, you wonder whether players will freeze or play without fear, and it is the same for United's younger players too. If there was ever a game in which United needed the know-how ofinjured striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic,it might be this one - because he would not be scared of what was at stake. Ibrahimovic has already delivered for United in the Community Shield and EFL Cup final. It is big games like this in which you need your big players, and there are none bigger at United than him. I think United will miss Zlatan, but what they do have in their favour is a manager who has been there and done it all before. Jose Mourinho has great experience, not just of the big occasions but of winning them. He is a serial winner and knows how to set up a team to win a final, and that is where I think United have the greatest advantage. Mourinho will have a massive influence on the day but he has already got all of the energy back into his team before the final. I don't think he can complain about them being tired because he has given his players the rest they needed in the three Premier League games they have played since they reached the final. United will be mentally fresh for this game, for the first time in about five or six weeks. It is a one-off game and finals are so unpredictable - but, under Mourinho, they will be ready. Phil Neville and his United team-mates celebrate their famous victory over Bayern Munich in the 1999 Champions League final The difference between United's form going into this final and the 1999 Champions League success that I was part of comes down to momentum. Back then, we had just won the Premier League and then the FA Cup. But there are still similarities this time - things that were drummed into you at Old Trafford when I was there, and still are under Mourinho. It is still the case that you cannot enjoy a final unless you win it. Getting there is not enough, even if by doing so you have already created history, as United have done by reaching a Europa League final for the first time. This video can not be played Jose Mourinho wants Manchester United to 'close trophy circle' And United still measure themselves on trophies won, not the fact they have finished outside the Champions League positions in the Premier League. Mourinho's whole philosophy is about winning, so you have got to admire the fact that, if they beat Ajax, they have two major trophies to show for their season. For me, that means they have been more successful than three of the clubs who finished above them in the table - Tottenham, Manchester City and Liverpool, who finished second, third and fourth. I would rather finish sixth and win two major trophies than finish second with none - that was the mentality I was brought up with at Old Trafford and I am pleased it is the same there now. Winning trophies gives you a taste of something you want more of, which is why success in Stockholm is important for this United team in the future, as well as the here and now. If you finish second, third or fourth and you don't get your hands on a trophy or a medal, you don't get to step on to that winning podium. There are no prizes in fact. There are several United players who have never won a trophy with the club, and I know what a boost getting some silverware gives you and how you get a thirst for more. Beating Ajax would make a big difference for next season, not just by getting them into the Champions League but to give them an advantage over the teams who have finished above them but have not got anything to show for it.

"This video can not be played Would you eat this reindeer? Alaskan farmers hope so. As a warming climate threatens traditional food supplies in the Arctic, one rural Alaskan village is flying in hundreds of reindeer by cargo plane. James Cook went to find out why. Only 12,000 years late, on an experimental farm outside Fairbanks in central Alaska, Greg Finstad is proposing an agricultural revolution. For the indigenous communities of the north, he is advocating a move from hunting to farming, in particular to farming reindeer. Finstad, who runs the reindeer research programme at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, says the subsistence lifestyle of rural communities on the Yukon river is under serious threat in a time of tumultuous change. Softly spoken, his eyes shaded from the sunshine by a baseball cap, Finstad is a disarming mix of wit, charm and frankness. ""They're off the road system,"" he says. ""They have to ship very expensive food. They're very worried about starving and it's a legitimate concern."" For those who have traditionally relied on subsistence hunting, these are indeed challenging times. Polar bears arescarcer than everand, even for the few with permits to hunt the animals, tracking them on thinning ice is becoming ever more dangerous. Wildcaribou herds have been shrinking,externalfor reasons that are not entirely clear. And last year saw thelowest harvest of pink salmon since 1977,external, although sockeye salmon have been more resilient. A more unpredictable climate may be affecting the animals' migration patterns and food sources, although some recent evidencesuggests,externalthey may now be adapting to those changes. Melting water on glacier in Alaska What is not in doubt, according to more than 90 scientists who contributed to arecent report by an Arctic Council working group,external, is ""rising concentrations of greenhouse gases are driving widespread changes in the Arctic's sensitive climate"". According to the report, ice on sea and land is declining; permafrost is warming; and spring snow cover is retreating. ""With each additional year of data, it becomes increasingly clear that the Arctic as we know it is being replaced by a warmer, wetter, and more variable environment,"" say the authors, who add that the transformation has ""profound implications for people, resources, and ecosystems worldwide"". One Yukon river community - Steven's Village - has purchased a 2,000-acre (800-hectare) farm. The plan is to raise some 1,500 to 2,000 reindeer to feed the village, to sell, and to act as a staging area for livestock for other settlements. Finstad thinks deer are hardier than cattle, and in any case he is not a fan of the beef industry, which he accuses of trying to stymie reindeer production. ""If you compare beef to reindeer we flat out kick their butt every time in flavour,"" he insists. He says the plan is to load hundreds of reindeer on to a Douglas DC-6 transport plane and fly them from the west coast of Alaska to the interior to start the new farm. This ""seed stock"" for Steven's Village may come from Nome on the Seward peninsula, which juts out towards Russia between the Bering and Chukchi seas. There is a historical twist here. The Seward peninsula is the region where reindeerwere first introduced to the United States,externalfrom Siberia in 1892 because Alaskan whaling communities were struggling to survive. Maintaining the reindeer population on the peninsula has been difficult. Stopping animals running off with migrating caribou herds is a particular challenge. Caribou and reindeer are the same species -Rangifer tarandus- but in North America, the semi-domesticated variety are known as reindeer, and the wild herds are known as caribou (in Europe the word caribou is not used at all). Ann and Bruce Davis, who have a thriving reindeer herd in Nome at their Midnite Sun Reindeer Ranch, also rhapsodise about the properties of the meat. ""The fat is deposited on the outside of the reindeer and not marbled within the meat so the meat is very lean,"" says Bruce Davis. The fat doesn't go to waste though. The Inupiat people mix it with a variety of berries to make a concoction which the Davises say is known locally as ""Eskimo ice cream"". ""It's very high in carbs and fat and so it's a good source of energy and it's pretty good to eat too,"" says Ann Davis before offering a word of caution. ""It's nothing like American ice cream!"" Two Inuit hunters in Canada strip the meat from a pair of reindeer carcasses, March 1924. There are plenty of other ways to eat reindeer, including roasting it with garlic and herbs, frying the animal's heart or in a traditional Sami bidu, or feast stew. Before reindeer consumption becomes widespread though, there is a problem to overcome. Reindeer have rather good PR, Greg Finstad admits. ""It's the perception that reindeer are on this planet to pull a sled with this chubby guy in a red suit and a white beardâ¦ but that's actually not true,"" he says. ""Reindeer are on this planet to feed people."" ""So I guess it's my job to take the magic of Christmas."" ""We have to eat Rudolph?"" I ask. ""Yes,"" answers Finstad, his expression somewhere between weary and mischievous. ""I actually got in trouble saying we are going to eat rump of Rudolph. ""So I try not to say that any more.""
