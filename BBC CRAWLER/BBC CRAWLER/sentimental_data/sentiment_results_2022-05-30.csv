"The pandemic, supply chain problems and the war in Ukraine have all had an impact on rising prices A Primark executive has told the BBC he ""regrets"" raising prices, as the fashion firm battles with rising costs. John Bason, finance director at Primark's parent company Associated British Foods, also warned some people might spend less as budgets are squeezed by the higher living costs. Primark is hiking prices across some of its range from this autumn. But Mr Bason said the company is still committed to ""affordability for everyone"". Across the UK economy, firms have been passing on higher energy, shipping and oil costs to customers. High Street chains including Next, Greggs and Superdry have all said they are raising prices. Primark to cut 400 store management jobs Next warns prices to rise by more than expected Why are prices rising so quickly? Primark hadpromised not to raise prices,externalfor its spring and summer collection. But while it is keeping that pledge, ABF recently announced that it will implement ""selective price increases"" across some of Primark's autumn and winter stock as it tackles spiralling costs. ""I do regret that we have to put some prices up,"" Mr Bason said. ""It is a reflection of the scale of the inflation that we're seeing."" Inflation - the rate at which prices rise -is at a 40-year-high. The pandemic, the supply chain disruption as the global economy rebounded, and the war in Ukraine have all impacted on rising prices. John Bason, finance director for Primark's parent company ABF, says costs are currently 'very high' ""Obviously Russia's invasion of Ukraine has really changed the economic environment and inflation in particular,"" Mr Bason said. ""We've worked hard to ensure that our prices stay where they are, but at some point the inflationary pressures is such that you do have to do something about it."" Mr Bason would not say how much prices will go up. However, he insisted that Primark was still ""the best value clothing fashion retailer"" in the UK. And said that, in an environment where other retailers were also raising prices, the gap - compared with others - could be maintained. Retail expert Jonathan de Mello said tightening household budgets due to the rising costs of food, fuel and energy are a huge problem for high street retailers. ""The cost of living crisis has achieved the dubious accolade of replacing Covid as the main concern for consumers currently, and as real incomes start to fall and prices rise further, retailers face yet another major headwind,"" he said. Bank chief in 'apocalyptic' warning on food prices Warning of economic downturn as interest rates rise Who is to blame for soaring prices? Mr de Mello added: ""These price increases will certainly impact less affluent consumers buying from Primark, who have already seen real incomes fall due to a combination of significantly higher energy prices, and food price inflation."" Unlike most High Street retailers, Primark does not sell its products online Mr Bason said: ""There are some consumers who would normally be spending more and probably would come into Primark, and I think there would be those that have very, very constrained budgets and probably would shop less with us as a result of this."" So far, however, Mr Bason said Primark is not seeing ""any major impact"" from the tightening of budgets. ""The footfall and the like-for-like sales that we're seeing in the UK have been on a strongly improving trend this year and that really is more about recovery from the pandemic,"" he said. ""People are travelling, people are going back to the office although probably not back to where it was, and people are socialising. So we're seeing a big pick up in sales relating to those activities."" Unlike most High Street retailers, Primark does not sell its products online. As a result,the business was hit hard by Covid restrictionswhile stores were closed. The group has recently revamped its website to give more details of in-store ranges, so customers can browse the full collection and check availability before coming into stores. But Mr Bason said he is confident that the high street does have a future. Primark shopper numbers 'back to pre-Covid levels' Primark says stock woes could persist until 2023 ""Even though we were closed probably six months for the two main years of the pandemic, our customers have come back to us. That I think is very very striking,"" he added. ""So no, I think the demise of the high street is way overstated, but it is changing. There's no doubt over it."" Mr Bason is also confident that fast fashion can be green, with the chainannouncing new sustainability pledges last year. The pledges included a commitment to making Primark's clothes using recycled or ""more sustainably sourced materials"" by 2030. Mr Bason said that the soaring energy prices, fuelled by the Ukraine war, could act as a catalyst to greater energy efficiency as suppliers look to reduce their costs.

"One in five pupils in England are eligible for free school meals, according to the most recent data More children should be given free school meals to help tackle the ""devastating reality"" of the cost of living crisis in England, teachers say. All children from families who receive universal credit should be eligible as part of an ""urgent"" expansion of the scheme, 11 educational groups said in a letter seen by the BBC. Around one in five pupils - 1.7 million children - receive free school meals. The government said it recognised households were struggling. It said it had expanded access to the meals more than any other government in recent decades. Warning over shrinking school meals as prices rise Budget pasta prices jump 50% as food staples rise How many children need free meals? The prices of food, fuel and other goods have surged in recent months in the UK, pushing inflation - the rate at which prices rise - to a 40-year high. Measures the government have announced to try to tackle the rising cost of living includea Â£400 energy bill discount for every household. But the joint letter, sent to Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi by education unions and other organisations claiming to represent one million school staff in England, said vulnerable children not receiving free school meals were facing a ""real barrier to learning"". ""We see the devastating reality of children coming to school unable to afford to buy lunch, because their family circumstances means they fall outside the restrictive free school meal eligibility criteria,"" it said. In England, all infant state school pupils up to Year Two can get free school meals during term time. For English pupils in Year Three and above, those living in households on income-related benefits (such as universal credit) are eligible, as long as their annual household income does not exceed Â£7,400 after tax. That figure does not include welfare payments. In Northern Ireland the cap is set at Â£14,000 a year. ScotlandandWaleshave recently committed to rolling out free school meal provision to all primary pupils. Rachel Bresnahan runs a free holiday club in Stockport, to help children stay well-fed during half-term The latest call for change follows footballerMarcus Rashford's successful campaignto extend free school meal vouchers into school holidays during the pandemic. An estimated 2.6 million children in the UK live in households that missed meals or struggled to access healthy food during April, according to data from the Food Foundation charity. Rachel Bresnahan, who works for a community group in Stockport, the Cherry Tree Project, told BBC News many people who rely on the project live in food poverty, but their children are not eligible for free school meals. ""Our food banks have always run in the mornings, and suddenly people are asking if they can come at night - because people who are working full-time still can't make ends meet,"" she said. Emma, who wants to remain anonymous, says she and her husband were both on universal credit, but their eight-year-old son does not qualify for free school meals. The mother-of-three, from Kent, says she hasn't eaten three meals a day for months because she wants to make sure she can afford food for her son and other younger, pre-school children. ""A few weeks back my eight-year-old got two bowls out for breakfast and I said: 'Don't have two bowls, that is just being greedy,' and he said: 'They're not both for me mum, one of them is for you as I haven't seen you eat in days.',"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Emma, who currently has three jobs, says she pays Â£70 every six weeks to cover the cost of school dinners for her son: ""It is expensive and with all the other price increases that we are facing now, it is just one big headache."" How will I get the Â£400 promised for energy bills? All primary school kids in Wales to get free school meals Rashford and top chefs demand school meals review Dr Nick Capstick, head teacher of Drove Primary School in Wiltshire and a signatory to the letter, says children are missing more school because of ""illness and poor oral hygiene caused by inadequate diet"". Dr Capstick, who is also chairman of an independent working group, the School Food Review, told the Today programme: ""It's increasingly common that children will come in having not eaten from the night before and also being quite confused, disorientated, and really lacking in energy to have a really productive day at school. ""Universal free schools meals is a simple way of eradicating this situation."" Other signatories to the letter include leaders of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), the National Education Union (NEU), the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) and the teachers' union, NASUWT as well as Teach First and the Confederation of School Trusts. A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise that millions of households across the UK are struggling to make their incomes stretch to cover the rising cost of living, which is why, in addition to the over Â£22bn announced previously, we are providing over Â£15bn in further support, targeted particularly at those with the greatest need. ""The holiday activities and food programme runs during major school holidays, and wider welfare support is available through the household support fund, which helps vulnerable families in need with essentials, such as food and utility bills.""

"Todd Boehly attended Chelsea's Premier League game against Watford on 22 May Chelsea's Â£4.25bn sale to a consortium led by American investor Todd Boehly and private equity firm Clearlake Capital has been completed. The club was put up for sale in March before previous owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned over his links to Russian president Vladimir Putin. Chelsea had been operating under a special government licence which would have expired on 31 May. Boehly said that he was ""honoured"" and ""wanted to make fans proud"". The consortium fought off 11 serious rivals to become the new owners, in a sale process that started on 2 March and comprised more than 250 enquiries. ""We are honoured to become the new custodians of Chelsea Football Club,"" he said. ""We're all in - 100% - every minute of every match. Our vision as owners is clear: we want to make the fans proud. ""Along with our commitment to developing the youth squad and acquiring the best talent, our plan of action is to invest in the club for the long term and build on Chelsea's remarkable history of success. ""I personally want to thank ministers and officials in the British government, and the Premier League, for all their work in making this happen."" The UK government - which said last Wednesday it could issue a licence for the sale of the club - does not want Abramovich to receive any of the proceeds from the sale, which will instead go into a frozen bank account to be donated to charities supporting victims of the war in Ukraine.

What are the pressing issues for Chelsea's new owners? Several parties expressed an interest, but Chelsea agreed to sell to the Boehly-Clearlake Capital consortium earlier in May, with Californian private equity firm owning a majority of the shares as it makes its first foray into sport. Boehly, 48, is also a part-owner of seven-time baseball World Series champions the LA Dodgers, US women's basketball team the Los Angeles Sparks and NBA franchise the Los Angeles Lakers. He has also invested in Bruce Springsteen's song rights, a sports betting firm and restaurant chains. Other investors include US billionaire Mark Walter, a co-owner of the LA Dodgers with a stake in the Lakers like Boehly, and Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss. Abramovich bought Chelsea for Â£140m in 2003. Under his ownership, the club won every major trophy - two Champions Leagues, five Premier Leagues, five FA Cups, two Europa Leagues and three EFL Cups. In August 2021 they won the Uefa Super Cup and in February their first Club World Cup. Abramovich has appointed 13 managers and the club has spent more than Â£2bn in the transfer market under his ownership. Chelsea's women's team, who became affiliated to Chelsea FC in 2004, have won five Women's Super League titles and four FA Cups under Abramovich. When an agreement for the sale was reached, he said: ""As I hand over Chelsea to its new custodians, I would like to wish them the best of success, both on and off the pitch. ""It has been an honour of a lifetime to be a part of this club - I would like to thank all the club's past and current players, staff, and of course fans for these incredible years."" 24 February:Russia invades Ukraine 26 February:Abramovichgives ""stewardship and care""of club to charitable foundation 2 March:Abramovichsays he plans to sell the club 10 March:The UK governmentsanctions Abramovich 5 May:Abramovichdenies he has requesteda Â£1.5bn loan he made to Chelsea is repaid 7 May:Boehlyagrees a Â£4.25bn dealfor the club 16 May:Government insider says thedeal is close to collapse 24 May:Premier Leagueapproves takeover 25 May:Governmentapproves takeover 28 May:Final agreement reachedwith Boehly-Clearlake Capital consortium 30 May:Sale completed Our coverage of Chelsea is bigger and better than ever before - here'severything you need to knowto make sure you never miss a moment Everything Chelsea - go straight to all the best content Australian Open: GB's Draper fighting in fifth set v Kokkinakis after Fearnley wins Transfers,  Premier League build-up and football latest New Match of the Day presenters announced A pregnant young woman is in crisis, but is it all a scam?

"Wem in Shropshire was the epicentre of the earthquake A 3.8 magnitude earthquake has been recorded in Shropshire. The British Geological Survey (BGS) said the tremor happened at a depth of 8km (5 miles), near Wem in the north of the county. Residents of nearby towns and villages including Shrewsbury, Telford, and High Ercall, contacted the BBC with reports of their homes shaking. One resident said her legs ""turned to jelly"" as she felt her bedroom floor shuddering beneath her.

"This video can not be played Watch: Fans shared videos showing pepper spray being deployed and children crying in Paris Uefa has commissioned an independent report into the scenes outside the ground that delayed Saturday's Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid. Kick-off at the Stade de France in Paris was delayed by over half an hour with Liverpool ticket-holders seen waiting in huge queues, and French police later using tear gas on crowds. On Monday,French authorities complained of what they called ""industrial-scale"" ticket fraud amid a row over the game's policing. French sports ministerAmelie Oudea-Castera,externalsaid there were ""no problems"" regarding Madrid supporters and the Spanish side had controlled their travelling fans better than Liverpool, who had let their supporters ""out in the wild"". Liverpool chairman Tom Werner has since written a letter to Oudea-Castera ""demanding an apology"" for her comments. Werner wrote: ""The events that occurred in and around the Stade de France on Saturday night at the Uefa Champions League final were not only incredibly dangerous for all who attended, but raised serious questions about the organization and operation of the event. ""This should be the focus of all interested parties today rather than pursuing a blame game strategy via press conference. ""The Uefa Champions League final should be one of the finest spectacles in world sport, instead it devolved into one of the worst security collapses in recent memory."" Liverpool chief executive Billy Hogan has said the club are ""reviewing legal avenues available to us on behalf of affected supporters"". In an interview on theLiverpool website,,externalHogan said he was ""incredibly surprised"" by Oudea-Castera's remarks, calling them ""completely inappropriate"". He added: ""We just feel that everyone should be focused on getting the investigation right and less about making inflammatory comments that attempt to deflect responsibility for what happened on Saturday night."" Uefa said a ""comprehensive review"" would examine a number of factors which include the decision-making, responsibility and behaviour of all parties involved in the final, it added. Uefa said in a statement: ""Evidence will be gathered from all relevant parties and the findings of the independent report will be made public once completed. Upon receipt of the findings, Uefa will evaluate the next steps."" The report will be independently compiled and Dr Tiago Brandao Rodrigues from Portugal will lead the production of the review.

France's interior and sports ministers acknowledged difficulties in managing crowds at the final but have been pointing blame for the chaos at fans with fake tickets and local youths trying to force their way into the stadium. However, a spokesperson for France's independent police commissioner's union (SICP), Mathieu Valet, told the BBC's Newshour that ""supporters without tickets or with fake tickets were not the main problem"". ""It's clear that we needed more police - we didn't have enough on the ground,"" he said. On Sunday,Liverpool called for an investigation into the ""unacceptable issues"" faced by fans before the match. Many claimed they had been at the stadium hours before kick-off but were stopped from getting into the ground.

"This video can not be played Watch: EU plans to ban 90% of all Russian oil imports by 2023 - Ursula von der Leyen EU leaders say they will block most Russian oil imports by the end of 2022 to punish Moscow for invading Ukraine. The EU-wide ban will affect oil that arrives by sea - around two-thirds of imports - but not pipeline oil, following opposition from Hungary. Poland and Germany have also pledged to end pipeline imports, meaning a total of 90% of Russian oil will be blocked. European Council chief Charles Michel said the deal cut off a huge source of financing for the Russian war machine. It is part of a sixth package of sanctions approved at a summit in Brussels, which all 27 member states have had to agree on. Russia currently supplies 27% of the EU's imported oil and 40% of its gas. The EU pays Russia around â¬400bn ($430bn, Â£341bn) a year in return. Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? So far, no sanctions on Russian gas exports to the EU have been put in place, although plans to open a new gas pipeline from Russia to Germany have been frozen. The UK - which gets 8% of its oil needs from Russia - has pledged to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. Oil prices climbed on news of the EU embargo, withBrent crude rising above $123 a barrel, its highest level since March. Russian seaborne oil to be banned by the end of the year, with a temporary exemption for pipeline oil. Two-thirds of Russian oil arrives by sea Pledges by Poland and Germany to stop importing pipeline oil will raise coverage of the ban to 90% of Russian imports Russia's largest bank, Sberbank, to be cut off from the Swift payment system, which allows the rapid transfer of money across borders Three more Russian state-owned broadcasters banned More restrictions on ""individuals responsible for war crimes in Ukraine"" EU members spent hours struggling to resolve their differences over the ban on Russian oil imports. Hungary, which imports 65% of its oil from Russia through pipelines, was its main opponent. Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, has good relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The compromise followed weeks of wrangling until it was agreed there would be ""a temporary exemption for oil that comes through pipelines to the EU"", Mr Michel told reporters. Because of this, the immediate sanctions will affect only Russian oil being transported into the EU over sea - two-thirds of the total imported from Russia. But in practice, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the scope of the ban would be wider, because Germany and Poland have volunteered to wind down their own pipeline imports by the end of this year. Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Can Africa replace Russian gas supplies to Europe? ""Left over is around 10-11% that is covered by the southern Druzhba,"" Ms Von der Leyen said, referring to the Russian pipeline supplying oil to Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The European Council would revisit this exemption ""as soon as possible"", she added. A senior EU official confirmed that the three landlocked countries were given an additional guarantee that they could obtain supplies of seaborne Russian oil in the event of an interruption to pipeline supply. The Russian ambassador to the EU, Vladimir Chizhov, said Brussels had ""already approached the limits of what is possible in terms of sanctions"". Speaking to Russian state TV, he predicted ""serious problems"" if the EU were to try to agree on a gas embargo. The ban on Russian oil imports was initially proposed by the European Commission - which develops laws for member states - a month ago. But resistance, notably from Hungary, held up the EU's troubled latest round of sanctions. Mr Orban declared the agreement a victory for his country, telling Hungarians they could sleep soundly - protected from expensive fuel costs that the embargo would bring to the rest of Europe. ""We succeeded in defeating the proposal of the European Council which would have forbidden Hungary from using Russian oil,"" he said in a Facebook video. Other landlocked countries, such as Slovakia and the Czech Republic, also asked for more time due to their dependence on Russian oil. Bulgaria, already cut off from Russian gas by Gazprom, had likewise sought opt-outs. The cost of living crisis being felt across Europe has not helped either. Sky-rocketing energy prices - among other things - have curtailed some EU countries' appetite for sanctions which could also hurt their own economies. The EU's oil agreement is a compromise deal - but it's also an important one. Moscow is heavily reliant on its energy exports, and the EU says this deal will cut more than 90% of Russian oil imports by the end of the year. But considering all the sabre-rattling and anti-Western rhetoric we've been hearing from Vladimir Putin in recent weeks, I suspect the Russian leader is more likely to say to Europe: ""Get ready for some more economic pain because of this embargo. Let's see how long your support for Ukraine lasts."" The Kremlin is aware of the differences of opinion within the EU over what to do about Russia - and you can be sure that Putin is going to try to exploit them. Russia will look for new markets, but in terms of oil that's not a quick fix. The infrastructure isn't in place to reorient oil exports from Europe to Asia, for example. And if it does sell to Asia - it will have to do so at a discounted price. There's also the question of Russian gas - an embargo on that could be discussed next.

Latvia's Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins said member countries should not get ""bogged down"" in their own personal interests. ""It's going to cost us more. But it's only money. The Ukrainians are paying with their lives,"" he said. Russia cut off gas supplies to Dutch firm GasTerra on Tuesday for refusing to pay for supplies in roubles. The EU has said paying in Russian currency breaches sanctions and Gazprom has already cut supplies to Poland, Finland and Bulgaria. MILITARY STATUS:What might swing the Ukraine war?

"This video can not be played Watch: Fans shared videos showing pepper spray being deployed and children crying in Paris French authorities and Uefa blamed late arrivals and fraudulent tickets for chaotic scenes outside the Stade de France before Saturday's Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid. But Liverpool fans who spoke to the BBC described organisational failures, overcrowding and heavy-handed policing. On Monday, Uefacommissioned an independent reportinto the decision-making, responsibility and behaviour of all parties involved in the final. Here is what we know so far about how events unfolded. Michael Carter was among tens of thousands of Liverpool supporters gathered in a fan zone in the south-west of Paris ahead of the Champions League final. He recalled a ""top class"" atmosphere, without any trouble. As early evening approached, he and others with tickets travelled to the Stade de France in the north of the city, ahead of the scheduled kick-off at 21:00. Fans had been warned to get there early and Merseyside police, who had officers deployed as observers, would later describe the behaviour of most as ""exemplary"", saying they arrived in plenty of time and queued as directed. One of the train lines serving the stadium, the RER B, was not working, meaning many fans had to take the RER D. This meant they ended up at a single checkpoint at the perimeter outside the stadium. Mr Carter said the trouble started to begin when fans leaving the station were ""squeezed"" into a ""narrow alley"". Thegates opened at 18:00 local time(17:00 BST) but Liverpool fan Suzanne Gower, who arrived at 18:15, told the BBC that crowds were already so big it took them 35 minutes to move 100 metres (328 feet) at this point. The route from the Stade de France-St Denis RER stop to the stadium involves crossing two motorways, cramming fans into narrow underpasses. Some fans said they were searched multiple times, further adding to the delays, while police vans blocked part of the route to funnel supporters towards a ticket stop. Liverpool fan Matt Lomas said he saw people without tickets turned away at this point, but it took two hours to move 40 yards (36m). Michael Carter told the BBC that people further back in the queue ""were lifting each other up and over the walls because they were being crushed"". By the time he got to the police barricade, there were ""no ticket checks, they were just letting people through"" - including local youths who had been trying to snatch fans' bags and other possessions, he said. Thousands of fans were crammed into underpasses, taking hours to reach the stadium Mr Carter said at one point, people at this checkpoint were doused indiscriminately in what was thought to be pepper spray, causing the crowd to stampede backwards and leaving some of them vomiting as others rushed for water from neighbouring bars to ease the pain. Real Madrid fans on social media also reported long queues before kick-off, as well as disruption by local youths and an overwhelmed police force. When they finally reached the gates, fans described more chaotic scenes. Mr Carter said people were being manhandled through the turnstile without their tickets being scanned as the crowd pressed in on them, while videos showed others trying to jump the barriers. It got to the point where staff were pulling out women and children from the crowd to prevent them being crushed, he said. ""It shouldn't have to be 'save the women and children first' at a football match,"" Mr Carter said. Gates X and Y, two of the main entrances for Liverpool fans, were closed altogether at one point, said BBC News reporter Nick Parrott, who was at the stadium as a fan. He said about 1,500 to 2,000 people were waiting outside each gate. This video can not be played BBC reporter describes his experience entering the stadium for Champions League final Some people tried to get through gates A and B, but locals without tickets tried to force their way in at the same time, he said. He saw police punch one fan, who did not react, while using the spray on others. ""The safest place was to be in the ground, that's why the fans were trying to get in so much,"" Mr Parrott said. ""The police just seemed to go after anyone who moved."" While eyewitnesses felt police tactics were heavy-handed, a spokesperson for a police union said officers on the ground were overwhelmed. But Mathieu Valet, from senior police officers' union the SICP, told the BBC's Newshour the main issue was not ticketless fans or fake tickets, but ""three or four hundred French and undocumented delinquents who were there on the concourse of the Stade de France"". ""It's clear that we needed more police - we didn't have enough on the ground,"" Mr Valet said. A police officer is photographed spraying a cannister towards a Liverpool fan outside the gates He confirmed the use of tear gas, saying it ""unfortunately does not discriminate"". ""It's clear that families, children, mainly English supporters, were inconvenienced by tear gas, I know it's not part of your culture but it allows us to repel attackers,"" he said. Liverpool fans also said many of the crowd troubles were caused by locals, describing gangs of young people who tried to steal from the travelling football fans and rush the gates. Steve Rotherham, mayor of Liverpool City Region, was one of their victims. ""Like too many others, I had my phone and other belongings stolen by dippers [pickpockets] on the approach to the stadium,"" he said on Monday. Some eyewitnesses described gangs of young people hanging around outside the station after the match, saying they were mugging people and assaulting them without being challenged by police. Others said local trouble-makers made it inside the stadium. Mr Carter said that inside the Stade de France, several French youths attempted to steal Liverpool fans' seats. Inside the stadium, Suzanne Gower had arrived with nearly two hours to go before kick-off. ""The Liverpool side had no fans and the Madrid end was really full so you know something outside was happening,"" she said. Five minutes before kick-off was due,at 20:55 local time, Uefa announced that the start of the match was delayed""for security reasons"" until 21:15. Inside the stadium, signs said the delay was ""due to the late arrival of fans at the stadium"". Notices inside the stadium blamed the late arrival of fans for the delayed kick-off Thenat 21:14 Uefa announced a further delayto kick-off. Eventually,the match got underway at 21:36. Even then, there were many empty seats in the Liverpool end, with some fans reporting they were not able to get into the stadium until half-time. Liverpool fans say police lined up in front of them before the final whistle - but ignored the Real Madrid supporters' section. Chaos erupted again when the exit gates were opened, with Mr Carter saying local youths rushed the gates, while police fired what appeared to be tear gas into the crowd. Riot police lined up in front of Liverpool fans before the final whistle French interior minister Gerard Darmanin said the disruption was due to ""thousands of British 'supporters', without tickets or with counterfeit tickets"" who ""forced entry and sometimes assaulted the stewards"". But Ms Gower, a lawyer who worked on the inquests intothe Hillsborough disaster, said: ""The way this event was being policed was all wrong and incredibly dangerous."" And fan Adrian Tempanyreflected later,external: ""My experience at Stade de France on Saturday was the 2nd worst I've had at a football match, after Hillsborough."" ""In my opinion, French police and Uefa nearly caused a disaster,"" he added. The French government has suggested there were between 30,000 and 40,000 ticketless Liverpool fans who attempted to gain entry to the stadium. Mr Darmanin described it as ""massive, industrial-level ticket fraud"". There were several reports of legitimate tickets failing to scan or being rejected at the turnstiles, however. Peter Hooton, singer of Liverpool band The Farm, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that he was attending as a guest of broadcaster BT Sport in a neutral part of the ground, where French, Spanish and British attendees all saw their mobile tickets repeatedly rejected. Uefa declined to give details of the anti-fraud measures used on the tickets at the Champions League final, saying: ""Tickets contain a number of security features and the design is different for every single competition."" But Prof Clifford Stott from Keele University, an expert in crowds and policing, cast doubt on the French authorities' claim. He said on Monday there was no apparent evidence for what would have been ""the largest-ever criminal conspiracy to produce and supply forged tickets at football"".

"The head of the European Commission rushed to Hungary earlier this month in a bid to unblock the oil proposal EU leaders meet on Monday for an extraordinary summit, but as one diplomat put it: ""What are we going to talk about?"" There are serious issues on the agenda, centred around the war in Ukraine. But it's doubtful the major, unresolved matter will specifically be up for discussion. That is the EU's beleaguered attempts to ban imports of Russian oil. It's now nearly a month since European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced her proposals. ""This will be a complete import ban on all Russian oil, seaborne and pipeline, crude and refined,"" she told the European Parliament. This video can not be played Watch: EU ban on Russian oil will not be easy, says von der Leyen It was to be an ""orderly"" transition, phasing out Russian crude within six months and refined products by the end of 2022. But resistance, notably from Hungary, has held up the EU's troubled sixth package of sanctions. Other landlocked countries, such as Slovakia and the Czech Republic, have also asked for more time due to their dependence on Russian oil. Bulgaria, already cut off from Russian gas by Gazprom, has likewise sought opt-outs. But Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Hungarian government, which has compared an oil ban to dropping a nuclear bomb on its economy, is seen as the ultimate obstacle. He wrote to the European Council to say he didn't even want to discuss it next week. Diplomats are getting frustrated but they also concede that, with soaring energy prices, some countries may not be entirely unhappy that a decision is being blocked. More hard-line nations are clear that Europe must stop handing Russia billions in what they see as ""blood money"". However, there's also a feeling that Ursula von der Leyen has mishandled things, announcing plans before doing the necessary groundwork. Nevertheless, both she and the head of the European Council this week suggested a deal on oil might happen within days. That was ""absolutely bonkers"", remarked one EU diplomat: ""Charles Michel is setting his own European Council up for failure."" Little time is left with leaders gathering in Brussels on Monday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has voiced his anger at the delays: ""Of course, I am grateful to our friends who are promoting new sanctions,"" he said in Thursday's late night address. ""But where did those who block the sixth package get so much power? Why are they still allowed to have so much power, including in intra-European procedures?"" While sanctions are signed off at ambassador level, rather than at big EU summits, there had been hopes that the European Council might focus minds and force the issue. The extraordinary council was originally called, in part, because the pre-scheduled June summit felt a long way away, in the midst of a war on European soil. But items actually on the agenda, say diplomats, are principally things that are already bubbling along without the need for a major meeting. Officially up for discussion are financial support for Ukraine, food security, defence procurement and broader issues on the EU's energy transition. Draft conclusions, seen by the BBC, do refer to the phase-out of Russian fossil fuels while glossing over the specific issue of oil sanctions. ""Avoiding a debate is not very realistic,"" suggested one senior diplomat. The odds are that someone will bring it up: elephants in the room have ways of making themselves heard. The question is whether a debate turns into a bust-up. There is frustration that this delay is preventing other measures from going forward, given that the sixth sanctions package isn't just about oil. It also proposes expanding export controls and the list of individuals subject to asset freezes, as well as targeting Russia's majority state-owned Sberbank. Member states quickly signed off the other sanctions packages, including a phased embargo on Russian coal. Officials had talked proudly about how the EU had defied the old narratives about sluggish, tortured EU decision-making. And they had, until now. But in his letter this week the Hungarian leader warned Charles Michel that discussing the oil embargo would ""only highlight our internal divisions"". Phasing out Russian oil, he argued, would require ""a complete rearrangement of our refinery capacities"". Hungary argues it will need billions of euros to wean itself off Russian oil In other words, it's going to cost a lot of money, which has made some suspicious that Mr Orban is ultimately angling for more cash. European Parliament President Roberta Metsola is optimistic that Hungary is essentially adopting a ""negotiating stance"". However, funds recently earmarked to help with the EU's energy transition come from a pot of money that Hungary does not yet have access to. It's all part of a financial tug-of-war between Brussels and Budapest, over accusations that the Orban government is presiding over an erosion of democratic standards. His supporters argue Hungary is maligned for forging its own path and quite justified in resisting a ruinous oil ban without sufficient guarantees. Various ideas have been floated, such as putting price caps or tariffs on Russian oil to squeeze the Kremlin's revenues. Another recent proposal was cutting seaborne supplies first and leaving pipelines until later. But while it is widely accepted that some countries will need more time and support, each compromise brings its complications. EU ambassadors gather for a preparatory meeting on the eve of the summit. Most think this troubled sanctions package will get over the line at some point but this has been an embarrassing episode for the European Commission. How far it will have to water it down will dictate any further level of embarrassment.

"The European Commission has given more details on how it plans to end Europe's dependence on Russian fossil fuels. Russia supplies 40% of the EU's natural gas and 27% of its imported oil. The EU sends the country roughly â¬400 billion a year in return. Now the EU plans to speed up its shift to green energy but says it must also invest in pipelines in other countries. It has been accused of helping fund the war in Ukraine through its use of Russian energy. TheREPowerEU strategy was first announced in Marchwith the stated aim of reducing Russian gas imports by two thirds in 2022. Rising energy costs have also put financial pressure on consumers and businesses in Europe now facing higher bills. The updated proposals outline not just how the EU plans to negotiate both the immediate gas crisis, but also deliver on promises to completely wean itself off Russian energy by 2030. The strategy focuses on three key topic areas. Improving energy efficiency, expanding the use of renewable energy and securing non-Russian suppliers of oil and gas. ""We are taking our ambition to yet another level,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said as she presented the update at a briefing in Brussels, Belgium. How reliant is the world on Russia for oil and gas? Can Africa replace Russian gas supplies to Europe? Why are prices rising so quickly? The REPowerEU plan is estimated to cost â¬210 billion (Â£178 billion) over the next five years. The Commission report highlights energy saving as the ""cheapest, safest and cleanest"" way to reduce dependence on Russian fuel. It wants to improve how buildings of insulated, as well as encourage consumers to be more aware of energy use. It also plans to speed up the transition from fossil fuel burning boilers to electric heat pumps (a device that absorbs heat from the air, ground or water around a building) Plans to reduce energy consumption in the EU have also made more ambitious, from the original plan of a 9% cut to 13% cut by 2030. The bloc has earmarked â¬113 billion for a ""massive scale up in renewables"" and new hydrogen infrastructure. New EU legislation is being proposed to make it easier to build solar and wind farms. ""Whenever we talk about rapid deployment of renewables, there is an elephant in the room-  getting a permit,"" said Frans Timmermans, vice president of the European Commission. ""It might take as long as nine years for wind and up to four years for solar projects, so this is time that we do not have and we have to speed things up,"" he added. The Commission has proposed specially designated ""go-to"" areas where permission can be given in just one year. Certain new buildings could also be required to have solar panels installed on the roof. The EU target for renewable energy has also been more raised. The goal is for green energy to provide 45% of energy needs by 2030, up from 40%. Even if they are fast-tracked in special zones, new wind and solar plants will still take time. To quickly diversify from Russian fossil fuels, the EU is investing up to â¬12 billion in pipelines and Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) terminals to improve access to gas and oil from other countries including Egypt, Israel and Nigeria. Some environmental groups have criticised the news. Instead they want to see a decisive break with fossil fuels. ""The European Commission's latest strategy gives with one hand and takes with the other,"" said Eilidh Robb, an anti-fossil fuels campaigner at Friends of the Earth. ""So-called REPowerEU contains useful and necessary strides towards renewable solutions but it simultaneously enables almost 50 fossil fuel infrastructure projects and expansions,"" she added.

"This video can not be played Watch: EU ban on Russian oil will not be easy, says von der Leyen The EU has proposed some of its toughest measures yet against Russia, including a total ban on oil imports and sanctions on war crimes suspects. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the package was aimed at maximising pressure on Russia while minimising damage to Europe. Russian crude oil would be phased out within six months, she said. Hungary has rejected the proposal as unacceptable and the Czech and Slovak governments want a transition period. The EU has been focusing for weeks on how to wean itself off Russian oil and gas. It has already pledged to reduce gas imports by two-thirds by the end of 2022 and now plans to phase out crude oil over six months and refined products by the end of 2022. ""We will make sure that we phase out Russian oil in an orderly fashion,"" the Commission president said. The package first has to be approved by EU ambassadors and is set to be signed off in the next few days. But Hungarian government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said his country would veto it in its current form: ""They exactly know that what they are proposing is against Hungarian interests... and if we do that we are completely going to ruin the Hungarian economy."" Slovakia as well as Hungary currently relies on Russian oil and under the initial proposal would be given until the end of 2023 to find alternative suppliers. Slovakia's economy minister said his country wanted a three-year transition period, while Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said he would also seek a two-to-three year exemption to tackle problems with pipeline capacity. Last year, Russia supplied the EU with a quarter of its oil imports, and the Netherlands and Germany were the biggest buyers. The Dutch government has said it wants to halt all Russian fossil fuel imports by the end of this year and Germany has drastically reduced its reliance on Russian oil imports, down from 35% to 12%. The UK, which is no longer in the EU, is already phasing out Russian oil, which accounts for 8% of its imports. German Economics Minister Robert Habeck has said the six-month transition period gives Berlin long enough to make the change. The problem for Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic is that they are all landlocked and rely on their neighbours for fuel supplies. Czech special envoy for energy security Vaclav Bartuska told the BBC that Europe was currently trying to redraw the map of energy supplies as fast as it could: ""We want to get rid of Russian crude once and for all and we want to be absolutely sure there'll be no need to go back and ask Russia again."" How Germany is getting rid of Russian oil Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was working on various options in response to the planned embargo. Sanctions were a double-edged sword for the Europeans and others, he said, as the cost for European citizens would increase every day. Oil prices rose by 5% on news of the EU plan to $110 a barrel of Brent Crude. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a video briefing on social media thatthe gradual EU ban on oil was ""better than nothing"",external. Any country that opposed the oil embargo was complicit in Russia's crimes in Ukraine, he said, whatever their arguments. As well as seeking a ban on Russian oil, the EU Commission president announced that sanctions would be imposed on military officers involved in suspected war crimes in Bucha and Mariupol. ""This sends another important signal to all perpetrators of the Kremlin's war: We know who you are, and you will be held accountable,"" Ms von der Leyen told the European Parliament on Wednesday. There are plans for a broad ban on three of the biggest Russian state-run broadcasters. ""We have identified these TV channels as mouthpieces that amplify Putin's lies and propaganda aggressively,"" Ms von der Leyen said. Although the three networks were not named, they are thought to include the widely watched Russian-language Rossiya and RTR Planeta channels of state-owned operator VGTRK. The EU has already suspended two networks, RT and Sputnik, that broadcast in English, German and Spanish. A ban would also be imposed on providing European services to Russian companies through accountants, lawyers and spin-doctors, she said. Earlier sanctions have already hit Russian banks but the biggest bank of all, Sberbank, has been left off the list because it was considered necessary for paying for Russian gas. Sberbank makes up over a third of Russia's banking sector and is now set to be removed from the SWIFT global financial messaging system. Two other Russian banks are included in the proposals. Previous sanctions packages have also targeted a number of individuals linked to the Kremlin and the invasion, and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, is said to be on the latest list. He has given his full support to the war, prompting Pope Francis to warn him not to become ""Putin's altar boy"".

Explaining Europe's ""very special responsibility towards Ukraine"", she said Ukraine needed to fund the dramatic fall in its economic output and wider reconstruction. A recovery package would be drawn up that could tackle weaknesses in the Ukrainian economy and help fight corruption, she said. ""We want Ukraine to win this war, but we also want to set the conditions for Ukraine's success in the aftermath of the war."" In a separate move, the EU also promised to increase military aid to neighbouring Moldova, which is under threat from Russian soldiers based in the breakaway Moldova region of Transnistria.

"This video can not be played Watch: Fans shared videos showing pepper spray being deployed and children crying in Paris France has hit out at what it says was ""industrial-scale"" ticket fraud at Saturday's Champions League final amid a row over the game's policing. Ministers acknowledged difficulties in managing crowds at the final in Paris, but say organised fraud was the root cause of the problems. Liverpool ticket-holders were seen waiting in huge queues, with French police later using tear gas on crowds. The treatment of fans was ""an absolute disgrace,"" one Liverpool fan said. Tom Whitehurst said he had to get his disabled son ""out of the way"" after they were pepper-sprayed. ""[Fans] were indiscriminately pepper-sprayed and there were people with tickets, who arrived two-and-a-half hours early, who were queuing up and they were charged at by riot police with shields."" Another supporter, Michael Carter, told the BBC people further back in the queue ""were lifting each other up and over the walls because they were being crushed"". The BBC's sports journalist Nick Parrott, who was in Paris, said ""it was the most petrifying experience I've ever had at a football match"". He tweeted that locals were ""trying to force their way in leading to security closing the gates and keeping out legitimate fans with tickets"". Amid a chorus of criticism from the UK, the French sports ministry has been meeting Europe's football governing body Uefa, the French Football Association and stadium officials and police to ""draw lessons"" from the event. Uefa has now commissioned an independent report into the events surrounding the match. The French sports ministry also commissioned its own summary report, due within 10 days. France's interior and sports ministers have been pointing blame for the chaos at fans with fake tickets and local youths trying to force their way into the stadium. How the Champion's League Final trouble unfolded UK urges investigation into Paris football chaos France blames ticket fraud as police row rages Interior minister GÃ©rald Darmanin said ""massive, industrial-scale"" ticket fraud had caused Liverpool fans to turn up en masse, and said that of about 30 arrests made at the Stade de France ""more than half concerned British citizens"". He stated that there had been 30,000 to 40,000 Liverpool fans with fake tickets or without tickets outside the stadium. Mr Darmanin also defended the police's actions, stating that ""the decisions taken prevented deaths or serious injury"". ""We regret a disorganisation in the admission of British supporters,"" he said. Speaking earlier on French radio, sports minister AmÃ©lie OudÃ©a-CastÃ©ra said there were ""no problems"" regarding Real supporters and the Spanish side had controlled their travelling fans better than Liverpool. But a spokesperson for France's independent police commissioner's union (SICP), Mathieu Valet, told the BBC's Newshour that ""supporters without tickets or with fake tickets... were not the main problem."" ""It's clear that we needed more police - we didn't have enough on the ground,"" he added. So the French government recognises that the policing was at times heavy-handed, and that the difficulties getting fans from the train station should have been predicted after a strike. But it insists that there would have been none of the chaos without the presence of ""30-40,000"" ticketless Liverpool supporters. All of this will have to be verified. If it is true that seven out of ten tickets checked at the first perimeter turned out to be fraudulent, then that does indeed suggest a scam of monumental proportions - enough to render useless even the best-laid policing plans. But plenty of people - French as well as British - who were there on Saturday night question the government's version. They wonder if blaming Liverpool isn't a convenient way of shucking off responsibility closer to home. And if there were 30-40,000 ticketless people milling around the stadium as the match got under way, how come that is not what journalists remember seeing? That number of disappointed and aimless fans don't just disappear. Liverpool fans are angry with the French, and with UEFA for blaming them for the disastrous evening. The chaos will probably turn out to have multiple causes. But from the French point of view,  pointing the finger at convenient foreign scapegoats would be particularly short-sighted. A spokesman for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson described footage from the Stade de France at the weekend as ""deeply upsetting and concerning"" and called for a full investigation. Uefa initially blamed the ""late arrival"" of fans for the problems. But Merseyside police, who are responsible for policing in Liverpool and were present in Paris, said the vast majority of Liverpool fans arrived early at the turnstiles and behaved in an ""exemplary manner"". Saturday's TV footage showed young men who did not appear to be wearing red Liverpool shirts jumping the stadium gates and then running away from security. Liverpool fans spoke of long queues building up hours before the match started, and the final was delayed by 35 minutes by the trouble outside the stadium. The chaos continued after the match ended. One Real Madrid supporter, Antonio CastaÃ±o, told the BBC there were ""organised groups robbing people, harassing them, breaking car windows, it was absolute chaos. ""I've been to games in Liverpool, Munich, Milan, London, Cardiff, to Russia. I've never seen anything like this,"" he said. ""There weren't enough police, there weren't enough resources and there wasn't enough respect for the fans. We were left high and dry, both the Spanish fans and the English ones.""

"Fashion brand Missguided has appointed administrators after suppliers filed to shut it down over unpaid debts. The retailer with about 330 staff has asked Teneo Financial Advisory to sell its business and assets. Missguided has been hit by supply chain costs, rising inflation and ""softening"" consumer confidence in an increasingly tough market, Teneo said. One marketing expert said rival brands were better, cheaper and faster and shoppers now care about sustainability. Catherine Shuttleworth, chief executive of Get Savvy marketing agency added: ""The fast fashion shopper is growing up, spending elsewhere and in new categories."" Teneo said Missguided would continue to trade while it looked for a buyer. Gavin Maher from Teneo said there was ""a high level of interest from a number of strategic buyers"". Rival fast fashion brand Boohoo is rumoured to be among potential suitors. Mr Maher thanked Missguided staff and other key stakeholders for their ""support at this difficult time"". Missguided issued with a winding-up petition by creditors The Manchester-based business was founded by Nitin Passi in 2009. It grew to become one of the UK's biggest online fashion players. But in the last few years, it has struggled to make a profit and was rescued last autumn by the finance firm Alteri Investors. Mr Passi stepped down as CEO in April and this administration comes after supplier JSK Fashions issued a winding up petition on 10 May. Last week,a report in the i newspaper,externalsaid that three of Missguided's suppliers warned they were at risk of going under due to outstanding payments. ""It's a saying that cash is king in business and if reports are to be believed then that's a factor in Missguided's troubles,"" said Julie Palmer, partner at insolvency firm Begbies Traynor. ""If true, tales of suppliers being asked to give discounts, or struggling to extract payment, point to a company facing a cash flow crisis,"" she said. The cost-of-living crisis means shoppers are reining in spending on non-essentials like the fast fashion Missguided offers, she said. ""While Missguided boomed when we were locked down with no opportunity to spend wages going out, the harsh realities of post-pandemic life are becoming clear,"" she said. ""Rising inflation and worries about the potential for a recession mean that people just aren't willing to spend on what they don't need. ""Hopefully a buyer will see the potential in this company that means its suppliers continue to find an outlet for their products."" Missguided has previously provided outfits for Love Island but this year the show has partnered with eBay to source second-hand clothes Catherine Shuttleworth, chief executive of Get Savvy marketing agency, said the fast-fashion industry as a whole was under huge cost pressures. But it was also having to work harder to engage with shoppers who were increasingly focused on sustainability. ""The cost-of-living squeeze is starting to make a difference to younger shoppers meaning they are going out less, and spending less on clothing they just aren't engaging with fast fashion brands in the way they used to be."" She added: ""The bottom line is that Missguided were up against other players who are simply better, cheaper and faster in this space - notably Boohoo."" Online-only retailer Boohoo bought up swathes of High Street stores that collapsed during the pandemic. Among the many brands it owns are PrettyLittleThing, NastyGal and MissPap, which contribute to the increasing competition faced by Missguided. But fashion business educator Maria Malone told BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up To Money there was also a shift away from throwaway fashion. ""It had a phenomenal rise, sponsoring cultural icons like Love Island,"" she said. ""This year the show is featuring pre-owned clothing. Turning its back on fast fashion, that's the problem really, the customer has changed. ""Its rivals have diversified, Missguided stuck with fast fashion, there's now a movement away from that. At every level of society people are questioning fashion, there's a massive market now in slow fashion, sustainability, up cycling and repairing.""

"People in Severodonetsk are warned not to leave bomb shelters and to prepare masks to protect against toxic fumes after a nitric acid tank is hit, the regional governor says Serhiy Haidai says much of the eastern Ukrainian city is now controlled by Russians Nearly all critical infrastructure and 90% of its housing is destroyed, he says There's been a shutdown of all communications in southern Kherson, officials say But in his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says forces have had some success there, and are advancing around Kharkiv EU leaders reach agreement to ban 90% of oil imports from Russia but are split over gas imports They met for a two-day summit in Brussels to discuss sanctions against Russia Moscow now occupies almost all of the Luhansk region, as it focuses on seizing the whole of Donbas in the east Edited by Claire Heald Thank you for joining our live coverage today. We'll leave you with the latest developments in the war in Ukraine:  Todayâs live page was edited by Chris Giles, Emma Owens,
Claire Heald and Tiffany Wertheimer. The writers were Alexandra FouchÃ©, Gareth
Evans, Jack Burgess, James Harness, Sam Hancock and Victoria Lindrea. Join us tomorrow. General David Petraeus Over 20,000 Russian troops may have been killed during the Ukraine conflict, says retired US General David Petraeus. This is ""many multiples of what they lost in nine years in
Afghanistan"", he says. Russia's last estimate of its troop losses was 1,351, given on 25 March. This war is approaching 100 days duration. Speaking to the BBC, he says he's not surprised by Ukraine's ability to repel Russian forces. Ukraine ""performed above even the highest of expectations most of us had"". On Russia's effectiveness in the war, Petraeus is very critical: ""No one predicted Russia's sheer incompetence, at every single level,"" he says. However, on Severodonetsk he is less upbeat about Ukraine's situation: ""At some point, the Ukrainians may have to withdraw to fight another day."" And Russia seizing the city would be significant in the psychological ""war of ideas"", says Petraeus. He is sceptical about Russia's offer to escort cargo ships of wheat out of Ukrainian ports. ""They said they would do that if we lift the sanctions
and there's no way that we're going to lift the sanctions,"" he says. And any idea of Western forces sending in ships to force a way through the Black Sea is ""dead on arrival"", he says, because "" you're going to sail into a direct conflict with Russia"". James WaterhouseReporting from Poltava Hlib Stryzhko suffered a broken pelvis and jaw when he came under attack from a Russian tank Hlib Stryzhko endured psychological torture and was denied medical treatment for a broken pelvis and jaw. Yet somehow, he made it home. In a hospital bed in the Ukrainian city of Poltava, he tried to sit up. The 25-year-old soldier's pelvis was supported by metal scaffolding - one of his many injuries sustained while trying to defend Mariupol, nearly 500km (310 miles) to the south. As his mother Olesya helped him he grimaced with pain, but seemed eager to share his story nevertheless. ""Turning my head, I saw that a tank was aimed at me,"" he recalled. ""When a tank fires, there is no time between exit and arrival. It happens instantaneously. I saw a bright flash."" Read the full story here. Ukrainian President Zelensky visiting frontline positions in Kharkiv on Sunday Ukraine's forces have had some success near the southern city of Kherson and are advancing in parts of the Kharkiv region to the east of Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says, Reuters reports. Zelensky praised his military's ""utmost courage"" and says they ""remain masters of the situation at the front"". The Ukrainian president did however say Russian forces have a ""significant advantage"" in terms or equipment and numbers. Ukrainian officials are reporting a ""shutdown of all communications"" in the Russian-occupied southern region of Kherson, Reuters reports. An unspecified intrusion ""by the occupation regime"" has taken place, with equipment powered down and cables disconnected, Ukraine's State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection has said, according to Reuters. This has left residents ""without Ukrainian mobile communication and Internet access"" and ""no means to make national and international phone calls using landline phone devices,"" the agency has reportedly said. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this. Smoke over Severodonetsk on Monday The 97th day of the war saw Ukrainian and Russian forces battling for control of the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which is said to be divided between the two sides. Up to 15,000 people may still be trapped there, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai has said. Both sides are suffering heavy casualties and the Ukrainian command may decide a tactical retreat would better serve their medium-term interests. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,""Ukrainian former Defence Minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk has told the BBC. Russia now occupies almost all of Luhansk, as it focuses on seizing it and neighbouring Donetsk.At least 3,052 of its soldiers have been killedsince the invasion began on 24 February, according to a list of names compiled by BBC News Russian. Read more on this story here. Anna HolliganBBC News, The Hague Today was described as âa
momentous dayâ by the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor, Karim
Khan. He was referring to
three new countries - Estonia,
Latvia and Slovakia -joining the joint investigation team (JIT), and what that represents for the
pursuit of justice. Khan was speaking at the
Eurojust â the EU agency for criminal justice â a lesser-known international
organisation at The Hague. Eurojust will ensure all
the evidence - from witness statements to forensic data - will be translated
into a language that will make it accessible for all prosecution teams. Khan told a news conference: We must join hands in the common interest of humanity.   And when Iryna Venediktova, Ukraineâs chief prosecutor, told journalists ""we are fighting for European values"", Khan interjected. ""These aren't European values we're protecting,â he said. âIt's important to emphasize the ICC is fighting for basic human standards in the 21st century."" The Azovstal steel plant was bombarded for months by Russian forces For months Ukrainian fighters in Mariupol's Azovstal steelworksprevented Russian forcesfrom taking full control of the besieged southern port city. BBC Monitoring reports Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, has rejected a Russian statement claiming about 150 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found rigged with explosives at the steel plant. Andryushchenko has said the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, earlier reported some Ukrainian fighters were found alive at Azovstal. The Russian Defence Ministry said 152 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found in an inoperative refrigerated van and four mines were planted under the bodies. According to the ministry's spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, Ukrainian POWs from the Azov regiment said the van was set up on orders from Kyiv. The Russian side plans to hand over the bodies to Ukraine in the near future, Konashenkov has been quoted as saying by the separatist website Donetsk News Agency. This video can not be played Russia's Defence Ministry released video of a cargo ship leaving Mariupol's port Russian naval vessels have escorted the first cargo ship to leave the Port of Mariupol since Russia took control of the area. In footage released by the Russian Defence Ministry, artillery boats can be seen flanking the ship as it left the port, reportedly carrying metal in its hold. It's the first ship to enter and then leave the port, on the Sea of Azov, since the fighting in Mariupol ended. Earlier, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the Russian Navy is ready to provide safe passage to ships transporting grain currently stuck in Ukraine's ports - if Ukraine clears coastal waters of mines. Lavrov said: ""If this de-mining problem is solved... the Russian Federation will ensure the unhindered passage of these ships to the Mediterranean Sea and further to their destinations."" The explosion of a nitric acid container in Severodonetsk is thought to have been caused by an airstrike, Luhansk's regional governor Serhiy Haidai says. âThere
was allegedly an airstrike on the chemical plant in Severodonetsk which hit
the tank with the remains of nitric acid"", he says. He tells the BBC toxic fumes were released into the air. Based on a previous chemical leak, he predicts there might be a threat to people within a 400-metre range of the explosion. Outside of that range, people might experience some eye irritation, he says. At the moment there is no possibility of evacuating any of the 15,000 residents who remain in Severodonetsk - as it comes under sustained attack from Russians, he says. ""Russians provide no humanitarian corridors,"" he says. ""Seventy to eighty percent of the city is controlled by the Russian army. The neighbouring city of Lysychansk is
under the full control of Ukraineâ, he adds. Smoke rises in Severodonetsk during heavy fighting between Ukrainian and Russian troops The head of the Severodonetsk state district, in the Luhansk region, says the city is ""the hottest spot in Ukraine right now"". Speaking to the BBC, Roman Vlasenk says Russia has ""thrown everything at it"". Delays to military aid from Europe and the US, such as anti-tank weapons, is a particular problem, he adds, with civilian evacuation and humanitarian aid delivery impossible. In terms of personnel on the ground, Vlasenko says they have parity with Russia. However, he says Russia ""has more aviation and artillery"" which is preventing them from being able to defend against Russian forces or launch counter-offensives. More now on reports of a chemical explosion in Severodonetsk. A container with
chemicals has been blown up at the Azot chemical works in the city, the Russian news agency TASS says. It quotes the âambassadorâ of the self-proclaimed Luhansk Peopleâs Republic Rodion Miroshnik, writing on his Telegram channel, that a container ""has been blown up"", and the plant ""is still controlled by the Ukrainian regimeâs armed units"". The plant is one of Ukraineâs biggest chemical works, and pre-war, it has been employing around 7,000 people, according to TASS. It's thought to manufacture acetic acid, methanol and vinyl

Pictures posted to Serhiy Haidai's Telegram appear to show a large pink cloud over the city Local residents in the frontline city of Severodonetsk, in Luhansk, have been warned not to leave bomb shelters and urged to prepare masks to protect themselves against toxic fumes. A nitric acid tank has been hit by a Russian airstrike, Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai has said on messaging app Telegram. He also posted photos of a large pink cloud over residential buildings in the city. The key eastern city of Severodonetsk has seen intense fighting in recent days as Russian forces attempt to capture the city. Itâs
just gone 8pm in Severodonetsk, the eastern Ukrainian city in the Donbas region
that is coming under extreme bombardment by Russian forces. In
Tuesday's evening report, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forceswrote on Facebook,externalthat âthe battle continuesâ. âThe enemy is trying to establish complete
control overâ¦ Severodonetsk and surround [Ukrainian forces]â, the post reads.â The region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai, also gave an update. ""Most of Severodonetsk is controlled by the
Russians. The city is not surrounded,"" hewrote on Telegram,external. ""The city's critical infrastructure has been
destroyed by almost 100%, 90% of the housing stock has been damaged, 60% of
which is critical, ie. it cannot be restored,"" he said. Earlier, he told the BBC that the
evacuation of civilians has been halted because of the heavy shelling and
up to 15,000 people may still be trapped in the city. Getting humanitarian aid in is also ""impossible"" he said. Read more on the relentless attack on Severodonetsk here. Ukrainian soldier with anti-tank weapon A former defence minister to Ukraine has said his country can win the war with more weapons from the West. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,"" Andriy Zagorodnyuk told the BBC. He said Russian forces were ""at maximum capacity"" and were throwing everything at the fight in the Donbas. ""They're bringing all their equipment and so on - and so currently they are at maximum of their capacity, maximum of their capability."" ""Ukraine is definitely not changing our strategy. We are absolutely determined to win. We know that we can. We know that our army is much more efficient and effective than Russia's. ""The only thing we need is to re-equip ourselves with additional weapons and we can do this."" Damien McGuinnessReporting from Berlin German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has announced his country will allow modern German-made tanks to backfill Soviet-era tanks sent from Greece to Ukraine. Berlin already has similar deals with a number of countries that have Soviet-era tanks, which can be used by Ukrainian soldiers straight away without training. So far, Germany has struck such deals with Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland. Germany is also training Ukrainian soldiers in Germany on modern heavy weapons, which will then be delivered to Ukraine. German ministers say Berlin is delivering a lot of weapons to Ukraine and dispute the impression abroad that Germany is not doing enough. But some ministers and leading politicians within the government accept deliveries are slower and more complicated than originally hoped. There is growing pressure in Germany for deliveries to be sped up, to be more transparent and better organised. Ukraine's prosecutor-general Iryna Venediktova (L) held a news conference earlier alongside Khan (R) Earlier we told you that Ukraine's chief prosecutor had said her officials had identified more than 600 Russian war crime suspects and had started prosecuting around 80 of them. Iryna Vanediktova had been meeting the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan, and the pair gave a news briefing afterwards. Karim described Ukraine as a crime scene, and said the tribunal was carrying out its largest ever investigation there, with plans to open an office in Kyiv in the next few weeks. As things currently stand, the ICC canât prosecute the crime of aggression because neither Russia nor Ukraine are in its list of members. However, the court is taking part in a joint investigation alongside Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania. Russia withdrew from - and stopped recognising - the ICC in 2016 after the court published a report classifyingthe annexation of Crimea, in Ukraine, as an occupation. Nearly seven million people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February, latest figures show. More than half of them - 3.6 million - have fled to neighbouring Poland, while nearly one million have relocated to Romania and Russia respectively. Some of those who fled Ukraine, have returned home or to different parts of their country. By Olga Ivshina and Olga Prosvirova, BBC News Russian UK intelligence estimates 15,000 Russian soldiers have died in the conflict so far BBC News Russian has compiled a list naming 3,052 Russian soldiers who have been killed in the current war in Ukraine. The list is part of an ongoing investigation into the number and nature of Russian losses and is based on open sources, as well conversations with the families of those killed. BBC journalists discovered fresh graves at 11 cemeteries located in different parts of Russia. Not all of them were marked as soldiers who died fighting in Ukraine, but the photographs of men in uniform, as well as wreaths bearing ribbons inscribed with 'From the Ministry of Defence' are tell-tale signs. There is a continuing trend of a high proportion of officers among those killed - around 20%. The findings match claims made by UK intelligence services, who stated this week that Russia was bearing âcrushing lossesâ among junior and senior officers. Russia's most recent casualty figures, released by Moscow on 25 March, claim 1,351 soldiers have been killed so far in the conflict. Meanwhile UK intelligence estimates that, by the end of May, Russia had lost around 15,000 soldiers, while Ukraine puts the figure at around 30,000 killed. As we've been reporting, the European Union has agreed to block all imports of Russian oil arriving by sea by the end of the year. However, the EU will continue temporarily to allow imports by pipeline because Hungary imports 65% of oil via Russian pipelines and says its economy could not take the hit if that stopped. Two other countries which import large amounts of Russian oil by pipeline, Germany and Poland, say they will stop doing so by the end of this year. The EU says, overall, the new measures will cut oil imports from Russia by up to 90%. Russia accounted for just8% of UK oil imports in 2020,external.

"This video can not be played Watch: EU plans to ban 90% of all Russian oil imports by 2023 - Ursula von der Leyen EU leaders say they will block most Russian oil imports by the end of 2022 to punish Moscow for invading Ukraine. The EU-wide ban will affect oil that arrives by sea - around two-thirds of imports - but not pipeline oil, following opposition from Hungary. Poland and Germany have also pledged to end pipeline imports, meaning a total of 90% of Russian oil will be blocked. European Council chief Charles Michel said the deal cut off a huge source of financing for the Russian war machine. It is part of a sixth package of sanctions approved at a summit in Brussels, which all 27 member states have had to agree on. Russia currently supplies 27% of the EU's imported oil and 40% of its gas. The EU pays Russia around â¬400bn ($430bn, Â£341bn) a year in return. Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? So far, no sanctions on Russian gas exports to the EU have been put in place, although plans to open a new gas pipeline from Russia to Germany have been frozen. The UK - which gets 8% of its oil needs from Russia - has pledged to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. Oil prices climbed on news of the EU embargo, withBrent crude rising above $123 a barrel, its highest level since March. Russian seaborne oil to be banned by the end of the year, with a temporary exemption for pipeline oil. Two-thirds of Russian oil arrives by sea Pledges by Poland and Germany to stop importing pipeline oil will raise coverage of the ban to 90% of Russian imports Russia's largest bank, Sberbank, to be cut off from the Swift payment system, which allows the rapid transfer of money across borders Three more Russian state-owned broadcasters banned More restrictions on ""individuals responsible for war crimes in Ukraine"" EU members spent hours struggling to resolve their differences over the ban on Russian oil imports. Hungary, which imports 65% of its oil from Russia through pipelines, was its main opponent. Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, has good relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The compromise followed weeks of wrangling until it was agreed there would be ""a temporary exemption for oil that comes through pipelines to the EU"", Mr Michel told reporters. Because of this, the immediate sanctions will affect only Russian oil being transported into the EU over sea - two-thirds of the total imported from Russia. But in practice, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the scope of the ban would be wider, because Germany and Poland have volunteered to wind down their own pipeline imports by the end of this year. Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Can Africa replace Russian gas supplies to Europe? ""Left over is around 10-11% that is covered by the southern Druzhba,"" Ms Von der Leyen said, referring to the Russian pipeline supplying oil to Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The European Council would revisit this exemption ""as soon as possible"", she added. A senior EU official confirmed that the three landlocked countries were given an additional guarantee that they could obtain supplies of seaborne Russian oil in the event of an interruption to pipeline supply. The Russian ambassador to the EU, Vladimir Chizhov, said Brussels had ""already approached the limits of what is possible in terms of sanctions"". Speaking to Russian state TV, he predicted ""serious problems"" if the EU were to try to agree on a gas embargo. The ban on Russian oil imports was initially proposed by the European Commission - which develops laws for member states - a month ago. But resistance, notably from Hungary, held up the EU's troubled latest round of sanctions. Mr Orban declared the agreement a victory for his country, telling Hungarians they could sleep soundly - protected from expensive fuel costs that the embargo would bring to the rest of Europe. ""We succeeded in defeating the proposal of the European Council which would have forbidden Hungary from using Russian oil,"" he said in a Facebook video. Other landlocked countries, such as Slovakia and the Czech Republic, also asked for more time due to their dependence on Russian oil. Bulgaria, already cut off from Russian gas by Gazprom, had likewise sought opt-outs. The cost of living crisis being felt across Europe has not helped either. Sky-rocketing energy prices - among other things - have curtailed some EU countries' appetite for sanctions which could also hurt their own economies. The EU's oil agreement is a compromise deal - but it's also an important one. Moscow is heavily reliant on its energy exports, and the EU says this deal will cut more than 90% of Russian oil imports by the end of the year. But considering all the sabre-rattling and anti-Western rhetoric we've been hearing from Vladimir Putin in recent weeks, I suspect the Russian leader is more likely to say to Europe: ""Get ready for some more economic pain because of this embargo. Let's see how long your support for Ukraine lasts."" The Kremlin is aware of the differences of opinion within the EU over what to do about Russia - and you can be sure that Putin is going to try to exploit them. Russia will look for new markets, but in terms of oil that's not a quick fix. The infrastructure isn't in place to reorient oil exports from Europe to Asia, for example. And if it does sell to Asia - it will have to do so at a discounted price. There's also the question of Russian gas - an embargo on that could be discussed next. This video can not be played Watch: The BBCâs Steve Rosenberg examines what Russian papers are saying about sanctions Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who dialled into the summit, urged EU countries to stop their internal ""quarrels,"" stating that they only helped Moscow. ""All quarrels in Europe must end, internal disputes that only encourage Russia to put more and more pressure on you,"" Mr Zelensky said via video-link. Latvia's Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins said member countries should not get ""bogged down"" in their own personal interests. ""It's going to cost us more. But it's only money. The Ukrainians are paying with their lives,"" he said. Russia cut off gas supplies to Dutch firm GasTerra on Tuesday for refusing to pay for supplies in roubles. The EU has said paying in Russian currency breaches sanctions and Gazprom has already cut supplies to Poland, Finland and Bulgaria. MILITARY STATUS:What might swing the Ukraine war?

"Three months a soldier - Maxsym Lutsyk, who has put university on hold to fight Maxsym Lutsyk looks older and more serious, and makes fewer jokes, than when I saw him in the days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Back then, the 19-year-old had just put university on hold and volunteered to fight. Last week he made a difficult journey out of the Donbas front line, using back roads at night to avoid artillery fire, to pick up supplies for his unit and to tell me what it has been like fighting the Russians. We met in Bakhmut, a small town well within the range of Russian artillery. Some of its buildings are in ruins and the city has been almost emptied of civilians. For three weeks, Maxsym and his comrades had fought to keep control of a position they called Serber, after a small dog they had adopted. It was in a smashed-up former factory in Rubizhne, a town that eventually fell to the Russians. ""It was like hell. There were no good positions to defend. We had been in trenches, sometimes shelters from Soviet times, and a fire station."" His unit was targeted by tank fire about 25 times a day, he says. ""One of my friends was killed there and maybe 10 or 15 guys were injured seriously."" Now, summer is almost on them and Ukraine's fertile black soil is bursting with life, the deadliest fighting is in Donbas. Russia's generals are learning from its enemy's victories around Kyiv, the capital, and Kharkiv, the second city. Defeat in March led the Russian army to fall back, in April and May, on what it knows best. Its forces and fearsome firepower are concentrated in a narrow sector of east Ukraine. Now it is close to forcing Ukrainian forces out of Luhansk, one of the two regions that make up Donbas. The other, Donetsk, where Ukraine has a bigger footprint, is already being hit by Russian artillery. I first came acrossMaxsym, a biology student, in early March,external. He, and his university friend Dmytro Kisilenko, an 18-year-old studying economics, had signed up to fight shortly after Russia launched its invasion. Maxsym (left) and Dmytro (right) on 4 March As they waited alongside others like them, in the bitter cold, to be bussed to their training centre, they looked like young lads off to a festival or a camping trip, except for the old Kalashnikovs they had just been issued. Witnessing 18- and 19-year-olds, full of the invincible sense that young men have, going to war in Europe, just as they had during the blood-soaked years of the 20th Century was moving, depressing, and alarming. It was a sign of the big war that was coming. In March, Maxsym and Dmytro and all Ukrainians were adapting, the way human beings always do in war. After the first shock old lives and routines fade into a new, all-consuming version of real life. During their brief training early in March, we talked about how the war was changing everything. Maxsym already sounded old for his years. Uni to uniform - Jeremy meets Maxsym in March ""We can't meet our wives, our girlfriends, our children. We can't do our business, like we were doing before the invasion. But everyone understands that we have a more important mission now. And we will continue doing business, growing up our children. We will kiss our wives and girlfriends many times, but after the war."" Their lives, those of every Ukrainian, were turned upside down, when the Russians invaded on 24 February. So have the lives of all of us who aren't Ukrainian. Despite Russian advances, Maxsym retains an iron-clad determination to fight. His friend Dmytro, who fought in the battle for Kyiv, remains in the capital. As they were students, service in the Donbas is not compulsory. Friends going in their separate ways: Maxsym, left, and Dmytro ""As long as it's necessary to hold, we are ready to freeze in trenches, to lose our hearing. We are ready even to die there, but we will win as much time as it's necessary for the entire civilized world to beat Russia in non-military ways."" He has no time for people calling themselves Ukraine's allies, who say they should trade territory for some kind of accommodation with Vladimir Putin's Russia. ""I think that there is no way to make a deal with Putin. Putin understands only the language of bullets, blood, war crimes and something else. It is impossible to say take this part of the land and the war will end."" I asked Maxsym how the war was changing him. At the start of the year, he was arranging concerts and involved with youth politics in Kyiv. ""Even now I can't answer you exactly because it is very hard to understand that some of your friends, they died in your arms. It is hard to live with that fact... and when we left Rubizhne, it was hard for us to understand that we have lost the battle for this factory; for one of the key cities of Luhansk region."" Back in March, Maxsym used to joke that he hadn't told his parents exactly what he was doing in uniform. ""Now my parents understand me 100%. I try to call them every time I can. My mama sent some uniform for me and my brothers."" His father tried to join the territorial defence in Maxsym's home town, Sumy. ""But he's 65 and too old to fight. So when they turned him down, he phoned me and says 'Maxsym, can I become a part of your unit?' ""They understand me. They support me mentally and financially."" Donbas is full of signs that the Ukrainians expect to lose more territory to this Russian offensive. New lines of trenches have been dug in the rear. Convoys of huge, expensive tractors are being driven west. The sophisticated heavy weapons that they need to try to match and even outgun Russian firepower are arriving, but not fast enough yet to force the invaders back. Maxsym the student has turned into a front-line soldier, engaged he believes in the mission of his life. ""We are fighting for the freedom of the entire world, the entire civilised world and if anyone thinks it is a Ukrainian-Russian war, it isn't. It is the war of the light and the darkness between the Russia and the entire world."" SOUTHERN FRONT:Russia's new propaganda machine WEAPONS:What is being given to Ukraine by the UK?

"The prices of some budget food items have risen by more than 15%, according to new data, with pasta showing the steepest jump over a year. The lowest cost version of pasta rose by 50% in the year to April, said the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Household staples such as minced beef, bread and rice also recorded large increases. But the average price rise of 30 budget food items at supermarkets was 6.7% - below the rate of inflation. The cost of living, or rate of inflation, rose by 9% in April, said the ONS. Despite sharp increases in the price of some items such as pasta, the ONS analysis found that the cost of its basket of low-cost groceries increased at a similar rate to the general basket of groceries used for the official measure of food and drink inflation. Earlier this year, anti-poverty campaignerJack Monroe criticised large supermarkets,externalfor ""stealthily"" removing value food ranges from their shelves, forcing shoppers to ""level up"" to higher priced goods. She criticised the way that the rate of inflation was calculated - which measures the prices of 700 goods - stating that it ""grossly"" underestimates ""the true cost of living crisis"". Why are prices rising so quickly? Seven reasons living costs are rising around the world In this latest data, the ONS measured the price of 30 everyday grocery items across seven supermarkets between April 2021 and 2022. It showed that the price of crisps rose by 17%, bread and minced beef grew by 16% and rice prices rose by 15%. Some everyday items showed a drop in prices, led by potatoes which were down by 14%. Cheese, pizza, chips, sausages and the price of apples were also lower. Measured by price rather than percentage change, minced beef showed the biggest rise, up 32p for 500g to Â£2.34. It was followed by chicken breast which rose by 28p to Â£3.50 for 600g. The price of chicken - the UK's most popular meat - has risen sharply due to a number of factors.According to an analysis by the BBC, higher feed costs and soaring transport prices have contributed to the increase. Ms Monroe told the BBC: ""The figures that are out today will not come as news to anyone who is actually living this because we have all seen the prices of food go up."" She said that having price rises that reflect reality for millions of people shown in official data ""puts us in a stronger position to campaign for things like better wages [and] a higher up-rating for benefits"". Following her comments earlier this year,Asda pledged to stock its budget ranges in all of its supermarkets. ""All of the others just held fast and ignored it really,"" said Ms Monroe on Monday. ""If one supermarket could implement the changes, why can't the others?"" In response, a Sainsbury's spokesperson told the BBC that they understand customers are facing significant pressure on their household budgets. ""We are doing all we can to help, and as part of our plans to focus on offering the best quality food at the lowest prices, today we announced we are investing Â£500m so that customers will be able to find low prices on the everyday items they buy most often,"" the spokesperson added. Meanwhile, Tesco said it is ""absolutely committed"" to helping customers by keeping a ""laser focus"" on the cost of the weekly shop. ""We have significantly increased the number of value lines we offer and whether it's price matching around 650 basics to Aldi prices, promising Low Everyday Prices on 1,600 staples, or offering exclusive deals and rewards through thousands of Clubcard Prices - we're more committed than ever to providing our customers with great value,"" a spokesperson told the BBC.

"Fashion brand Missguided has appointed administrators after suppliers filed to shut it down over unpaid debts. The retailer with about 330 staff has asked Teneo Financial Advisory to sell its business and assets. Missguided has been hit by supply chain costs, rising inflation and ""softening"" consumer confidence in an increasingly tough market, Teneo said. One marketing expert said rival brands were better, cheaper and faster and shoppers now care about sustainability. Catherine Shuttleworth, chief executive of Get Savvy marketing agency added: ""The fast fashion shopper is growing up, spending elsewhere and in new categories."" Teneo said Missguided would continue to trade while it looked for a buyer. Gavin Maher from Teneo said there was ""a high level of interest from a number of strategic buyers"". Rival fast fashion brand Boohoo is rumoured to be among potential suitors. Mr Maher thanked Missguided staff and other key stakeholders for their ""support at this difficult time"". Missguided issued with a winding-up petition by creditors The Manchester-based business was founded by Nitin Passi in 2009. It grew to become one of the UK's biggest online fashion players. But in the last few years, it has struggled to make a profit and was rescued last autumn by the finance firm Alteri Investors. Mr Passi stepped down as CEO in April and this administration comes after supplier JSK Fashions issued a winding up petition on 10 May. Last week,a report in the i newspaper,externalsaid that three of Missguided's suppliers warned they were at risk of going under due to outstanding payments. ""It's a saying that cash is king in business and if reports are to be believed then that's a factor in Missguided's troubles,"" said Julie Palmer, partner at insolvency firm Begbies Traynor. ""If true, tales of suppliers being asked to give discounts, or struggling to extract payment, point to a company facing a cash flow crisis,"" she said. The cost-of-living crisis means shoppers are reining in spending on non-essentials like the fast fashion Missguided offers, she said. ""While Missguided boomed when we were locked down with no opportunity to spend wages going out, the harsh realities of post-pandemic life are becoming clear,"" she said. ""Rising inflation and worries about the potential for a recession mean that people just aren't willing to spend on what they don't need. ""Hopefully a buyer will see the potential in this company that means its suppliers continue to find an outlet for their products."" Missguided has previously provided outfits for Love Island but this year the show has partnered with eBay to source second-hand clothes Catherine Shuttleworth, chief executive of Get Savvy marketing agency, said the fast-fashion industry as a whole was under huge cost pressures. But it was also having to work harder to engage with shoppers who were increasingly focused on sustainability. ""The cost-of-living squeeze is starting to make a difference to younger shoppers meaning they are going out less, and spending less on clothing they just aren't engaging with fast fashion brands in the way they used to be."" She added: ""The bottom line is that Missguided were up against other players who are simply better, cheaper and faster in this space - notably Boohoo."" Online-only retailer Boohoo bought up swathes of High Street stores that collapsed during the pandemic. Among the many brands it owns are PrettyLittleThing, NastyGal and MissPap, which contribute to the increasing competition faced by Missguided. But fashion business educator Maria Malone told BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up To Money there was also a shift away from throwaway fashion. ""It had a phenomenal rise, sponsoring cultural icons like Love Island,"" she said. ""This year the show is featuring pre-owned clothing. Turning its back on fast fashion, that's the problem really, the customer has changed. ""Its rivals have diversified, Missguided stuck with fast fashion, there's now a movement away from that. At every level of society people are questioning fashion, there's a massive market now in slow fashion, sustainability, up cycling and repairing.""

"Todd Boehly attended Chelsea's Premier League game against Watford on 22 May Chelsea's Â£4.25bn sale to a consortium led by American investor Todd Boehly and private equity firm Clearlake Capital has been completed. The club was put up for sale in March before previous owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned over his links to Russian president Vladimir Putin. Chelsea had been operating under a special government licence which would have expired on 31 May. Boehly said that he was ""honoured"" and ""wanted to make fans proud"". The consortium fought off 11 serious rivals to become the new owners, in a sale process that started on 2 March and comprised more than 250 enquiries. ""We are honoured to become the new custodians of Chelsea Football Club,"" he said. ""We're all in - 100% - every minute of every match. Our vision as owners is clear: we want to make the fans proud. ""Along with our commitment to developing the youth squad and acquiring the best talent, our plan of action is to invest in the club for the long term and build on Chelsea's remarkable history of success. ""I personally want to thank ministers and officials in the British government, and the Premier League, for all their work in making this happen."" The UK government - which said last Wednesday it could issue a licence for the sale of the club - does not want Abramovich to receive any of the proceeds from the sale, which will instead go into a frozen bank account to be donated to charities supporting victims of the war in Ukraine.

What are the pressing issues for Chelsea's new owners? Several parties expressed an interest, but Chelsea agreed to sell to the Boehly-Clearlake Capital consortium earlier in May, with Californian private equity firm owning a majority of the shares as it makes its first foray into sport. Boehly, 48, is also a part-owner of seven-time baseball World Series champions the LA Dodgers, US women's basketball team the Los Angeles Sparks and NBA franchise the Los Angeles Lakers. He has also invested in Bruce Springsteen's song rights, a sports betting firm and restaurant chains. Other investors include US billionaire Mark Walter, a co-owner of the LA Dodgers with a stake in the Lakers like Boehly, and Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss. Abramovich bought Chelsea for Â£140m in 2003. Under his ownership, the club won every major trophy - two Champions Leagues, five Premier Leagues, five FA Cups, two Europa Leagues and three EFL Cups. In August 2021 they won the Uefa Super Cup and in February their first Club World Cup. Abramovich has appointed 13 managers and the club has spent more than Â£2bn in the transfer market under his ownership. Chelsea's women's team, who became affiliated to Chelsea FC in 2004, have won five Women's Super League titles and four FA Cups under Abramovich. When an agreement for the sale was reached, he said: ""As I hand over Chelsea to its new custodians, I would like to wish them the best of success, both on and off the pitch. ""It has been an honour of a lifetime to be a part of this club - I would like to thank all the club's past and current players, staff, and of course fans for these incredible years."" 24 February:Russia invades Ukraine 26 February:Abramovichgives ""stewardship and care""of club to charitable foundation 2 March:Abramovichsays he plans to sell the club 10 March:The UK governmentsanctions Abramovich 5 May:Abramovichdenies he has requesteda Â£1.5bn loan he made to Chelsea is repaid 7 May:Boehlyagrees a Â£4.25bn dealfor the club 16 May:Government insider says thedeal is close to collapse 24 May:Premier Leagueapproves takeover 25 May:Governmentapproves takeover 28 May:Final agreement reachedwith Boehly-Clearlake Capital consortium 30 May:Sale completed Our coverage of Chelsea is bigger and better than ever before - here'severything you need to knowto make sure you never miss a moment Everything Chelsea - go straight to all the best content Australian Open: GB's Draper fighting in fifth set v Kokkinakis after Fearnley wins Transfers,  Premier League build-up and football latest New Match of the Day presenters announced A pregnant young woman is in crisis, but is it all a scam?

"Michelle O'Neill (centre) accused the DUP of stopping other parties from working together Stormont has failed to elect a new Speaker after the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) refused to vote in favour. The Northern Ireland Assembly had been recalled for the vote, following a proposal by Sinn FÃ©in. A Speaker cannot be elected without support from both unionists and nationalists. The DUP said it would not agree to a new Speaker until its issues with the Northern Ireland Protocol were addressed. It was the second time the DUP did not vote for a Speaker since the assembly election on 5 May and also means an executive cannot be formed. The protocol is thepart of the Brexit deal designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. Unionists said the fact it created a border in the Irish Sea undermined Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom and argued that it was damaging Northern Ireland's economy. The Ulster Unionist party (UUP) had nominated Mike Nesbitt to become Speaker while the SDLP nominated Patsy McGlone. Speaking after the vote, Sinn FÃ©in's deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said the DUP was preventing other parties from working together. ""We will come back again, we will do this again because I am not giving up, we believe in making this institution work and we still, at this point, call on the DUP to join with all the other parties that actually want to make politics work,"" she said. Alliance MLA Nuala McAllister said the recall showed the majority of MLAs wanted to elect a speaker. ""There was much chat in the assembly there about stunts being pulled today but let's be clear, the only stunt being pulled over the past few weeks and the past few months is the stunt of the DUP to not restore the executive, or even nominate a Speaker. ""Any consequence from now, and from the day that the DUP walked away from the executive, any hardships that people are facing, are on the heads of the DUP."" Earlier in the chamber, the DUP's Paul Givan said the recall of the assembly was ""another attempt at majority rule"". ""[It] has no credibility when it comes forward from the party that kept these institutions down for three years,"" he said. ""The public will see the hypocrisy for what it is from Sinn FÃ©in. ""This isn't a serious attempt to restore the principles of power sharing and these institutions. It is a stunt."" Paul Givan (centre) criticised the attempt to nominate a Speaker Robbie Butler of the UUP said his party had written to the head of the civil service urging all-party talks to draw up a programme for government. ""I have referred to this sitting today as potentially artificial because we will know in a short matter of time whether we can convince the party to my right [the DUP] whether they might make a move today but whilst I've said it's kind of artificial, it's absolutely within the rules to do this,"" he said. The SDLP's Matthew O'Toole said the DUP's actions were ""unconscionable"" and ""abhorrent"". ""We know in all probability that today the DUP will not let us elect a Speaker,"" he said. ""Today is another opportunity to elect first of all a Speaker and then first and deputy first ministers, to enable the people who were retuned here by the electorate just a few weeks ago to come here and do our jobs."" In a tweet, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis repeated his plea to Stormont parties to elect a Speaker, adding: ""Together, we must work together to deliver a brighter future for Northern Ireland"". In Stormont's Great Hall there hangs a portrait of the first assembly Speaker, John Alderdice. The question now is how long might we wait before a new Speaker is able to take the chair he once occupied? Be in no doubt, other parties are trying to up the ante and pressure the DUP to end its ongoing protest of the institutions, at least in part to allow the assembly to operate. The DUP refuses to budge, it says it is buoyed by the recent commitment from London to start moving on the protocol. Sinn FÃ©in has vowed to continue pushing for MLAs to be recalled as many times as it takes to get a new Speaker installed - the rules mean they can do that without limit. For now, this appears to be another roundabout in a Stormont stalemate with no clear exit route. Speaking before the debate in the assembly, DUP MLA Gordon Lyons said the recall was a ""distraction from the real problem"" of the protocol. ""We don't want to be in this position, but we have made more progress in two weeks than we made in the previous two years,"" Mr Lyons said. ""It's unfortunate that it has taken this step to bring the matter to a head."" The economy minister added that no elected unionist representative supported the protocol and accused Sinn FÃ©in of not attempting to ""deal with the problem"". A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Under assembly rules, no business can take place after an election until a new Speaker is elected. A bid to do so on 13 May failed becauseit requires cross-community support from a majority of unionist and nationalist MLAs. There are concerns that without a functioning government in Northern Ireland, the cost-of-living crisis cannot be addressed by politicians. Last week, Finance Minister Conor Murphy said there was""no guarantee"" Northern Ireland households could avail of a planned Â£400 energy bill discountthis autumn, without an executive in place to distribute funding. Colum Eastwood's SDLP nominated Patsy McGlone as speaker Monday's proceedings at Stormont were chaired by an acting Speaker, which under the rules must be the oldest MLA - currently Alan Chambers of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP). A Sinn FÃ©in motion was also proposed calling for ""immediate action to be taken by an incoming executive to address issues... including the cost-of-living crisis and challenges in our health service"". However, this cannot be debated unless a new Speaker and first and deputy first minister are elected first.

"Fashion brand Missguided has appointed administrators after suppliers filed to shut it down over unpaid debts. The retailer with about 330 staff has asked Teneo Financial Advisory to sell its business and assets. Missguided has been hit by supply chain costs, rising inflation and ""softening"" consumer confidence in an increasingly tough market, Teneo said. One marketing expert said rival brands were better, cheaper and faster and shoppers now care about sustainability. Catherine Shuttleworth, chief executive of Get Savvy marketing agency added: ""The fast fashion shopper is growing up, spending elsewhere and in new categories."" Teneo said Missguided would continue to trade while it looked for a buyer. Gavin Maher from Teneo said there was ""a high level of interest from a number of strategic buyers"". Rival fast fashion brand Boohoo is rumoured to be among potential suitors. Mr Maher thanked Missguided staff and other key stakeholders for their ""support at this difficult time"". Missguided issued with a winding-up petition by creditors The Manchester-based business was founded by Nitin Passi in 2009. It grew to become one of the UK's biggest online fashion players. But in the last few years, it has struggled to make a profit and was rescued last autumn by the finance firm Alteri Investors. Mr Passi stepped down as CEO in April and this administration comes after supplier JSK Fashions issued a winding up petition on 10 May. Last week,a report in the i newspaper,externalsaid that three of Missguided's suppliers warned they were at risk of going under due to outstanding payments. ""It's a saying that cash is king in business and if reports are to be believed then that's a factor in Missguided's troubles,"" said Julie Palmer, partner at insolvency firm Begbies Traynor. ""If true, tales of suppliers being asked to give discounts, or struggling to extract payment, point to a company facing a cash flow crisis,"" she said. The cost-of-living crisis means shoppers are reining in spending on non-essentials like the fast fashion Missguided offers, she said. ""While Missguided boomed when we were locked down with no opportunity to spend wages going out, the harsh realities of post-pandemic life are becoming clear,"" she said. ""Rising inflation and worries about the potential for a recession mean that people just aren't willing to spend on what they don't need. ""Hopefully a buyer will see the potential in this company that means its suppliers continue to find an outlet for their products."" Missguided has previously provided outfits for Love Island but this year the show has partnered with eBay to source second-hand clothes Catherine Shuttleworth, chief executive of Get Savvy marketing agency, said the fast-fashion industry as a whole was under huge cost pressures. But it was also having to work harder to engage with shoppers who were increasingly focused on sustainability. ""The cost-of-living squeeze is starting to make a difference to younger shoppers meaning they are going out less, and spending less on clothing they just aren't engaging with fast fashion brands in the way they used to be."" She added: ""The bottom line is that Missguided were up against other players who are simply better, cheaper and faster in this space - notably Boohoo."" Online-only retailer Boohoo bought up swathes of High Street stores that collapsed during the pandemic. Among the many brands it owns are PrettyLittleThing, NastyGal and MissPap, which contribute to the increasing competition faced by Missguided. But fashion business educator Maria Malone told BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up To Money there was also a shift away from throwaway fashion. ""It had a phenomenal rise, sponsoring cultural icons like Love Island,"" she said. ""This year the show is featuring pre-owned clothing. Turning its back on fast fashion, that's the problem really, the customer has changed. ""Its rivals have diversified, Missguided stuck with fast fashion, there's now a movement away from that.

"Wem in Shropshire was the epicentre of the earthquake A 3.8 magnitude earthquake has been recorded in Shropshire. The British Geological Survey (BGS) said the tremor happened at a depth of 8km (5 miles), near Wem in the north of the county. Residents of nearby towns and villages including Shrewsbury, Telford, and High Ercall, contacted the BBC with reports of their homes shaking. One resident said her legs ""turned to jelly"" as she felt her bedroom floor shuddering beneath her. Fire crews in Market Drayton said they also felt the tremor and urged people not to call emergency services unless someone was in danger. Allow Twitter content?

BGS records said the tremor began shortly after 15:30 BST, with the epicentre just south of Market Drayton between the villages of Stanton upon Hine Heath, Weston-under-Redcastle and Hodnet. Julie Williams lives in Wem and was upstairs when the earthquake hit. She said: ""All I heard a thud and a shudder through the bedroom floor."" ""I knew straight away what it was, I was just like, get downstairs and get out. ""It shocked me,"" she said. ""My legs went to jelly."" Andy Semourson, who lives in Whitmere, said his whole house creaked and his furniture wobbled. ""It really shook the house,"" he said. ""[I've] never felt one as strong."" Patricia Ford, from Hodnet, was in the kitchen when she felt the thud. ""I couldn't believe it,"" she said. ""It felt like a lorry hitting your house."" The last 3.8 magnitude earthquake was near Grimsby in north-east Lincolnshire, on 9 June 2018 Dudley in the West Midlands was hit by a 4.7 magnitude in 2002 In 1996, a 3.4 magnitude quake was recorded less than 10km away from Monday's earthquake in Wem Six years earlier in 1990, a 5.1 magnitude earthquake hit Bishop's Castle, also in Shropshire Source: BGS Emergency services said they had not received any callouts to incidents related to the earthquake. BGS said an earthquake of this magnitude only tends to happen once every three years in the UK. It added that more than 200 earthquakes are recorded each year in the UK. It was the third earthquake with a magnitude of more than two to hit the UK in the last 24 hours. A 2.1 magnitude earthquake was recorded in Arran, North Ayrshire, Scotland just before 08:00 BST and on Sunday a 2.3 magnitude tremor was felt in Sale, Greater Manchester.

"This video can not be played Watch: Fans shared videos showing pepper spray being deployed and children crying in Paris French authorities and Uefa blamed late arrivals and fraudulent tickets for chaotic scenes outside the Stade de France before Saturday's Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid. But Liverpool fans who spoke to the BBC described organisational failures, overcrowding and heavy-handed policing. On Monday, Uefacommissioned an independent reportinto the decision-making, responsibility and behaviour of all parties involved in the final. Here is what we know so far about how events unfolded. Michael Carter was among tens of thousands of Liverpool supporters gathered in a fan zone in the south-west of Paris ahead of the Champions League final. He recalled a ""top class"" atmosphere, without any trouble. As early evening approached, he and others with tickets travelled to the Stade de France in the north of the city, ahead of the scheduled kick-off at 21:00. Fans had been warned to get there early and Merseyside police, who had officers deployed as observers, would later describe the behaviour of most as ""exemplary"", saying they arrived in plenty of time and queued as directed. One of the train lines serving the stadium, the RER B, was not working, meaning many fans had to take the RER D. This meant they ended up at a single checkpoint at the perimeter outside the stadium. Mr Carter said the trouble started to begin when fans leaving the station were ""squeezed"" into a ""narrow alley"". Thegates opened at 18:00 local time(17:00 BST) but Liverpool fan Suzanne Gower, who arrived at 18:15, told the BBC that crowds were already so big it took them 35 minutes to move 100 metres (328 feet) at this point. The route from the Stade de France-St Denis RER stop to the stadium involves crossing two motorways, cramming fans into narrow underpasses. Some fans said they were searched multiple times, further adding to the delays, while police vans blocked part of the route to funnel supporters towards a ticket stop. Liverpool fan Matt Lomas said he saw people without tickets turned away at this point, but it took two hours to move 40 yards (36m). Michael Carter told the BBC that people further back in the queue ""were lifting each other up and over the walls because they were being crushed"". By the time he got to the police barricade, there were ""no ticket checks, they were just letting people through"" - including local youths who had been trying to snatch fans' bags and other possessions, he said. Thousands of fans were crammed into underpasses, taking hours to reach the stadium Mr Carter said at one point, people at this checkpoint were doused indiscriminately in what was thought to be pepper spray, causing the crowd to stampede backwards and leaving some of them vomiting as others rushed for water from neighbouring bars to ease the pain. Real Madrid fans on social media also reported long queues before kick-off, as well as disruption by local youths and an overwhelmed police force. When they finally reached the gates, fans described more chaotic scenes. Mr Carter said people were being manhandled through the turnstile without their tickets being scanned as the crowd pressed in on them, while videos showed others trying to jump the barriers. It got to the point where staff were pulling out women and children from the crowd to prevent them being crushed, he said. ""It shouldn't have to be 'save the women and children first' at a football match,"" Mr Carter said. Gates X and Y, two of the main entrances for Liverpool fans, were closed altogether at one point, said BBC News reporter Nick Parrott, who was at the stadium as a fan. He said about 1,500 to 2,000 people were waiting outside each gate. This video can not be played BBC reporter describes his experience entering the stadium for Champions League final Some people tried to get through gates A and B, but locals without tickets tried to force their way in at the same time, he said. He saw police punch one fan, who did not react, while using the spray on others. ""The safest place was to be in the ground, that's why the fans were trying to get in so much,"" Mr Parrott said. ""The police just seemed to go after anyone who moved."" While eyewitnesses felt police tactics were heavy-handed, a spokesperson for a police union said officers on the ground were overwhelmed. But Mathieu Valet, from senior police officers' union the SICP, told the BBC's Newshour the main issue was not ticketless fans or fake tickets, but ""three or four hundred French and undocumented delinquents who were there on the concourse of the Stade de France"". ""It's clear that we needed more police - we didn't have enough on the ground,"" Mr Valet said. A police officer is photographed spraying a cannister towards a Liverpool fan outside the gates He confirmed the use of tear gas, saying it ""unfortunately does not discriminate"". ""It's clear that families, children, mainly English supporters, were inconvenienced by tear gas, I know it's not part of your culture but it allows us to repel attackers,"" he said. Liverpool fans also said many of the crowd troubles were caused by locals, describing gangs of young people who tried to steal from the travelling football fans and rush the gates. Steve Rotherham, mayor of Liverpool City Region, was one of their victims. ""Like too many others, I had my phone and other belongings stolen by dippers [pickpockets] on the approach to the stadium,"" he said on Monday. Some eyewitnesses described gangs of young people hanging around outside the station after the match, saying they were mugging people and assaulting them without being challenged by police. Others said local trouble-makers made it inside the stadium. Mr Carter said that inside the Stade de France, several French youths attempted to steal Liverpool fans' seats. Inside the stadium, Suzanne Gower had arrived with nearly two hours to go before kick-off. ""The Liverpool side had no fans and the Madrid end was really full so you know something outside was happening,"" she said. Five minutes before kick-off was due,at 20:55 local time, Uefa announced that the start of the match was delayed""for security reasons"" until 21:15. Inside the stadium, signs said the delay was ""due to the late arrival of fans at the stadium"". Notices inside the stadium blamed the late arrival of fans for the delayed kick-off Thenat 21:14 Uefa announced a further delayto kick-off. Eventually,the match got underway at 21:36. Even then, there were many empty seats in the Liverpool end, with some fans reporting they were not able to get into the stadium until half-time. Liverpool fans say police lined up in front of them before the final whistle - but ignored the Real Madrid supporters' section. Chaos erupted again when the exit gates were opened, with Mr Carter saying local youths rushed the gates, while police fired what appeared to be tear gas into the crowd. Riot police lined up in front of Liverpool fans before the final whistle French interior minister Gerard Darmanin said the disruption was due to ""thousands of British 'supporters', without tickets or with counterfeit tickets"" who ""forced entry and sometimes assaulted the stewards"". But Ms Gower, a lawyer who worked on the inquests intothe Hillsborough disaster, said: ""The way this event was being policed was all wrong and incredibly dangerous."" And fan Adrian Tempanyreflected later,external: ""My experience at Stade de France on Saturday was the 2nd worst I've had at a football match, after Hillsborough."" ""In my opinion, French police and Uefa nearly caused a disaster,"" he added. The French government has suggested there were between 30,000 and 40,000 ticketless Liverpool fans who attempted to gain entry to the stadium. Mr Darmanin described it as ""massive, industrial-level ticket fraud"". There were several reports of legitimate tickets failing to scan or being rejected at the turnstiles, however. Peter Hooton, singer of Liverpool band The Farm, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that he was attending as a guest of broadcaster BT Sport in a neutral part of the ground, where French, Spanish and British attendees all saw their mobile tickets repeatedly rejected. Uefa declined to give details of the anti-fraud measures used on the tickets at the Champions League final, saying: ""Tickets contain a number of security features and the design is different for every single competition."" But Prof Clifford Stott from Keele University, an expert in crowds and policing, cast doubt on the French authorities' claim. He said on Monday there was no apparent evidence for what would have been ""the largest-ever criminal conspiracy to produce and supply forged tickets at football"".

"This video can not be played Families in Aberdeenshire find out if it is easy to swap the car in rural locations. How easy is it to drop the car when living in rural Scotland? That is exactly what six families in Aberdeenshire have been finding out as part of a pilot project. For one year, the volunteers have been given electric bikes - with the aim of challenging their travel behaviours. Here are the experiences of three of those households, in three different locations, but with one common challenge - picking pedal power over petrol. The Smith family signed up to the pilot project Martin and Sarah Smith live in Drums, about 10 miles north of Aberdeen, with their two young children. For the past eight months, they have been loaned e-bikes as part of the pilot scheme through Aberdeenshire Council. It has been an especially big hit with four-year-old Penny. ""Instead of just driving to nursery, I can plop her on the bike and we can cycle in together and it was a lot more engaging,"" her father said. E-bike sales boom despite high prices and confusing rules ""We have both loved it. It's been great. It opens up avenues. ""I think at the moment there's a bit of a challenge for us in terms of the commute. My work is 25 miles each way so to plan ahead and try to budget the time without sacrificing family time would be a challenge at this moment."" Mrs Smith said they saw a post on social media looking for families to take part in the behavioural change pilot. ""It was something we thought looked quite exciting,"" she said. Penny has enjoyed being on the bike with dad Martin ""We had thought about e-bikes previously but we didn't want to outlay such a big financial commitment and not know if it was something we would get the use out of. ""So we thought this was something that could work for our family, and we were exceptionally fortunate to be chosen as part of the pilot. ""We will cycle down to the beach. ""If you want to go anywhere on a distance you pick up the car keys and you don't give it a second thought. There's not a bus route here so to have the option of the e-bikes now, it has just been transformational for us."" Tim MacLaren is finding the e-bike means he is less tired when he gets to work Keen cyclist Tim MacLaren lives in Kintore, and regularly makes the 15-mile commute using his normal road bike. Lately, however, he has been using the e-bike in the 12-month trial. ""It makes a big difference on the hills,"" he said. ""The battery only takes you up to about 15mph with assistance and after that you lose any assistance. It is then just a big heavy bike. I can't quite get that same speed. ""But I'm less tired when I get to work. ""For commuting, it's superb. The battery lasts to work and back. ""The biggest challenge is the weather - the dark, ice, cold."" Charlotte Milburn has enjoyed the e-bike option when the elements have been kind The most remote participant is Charlotte Milburn, who lives in Strathdon. ""You read about schemes in cities and this was an extreme rural area,"" she said of her decision to take part. It is a beautiful setting, but living 1,300ft up is not without its problems. Electric bikes 'could help people return to work' ""It's nearly three miles to the nearest shop and another 20 to the nearest supermarket,"" she explained. ""Now I've got this I can get back up the hill in about 12 minutes from the village instead of half-an-hour, so that's made it a lot more accessible, definitely. ""We had the snow, then we had storm Arwen, and then we had more storms, so over the winter it's had very little use I'm afraid. ""It has made me think, and there are times when I've definitely used the bike when I would have used the car, that's for sure, but not always able to, that's been the problem.

"Michelle O'Neill (centre) accused the DUP of stopping other parties from working together Stormont has failed to elect a new Speaker after the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) refused to vote in favour. The Northern Ireland Assembly had been recalled for the vote, following a proposal by Sinn FÃ©in. A Speaker cannot be elected without support from both unionists and nationalists. The DUP said it would not agree to a new Speaker until its issues with the Northern Ireland Protocol were addressed. It was the second time the DUP did not vote for a Speaker since the assembly election on 5 May and also means an executive cannot be formed. The protocol is thepart of the Brexit deal designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. Unionists said the fact it created a border in the Irish Sea undermined Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom and argued that it was damaging Northern Ireland's economy. The Ulster Unionist party (UUP) had nominated Mike Nesbitt to become Speaker while the SDLP nominated Patsy McGlone. Speaking after the vote, Sinn FÃ©in's deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said the DUP was preventing other parties from working together. ""We will come back again, we will do this again because I am not giving up, we believe in making this institution work and we still, at this point, call on the DUP to join with all the other parties that actually want to make politics work,"" she said. Alliance MLA Nuala McAllister said the recall showed the majority of MLAs wanted to elect a speaker. ""There was much chat in the assembly there about stunts being pulled today but let's be clear, the only stunt being pulled over the past few weeks and the past few months is the stunt of the DUP to not restore the executive, or even nominate a Speaker. ""Any consequence from now, and from the day that the DUP walked away from the executive, any hardships that people are facing, are on the heads of the DUP."" Earlier in the chamber, the DUP's Paul Givan said the recall of the assembly was ""another attempt at majority rule"". ""[It] has no credibility when it comes forward from the party that kept these institutions down for three years,"" he said. ""The public will see the hypocrisy for what it is from Sinn FÃ©in. ""This isn't a serious attempt to restore the principles of power sharing and these institutions. It is a stunt."" Paul Givan (centre) criticised the attempt to nominate a Speaker Robbie Butler of the UUP said his party had written to the head of the civil service urging all-party talks to draw up a programme for government. ""I have referred to this sitting today as potentially artificial because we will know in a short matter of time whether we can convince the party to my right [the DUP] whether they might make a move today but whilst I've said it's kind of artificial, it's absolutely within the rules to do this,"" he said. The SDLP's Matthew O'Toole said the DUP's actions were ""unconscionable"" and ""abhorrent"". ""We know in all probability that today the DUP will not let us elect a Speaker,"" he said. ""Today is another opportunity to elect first of all a Speaker and then first and deputy first ministers, to enable the people who were retuned here by the electorate just a few weeks ago to come here and do our jobs."" In a tweet, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis repeated his plea to Stormont parties to elect a Speaker, adding: ""Together, we must work together to deliver a brighter future for Northern Ireland"". In Stormont's Great Hall there hangs a portrait of the first assembly Speaker, John Alderdice. The question now is how long might we wait before a new Speaker is able to take the chair he once occupied? Be in no doubt, other parties are trying to up the ante and pressure the DUP to end its ongoing protest of the institutions, at least in part to allow the assembly to operate. The DUP refuses to budge, it says it is buoyed by the recent commitment from London to start moving on the protocol. Sinn FÃ©in has vowed to continue pushing for MLAs to be recalled as many times as it takes to get a new Speaker installed - the rules mean they can do that without limit. For now, this appears to be another roundabout in a Stormont stalemate with no clear exit route. Speaking before the debate in the assembly, DUP MLA Gordon Lyons said the recall was a ""distraction from the real problem"" of the protocol. ""We don't want to be in this position, but we have made more progress in two weeks than we made in the previous two years,"" Mr Lyons said. ""It's unfortunate that it has taken this step to bring the matter to a head."" The economy minister added that no elected unionist representative supported the protocol and accused Sinn FÃ©in of not attempting to ""deal with the problem"". A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Under assembly rules, no business can take place after an election until a new Speaker is elected. A bid to do so on 13 May failed becauseit requires cross-community support from a majority of unionist and nationalist MLAs. There are concerns that without a functioning government in Northern Ireland, the cost-of-living crisis cannot be addressed by politicians. Last week, Finance Minister Conor Murphy said there was""no guarantee"" Northern Ireland households could avail of a planned Â£400 energy bill discountthis autumn, without an executive in place to distribute funding. Colum Eastwood's SDLP nominated Patsy McGlone as speaker Monday's proceedings at Stormont were chaired by an acting Speaker, which under the rules must be the oldest MLA - currently Alan Chambers of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP). A Sinn FÃ©in motion was also proposed calling for ""immediate action to be taken by an incoming executive to address issues... including the cost-of-living crisis and challenges in our health service"". However, this cannot be debated unless a new Speaker and first and deputy first minister are elected first.

"The prices of some budget food items have risen by more than 15%, according to new data, with pasta showing the steepest jump over a year. The lowest cost version of pasta rose by 50% in the year to April, said the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Household staples such as minced beef, bread and rice also recorded large increases. But the average price rise of 30 budget food items at supermarkets was 6.7% - below the rate of inflation. The cost of living, or rate of inflation, rose by 9% in April, said the ONS. Despite sharp increases in the price of some items such as pasta, the ONS analysis found that the cost of its basket of low-cost groceries increased at a similar rate to the general basket of groceries used for the official measure of food and drink inflation. Earlier this year, anti-poverty campaignerJack Monroe criticised large supermarkets,externalfor ""stealthily"" removing value food ranges from their shelves, forcing shoppers to ""level up"" to higher priced goods. She criticised the way that the rate of inflation was calculated - which measures the prices of 700 goods - stating that it ""grossly"" underestimates ""the true cost of living crisis"". Why are prices rising so quickly? Seven reasons living costs are rising around the world In this latest data, the ONS measured the price of 30 everyday grocery items across seven supermarkets between April 2021 and 2022. It showed that the price of crisps rose by 17%, bread and minced beef grew by 16% and rice prices rose by 15%. Some everyday items showed a drop in prices, led by potatoes which were down by 14%. Cheese, pizza, chips, sausages and the price of apples were also lower. Measured by price rather than percentage change, minced beef showed the biggest rise, up 32p for 500g to Â£2.34. It was followed by chicken breast which rose by 28p to Â£3.50 for 600g. The price of chicken - the UK's most popular meat - has risen sharply due to a number of factors.According to an analysis by the BBC, higher feed costs and soaring transport prices have contributed to the increase. Ms Monroe told the BBC: ""The figures that are out today will not come as news to anyone who is actually living this because we have all seen the prices of food go up."" She said that having price rises that reflect reality for millions of people shown in official data ""puts us in a stronger position to campaign for things like better wages [and] a higher up-rating for benefits"". Following her comments earlier this year,Asda pledged to stock its budget ranges in all of its supermarkets. ""All of the others just held fast and ignored it really,"" said Ms Monroe on Monday. ""If one supermarket could implement the changes, why can't the others?"" In response, a Sainsbury's spokesperson told the BBC that they understand customers are facing significant pressure on their household budgets. ""We are doing all we can to help, and as part of our plans to focus on offering the best quality food at the lowest prices, today we announced we are investing Â£500m so that customers will be able to find low prices on the everyday items they buy most often,"" the spokesperson added. Meanwhile, Tesco said it is ""absolutely committed"" to helping customers by keeping a ""laser focus"" on the cost of the weekly shop. ""We have significantly increased the number of value lines we offer and whether it's price matching around 650 basics to Aldi prices, promising Low Everyday Prices on 1,600 staples, or offering exclusive deals and rewards through thousands of Clubcard Prices - we're more committed than ever to providing our customers with great value,"" a spokesperson told the BBC.

"People in Severodonetsk are warned not to leave bomb shelters and to prepare masks to protect against toxic fumes after a nitric acid tank is hit, the regional governor says Serhiy Haidai says much of the eastern Ukrainian city is now controlled by Russians Nearly all critical infrastructure and 90% of its housing is destroyed, he says There's been a shutdown of all communications in southern Kherson, officials say But in his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says forces have had some success there, and are advancing around Kharkiv EU leaders reach agreement to ban 90% of oil imports from Russia but are split over gas imports They met for a two-day summit in Brussels to discuss sanctions against Russia Moscow now occupies almost all of the Luhansk region, as it focuses on seizing the whole of Donbas in the east Edited by Claire Heald Thank you for joining our live coverage today. We'll leave you with the latest developments in the war in Ukraine:  Todayâs live page was edited by Chris Giles, Emma Owens,
Claire Heald and Tiffany Wertheimer. The writers were Alexandra FouchÃ©, Gareth
Evans, Jack Burgess, James Harness, Sam Hancock and Victoria Lindrea. Join us tomorrow. General David Petraeus Over 20,000 Russian troops may have been killed during the Ukraine conflict, says retired US General David Petraeus. This is ""many multiples of what they lost in nine years in
Afghanistan"", he says. Russia's last estimate of its troop losses was 1,351, given on 25 March. This war is approaching 100 days duration. Speaking to the BBC, he says he's not surprised by Ukraine's ability to repel Russian forces. Ukraine ""performed above even the highest of expectations most of us had"". On Russia's effectiveness in the war, Petraeus is very critical: ""No one predicted Russia's sheer incompetence, at every single level,"" he says. However, on Severodonetsk he is less upbeat about Ukraine's situation: ""At some point, the Ukrainians may have to withdraw to fight another day."" And Russia seizing the city would be significant in the psychological ""war of ideas"", says Petraeus. He is sceptical about Russia's offer to escort cargo ships of wheat out of Ukrainian ports. ""They said they would do that if we lift the sanctions
and there's no way that we're going to lift the sanctions,"" he says. And any idea of Western forces sending in ships to force a way through the Black Sea is ""dead on arrival"", he says, because "" you're going to sail into a direct conflict with Russia"". James WaterhouseReporting from Poltava Hlib Stryzhko suffered a broken pelvis and jaw when he came under attack from a Russian tank Hlib Stryzhko endured psychological torture and was denied medical treatment for a broken pelvis and jaw. Yet somehow, he made it home. In a hospital bed in the Ukrainian city of Poltava, he tried to sit up. The 25-year-old soldier's pelvis was supported by metal scaffolding - one of his many injuries sustained while trying to defend Mariupol, nearly 500km (310 miles) to the south. As his mother Olesya helped him he grimaced with pain, but seemed eager to share his story nevertheless. ""Turning my head, I saw that a tank was aimed at me,"" he recalled. ""When a tank fires, there is no time between exit and arrival. It happens instantaneously. I saw a bright flash."" Read the full story here. Ukrainian President Zelensky visiting frontline positions in Kharkiv on Sunday Ukraine's forces have had some success near the southern city of Kherson and are advancing in parts of the Kharkiv region to the east of Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says, Reuters reports. Zelensky praised his military's ""utmost courage"" and says they ""remain masters of the situation at the front"". The Ukrainian president did however say Russian forces have a ""significant advantage"" in terms or equipment and numbers. Ukrainian officials are reporting a ""shutdown of all communications"" in the Russian-occupied southern region of Kherson, Reuters reports. An unspecified intrusion ""by the occupation regime"" has taken place, with equipment powered down and cables disconnected, Ukraine's State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection has said, according to Reuters. This has left residents ""without Ukrainian mobile communication and Internet access"" and ""no means to make national and international phone calls using landline phone devices,"" the agency has reportedly said. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this. Smoke over Severodonetsk on Monday The 97th day of the war saw Ukrainian and Russian forces battling for control of the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which is said to be divided between the two sides. Up to 15,000 people may still be trapped there, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai has said. Both sides are suffering heavy casualties and the Ukrainian command may decide a tactical retreat would better serve their medium-term interests. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,""Ukrainian former Defence Minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk has told the BBC. Russia now occupies almost all of Luhansk, as it focuses on seizing it and neighbouring Donetsk.At least 3,052 of its soldiers have been killedsince the invasion began on 24 February, according to a list of names compiled by BBC News Russian. Read more on this story here. Anna HolliganBBC News, The Hague Today was described as âa
momentous dayâ by the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor, Karim
Khan. He was referring to
three new countries - Estonia,
Latvia and Slovakia -joining the joint investigation team (JIT), and what that represents for the
pursuit of justice. Khan was speaking at the
Eurojust â the EU agency for criminal justice â a lesser-known international
organisation at The Hague. Eurojust will ensure all
the evidence - from witness statements to forensic data - will be translated
into a language that will make it accessible for all prosecution teams. Khan told a news conference: We must join hands in the common interest of humanity.   And when Iryna Venediktova, Ukraineâs chief prosecutor, told journalists ""we are fighting for European values"", Khan interjected. ""These aren't European values we're protecting,â he said. âIt's important to emphasize the ICC is fighting for basic human standards in the 21st century."" The Azovstal steel plant was bombarded for months by Russian forces For months Ukrainian fighters in Mariupol's Azovstal steelworksprevented Russian forcesfrom taking full control of the besieged southern port city. BBC Monitoring reports Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, has rejected a Russian statement claiming about 150 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found rigged with explosives at the steel plant. Andryushchenko has said the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, earlier reported some Ukrainian fighters were found alive at Azovstal. The Russian Defence Ministry said 152 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found in an inoperative refrigerated van and four mines were planted under the bodies. According to the ministry's spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, Ukrainian POWs from the Azov regiment said the van was set up on orders from Kyiv. The Russian side plans to hand over the bodies to Ukraine in the near future, Konashenkov has been quoted as saying by the separatist website Donetsk News Agency. This video can not be played Russia's Defence Ministry released video of a cargo ship leaving Mariupol's port Russian naval vessels have escorted the first cargo ship to leave the Port of Mariupol since Russia took control of the area. In footage released by the Russian Defence Ministry, artillery boats can be seen flanking the ship as it left the port, reportedly carrying metal in its hold. It's the first ship to enter and then leave the port, on the Sea of Azov, since the fighting in Mariupol ended. Earlier, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the Russian Navy is ready to provide safe passage to ships transporting grain currently stuck in Ukraine's ports - if Ukraine clears coastal waters of mines. Lavrov said: ""If this de-mining problem is solved... the Russian Federation will ensure the unhindered passage of these ships to the Mediterranean Sea and further to their destinations."" The explosion of a nitric acid container in Severodonetsk is thought to have been caused by an airstrike, Luhansk's regional governor Serhiy Haidai says. âThere
was allegedly an airstrike on the chemical plant in Severodonetsk which hit
the tank with the remains of nitric acid"", he says. He tells the BBC toxic fumes were released into the air. Based on a previous chemical leak, he predicts there might be a threat to people within a 400-metre range of the explosion. Outside of that range, people might experience some eye irritation, he says. At the moment there is no possibility of evacuating any of the 15,000 residents who remain in Severodonetsk - as it comes under sustained attack from Russians, he says. ""Russians provide no humanitarian corridors,"" he says. ""Seventy to eighty percent of the city is controlled by the Russian army. The neighbouring city of Lysychansk is
under the full control of Ukraineâ, he adds. Smoke rises in Severodonetsk during heavy fighting between Ukrainian and Russian troops The head of the Severodonetsk state district, in the Luhansk region, says the city is ""the hottest spot in Ukraine right now"". Speaking to the BBC, Roman Vlasenk says Russia has ""thrown everything at it"". Delays to military aid from Europe and the US, such as anti-tank weapons, is a particular problem, he adds, with civilian evacuation and humanitarian aid delivery impossible. In terms of personnel on the ground, Vlasenko says they have parity with Russia. However, he says Russia ""has more aviation and artillery"" which is preventing them from being able to defend against Russian forces or launch counter-offensives. More now on reports of a chemical explosion in Severodonetsk. A container with
chemicals has been blown up at the Azot chemical works in the city, the Russian news agency TASS says. It quotes the âambassadorâ of the self-proclaimed Luhansk Peopleâs Republic Rodion Miroshnik, writing on his Telegram channel, that a container ""has been blown up"", and the plant ""is still controlled by the Ukrainian regimeâs armed units"". The plant is one of Ukraineâs biggest chemical works, and pre-war, it has been employing around 7,000 people, according to TASS. It's thought to manufacture acetic acid, methanol and vinyl
acetate. Pictures posted to Serhiy Haidai's Telegram appear to show a large pink cloud over the city Local residents in the frontline city of Severodonetsk, in Luhansk, have been warned not to leave bomb shelters and urged to prepare masks to protect themselves against toxic fumes. A nitric acid tank has been hit by a Russian airstrike, Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai has said on messaging app Telegram. He also posted photos of a large pink cloud over residential buildings in the city. The key eastern city of Severodonetsk has seen intense fighting in recent days as Russian forces attempt to capture the city. Itâs
just gone 8pm in Severodonetsk, the eastern Ukrainian city in the Donbas region
that is coming under extreme bombardment by Russian forces. In
Tuesday's evening report, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forceswrote on Facebook,externalthat âthe battle continuesâ. âThe enemy is trying to establish complete
control overâ¦ Severodonetsk and surround [Ukrainian forces]â, the post reads.â The region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai, also gave an update. ""Most of Severodonetsk is controlled by the
Russians. The city is not surrounded,"" hewrote on Telegram,external. ""The city's critical infrastructure has been
destroyed by almost 100%, 90% of the housing stock has been damaged, 60% of
which is critical, ie. it cannot be restored,"" he said. Earlier, he told the BBC that the
evacuation of civilians has been halted because of the heavy shelling and
up to 15,000 people may still be trapped in the city. Getting humanitarian aid in is also ""impossible"" he said. Read more on the relentless attack on Severodonetsk here. Ukrainian soldier with anti-tank weapon A former defence minister to Ukraine has said his country can win the war with more weapons from the West. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,"" Andriy Zagorodnyuk told the BBC. He said Russian forces were ""at maximum capacity"" and were throwing everything at the fight in the Donbas. ""They're bringing all their equipment and so on - and so currently they are at maximum of their capacity, maximum of their capability."" ""Ukraine is definitely not changing our strategy. We are absolutely determined to win. We know that we can. We know that our army is much more efficient and effective than Russia's. ""The only thing we need is to re-equip ourselves with additional weapons and we can do this."" Damien McGuinnessReporting from Berlin German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has announced his country will allow modern German-made tanks to backfill Soviet-era tanks sent from Greece to Ukraine. Berlin already has similar deals with a number of countries that have Soviet-era tanks, which can be used by Ukrainian soldiers straight away without training. So far, Germany has struck such deals with Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland. Germany is also training Ukrainian soldiers in Germany on modern heavy weapons, which will then be delivered to Ukraine. German ministers say Berlin is delivering a lot of weapons to Ukraine and dispute the impression abroad that Germany is not doing enough. But some ministers and leading politicians within the government accept deliveries are slower and more complicated than originally hoped. There is growing pressure in Germany for deliveries to be sped up, to be more transparent and better organised. Ukraine's prosecutor-general Iryna Venediktova (L) held a news conference earlier alongside Khan (R) Earlier we told you that Ukraine's chief prosecutor had said her officials had identified more than 600 Russian war crime suspects and had started prosecuting around 80 of them. Iryna Vanediktova had been meeting the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan, and the pair gave a news briefing afterwards. Karim described Ukraine as a crime scene, and said the tribunal was carrying out its largest ever investigation there, with plans to open an office in Kyiv in the next few weeks. As things currently stand, the ICC canât prosecute the crime of aggression because neither Russia nor Ukraine are in its list of members. However, the court is taking part in a joint investigation alongside Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania. Russia withdrew from - and stopped recognising - the ICC in 2016 after the court published a report classifyingthe annexation of Crimea, in Ukraine, as an occupation. Nearly seven million people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February, latest figures show. More than half of them - 3.6 million - have fled to neighbouring Poland, while nearly one million have relocated to Romania and Russia respectively. Some of those who fled Ukraine, have returned home or to different parts of their country. By Olga Ivshina and Olga Prosvirova, BBC News Russian UK intelligence estimates 15,000 Russian soldiers have died in the conflict so far BBC News Russian has compiled a list naming 3,052 Russian soldiers who have been killed in the current war in Ukraine. The list is part of an ongoing investigation into the number and nature of Russian losses and is based on open sources, as well conversations with the families of those killed. BBC journalists discovered fresh graves at 11 cemeteries located in different parts of Russia. Not all of them were marked as soldiers who died fighting in Ukraine, but the photographs of men in uniform, as well as wreaths bearing ribbons inscribed with 'From the Ministry of Defence' are tell-tale signs. There is a continuing trend of a high proportion of officers among those killed - around 20%. The findings match claims made by UK intelligence services, who stated this week that Russia was bearing âcrushing lossesâ among junior and senior officers. Russia's most recent casualty figures, released by Moscow on 25 March, claim 1,351 soldiers have been killed so far in the conflict. Meanwhile UK intelligence estimates that, by the end of May, Russia had lost around 15,000 soldiers, while Ukraine puts the figure at around 30,000 killed. As we've been reporting, the European Union has agreed to block all imports of Russian oil arriving by sea by the end of the year. However, the EU will continue temporarily to allow imports by pipeline because Hungary imports 65% of oil via Russian pipelines and says its economy could not take the hit if that stopped. Two other countries which import large amounts of Russian oil by pipeline, Germany and Poland, say they will stop doing so by the end of this year. The EU says, overall, the new measures will cut oil imports from Russia by up to 90%. Russia accounted for just8% of UK oil imports in 2020,external. The UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. Read more about the world's reliance on Russian oil and gashere. Â© 2025 BBC.

However, the EU will continue temporarily to allow imports by pipeline because Hungary imports 65% of oil via Russian pipelines and says its economy could not take the hit if that stopped. Two other countries which import large amounts of Russian oil by pipeline, Germany and Poland, say they will stop doing so by the end of this year. The EU says, overall, the new measures will cut oil imports from Russia by up to 90%. Russia accounted for just8% of UK oil imports in 2020,external. The UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. Read more about the world's reliance on Russian oil and gashere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Watch: Fans shared videos showing pepper spray being deployed and children crying in Paris France has hit out at what it says was ""industrial-scale"" ticket fraud at Saturday's Champions League final amid a row over the game's policing. Ministers acknowledged difficulties in managing crowds at the final in Paris, but say organised fraud was the root cause of the problems. Liverpool ticket-holders were seen waiting in huge queues, with French police later using tear gas on crowds. The treatment of fans was ""an absolute disgrace,"" one Liverpool fan said. Tom Whitehurst said he had to get his disabled son ""out of the way"" after they were pepper-sprayed. ""[Fans] were indiscriminately pepper-sprayed and there were people with tickets, who arrived two-and-a-half hours early, who were queuing up and they were charged at by riot police with shields."" Another supporter, Michael Carter, told the BBC people further back in the queue ""were lifting each other up and over the walls because they were being crushed"". The BBC's sports journalist Nick Parrott, who was in Paris, said ""it was the most petrifying experience I've ever had at a football match"". He tweeted that locals were ""trying to force their way in leading to security closing the gates and keeping out legitimate fans with tickets"". Amid a chorus of criticism from the UK, the French sports ministry has been meeting Europe's football governing body Uefa, the French Football Association and stadium officials and police to ""draw lessons"" from the event. Uefa has now commissioned an independent report into the events surrounding the match. The French sports ministry also commissioned its own summary report, due within 10 days. France's interior and sports ministers have been pointing blame for the chaos at fans with fake tickets and local youths trying to force their way into the stadium. How the Champion's League Final trouble unfolded UK urges investigation into Paris football chaos France blames ticket fraud as police row rages Interior minister GÃ©rald Darmanin said ""massive, industrial-scale"" ticket fraud had caused Liverpool fans to turn up en masse, and said that of about 30 arrests made at the Stade de France ""more than half concerned British citizens"". He stated that there had been 30,000 to 40,000 Liverpool fans with fake tickets or without tickets outside the stadium. Mr Darmanin also defended the police's actions, stating that ""the decisions taken prevented deaths or serious injury"". ""We regret a disorganisation in the admission of British supporters,"" he said. Speaking earlier on French radio, sports minister AmÃ©lie OudÃ©a-CastÃ©ra said there were ""no problems"" regarding Real supporters and the Spanish side had controlled their travelling fans better than Liverpool. But a spokesperson for France's independent police commissioner's union (SICP), Mathieu Valet, told the BBC's Newshour that ""supporters without tickets or with fake tickets... were not the main problem."" ""It's clear that we needed more police - we didn't have enough on the ground,"" he added. So the French government recognises that the policing was at times heavy-handed, and that the difficulties getting fans from the train station should have been predicted after a strike. But it insists that there would have been none of the chaos without the presence of ""30-40,000"" ticketless Liverpool supporters. All of this will have to be verified. If it is true that seven out of ten tickets checked at the first perimeter turned out to be fraudulent, then that does indeed suggest a scam of monumental proportions - enough to render useless even the best-laid policing plans. But plenty of people - French as well as British - who were there on Saturday night question the government's version. They wonder if blaming Liverpool isn't a convenient way of shucking off responsibility closer to home. And if there were 30-40,000 ticketless people milling around the stadium as the match got under way, how come that is not what journalists remember seeing? That number of disappointed and aimless fans don't just disappear. Liverpool fans are angry with the French, and with UEFA for blaming them for the disastrous evening. The chaos will probably turn out to have multiple causes. But from the French point of view,  pointing the finger at convenient foreign scapegoats would be particularly short-sighted. A spokesman for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson described footage from the Stade de France at the weekend as ""deeply upsetting and concerning"" and called for a full investigation. Uefa initially blamed the ""late arrival"" of fans for the problems. But Merseyside police, who are responsible for policing in Liverpool and were present in Paris, said the vast majority of Liverpool fans arrived early at the turnstiles and behaved in an ""exemplary manner"". Saturday's TV footage showed young men who did not appear to be wearing red Liverpool shirts jumping the stadium gates and then running away from security. Liverpool fans spoke of long queues building up hours before the match started, and the final was delayed by 35 minutes by the trouble outside the stadium. The chaos continued after the match ended. One Real Madrid supporter, Antonio CastaÃ±o, told the BBC there were ""organised groups robbing people, harassing them, breaking car windows, it was absolute chaos. ""I've been to games in Liverpool, Munich, Milan, London, Cardiff, to Russia. I've never seen anything like this,"" he said. ""There weren't enough police, there weren't enough resources and there wasn't enough respect for the fans. We were left high and dry, both the Spanish fans and the English ones.""

"Authorities in Shanghai have announced that some Covid-19 lockdown measures imposed on businesses will be lifted from Wednesday. Plans have also been introduced to support the city's economy, which has been hit hard by the restrictions. The commercial centre has been under a strict lockdown for almost two months. Meanwhile, China's capital Beijing has reopened parts of its public transport system as well as some shopping malls and other venues as infections ease. The announcement in Shanghai came as official figures showed on Sunday that new daily coronavirus cases fell to 122 from 170 over the previous 24 hours. Officials said guidelines to curb the spread of Covid-19 and control the number of people returning to work will be revised. The move will see ""unreasonable restrictions"" being lifted on restarting work and production at companies, vice mayor Wu Qing told a news briefing. Companies will no longer need to be on a ""whitelist"" to resume production starting from 1 June. Why is Shanghai in a lockdown? China unemployment rate near pandemic peak Shanghai moves to impose tightest restrictions yet The announcement came as the city launched a 50-point plan aimed at revitalising Shanghai's economy, which before the lockdown was worth more than $600bn (Â£475bn). The new measures included reducing some taxes for car buyers, speeding up the issuance of local government bonds, and fast-tracking approvals of building projects. Under the plans, drivers who switch to an electric vehicle will be able claim a $1,500 subsidy. Additional help for businesses will include allowing firms to delay insurance and rent payments, as well as subsidies for utility charges. The measures are significant and will be widespread, but they are desperately needed. Most parts of this vast city ground to a halt for two months. It's beginning to change, but where I live the vast majority of shops are closed, the roads are very far from their usual constant hum and almost no-one is back at work, in the conventional sense. The lockdown crippled this city. The easing of restrictions and the ""opening up"" that comes with it will likely be a gradual one, underpinned by caution. China needs its single biggest city, and the second biggest contributor to its economic growth, to get going. But remember too that the ruling Communist Party remains committed to 'zero Covid'. Banks will also be asked to renew loans to small and medium-sized businesses totalling $15bn this year. At the same time vouchers will be handed out to help support retailers and e-commerce platforms, particularly for businesses in the cultural, tourism and fitness industries. The latest moves aimed to revitalise the city's hard-hit economy come on top of measures rolled-out at the end of March. Shanghai is China's biggest city with a population of around 25 million and is a key financial, manufacturing and shipping hub. The lockdown has seen many of its residents lose income, struggle to find enough food and cope mentally with prolonged isolation. Manufacturers in Shanghai, including western car makers Volkswagen and Tesla, have been particularly impacted by the restrictions as staff were kept away from factories or had to work in so-called ""closed loop"" conditions, where they lived at the plants. Also on Sunday, authorities in Beijing eased curbs in several parts of the city after officials said the outbreak is now under control. Most of the capital's public transport system - including buses, trains and taxis - will resume in three districts including the central area of Chaoyang. Shopping malls and other venues have also been allowed to reopen in some parts of the city. Workers in two districts in the south west and north east of the city have also been allowed to return to work. However, tutoring businesses, Internet cafes and karaoke bars remained closed.

"People in Severodonetsk are warned not to leave bomb shelters and to prepare masks to protect against toxic fumes after a nitric acid tank is hit, the regional governor says Serhiy Haidai says much of the eastern Ukrainian city is now controlled by Russians Nearly all critical infrastructure and 90% of its housing is destroyed, he says There's been a shutdown of all communications in southern Kherson, officials say But in his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says forces have had some success there, and are advancing around Kharkiv EU leaders reach agreement to ban 90% of oil imports from Russia but are split over gas imports They met for a two-day summit in Brussels to discuss sanctions against Russia Moscow now occupies almost all of the Luhansk region, as it focuses on seizing the whole of Donbas in the east Edited by Claire Heald Thank you for joining our live coverage today. We'll leave you with the latest developments in the war in Ukraine:  Todayâs live page was edited by Chris Giles, Emma Owens,
Claire Heald and Tiffany Wertheimer. The writers were Alexandra FouchÃ©, Gareth
Evans, Jack Burgess, James Harness, Sam Hancock and Victoria Lindrea. Join us tomorrow. General David Petraeus Over 20,000 Russian troops may have been killed during the Ukraine conflict, says retired US General David Petraeus. This is ""many multiples of what they lost in nine years in
Afghanistan"", he says. Russia's last estimate of its troop losses was 1,351, given on 25 March. This war is approaching 100 days duration. Speaking to the BBC, he says he's not surprised by Ukraine's ability to repel Russian forces. Ukraine ""performed above even the highest of expectations most of us had"". On Russia's effectiveness in the war, Petraeus is very critical: ""No one predicted Russia's sheer incompetence, at every single level,"" he says. However, on Severodonetsk he is less upbeat about Ukraine's situation: ""At some point, the Ukrainians may have to withdraw to fight another day."" And Russia seizing the city would be significant in the psychological ""war of ideas"", says Petraeus. He is sceptical about Russia's offer to escort cargo ships of wheat out of Ukrainian ports. ""They said they would do that if we lift the sanctions
and there's no way that we're going to lift the sanctions,"" he says. And any idea of Western forces sending in ships to force a way through the Black Sea is ""dead on arrival"", he says, because "" you're going to sail into a direct conflict with Russia"". James WaterhouseReporting from Poltava Hlib Stryzhko suffered a broken pelvis and jaw when he came under attack from a Russian tank Hlib Stryzhko endured psychological torture and was denied medical treatment for a broken pelvis and jaw. Yet somehow, he made it home. In a hospital bed in the Ukrainian city of Poltava, he tried to sit up. The 25-year-old soldier's pelvis was supported by metal scaffolding - one of his many injuries sustained while trying to defend Mariupol, nearly 500km (310 miles) to the south. As his mother Olesya helped him he grimaced with pain, but seemed eager to share his story nevertheless. ""Turning my head, I saw that a tank was aimed at me,"" he recalled. ""When a tank fires, there is no time between exit and arrival. It happens instantaneously. I saw a bright flash."" Read the full story here. Ukrainian President Zelensky visiting frontline positions in Kharkiv on Sunday Ukraine's forces have had some success near the southern city of Kherson and are advancing in parts of the Kharkiv region to the east of Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says, Reuters reports. Zelensky praised his military's ""utmost courage"" and says they ""remain masters of the situation at the front"". The Ukrainian president did however say Russian forces have a ""significant advantage"" in terms or equipment and numbers. Ukrainian officials are reporting a ""shutdown of all communications"" in the Russian-occupied southern region of Kherson, Reuters reports. An unspecified intrusion ""by the occupation regime"" has taken place, with equipment powered down and cables disconnected, Ukraine's State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection has said, according to Reuters. This has left residents ""without Ukrainian mobile communication and Internet access"" and ""no means to make national and international phone calls using landline phone devices,"" the agency has reportedly said. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this. Smoke over Severodonetsk on Monday The 97th day of the war saw Ukrainian and Russian forces battling for control of the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which is said to be divided between the two sides. Up to 15,000 people may still be trapped there, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai has said. Both sides are suffering heavy casualties and the Ukrainian command may decide a tactical retreat would better serve their medium-term interests. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,""Ukrainian former Defence Minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk has told the BBC. Russia now occupies almost all of Luhansk, as it focuses on seizing it and neighbouring Donetsk.At least 3,052 of its soldiers have been killedsince the invasion began on 24 February, according to a list of names compiled by BBC News Russian. Read more on this story here. Anna HolliganBBC News, The Hague Today was described as âa
momentous dayâ by the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor, Karim
Khan. He was referring to
three new countries - Estonia,
Latvia and Slovakia -joining the joint investigation team (JIT), and what that represents for the
pursuit of justice. Khan was speaking at the
Eurojust â the EU agency for criminal justice â a lesser-known international
organisation at The Hague. Eurojust will ensure all
the evidence - from witness statements to forensic data - will be translated
into a language that will make it accessible for all prosecution teams. Khan told a news conference: We must join hands in the common interest of humanity.   And when Iryna Venediktova, Ukraineâs chief prosecutor, told journalists ""we are fighting for European values"", Khan interjected. ""These aren't European values we're protecting,â he said. âIt's important to emphasize the ICC is fighting for basic human standards in the 21st century."" The Azovstal steel plant was bombarded for months by Russian forces For months Ukrainian fighters in Mariupol's Azovstal steelworksprevented Russian forcesfrom taking full control of the besieged southern port city. BBC Monitoring reports Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, has rejected a Russian statement claiming about 150 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found rigged with explosives at the steel plant. Andryushchenko has said the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, earlier reported some Ukrainian fighters were found alive at Azovstal. The Russian Defence Ministry said 152 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found in an inoperative refrigerated van and four mines were planted under the bodies. According to the ministry's spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, Ukrainian POWs from the Azov regiment said the van was set up on orders from Kyiv. The Russian side plans to hand over the bodies to Ukraine in the near future, Konashenkov has been quoted as saying by the separatist website Donetsk News Agency. This video can not be played Russia's Defence Ministry released video of a cargo ship leaving Mariupol's port Russian naval vessels have escorted the first cargo ship to leave the Port of Mariupol since Russia took control of the area. In footage released by the Russian Defence Ministry, artillery boats can be seen flanking the ship as it left the port, reportedly carrying metal in its hold. It's the first ship to enter and then leave the port, on the Sea of Azov, since the fighting in Mariupol ended. Earlier, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the Russian Navy is ready to provide safe passage to ships transporting grain currently stuck in Ukraine's ports - if Ukraine clears coastal waters of mines. Lavrov said: ""If this de-mining problem is solved... the Russian Federation will ensure the unhindered passage of these ships to the Mediterranean Sea and further to their destinations."" The explosion of a nitric acid container in Severodonetsk is thought to have been caused by an airstrike, Luhansk's regional governor Serhiy Haidai says. âThere
was allegedly an airstrike on the chemical plant in Severodonetsk which hit
the tank with the remains of nitric acid"", he says. He tells the BBC toxic fumes were released into the air. Based on a previous chemical leak, he predicts there might be a threat to people within a 400-metre range of the explosion. Outside of that range, people might experience some eye irritation, he says. At the moment there is no possibility of evacuating any of the 15,000 residents who remain in Severodonetsk - as it comes under sustained attack from Russians, he says. ""Russians provide no humanitarian corridors,"" he says. ""Seventy to eighty percent of the city is controlled by the Russian army. The neighbouring city of Lysychansk is
under the full control of Ukraineâ, he adds. Smoke rises in Severodonetsk during heavy fighting between Ukrainian and Russian troops The head of the Severodonetsk state district, in the Luhansk region, says the city is ""the hottest spot in Ukraine right now"". Speaking to the BBC, Roman Vlasenk says Russia has ""thrown everything at it"". Delays to military aid from Europe and the US, such as anti-tank weapons, is a particular problem, he adds, with civilian evacuation and humanitarian aid delivery impossible. In terms of personnel on the ground, Vlasenko says they have parity with Russia. However, he says Russia ""has more aviation and artillery"" which is preventing them from being able to defend against Russian forces or launch counter-offensives. More now on reports of a chemical explosion in Severodonetsk. A container with
chemicals has been blown up at the Azot chemical works in the city, the Russian news agency TASS says. It quotes the âambassadorâ of the self-proclaimed Luhansk Peopleâs Republic Rodion Miroshnik, writing on his Telegram channel, that a container ""has been blown up"", and the plant ""is still controlled by the Ukrainian regimeâs armed units"". The plant is one of Ukraineâs biggest chemical works, and pre-war, it has been employing around 7,000 people, according to TASS. It's thought to manufacture acetic acid, methanol and vinyl
acetate. Pictures posted to Serhiy Haidai's Telegram appear to show a large pink cloud over the city Local residents in the frontline city of Severodonetsk, in Luhansk, have been warned not to leave bomb shelters and urged to prepare masks to protect themselves against toxic fumes. A nitric acid tank has been hit by a Russian airstrike, Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai has said on messaging app Telegram. He also posted photos of a large pink cloud over residential buildings in the city. The key eastern city of Severodonetsk has seen intense fighting in recent days as Russian forces attempt to capture the city. Itâs
just gone 8pm in Severodonetsk, the eastern Ukrainian city in the Donbas region
that is coming under extreme bombardment by Russian forces. In
Tuesday's evening report, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forceswrote on Facebook,externalthat âthe battle continuesâ. âThe enemy is trying to establish complete
control overâ¦ Severodonetsk and surround [Ukrainian forces]â, the post reads.â The region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai, also gave an update. ""Most of Severodonetsk is controlled by the
Russians. The city is not surrounded,"" hewrote on Telegram,external. ""The city's critical infrastructure has been
destroyed by almost 100%, 90% of the housing stock has been damaged, 60% of
which is critical, ie. it cannot be restored,"" he said. Earlier, he told the BBC that the
evacuation of civilians has been halted because of the heavy shelling and
up to 15,000 people may still be trapped in the city. Getting humanitarian aid in is also ""impossible"" he said. Read more on the relentless attack on Severodonetsk here. Ukrainian soldier with anti-tank weapon A former defence minister to Ukraine has said his country can win the war with more weapons from the West. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,"" Andriy Zagorodnyuk told the BBC. He said Russian forces were ""at maximum capacity"" and were throwing everything at the fight in the Donbas. ""They're bringing all their equipment and so on - and so currently they are at maximum of their capacity, maximum of their capability."" ""Ukraine is definitely not changing our strategy. We are absolutely determined to win. We know that we can. We know that our army is much more efficient and effective than Russia's. ""The only thing we need is to re-equip ourselves with additional weapons and we can do this."" Damien McGuinnessReporting from Berlin German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has announced his country will allow modern German-made tanks to backfill Soviet-era tanks sent from Greece to Ukraine. Berlin already has similar deals with a number of countries that have Soviet-era tanks, which can be used by Ukrainian soldiers straight away without training. So far, Germany has struck such deals with Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland. Germany is also training Ukrainian soldiers in Germany on modern heavy weapons, which will then be delivered to Ukraine. German ministers say Berlin is delivering a lot of weapons to Ukraine and dispute the impression abroad that Germany is not doing enough. But some ministers and leading politicians within the government accept deliveries are slower and more complicated than originally hoped. There is growing pressure in Germany for deliveries to be sped up, to be more transparent and better organised. Ukraine's prosecutor-general Iryna Venediktova (L) held a news conference earlier alongside Khan (R) Earlier we told you that Ukraine's chief prosecutor had said her officials had identified more than 600 Russian war crime suspects and had started prosecuting around 80 of them. Iryna Vanediktova had been meeting the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan, and the pair gave a news briefing afterwards. Karim described Ukraine as a crime scene, and said the tribunal was carrying out its largest ever investigation there, with plans to open an office in Kyiv in the next few weeks. As things currently stand, the ICC canât prosecute the crime of aggression because neither Russia nor Ukraine are in its list of members. However, the court is taking part in a joint investigation alongside Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania. Russia withdrew from - and stopped recognising - the ICC in 2016 after the court published a report classifyingthe annexation of Crimea, in Ukraine, as an occupation. Nearly seven million people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February, latest figures show. More than half of them - 3.6 million - have fled to neighbouring Poland, while nearly one million have relocated to Romania and Russia respectively. Some of those who fled Ukraine, have returned home or to different parts of their country. By Olga Ivshina and Olga Prosvirova, BBC News Russian UK intelligence estimates 15,000 Russian soldiers have died in the conflict so far BBC News Russian has compiled a list naming 3,052 Russian soldiers who have been killed in the current war in Ukraine. The list is part of an ongoing investigation into the number and nature of Russian losses and is based on open sources, as well conversations with the families of those killed. BBC journalists discovered fresh graves at 11 cemeteries located in different parts of Russia. Not all of them were marked as soldiers who died fighting in Ukraine, but the photographs of men in uniform, as well as wreaths bearing ribbons inscribed with 'From the Ministry of Defence' are tell-tale signs. There is a continuing trend of a high proportion of officers among those killed - around 20%. The findings match claims made by UK intelligence services, who stated this week that Russia was bearing âcrushing lossesâ among junior and senior officers. Russia's most recent casualty figures, released by Moscow on 25 March, claim 1,351 soldiers have been killed so far in the conflict. Meanwhile UK intelligence estimates that, by the end of May, Russia had lost around 15,000 soldiers, while Ukraine puts the figure at around 30,000 killed. As we've been reporting, the European Union has agreed to block all imports of Russian oil arriving by sea by the end of the year. However, the EU will continue temporarily to allow imports by pipeline because Hungary imports 65% of oil via Russian pipelines and says its economy could not take the hit if that stopped. Two other countries which import large amounts of Russian oil by pipeline, Germany and Poland, say they will stop doing so by the end of this year. The EU says, overall, the new measures will cut oil imports from Russia by up to 90%. Russia accounted for just8% of UK oil imports in 2020,external.

"Coventry was crowned UK City of Culture 2021, and has seen many benefits On Tuesday Wrexham will find out if it has been chosen as the UK City of Culture for 2025. It is competing against Bradford, County Durham and Southampton for the title - which can be worth hundreds of millions of pounds in investment. A recent drone display over current holder Coventry showed a city rising phoenix-like from tough economic times. And that is what the project aims to do - bring communities together, tap into creativity and attract investment.

One thousand people took part in the This is the City parade to mark Coventry's final month as the UK City of Culture Research into the value of such events both in the UK and Europe has found that they work best when they help projects grow even after their year in the spotlight ends. Coventry looks set to be one of those, according to Dr Franco Bianchini, an associate director of the Centre for Cultural Value at Leeds University. ""I think it's a very good example of a new type of City of Culture programme,"" he said. ""They have paid much more attention to projects in the community and projects that are going to last and have a legacy. It's not perfect but it's really a step in the right direction."" Femi Dokunmu runs a music studio in Coventry and thinks the title has brought the city ""into the light"" Being host city has brought a boost for some like Femi Dokunmu, who runs a music studio. ""With music being a big part of culture I've been working with a lot of youth foundations trying to bring people together to work with the whole City of Culture and hopefully bring Coventry more into the light,"" he said. Larna Andrew has said projects made possible by City of Culture status have been a big positive for young people in Coventry Larna Andrews works for Positive Youth Foundation, a project supporting young people, and she says City of Culture has laid the groundwork for future success. ""Through all the different events in the city it means that our young people have had volunteering opportunities, they've had paid placements and also exposure which I think is so important. ""It doesn't stop here: young people continuously need our support and we're ensuring that every project we put on has that quality and longevity as well."" BBC reporter Ushma Mistry said many City of Culture events have been a ""huge success"" Ushma Mistry, who has covered many of the events for BBC Coventry & Warwickshire Radio, said although some events were hampered by the pandemic, many have been a huge success, like a parade last June. ""We've got a big Irish community here so there was Irish dancing, ska dancers from the big Caribbean community and Bollywood dancers from the Indian community,"" she said. ""People were going about their business - shopping or doing their normal errands - and all of a sudden something would happen either outside their front door on the high street."" Coventry will soon pass the baton to its successor, but it aims to remain a vibrant part of the UK's cultural life.

"People in Severodonetsk are warned not to leave bomb shelters and to prepare masks to protect against toxic fumes after a nitric acid tank is hit, the regional governor says Serhiy Haidai says much of the eastern Ukrainian city is now controlled by Russians Nearly all critical infrastructure and 90% of its housing is destroyed, he says There's been a shutdown of all communications in southern Kherson, officials say But in his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says forces have had some success there, and are advancing around Kharkiv EU leaders reach agreement to ban 90% of oil imports from Russia but are split over gas imports They met for a two-day summit in Brussels to discuss sanctions against Russia Moscow now occupies almost all of the Luhansk region, as it focuses on seizing the whole of Donbas in the east Edited by Claire Heald Thank you for joining our live coverage today. We'll leave you with the latest developments in the war in Ukraine:  Todayâs live page was edited by Chris Giles, Emma Owens,
Claire Heald and Tiffany Wertheimer. The writers were Alexandra FouchÃ©, Gareth
Evans, Jack Burgess, James Harness, Sam Hancock and Victoria Lindrea. Join us tomorrow. General David Petraeus Over 20,000 Russian troops may have been killed during the Ukraine conflict, says retired US General David Petraeus. This is ""many multiples of what they lost in nine years in
Afghanistan"", he says. Russia's last estimate of its troop losses was 1,351, given on 25 March. This war is approaching 100 days duration. Speaking to the BBC, he says he's not surprised by Ukraine's ability to repel Russian forces. Ukraine ""performed above even the highest of expectations most of us had"". On Russia's effectiveness in the war, Petraeus is very critical: ""No one predicted Russia's sheer incompetence, at every single level,"" he says. However, on Severodonetsk he is less upbeat about Ukraine's situation: ""At some point, the Ukrainians may have to withdraw to fight another day."" And Russia seizing the city would be significant in the psychological ""war of ideas"", says Petraeus. He is sceptical about Russia's offer to escort cargo ships of wheat out of Ukrainian ports. ""They said they would do that if we lift the sanctions
and there's no way that we're going to lift the sanctions,"" he says. And any idea of Western forces sending in ships to force a way through the Black Sea is ""dead on arrival"", he says, because "" you're going to sail into a direct conflict with Russia"". James WaterhouseReporting from Poltava Hlib Stryzhko suffered a broken pelvis and jaw when he came under attack from a Russian tank Hlib Stryzhko endured psychological torture and was denied medical treatment for a broken pelvis and jaw. Yet somehow, he made it home. In a hospital bed in the Ukrainian city of Poltava, he tried to sit up. The 25-year-old soldier's pelvis was supported by metal scaffolding - one of his many injuries sustained while trying to defend Mariupol, nearly 500km (310 miles) to the south. As his mother Olesya helped him he grimaced with pain, but seemed eager to share his story nevertheless. ""Turning my head, I saw that a tank was aimed at me,"" he recalled. ""When a tank fires, there is no time between exit and arrival. It happens instantaneously. I saw a bright flash."" Read the full story here. Ukrainian President Zelensky visiting frontline positions in Kharkiv on Sunday Ukraine's forces have had some success near the southern city of Kherson and are advancing in parts of the Kharkiv region to the east of Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says, Reuters reports. Zelensky praised his military's ""utmost courage"" and says they ""remain masters of the situation at the front"". The Ukrainian president did however say Russian forces have a ""significant advantage"" in terms or equipment and numbers. Ukrainian officials are reporting a ""shutdown of all communications"" in the Russian-occupied southern region of Kherson, Reuters reports. An unspecified intrusion ""by the occupation regime"" has taken place, with equipment powered down and cables disconnected, Ukraine's State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection has said, according to Reuters. This has left residents ""without Ukrainian mobile communication and Internet access"" and ""no means to make national and international phone calls using landline phone devices,"" the agency has reportedly said. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this. Smoke over Severodonetsk on Monday The 97th day of the war saw Ukrainian and Russian forces battling for control of the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which is said to be divided between the two sides. Up to 15,000 people may still be trapped there, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai has said. Both sides are suffering heavy casualties and the Ukrainian command may decide a tactical retreat would better serve their medium-term interests. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,""Ukrainian former Defence Minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk has told the BBC. Russia now occupies almost all of Luhansk, as it focuses on seizing it and neighbouring Donetsk.At least 3,052 of its soldiers have been killedsince the invasion began on 24 February, according to a list of names compiled by BBC News Russian. Read more on this story here. Anna HolliganBBC News, The Hague Today was described as âa
momentous dayâ by the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor, Karim
Khan. He was referring to
three new countries - Estonia,
Latvia and Slovakia -joining the joint investigation team (JIT), and what that represents for the
pursuit of justice. Khan was speaking at the
Eurojust â the EU agency for criminal justice â a lesser-known international
organisation at The Hague. Eurojust will ensure all
the evidence - from witness statements to forensic data - will be translated
into a language that will make it accessible for all prosecution teams. Khan told a news conference: We must join hands in the common interest of humanity.   And when Iryna Venediktova, Ukraineâs chief prosecutor, told journalists ""we are fighting for European values"", Khan interjected. ""These aren't European values we're protecting,â he said. âIt's important to emphasize the ICC is fighting for basic human standards in the 21st century."" The Azovstal steel plant was bombarded for months by Russian forces For months Ukrainian fighters in Mariupol's Azovstal steelworksprevented Russian forcesfrom taking full control of the besieged southern port city. BBC Monitoring reports Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, has rejected a Russian statement claiming about 150 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found rigged with explosives at the steel plant. Andryushchenko has said the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, earlier reported some Ukrainian fighters were found alive at Azovstal. The Russian Defence Ministry said 152 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found in an inoperative refrigerated van and four mines were planted under the bodies. According to the ministry's spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, Ukrainian POWs from the Azov regiment said the van was set up on orders from Kyiv. The Russian side plans to hand over the bodies to Ukraine in the near future, Konashenkov has been quoted as saying by the separatist website Donetsk News Agency. This video can not be played Russia's Defence Ministry released video of a cargo ship leaving Mariupol's port Russian naval vessels have escorted the first cargo ship to leave the Port of Mariupol since Russia took control of the area. In footage released by the Russian Defence Ministry, artillery boats can be seen flanking the ship as it left the port, reportedly carrying metal in its hold. It's the first ship to enter and then leave the port, on the Sea of Azov, since the fighting in Mariupol ended. Earlier, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the Russian Navy is ready to provide safe passage to ships transporting grain currently stuck in Ukraine's ports - if Ukraine clears coastal waters of mines. Lavrov said: ""If this de-mining problem is solved... the Russian Federation will ensure the unhindered passage of these ships to the Mediterranean Sea and further to their destinations."" The explosion of a nitric acid container in Severodonetsk is thought to have been caused by an airstrike, Luhansk's regional governor Serhiy Haidai says. âThere
was allegedly an airstrike on the chemical plant in Severodonetsk which hit
the tank with the remains of nitric acid"", he says. He tells the BBC toxic fumes were released into the air. Based on a previous chemical leak, he predicts there might be a threat to people within a 400-metre range of the explosion. Outside of that range, people might experience some eye irritation, he says. At the moment there is no possibility of evacuating any of the 15,000 residents who remain in Severodonetsk - as it comes under sustained attack from Russians, he says. ""Russians provide no humanitarian corridors,"" he says. ""Seventy to eighty percent of the city is controlled by the Russian army. The neighbouring city of Lysychansk is
under the full control of Ukraineâ, he adds. Smoke rises in Severodonetsk during heavy fighting between Ukrainian and Russian troops The head of the Severodonetsk state district, in the Luhansk region, says the city is ""the hottest spot in Ukraine right now"". Speaking to the BBC, Roman Vlasenk says Russia has ""thrown everything at it"". Delays to military aid from Europe and the US, such as anti-tank weapons, is a particular problem, he adds, with civilian evacuation and humanitarian aid delivery impossible. In terms of personnel on the ground, Vlasenko says they have parity with Russia. However, he says Russia ""has more aviation and artillery"" which is preventing them from being able to defend against Russian forces or launch counter-offensives. More now on reports of a chemical explosion in Severodonetsk. A container with
chemicals has been blown up at the Azot chemical works in the city, the Russian news agency TASS says. It quotes the âambassadorâ of the self-proclaimed Luhansk Peopleâs Republic Rodion Miroshnik, writing on his Telegram channel, that a container ""has been blown up"", and the plant ""is still controlled by the Ukrainian regimeâs armed units"". The plant is one of Ukraineâs biggest chemical works, and pre-war, it has been employing around 7,000 people, according to TASS. It's thought to manufacture acetic acid, methanol and vinyl
acetate. Pictures posted to Serhiy Haidai's Telegram appear to show a large pink cloud over the city Local residents in the frontline city of Severodonetsk, in Luhansk, have been warned not to leave bomb shelters and urged to prepare masks to protect themselves against toxic fumes. A nitric acid tank has been hit by a Russian airstrike, Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai has said on messaging app Telegram. He also posted photos of a large pink cloud over residential buildings in the city. The key eastern city of Severodonetsk has seen intense fighting in recent days as Russian forces attempt to capture the city. Itâs
just gone 8pm in Severodonetsk, the eastern Ukrainian city in the Donbas region
that is coming under extreme bombardment by Russian forces. In
Tuesday's evening report, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forceswrote on Facebook,externalthat âthe battle continuesâ. âThe enemy is trying to establish complete
control overâ¦ Severodonetsk and surround [Ukrainian forces]â, the post reads.â The region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai, also gave an update. ""Most of Severodonetsk is controlled by the
Russians. The city is not surrounded,"" hewrote on Telegram,external. ""The city's critical infrastructure has been
destroyed by almost 100%, 90% of the housing stock has been damaged, 60% of
which is critical, ie. it cannot be restored,"" he said. Earlier, he told the BBC that the
evacuation of civilians has been halted because of the heavy shelling and
up to 15,000 people may still be trapped in the city. Getting humanitarian aid in is also ""impossible"" he said. Read more on the relentless attack on Severodonetsk here. Ukrainian soldier with anti-tank weapon A former defence minister to Ukraine has said his country can win the war with more weapons from the West. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,"" Andriy Zagorodnyuk told the BBC. He said Russian forces were ""at maximum capacity"" and were throwing everything at the fight in the Donbas. ""They're bringing all their equipment and so on - and so currently they are at maximum of their capacity, maximum of their capability."" ""Ukraine is definitely not changing our strategy. We are absolutely determined to win. We know that we can. We know that our army is much more efficient and effective than Russia's. ""The only thing we need is to re-equip ourselves with additional weapons and we can do this."" Damien McGuinnessReporting from Berlin German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has announced his country will allow modern German-made tanks to backfill Soviet-era tanks sent from Greece to Ukraine. Berlin already has similar deals with a number of countries that have Soviet-era tanks, which can be used by Ukrainian soldiers straight away without training. So far, Germany has struck such deals with Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland. Germany is also training Ukrainian soldiers in Germany on modern heavy weapons, which will then be delivered to Ukraine. German ministers say Berlin is delivering a lot of weapons to Ukraine and dispute the impression abroad that Germany is not doing enough. But some ministers and leading politicians within the government accept deliveries are slower and more complicated than originally hoped. There is growing pressure in Germany for deliveries to be sped up, to be more transparent and better organised. Ukraine's prosecutor-general Iryna Venediktova (L) held a news conference earlier alongside Khan (R) Earlier we told you that Ukraine's chief prosecutor had said her officials had identified more than 600 Russian war crime suspects and had started prosecuting around 80 of them. Iryna Vanediktova had been meeting the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan, and the pair gave a news briefing afterwards. Karim described Ukraine as a crime scene, and said the tribunal was carrying out its largest ever investigation there, with plans to open an office in Kyiv in the next few weeks. As things currently stand, the ICC canât prosecute the crime of aggression because neither Russia nor Ukraine are in its list of members. However, the court is taking part in a joint investigation alongside Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania. Russia withdrew from - and stopped recognising - the ICC in 2016 after the court published a report classifyingthe annexation of Crimea, in Ukraine, as an occupation. Nearly seven million people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February, latest figures show. More than half of them - 3.6 million - have fled to neighbouring Poland, while nearly one million have relocated to Romania and Russia respectively. Some of those who fled Ukraine, have returned home or to different parts of their country. By Olga Ivshina and Olga Prosvirova, BBC News Russian UK intelligence estimates 15,000 Russian soldiers have died in the conflict so far BBC News Russian has compiled a list naming 3,052 Russian soldiers who have been killed in the current war in Ukraine. The list is part of an ongoing investigation into the number and nature of Russian losses and is based on open sources, as well conversations with the families of those killed. BBC journalists discovered fresh graves at 11 cemeteries located in different parts of Russia. Not all of them were marked as soldiers who died fighting in Ukraine, but the photographs of men in uniform, as well as wreaths bearing ribbons inscribed with 'From the Ministry of Defence' are tell-tale signs. There is a continuing trend of a high proportion of officers among those killed - around 20%. The findings match claims made by UK intelligence services, who stated this week that Russia was bearing âcrushing lossesâ among junior and senior officers. Russia's most recent casualty figures, released by Moscow on 25 March, claim 1,351 soldiers have been killed so far in the conflict. Meanwhile UK intelligence estimates that, by the end of May, Russia had lost around 15,000 soldiers, while Ukraine puts the figure at around 30,000 killed. As we've been reporting, the European Union has agreed to block all imports of Russian oil arriving by sea by the end of the year. However, the EU will continue temporarily to allow imports by pipeline because Hungary imports 65% of oil via Russian pipelines and says its economy could not take the hit if that stopped. Two other countries which import large amounts of Russian oil by pipeline, Germany and Poland, say they will stop doing so by the end of this year. The EU says, overall, the new measures will cut oil imports from Russia by up to 90%. Russia accounted for just8% of UK oil imports in 2020,external. The UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. Read more about the world's reliance on Russian oil and gashere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Authorities in Shanghai have announced that some Covid-19 lockdown measures imposed on businesses will be lifted from Wednesday. Plans have also been introduced to support the city's economy, which has been hit hard by the restrictions. The commercial centre has been under a strict lockdown for almost two months. Meanwhile, China's capital Beijing has reopened parts of its public transport system as well as some shopping malls and other venues as infections ease. The announcement in Shanghai came as official figures showed on Sunday that new daily coronavirus cases fell to 122 from 170 over the previous 24 hours. Officials said guidelines to curb the spread of Covid-19 and control the number of people returning to work will be revised. The move will see ""unreasonable restrictions"" being lifted on restarting work and production at companies, vice mayor Wu Qing told a news briefing. Companies will no longer need to be on a ""whitelist"" to resume production starting from 1 June. Why is Shanghai in a lockdown? China unemployment rate near pandemic peak Shanghai moves to impose tightest restrictions yet The announcement came as the city launched a 50-point plan aimed at revitalising Shanghai's economy, which before the lockdown was worth more than $600bn (Â£475bn). The new measures included reducing some taxes for car buyers, speeding up the issuance of local government bonds, and fast-tracking approvals of building projects. Under the plans, drivers who switch to an electric vehicle will be able claim a $1,500 subsidy. Additional help for businesses will include allowing firms to delay insurance and rent payments, as well as subsidies for utility charges. The measures are significant and will be widespread, but they are desperately needed. Most parts of this vast city ground to a halt for two months. It's beginning to change, but where I live the vast majority of shops are closed, the roads are very far from their usual constant hum and almost no-one is back at work, in the conventional sense. The lockdown crippled this city. The easing of restrictions and the ""opening up"" that comes with it will likely be a gradual one, underpinned by caution. China needs its single biggest city, and the second biggest contributor to its economic growth, to get going. But remember too that the ruling Communist Party remains committed to 'zero Covid'. Banks will also be asked to renew loans to small and medium-sized businesses totalling $15bn this year. At the same time vouchers will be handed out to help support retailers and e-commerce platforms, particularly for businesses in the cultural, tourism and fitness industries. The latest moves aimed to revitalise the city's hard-hit economy come on top of measures rolled-out at the end of March. Shanghai is China's biggest city with a population of around 25 million and is a key financial, manufacturing and shipping hub. The lockdown has seen many of its residents lose income, struggle to find enough food and cope mentally with prolonged isolation. Manufacturers in Shanghai, including western car makers Volkswagen and Tesla, have been particularly impacted by the restrictions as staff were kept away from factories or had to work in so-called ""closed loop"" conditions, where they lived at the plants. Also on Sunday, authorities in Beijing eased curbs in several parts of the city after officials said the outbreak is now under control. Most of the capital's public transport system - including buses, trains and taxis - will resume in three districts including the central area of Chaoyang. Shopping malls and other venues have also been allowed to reopen in some parts of the city. Workers in two districts in the south west and north east of the city have also been allowed to return to work. However, tutoring businesses, Internet cafes and karaoke bars remained closed.
