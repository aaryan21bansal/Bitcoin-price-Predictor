"The next few days are crucial in understanding the impact of Omicron on the NHS, a health boss has said. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents health trusts, said hospital admissions are rising across the country but what could happen next is unclear. He warned ministers ""must be ready to introduce new restrictions at pace if they're needed"". But the health secretary said any extra measures must be a ""last resort"". Writing on Twitter,external, Mr Hopson said staff were working ""flat out"" and the NHS was now under ""different, arguably more"" pressure compared to last January because more planned treatments were being carried out, the booster vaccination campaign was using up significant resources and staff absences were having a greater impact. England has reported 162,572 new cases - a record number for the fifth day in a row - as well as 154 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland did not report figures on Saturday. How can I tell I have Omicron? Who needs to self-isolate now and for how long? The number of hospital admissions in England are at their highest level since January 2021, according to the latest figures, while NHS hospital staff absences due to Covid have nearly doubled in a month. Mr Hopson said there was evidence infections peaked in London before Christmas and had plateaued since but the future trajectory ""remains very unclear"", ranging from hospital admissions plateauing and then dropping to numbers rapidly increasing. ""If the evidence shows that we are getting very significant numbers of people coming into hospital with Covid, then the government needs to be ready to introduce further restrictions at pace,"" he told the BBC. He said there were currently not the large numbers of severely ill older people that were seen in previous peaks and intensive care occupancy was broadly stable. However, he said there were worries about the possible impact of intergenerational mixing over Christmas. University Hospital of North Tees in Stocktonhas become the latest of more than a dozen hospitals to temporarily suspend routine visits because of rising infections. The doctors' union, the British Medical Association, has said further public health measures should be introduced as a matter or urgency. The association's council chairman, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, said it was ""wholly erroneous to talk about the risk of the NHS becoming overwhelmed"". The new year began with the health service ""already overwhelmed, in a parlous state, and with patient care suffering"", he said. Writing in the Daily Mail,external, Sajid Javid warned it was ""inevitable"" there would be a big increase in people needing NHS care over the next month due to the time lag between infections and hospital admissions. ""This will likely test the limits of finite NHS capacity even more than a typical winter,"" he added. The problem facing the government is that the window to suppress the peak with restrictions may already have passed. Modelling produced for government by Warwick University suggests even a return to lockdown with only schools open has virtually no impact on hospital admissions now. To have had a significant impact, measures would need to have been introduced on Boxing Day or a week earlier. But even then the argument for them was unclear - in both scenarios infections and hospital admissions rebound once restrictions are lifted. Largely all it achieves is delaying and spreading out illness. That could have been of benefit by evening out the pressure on the NHS. But there is, of course, the wider costs of restrictions to society, the economy and mental health to factor in. Some say it would also have bought you time to carry out more vaccinations, but with nine in 10 of the most vulnerable boosted and evidence protection wanes over time this may actually be the point in time when we have the most immunity across the population. There are no simple solutions to this Omicron wave - and the options that the government did have may well have gone. England is currently under Plan B restrictions, which includes mandatory masks in most indoor public places, Covid passes for nightclubs and other large venues and guidance to work from home if possible. The measures are set to expire six weeks after implementation, with a review after three weeks, which is expected on or close to 4 January. There are already tougher restrictionsfor hospitality venues in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. THE GREATEST JOURNEY OF THEM ALL:Can they really make it around the world in 80 days?

You may stillbe able to get free NHS tests,externalif you: have a health condition that makes you eligible for treatment if you test positive work in healthcare or a hospice You can buy a test for about Â£2 from High Street and online chemists, but cannot report these test results to the NHS. People are largely advised to treat Covid like any other respiratory disease. You no longer have to self-isolate after testing positive.

Those who have a high temperature or still feel unwell after five days are advised to stay home if they can until they: feel well enough for your normal activities no longer have a high temperature You don't have to tell your employer you have Covid. However, you are asked to avoid contact with others for five days, which means you should work from home if you can, especially if you have a high temperature.

"This video can not be played Watch: Tributes paid at state funeral for Archbishop Desmond Tutu The funeral mass for South African anti-apartheid campaigner Archbishop Desmond Tutu has taken place at the Anglican cathedral in Cape Town. Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize winner who helped end the racist regime in South Africa, died last Sunday aged 90. In his eulogy, President Cyril Ramaphosa described Tutu as ""the spiritual father of our new nation"". Tutu had insisted there should be no ""lavish spending"" on the funeral. He wanted ""the cheapest available coffin"". Family, friends, clergy and politicians were among those who gathered at St George's Cathedral for Saturday's service, which had limited numbers because of coronavirus restrictions. Tutu's widow Nomalizo Leah sat in a wheelchair at the front of the congregation wearing a purple shawl - the colour of her late husband's clerical robes. Tutu insisted that he be given ""the cheapest available coffin"" Tutu was one of the driving forces behind the movement to end the policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white minority government against the black majority in South Africa from 1948 until 1991. Desmond Tutu - South Africa's rebellious priest A time for new heroes after Desmond Tutu Archbishop Desmond Tutu: A life in pictures In the main eulogy at the official state funeral on Saturday, Mr Ramaphosa described the archbishop as a ""crusader in the struggle for freedom, for justice, for equality and for peace. Not only in South Africaâ¦ but around the world as well"". ""If we are to understand a global icon to be someone of great moral stature, of exceptional qualities, and of service to humanity there can be no doubt that it refers to the man we're laying to rest today,"" he said. About 100 people attended the funeral Saturday's funeral was given a special status, usually designated for presidents and very important people. Tutu had requested that the only flowers in the cathedral should be a ""bouquet of carnations from his family"", according to the Archbishop Tutu IP Trust and the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation. His ashes are to be interred behind the pulpit at St George's Cathedral - the Anglican diocese he served as Archbishop for 35 years. It was earlier revealed thatTutu is to be aquamated- a process using water that is described as an environmentally friendly alternative to cremation. Nomsa Maseko, BBC News, Cape Town Even though only 100 invited guests physically attended Archbishop Desmond Tutu's funeral service at the St George's cathedral, many turned up to honour him by watching proceedings from public viewing areas. Most were visibly emotional. One man described his attendance of Tutu's funeral as a full-circle moment because he also witnessed the release of Nelson Mandela from prison and watched Tutu and Mandela hold hands with their fists in the air as South Africa became a democracy. It's the end of an era. The last of South Africa's well-known freedom fighters leaves behind a difficult task for the leaders of the nation: to rid the country of corruption and racial divisions and lead the way forward, in the spirit of the moral compass which was the guiding force of Tutu's leadership. In a video message at the mass, the Archbishop of Canterbury described how Tutu ""lit up the world"". He said that his paying tribute to Tutu was ""like a mouse giving a tribute to an elephant"". Tutu's daughter said the outpouring of love for her father had ""warmed the cockles of our hearts"". ""Because we shared him with the world, you share part of the love you held for him with us,"" she said. Many people in Cape Town turned up to file past the archbishop's coffin as it lay in state. One man, Wally Mdluli, hitchhiked more than 1,000km (620 miles) across the country from Bloemfontein to Cape Town - enlisting the help of family and friends to pay for some of the trip and even sleeping at a petrol station on the way. ""I feel fulfilled after I saw the coffin. It's like his spirit is in me,"" he told the BBC's Nomsa Maseko in Cape Town. Tutu used his high profile to speak out against the oppression of black people in his home country, always saying his motives were religious and not political. After Nelson Mandela became South Africa's first black president in 1994, Tutu was appointed by him to a Truth and Reconciliation Commission set up to investigate crimes committed by both white and black people during the apartheid era. Tutu was awarded the Nobel prize in 1984 for his role in the struggle to abolish the apartheid system. He was also credited with coining the term Rainbow Nation to describe the ethnic mix of post-apartheid South Africa, but in his latter years he expressed regret that the nation had not coalesced in the way in which he had dreamt.

"A law allowing assisted suicide has taken effect in Austria. From Saturday, adults who are terminally ill or have a permanent, debilitating condition, can opt to make provisions for an assisted death. Parliament approved the new law in December, following a constitutional court ruling on the issue. The practice will be tightly regulated, with each case assessed by two doctors - one of whom would have to be a palliative medicine expert. Officials say the government has also allocated funds to develop palliative care to ensure no one chooses to die when other options are available. Assisted suicide, in which somebody is given the means to end their own life, is legal in neighbouring Switzerland. It's also been decriminalised in several European countries, including Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands. Active assistance to suicide will remain outlawed in Austria, and the new rules explicitly exclude minors or those with mental health conditions. Adults who want to end their lives must produce a diagnosis and have confirmation that they are able to make their own decisions. After gaining approval from two doctors, patients must wait for 12 weeks to reflect on their decision - or two weeks if they have a terminal illness. If they still want to go ahead after this waiting period, they can then get lethal drugs at a pharmacy after giving notification to a lawyer or notary. To prevent abuse, the names of pharmacies that sell these drugs will only be disclosed to lawyers and notaries who receive these notifications, and will not be advertised publicly. Until now, under Austrian law, anyone who induced or helped someone to kill themselves faced up to five years in prison. An absolute ban on assisted dying was lifted by a federal court last year, which ruled that it ""violated the right of self-determination"". But the same punishment will remain in place for those who kill another person at their ""serious and emphatic request"". Before the new rules were approved by parliament this year, some political opponents argued that it placed too many hurdles in the way of those seeking assisted dying. Others argued that too few restrictions were to be put in place, saying that a psychiatric evaluation was not enough to assess patients' decision-making ability.

"Li Jingwei was reunited with his mother on 1 January after he was sold into a child trafficking ring at four-years-old A Chinese man who was abducted over 30 years ago has been reunited with his biological mother after drawing a map of his childhood village from memory. Li Jingwei was just four years old when he was lured away from his home and sold into a child trafficking ring. On 24 December he shared a hand-drawn map to the video sharing app, Douyin, which police matched to a small village and a woman whose son had disappeared. After DNA tests, they were reunited in Yunnan province on Saturday. Video footage of the reunion,externalshowed the pair meeting for the first time in over three decades  and shows Li Jingwei carefully removing his mother's coronavirus mask to examine her face before breaking down in tears and embracing her. ""Thirty-three years of waiting, countless nights of yearning, and finally a map hand-drawn from memory, this is the moment of perfect release after 13 days,"" Mr Li wrote on his Douyin profile ahead of the anticipated reunion. ""Thank you, everyone who has helped me reunite with my family."" Mr Li was abducted near the south-western city of Zhaotong in Yunnan Province in 1989 and subsequently sold to a family living over 1,800km away. Now living in Guangdong Province in southern China, he had no success asking his adoptive parents or consulting DNA databases about his origins. So he turned to the internet. ""I'm a child who's finding his home. I was taken to Henan by a bald neighbour around 1989, when I was about four years old,"" he said in the video, which was shared thousands of times. ""This is a map of my home area that I have drawn from memory,"" he said holding up a rough guide of the village, which included features like a building he believed to be a school, a bamboo forest, and a small pond. Li Jingwei drew a map of his childhood village from memory and shared it online Child abductions are not uncommon in China, a society which places high value on having a son. Many children are abducted at a young age and sold to other families. In 2015, it was estimated that 20,000 children were being abducted each year. In 2021 there were numerous examples of young men being reunited with their biological parents after long absences.

"Volunteers sort out food packages ready for distribution A food distribution project launched two months ago has prevented 5.5 tonnes of food from going to waste. Newtown Food Surplus in Powys started in October and has already helped feed 465 people. Now the volunteers who run the project hope to expand it in 2022 with the help of a lottery grant. In December, organisers heard it had been approved for Â£100,000 funding which will enable it to employ staff, rather than rely on volunteers. Vicky Rowe, who started the initiative after working on a similar scheme in Aberystwyth, said the lottery funding will make a huge difference, Food banks could face empty shelves One parcel given 'every 10 minutes' ""It's a lot of hours running this sort of project so we do need some paid members of staff - volunteer coordinators and a chef,"" she said. ""A lot of food that comes in late at night is 'use by' and we need to cook it, and get it into the freezers. ""But we will [also] need to expand into larger premises of some description. There's a chiller [that] we want to get that up and running. That will be a game changer for us because a lot of the fresh produce can be stored in there."" Vicky Rowe, who launched the project, believes it could help communities around Wales if replicated Volunteers go to supermarkets in Newtown and Welshpool at closing time to pick up surplus food that is close to the ""use by"" or ""best before"" dates. One of the volunteers, Simon Longley, said after one visit: ""We've got lots of bread but we've also got doughnuts, spring onions, a whole tray full of salad tomatoes and strawberries: anything the supermarkets can't sell any more because it's reached the 'best by' date or it's reached the 'use by' date. ""It's a legal issue for 'use by' - you cannot sell something that's reached its use by date. 'Best by' is only a recommendation - you judge it by looking at it and checking it. ""That's the sort of stuff the supermarkets won't sell but we can make use of it in cooking or in people taking it away."" The project sorts the food and makes packages for collection on Mondays and Fridays. Its initial purpose was to reduce food waste, but since starting, Ms Rowe has seen how the food parcels have been meeting a social need. People have been queuing to collect their food parcel ""Something that's deeply shocked me is the amount of people that are struggling,"" she said. ""They're on your doorstep - people who are working as well. They're having to make a choice between putting fuel in the car and putting the heating on and putting food on the table. It's overwhelming."" The project is different from a food bank in that you do not need a referral to pick up a parcel and there is no limit to how many times you can visit. Andy from Newtown collects food parcels from the project mainly to reduce waste, adding: ""For us, it's environmental (reasons), but it's also about the cost of living. ""Because the cost of living is going up because of the pandemic. But to me personally, it's for the environment as well because I hate to see waste."" Seba said the project has made her feel a part of her new community Seba, a refugee from Syria who has lived in Newtown for five years, said collecting food from the project made her feel part of the community. She said: ""It's a new project, it's very useful. Just to look after us, you know, we are refugees, and we feel somebody cares about us."" Arfon, a pensioner who has recently been in hospital and collects food to avoid crowded places, said: ""I've just come out of hospital so I don't want to mix too much with people in the shops. Also, I'm on a pension so this helps a lot, food seems to be getting more expensive every day."" The food is what supermarkets can no longer sell As well as being given to individuals, the surplus food also goes into meals made by the Newtown Community Cafe. Pre-Covid, the cafe would prepare a three-course meal for people at a local church - but since the pandemic started the food has been delivered to peoples' homes, with 60 sent out in the week before Christmas. Ms Rowe hopes it continues to grow, and she said: ""I'd love to see this rolled out across Wales, with more and more towns and cities getting involved in doing this. ""Just think how much of a saving we could make on CO2, and also  food going into bellies, not bins.""

"Bibaa Henry (left) and Nicole Smallman were found in bushes at Fryent Country Park in Wembley The mother of two murdered sisters whose bodies were photographed by police officers says she is willing to meet with one of them. Deniz Jaffer and Jamie Lewis werejailed for taking and sharing photographsof the murder scene of Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman. Their mother, Mina Smallman, told BBC Radio 4 she was ""repulsed by them"" but was willing to meet with Jaffer. The Met said it was ""working hard to raise standards"". Ms Smallman also criticised the force's culture of toxicity and said the ""system is clearly broken"". Ms Henry, 46, and Ms Smallman, 27, had been celebrating Ms Henry's birthday at a park in Wembley, north-west London, when they were repeatedly stabbed by Danyal Hussein. Mina Smallman described the officer's actions as a ""sacrilegious act"" As part of her role as aguest editor of BBC Radio 4's Today programmeMs Smallman spoke about her feelings towards the two former officers who photographed her daughters. ""I'm repulsed by them if I'm honest, and can't wait to meet Jaffer,"" she said. ""He said he would like to meet with the family and I don't believe he thought that that could happen but it will, because he said he wanted it to happen and I'm going to give him that invitation."" Jaffer and Lewis werejailed for 33 months each in Decemberfor their actions. ""The system, clearly is broken. There are things being allowed to happen within the police force,"" she added. ""There's obviously a core that are abusing their powers and a culture that is toxic. Well we need to change that because the only people who benefit from that are the perpetrators.""

Moving forward, Ms Smallman says her family will now take the time to grieve while continuing to campaign. Bibaa Henry (L) and Nicole Smallman were celebrating a birthday before they were killed She said: ""If I told you I had a plan I wouldn't be telling the truth but I feel there's something I can offer in the future. ""We need to continue the progress we are making on behalf of women, women of colour and abuse and changing the underground toxicity of the police force."" A spokesman for the Met said:"" The actions of former PCs Jaffer and Lewis were utterly unprofessional, disrespectful and deeply insensitive. ""We're working hard to raise standards in the Met and have commissioned an independent review by Baroness Louise Casey to examine our culture and standards of behaviour.â¯"" It said since their actions came to light, officers had been reminded of their responsibilities in using social media. ""The behaviour of Lewis and Jaffer initially came to light because someone had concerns and anonymously reported them. We encourage all our officers and staff, and members of the public, to report wrong-doing and we will act on those reports, "" the spokesman added.

"The next few days are crucial in understanding the impact of Omicron on the NHS, a health boss has said. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents health trusts, said hospital admissions are rising across the country but what could happen next is unclear. He warned ministers ""must be ready to introduce new restrictions at pace if they're needed"". But the health secretary said any extra measures must be a ""last resort"". Writing on Twitter,external, Mr Hopson said staff were working ""flat out"" and the NHS was now under ""different, arguably more"" pressure compared to last January because more planned treatments were being carried out, the booster vaccination campaign was using up significant resources and staff absences were having a greater impact. England has reported 162,572 new cases - a record number for the fifth day in a row - as well as 154 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland did not report figures on Saturday. How can I tell I have Omicron? Who needs to self-isolate now and for how long? The number of hospital admissions in England are at their highest level since January 2021, according to the latest figures, while NHS hospital staff absences due to Covid have nearly doubled in a month. Mr Hopson said there was evidence infections peaked in London before Christmas and had plateaued since but the future trajectory ""remains very unclear"", ranging from hospital admissions plateauing and then dropping to numbers rapidly increasing. ""If the evidence shows that we are getting very significant numbers of people coming into hospital with Covid, then the government needs to be ready to introduce further restrictions at pace,"" he told the BBC. He said there were currently not the large numbers of severely ill older people that were seen in previous peaks and intensive care occupancy was broadly stable. However, he said there were worries about the possible impact of intergenerational mixing over Christmas. University Hospital of North Tees in Stocktonhas become the latest of more than a dozen hospitals to temporarily suspend routine visits because of rising infections. The doctors' union, the British Medical Association, has said further public health measures should be introduced as a matter or urgency. The association's council chairman, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, said it was ""wholly erroneous to talk about the risk of the NHS becoming overwhelmed"". The new year began with the health service ""already overwhelmed, in a parlous state, and with patient care suffering"", he said. Writing in the Daily Mail,external, Sajid Javid warned it was ""inevitable"" there would be a big increase in people needing NHS care over the next month due to the time lag between infections and hospital admissions. ""This will likely test the limits of finite NHS capacity even more than a typical winter,"" he added. The problem facing the government is that the window to suppress the peak with restrictions may already have passed. Modelling produced for government by Warwick University suggests even a return to lockdown with only schools open has virtually no impact on hospital admissions now. To have had a significant impact, measures would need to have been introduced on Boxing Day or a week earlier. But even then the argument for them was unclear - in both scenarios infections and hospital admissions rebound once restrictions are lifted. Largely all it achieves is delaying and spreading out illness. That could have been of benefit by evening out the pressure on the NHS. But there is, of course, the wider costs of restrictions to society, the economy and mental health to factor in. Some say it would also have bought you time to carry out more vaccinations, but with nine in 10 of the most vulnerable boosted and evidence protection wanes over time this may actually be the point in time when we have the most immunity across the population. There are no simple solutions to this Omicron wave - and the options that the government did have may well have gone. England is currently under Plan B restrictions, which includes mandatory masks in most indoor public places, Covid passes for nightclubs and other large venues and guidance to work from home if possible. The measures are set to expire six weeks after implementation, with a review after three weeks, which is expected on or close to 4 January. There are already tougher restrictionsfor hospitality venues in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. THE GREATEST JOURNEY OF THEM ALL:Can they really make it around the world in 80 days?

"Many people use the New Year to turn over a new leaf - to act in a way that is more rational and in our better interests. Yet we all have to confess this is more difficult than it might seem. Here are three examples from my series - Think with Pinker - of common irrationality traps and how to avoid them. When people contrast what they are ""thinking"" with what they are ""feeling"", often what they have in mind is the difference between immediate and longer-term enjoyment. For example - a feast now and a slim body tomorrow; a trinket today and sufficient funds when the rent is due; a night of passion and the facts of life nine months later. This contrast between times can feel like a struggle between selves, as if we have one self who enjoys a streaming TV series and another who enjoys good grades in an exam. In one episode of The Simpsons, Marge warns her husband he will regret his conduct, and he replies, ""That's a problem for Future Homer. Man, I don't envy that guy."" This raises a question: should we sacrifice now to benefit our future selves? Steven Pinker is Professor of Psychology at Harvard University, the author of Rationality: What It Is, Why It Seems Scarce, Why It Matters and the host of the BBC 4 seriesThink with Pinker The answer is - not necessarily. ""Discounting the future"", as economists call it, is rational to a degree. It's why we insist on bank interest to compensate us for giving up cash now in exchange for cash later. After all, maybe we'll die and our sacrifice will have been for nothing. As the bumper sticker advises, ""Life is short. Eat dessert first."" Maybe the promised payoff will never arrive, like when a pension fund goes bust. And after all, you're only young once. It makes no sense to save up for decades to buy an expensive sound system at an age when you can no longer hear the difference. So our problem is not that we discount the future, but that we discount it too steeply. We eat, drink and make merry as if we'll be dead in only a few years. And we discount the future myopically. We know at some point we should start saving for a rainy day, but the money we have now burns a hole in our pocket. The struggle between a self who prefers a small reward now and a self who prefers a larger reward later, is woven into the human condition. It's long been played out in art and myth. There's the biblical story of Eve eating the apple despite God's warning that she and Adam will be exiled from Paradise if she does - and then the grasshopper of Aesop's fable, who sings his summer away while the ant is working to store food, and finds himself hungry in winter. But mythology has also acted out a famous strategy of self-control. Odysseus had himself tied to the mast so he could not be lured into steering his ship on to the rocks by the Sirens' alluring song. That is, our present self can outsmart a future self by restricting its options. When sated, we can throw out the chocolate so that when we're hungry there's nothing to binge on. When we take a job, we authorise our employers to tithe some of our salary for retirement so there's no surplus to blow at the end of the month. It's one way we can use reason to overcome temptation, without relying on the raw exertion of willpower - which is all too easily outmatched in the moment. ...or in this case, a dog Hamlet was not the only sky-gazer to see things in ""yonder clouds"" - it's a pastime of our species. We look for patterns in the kaleidoscope of experience because they may be signs of a hidden cause or agent. But this leaves us vulnerable to hallucinating spurious causes in haphazard noise. When events occur at random times, they will inevitably group in clusters in our minds - unless there is some non-random process that spaces them apart. And so when we experience haphazardly timed events in life, we're liable to think that bad things happen in threes, that some people are born under a bad sign, or that God is testing our faith. The danger lies in the very idea of ""randomness"" - which actually is two ideas. Randomness can refer to an anarchic process which throws up data without rhyme or reason - like the roll of a die or flip of a coin. But it can also refer to the data themselves when they defy simple summary. For example - ""heads, tails, tails, heads, tails, heads"" looks random, while ""heads, heads, heads, tails, tails, tails"" does not because the second can be compressed into ""three heads, three tails"". People judge the second run to be less likely, even though every sequence of flips is equally probable. They may even bet that after a long string of heads, the coin is due for tails, as if it had a memory and a wish to appear fair - the infamous gambler's fallacy. What we often fail to appreciate is that a random process can generate non-random-looking data. Indeed, it's guaranteed to do so in the fullness of time. We're impressed by coincidences because we forget how many ways there are for coincidences to occur. For example, you're at a party with two dozen guests - what is the chance that two share a birthday? The answer is ""better than 50-50"". And with 60 guests, it's 99%! The high odds surprise us because we know it's unlikely that a random guest will share our own birthday, or any other birthday. What we forget is how many birthdays there are - 366 in some years - and thus how many opportunities there are for coincidences. Life is saturated with these opportunities. Perhaps the licence plate of the car in front of me spells part of my phone number backwards. Perhaps a dream or foreboding comes true - after all, billions of them float through people's minds every day. This video can not be played Steven Pinker: Why humans are so prone to seeing patterns in randomness The danger of over-interpreting coincidences explodes when we single them out after the fact - like the psychic who crows about a correct prediction cherry-picked from a long list of blunders he hopes everyone's forgotten. It's called the Texas sharpshooter fallacy - referring to the marksman who shoots a bullet into a barn wall and then paints a circular target around the hole to make it look like he is a crack shot. Spotting patterns is especially seductive when we choose the pattern only after we've gazed at it - when we get to say, like Hamlet with his clouds, whether it's a weasel or a camel or a whale. Over-interpreting randomness is an occupational hazard when monitoring the random walk of financial markets, while resisting any temptation provides an opportunity for the cognitively savvy investor. It also provides an opportunity in living one's life - to avoid thinking everything happens for a reason and to avoid guiding your personal choices by reasons that don't exist. Whenever we engage in an intellectual discussion, our goal ought to be to converge on the truth. But humans are primates - and often the goal is to become the alpha debater. It can be done non-verbally - the supercilious posture, the hard stare, the deep voice, the peremptory tone, the constant interruptions and other dominance displays. Dominance can also be pursued in the content of an argument, using a host of dirty tricks designed to make an opponent look weak or foolish. These can include: Arguing ""ad hominem"" - attacking the person rather than the argument itself Knocking down a ""straw man"" - distorting the other person's argument and then attacking the distortion Guilt by association - rather than exposing flaws in an argument, calling attention to disreputable people that are sympathetic to it Intellectual combat, to be sure, can be a titillating spectator sport. Readers of literary magazines savour the withering ripostes between intellectual gladiators. A popular genre of YouTube video features the hero who ""destroys"" or ""owns"" or ""takes down"" a hapless questioner (note the metaphors). But if the point of debate is to clarify our understanding - rather than bow to an alpha - we ought to find ways to control these bad habits. We can all promote reason by changing the mores of intellectual discussion, so people treat their beliefs as hypotheses to be tested rather than slogans to be defended.

"Many people use the New Year to turn over a new leaf - to act in a way that is more rational and in our better interests. Yet we all have to confess this is more difficult than it might seem. Here are three examples from my series - Think with Pinker - of common irrationality traps and how to avoid them. When people contrast what they are ""thinking"" with what they are ""feeling"", often what they have in mind is the difference between immediate and longer-term enjoyment. For example - a feast now and a slim body tomorrow; a trinket today and sufficient funds when the rent is due; a night of passion and the facts of life nine months later. This contrast between times can feel like a struggle between selves, as if we have one self who enjoys a streaming TV series and another who enjoys good grades in an exam. In one episode of The Simpsons, Marge warns her husband he will regret his conduct, and he replies, ""That's a problem for Future Homer. Man, I don't envy that guy."" This raises a question: should we sacrifice now to benefit our future selves? Steven Pinker is Professor of Psychology at Harvard University, the author of Rationality: What It Is, Why It Seems Scarce, Why It Matters and the host of the BBC 4 seriesThink with Pinker The answer is - not necessarily. ""Discounting the future"", as economists call it, is rational to a degree. It's why we insist on bank interest to compensate us for giving up cash now in exchange for cash later. After all, maybe we'll die and our sacrifice will have been for nothing. As the bumper sticker advises, ""Life is short. Eat dessert first."" Maybe the promised payoff will never arrive, like when a pension fund goes bust. And after all, you're only young once. It makes no sense to save up for decades to buy an expensive sound system at an age when you can no longer hear the difference. So our problem is not that we discount the future, but that we discount it too steeply. We eat, drink and make merry as if we'll be dead in only a few years. And we discount the future myopically. We know at some point we should start saving for a rainy day, but the money we have now burns a hole in our pocket. The struggle between a self who prefers a small reward now and a self who prefers a larger reward later, is woven into the human condition. It's long been played out in art and myth. There's the biblical story of Eve eating the apple despite God's warning that she and Adam will be exiled from Paradise if she does - and then the grasshopper of Aesop's fable, who sings his summer away while the ant is working to store food, and finds himself hungry in winter. But mythology has also acted out a famous strategy of self-control. Odysseus had himself tied to the mast so he could not be lured into steering his ship on to the rocks by the Sirens' alluring song. That is, our present self can outsmart a future self by restricting its options. When sated, we can throw out the chocolate so that when we're hungry there's nothing to binge on. When we take a job, we authorise our employers to tithe some of our salary for retirement so there's no surplus to blow at the end of the month. It's one way we can use reason to overcome temptation, without relying on the raw exertion of willpower - which is all too easily outmatched in the moment. ...or in this case, a dog Hamlet was not the only sky-gazer to see things in ""yonder clouds"" - it's a pastime of our species. We look for patterns in the kaleidoscope of experience because they may be signs of a hidden cause or agent. But this leaves us vulnerable to hallucinating spurious causes in haphazard noise. When events occur at random times, they will inevitably group in clusters in our minds - unless there is some non-random process that spaces them apart. And so when we experience haphazardly timed events in life, we're liable to think that bad things happen in threes, that some people are born under a bad sign, or that God is testing our faith. The danger lies in the very idea of ""randomness"" - which actually is two ideas. Randomness can refer to an anarchic process which throws up data without rhyme or reason - like the roll of a die or flip of a coin. But it can also refer to the data themselves when they defy simple summary. For example - ""heads, tails, tails, heads, tails, heads"" looks random, while ""heads, heads, heads, tails, tails, tails"" does not because the second can be compressed into ""three heads, three tails"". People judge the second run to be less likely, even though every sequence of flips is equally probable. They may even bet that after a long string of heads, the coin is due for tails, as if it had a memory and a wish to appear fair - the infamous gambler's fallacy. What we often fail to appreciate is that a random process can generate non-random-looking data. Indeed, it's guaranteed to do so in the fullness of time. We're impressed by coincidences because we forget how many ways there are for coincidences to occur. For example, you're at a party with two dozen guests - what is the chance that two share a birthday? The answer is ""better than 50-50"". And with 60 guests, it's 99%! The high odds surprise us because we know it's unlikely that a random guest will share our own birthday, or any other birthday. What we forget is how many birthdays there are - 366 in some years - and thus how many opportunities there are for coincidences. Life is saturated with these opportunities. Perhaps the licence plate of the car in front of me spells part of my phone number backwards. Perhaps a dream or foreboding comes true - after all, billions of them float through people's minds every day. This video can not be played Steven Pinker: Why humans are so prone to seeing patterns in randomness The danger of over-interpreting coincidences explodes when we single them out after the fact - like the psychic who crows about a correct prediction cherry-picked from a long list of blunders he hopes everyone's forgotten. It's called the Texas sharpshooter fallacy - referring to the marksman who shoots a bullet into a barn wall and then paints a circular target around the hole to make it look like he is a crack shot. Spotting patterns is especially seductive when we choose the pattern only after we've gazed at it - when we get to say, like Hamlet with his clouds, whether it's a weasel or a camel or a whale. Over-interpreting randomness is an occupational hazard when monitoring the random walk of financial markets, while resisting any temptation provides an opportunity for the cognitively savvy investor. It also provides an opportunity in living one's life - to avoid thinking everything happens for a reason and to avoid guiding your personal choices by reasons that don't exist. Whenever we engage in an intellectual discussion, our goal ought to be to converge on the truth. But humans are primates - and often the goal is to become the alpha debater. It can be done non-verbally - the supercilious posture, the hard stare, the deep voice, the peremptory tone, the constant interruptions and other dominance displays. Dominance can also be pursued in the content of an argument, using a host of dirty tricks designed to make an opponent look weak or foolish. These can include: Arguing ""ad hominem"" - attacking the person rather than the argument itself Knocking down a ""straw man"" - distorting the other person's argument and then attacking the distortion Guilt by association - rather than exposing flaws in an argument, calling attention to disreputable people that are sympathetic to it Intellectual combat, to be sure, can be a titillating spectator sport. Readers of literary magazines savour the withering ripostes between intellectual gladiators. A popular genre of YouTube video features the hero who ""destroys"" or ""owns"" or ""takes down"" a hapless questioner (note the metaphors). But if the point of debate is to clarify our understanding - rather than bow to an alpha - we ought to find ways to control these bad habits. We can all promote reason by changing the mores of intellectual discussion, so people treat their beliefs as hypotheses to be tested rather than slogans to be defended.

"Dave Riley (far right) says he has lost over Â£2,500 in cancelled gigs between Boxing Day and New Year Cancelled New Year's Eve celebrations have left pub singers thousands of pounds out of pocket with no compensation, an event founder says. Thenew Covid restrictionslimit indoor events to 30 seated attendees, leading many venues to cancel. Singer Dave Riley from Porthcawl, Bridgend, said he had lost over Â£2,500. The Welsh government said freelance musicians may be eligible for the Economic Resilience Fund (ERF) or a local authority discretionary fund. Welsh hospitality hit 'far worse' than in England Omicron dominant variant as cases pass 600,000 Vaccine booster key to avoiding lockdowns in Wales ""New Year's Eve is traditionally the biggest payday for for pub singers and it was removed, their incomes being basically pulled from under them at very short notice,"" said Peter Phillips, founder of the Porthcawl Elvis Festival. ""I think the Welsh government have been irresponsible by not putting some measures in place. ""I'm not criticising their public health measures - that's way above my pay grade to talk about - but they should have thought through who's going to be immediately impacted financially and put something in place for them."" Peter Phillips founded Porthcawl's Elvis Festival in 2004 He said many freelance musicians had been able to claimfurloughduring earlier lockdowns, but this was no longer possible. First Minister Mark Drakeford hasrepeated his callfor the UK government to restart the scheme, which cost almost Â£70bn. ""They should have put some support in place for these people, these people are friends of ours we've known a lot of these people for years,"" said Mr Phillips. Dave Riley is a singer from Porthcawl who sings covers, his own material and performs an Elvis tribute act on cruises, overseas and in pubs, hotels and clubs. He had four gigs lined up between Boxing Day and New Year's Eve, all of which have been cancelled. Dave Riley says his work has been cancelled with ""nothing in place"" ""It's just come all of a sudden with no plan,"" he said. ""All cancelled basically with nothing in place"". He said he had been banking on those gigs - which would have earned him between Â£2,500 and Â£3,000 - to see him through January, which is usually a quiet time for entertainers. He said he had previously been unable to receive furlough and had got by on unemployment benefits and selling things on eBay. ""I'm angry this time around. I was only just getting back to normal and building things up again,"" he added. Dave Riley says he was relying on money from his festive gigs to see him through January UnderAlert Level 2 rules,external, live music is allowed in pubs and other venues but a maximum of 30 people can attend. Those in attendance must remain seated, meaning dancing is not allowed. Table service must be provided and 2m social distancing between groups of a maximum of six people from up to six households must be observed. Face coverings must be worn when not seated at a table. The same applies to weddings, where the only exception is that the couple's first dance is permitted. Mr Phillips said the limited number of attendees made booking a singer financially unviable for many businesses. Covid Q&A: What are the new rules for Wales? When can I have a booster jab and how do I book one? Can police enforce Covid rules if I break them? On 23 December, the Welsh government outlined the details of aÂ£120m package of financial support,externalfor businesses in Wales impacted by Omicron. In a statement at the time, Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said: ""We fully understand the continued challenges faced by businesses, however we are facing a very serious situation in Wales. ""A wave of infections caused by the new, fast-moving and very-infectious omicron variant is headed our way, this means taking early action to try and control its spread - and limit the impact on Welsh businesses."" He said since the start of the pandemic over Â£2.2bn of support had been provided to businesses throughout Wales. The Welsh government will consider whether additional emergency funding is needed in the new year, he added.

"The measures are part of a slate of environmental rules introduced by President Emmanuel Macron A new law banning plastic packaging on most fruit and vegetables comes into effect in France from New Year's day. Cucumbers, lemons and oranges are among the 30 varieties banned from being wrapped in plastic. Larger packs as well as chopped or processed fruit will be exempt. President Emmanuel Macron called the ban ""a real revolution"" and said it showed the country's commitment to phase out single use plastics by 2040. More than a third of fruit and vegetable products in France are thought to be sold in plastic wrapping, and government officials believe that the ban could prevent a billion items of single use plastics being used every year. In a statement announcing the new law, the Environment Ministry said that France uses an ""outrageous amount"" of single use plastics and that the new ban ""aims at cutting back the use of throwaway plastic and boost its substitution by other materials or reusable and recyclable packaging"". The ban forms part of a multi-year programme introduced by Mr Macron's government that will see plastics slowly eased out in many industries. From 2021, the country banned plastic straws, cups and cutlery, as well as polystyrene takeaway boxes. And later in 2022 public spaces will be forced to provide water fountains to reduce the use of plastic bottles, publications will have to be shipped without plastic wrapping, and fast-food restaurants will no longer be able offer free plastic toys. However, industry figures have expressed concerns over the speed at which the new ban is being introduced. Philippe Binard, from the European Fresh Produce Association, said the ""removal of plastic packaging from most fruit and vegetables at such short notice does not allow alternatives to be tested and introduced in a timely manner and stocks of existing packaging to be cleared"". Several other European countries have announced similar bans in recent months as they pursue commitments made at the recent COP26 conference in Glasgow. Earlier this month Spain announced that it will introduce a ban on the sale of fruit and vegetables in plastic packaging from 2023 to allow business to find alternative solutions. Mr Macron's government also announced several other new environmental regulations, including rules calling on car adverts to promote greener alternatives such as walking and cycling.

"This video can not be played Watch: Tributes paid at state funeral for Archbishop Desmond Tutu The funeral mass for South African anti-apartheid campaigner Archbishop Desmond Tutu has taken place at the Anglican cathedral in Cape Town. Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize winner who helped end the racist regime in South Africa, died last Sunday aged 90. In his eulogy, President Cyril Ramaphosa described Tutu as ""the spiritual father of our new nation"". Tutu had insisted there should be no ""lavish spending"" on the funeral. He wanted ""the cheapest available coffin"". Family, friends, clergy and politicians were among those who gathered at St George's Cathedral for Saturday's service, which had limited numbers because of coronavirus restrictions. Tutu's widow Nomalizo Leah sat in a wheelchair at the front of the congregation wearing a purple shawl - the colour of her late husband's clerical robes. Tutu insisted that he be given ""the cheapest available coffin"" Tutu was one of the driving forces behind the movement to end the policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white minority government against the black majority in South Africa from 1948 until 1991. Desmond Tutu - South Africa's rebellious priest A time for new heroes after Desmond Tutu Archbishop Desmond Tutu: A life in pictures In the main eulogy at the official state funeral on Saturday, Mr Ramaphosa described the archbishop as a ""crusader in the struggle for freedom, for justice, for equality and for peace. Not only in South Africaâ¦ but around the world as well"". ""If we are to understand a global icon to be someone of great moral stature, of exceptional qualities, and of service to humanity there can be no doubt that it refers to the man we're laying to rest today,"" he said. About 100 people attended the funeral Saturday's funeral was given a special status, usually designated for presidents and very important people. Tutu had requested that the only flowers in the cathedral should be a ""bouquet of carnations from his family"", according to the Archbishop Tutu IP Trust and the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation. His ashes are to be interred behind the pulpit at St George's Cathedral - the Anglican diocese he served as Archbishop for 35 years. It was earlier revealed thatTutu is to be aquamated- a process using water that is described as an environmentally friendly alternative to cremation. Nomsa Maseko, BBC News, Cape Town Even though only 100 invited guests physically attended Archbishop Desmond Tutu's funeral service at the St George's cathedral, many turned up to honour him by watching proceedings from public viewing areas. Most were visibly emotional. One man described his attendance of Tutu's funeral as a full-circle moment because he also witnessed the release of Nelson Mandela from prison and watched Tutu and Mandela hold hands with their fists in the air as South Africa became a democracy. It's the end of an era. The last of South Africa's well-known freedom fighters leaves behind a difficult task for the leaders of the nation: to rid the country of corruption and racial divisions and lead the way forward, in the spirit of the moral compass which was the guiding force of Tutu's leadership. In a video message at the mass, the Archbishop of Canterbury described how Tutu ""lit up the world"". He said that his paying tribute to Tutu was ""like a mouse giving a tribute to an elephant"". Tutu's daughter said the outpouring of love for her father had ""warmed the cockles of our hearts"". ""Because we shared him with the world, you share part of the love you held for him with us,"" she said. Many people in Cape Town turned up to file past the archbishop's coffin as it lay in state. One man, Wally Mdluli, hitchhiked more than 1,000km (620 miles) across the country from Bloemfontein to Cape Town - enlisting the help of family and friends to pay for some of the trip and even sleeping at a petrol station on the way. ""I feel fulfilled after I saw the coffin. It's like his spirit is in me,"" he told the BBC's Nomsa Maseko in Cape Town. Tutu used his high profile to speak out against the oppression of black people in his home country, always saying his motives were religious and not political. After Nelson Mandela became South Africa's first black president in 1994, Tutu was appointed by him to a Truth and Reconciliation Commission set up to investigate crimes committed by both white and black people during the apartheid era. Tutu was awarded the Nobel prize in 1984 for his role in the struggle to abolish the apartheid system. He was also credited with coining the term Rainbow Nation to describe the ethnic mix of post-apartheid South Africa, but in his latter years he expressed regret that the nation had not coalesced in the way in which he had dreamt.
