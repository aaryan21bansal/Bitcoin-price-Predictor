"Non-essential shops and restaurants will be shut France has entered its third national lockdown as it battles a surge in cases of Covid-19 that threatens to overwhelm the country's hospitals. All schools and non-essential shops will shut for four weeks, and a curfew will be in place from 19:00 to 06:00. On Friday, the number of seriously ill Covid patients in intensive care units (ICU) increased by 145 - the biggest jump in five months. President Emmanuel Macron has promised more hospital beds for Covid patients. France is currently battling a peak of about 5,000 Covid patients in ICUs. On Friday, the country recorded 46,677 new cases and 304 deaths. As well as the restrictions that came into force on Saturday, from Tuesday people will also need a valid reason to travel more than 10 km (six miles) from their homes. France is facing a peak of about 5,000 people in intensive care President Macron had hoped to keep France's coronavirus cases under control without having to impose another lockdown. However, the country has struggled with an EU-wide delay in the vaccine rollout, as well as several new strains of the virus. This video can not be played Ros Atkins Onâ¦ Macronâs Covid-19 Crisis In Germany, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier called on people to play their part and get vaccinated. Speaking in a television address to the nation on Saturday, he said the country was in the middle of a third wave and that it faced more restrictions. He also admitted that mistakes had been made - specifically in testing and in the vaccine rollout - and talked about there being a ""crisis of trust"" in the state. ""Of course, there is no single silver bullet to get out of the pandemic,"" President Steinmeier said. ""And that is why political dispute is needed - but the arguing must not become an end in itself. ""Whether it's about a federal or state level, party or coalition, or whether opinion polls are up or down - none of that can play the main role now. ""We need clarity and determination, we need understandable and pragmatic regulations so that people have direction, so that this country can again achieve what it has within."" President Frank-Walter Steinmeier urged Germans to get vaccinated Last month, German officials announced that the country would be placed in a strict Easter lockdown - only to reverse the decision just days later. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the plan for a lockdown from 1 to 5 April a ""mistake"", and said she took ""ultimate responsibility"" for the U-turn. Pandemic peaks in Eastern Europe and ruins Easter Germany reverses plans for strict Easter lockdown Europe's vaccine rollout 'unacceptably slow' - WHO Italy also entered a strict three-day lockdown on Saturday in order to try to prevent a surge in Covid-19 cases over the Easter weekend. All regions are now in the ""red zone"" - the highest tier of restrictions - as the country records about 20,000 new cases a day. Non-essential movement is banned, but people are allowed to have an Easter meal in their homes with two others. Churches are also open, but worshippers are being told to attend services within their regions. This video can not be played For the second consecutive year Pope Francis led his Easter mass from behind closed doors Pope Francis delivered his Easter message to a scaled back group of about 200 people, with St Peter's Square empty for the second year. Different regions will remain in either ""orange zone"" or ""red zone"" restrictions until the end of the month. The Italian government also announced it was placing 70,000 extra police officers on surveillance nationwide, in order to enforce the lockdown rules. All non-essential shops are shut ""This is not the time to lower our guard, and to let go of that sense of responsibility shown so far,"" Interior Minister Luciana Lamorgese told the newspaper Il Messaggero. ""Because the progress recorded by the campaign for vaccines finally gives a glimpse of a different horizon that will allow us to gradually return to normal."" On Friday, the World Health Organization (WHO) criticised Europe's ""unacceptably slow"" vaccine rollout, and said the situation in the region is now worse than it has been for several months. ""Vaccines present our best way out of this pandemic... However, the rollout of these vaccines is unacceptably slow,"" WHO director for Europe Hans Kluge said in a statement. ""We must speed up the process by ramping up manufacturing, reducing barriers to administering vaccines, and using every single vial we have in stock, now."" In the meantime, as long as vaccine coverage remained low, he said EU countries would have to impose lockdowns and other measures to compensate for the delays. According to the WHO, only 10% of the nearly 900 million people in the region have had a single dose of coronavirus vaccine.

"Easter, Passover, Ramadan and Vaisakhi all fall within the month of April, so it's an important month across different faiths. And with lockdown being relaxed across the UK, more places of worship are now open - but there are still changes to worshippers' usual practices. A number of common measures are in place across the UK: Services should be carried out in the shortest possible time - to ensure safety and minimise infection spread Worshippers should wear a face mask and keep a 2m (6ft) distance from anyone not from their own household or support bubble People must not mingle with anyone not in their own household or support bubble, and should be ""encouraged to move on promptly"" afterwards If shoes are removed before a service, people should avoid touching other people's footwear Items such as prayer mats, service sheets, religious texts or hymn books should not be shared - worshippers should bring their own and then take them home If people can't bring their own books, places of worship can offer a selection for individuals to use, but these should be quarantined for 48 hours before and after use Those giving and receiving food and drink in a service must observe strict precautions Spoken responses from worshippers should be uttered softly, and there should be no communal singing or chanting indoors to reduce the risk of transmission In line with government guidance,,externalacts of communal worship have continued throughout the winter in churches, synagogues, mosques, gurdwaras, temples and meeting rooms. The number allowed at any service is determined by a risk assessment on the building where it is held. A single small group of singers is now allowed to perform but only where it's essential to an act of communal worship, and with social distancing maintained at all times. Communal singing should not take place indoors, but a congregation outdoors may join in, as long as they follow social distancing rules. No more than 30 people are allowed to attend funerals. Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies can now take place with six people attending. From 12 April (at the earliest), 15 people will be allowed to attend wedding ceremonies, and from 17 May (at the earliest), this number will rise to 30. At that point, other ""life cycle"" ceremonies - such as baptisms or bar mitzvahs - will be allowed to take place with 30 attendees. What is the rule of six and what are the social distancing rules? What are the rules on weddings? Communal services can be held in places of worship (but they are not currently allowed outdoors). Marriages, civil partnerships, alternative wedding ceremonies and funerals are allowed. The number who can attend is determined by the size and layout of the building. Organised groups of no more than six singers are allowed to take part in services. Congregations are not allowed to join in the singing. Groups of musicians are also allowed, but they are not allowed to play wind instruments, and are advised to use pianos or electronic instruments. Supervised children's activities such as Sunday schools and madrassas are not permitted. Official guidance for Wales,external What are Wales' lockdown rules? Places of worship have now reopened for communal services across Scotland. The limit on attendance is 50 - as long as 2m social distancing can be maintained within a building. Life ceremonies may be held as long as they also comply with these rules. Wedding ceremonies are allowed with a maximum of five people (including the couple). Funerals can take place with a maximum capacity of 20 attendees. Most Scottish isles are underlevel three restrictions,external, and wedding ceremonies with a maximum of 20 people (including the couple) are also allowed. From 26 April, up to 50 people will be able to attend weddings and funeral ceremonies throughout Scotland. Official guidance for Scotland,external What Covid rules are changing in Scotland, and when? Worshippers at Dundee Central Mosque Northern Ireland's main Christian denominations chose to suspend in-person gatherings in January. The Catholic Church has now resumed services, and the Church of Ireland, Methodist and Presbyterian Churches in Northern Ireland will follow suit from Good Friday (2 April).

"This video can not be played Several hundred people marched in London chanting ""kill the Bill"" Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urged marchers to ""stand up for the right to protest"" as protests against the Police and Crime Bill were held around the UK. Kill the Bill demonstrations took place in London, Birmingham, Liverpool, and Bristol among other places. Mr Corbyn said the bill would prevent protest without police approval. Police said 26 people were arrested after a minority refused to leave after the London protest. Speaking in Parliament Square in central London, Mr Corbyn invoked figures such as the suffragettes and Nelson Mandela as he urged the crowd to oppose the bill. ""Stand up for the right to protest, stand up for the right to have your voice heard,"" he said. What is the Police and Crime Bill at the centre of protests? Vigil policing critics lacked facts says Met chief More than 1,000 at city's Kill the Bill protest He said the protests against the bill were sparked after police dispersed the crowd at the ""perfectly correct and proper vigil"" for Sarah Everard, who was killed as she walked home in south London. ""I want a society where it is safe to walk the streets, where you can speak out, you can demonstrate and you don't have to seek the permission from the police or the home secretary to do so,"" he said. More than 1,000 people gathered peacefully in Bristol Several women addressed the crowd and shared personal experiences of abuse and being drugged. Protesters carried anti-sexism placards and chanted ""women scared everywhere, police and Government do not care"" as they marched past Downing Street. The protests were prompted by the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which propose to give police in England and Wales more power to impose conditions on non-violent protests, including those which are deemed too noisy or a nuisance. Anyone refusing to follow police directions about a protest could be fined up to Â£2,500. In London, police scuffled with protestors at the demonstration Ministers and police have defended the proposals, saying they were needed to tackle demonstrations such the ones by Extinction Rebellion in 2019, where mass occupations of roads and bridges in London and elsewhere stretched police resources to the limit. Most of the crowd of several hundred people in London dispersed peacefully after the rally, but police said they made arrests after a ""small minority"" refused to leave. In Bristol, more than 1,000 people gathered for a peaceful protest, after demonstrations on 23 March and 26 March ended in clashes with police. Earlier Kill the Bill protests had taken place under lockdown, but the latest demonstrations are the first since coronavirus rules on outdoor gatherings were eased on Monday in the latest stage of the government's roadmap out of lockdown. Under the current rules, people can meet outdoors in groups of six or two households. But there is an extra provision to allow outdoor protests with more than six people - as long as organisers carry out a risk assessment and take all reasonable steps to limit the spread of the virus. At the Bristol protest, about 100 demonstrators began marching again later in the evening, Avon and Somerset Police said. They forced police to briefly close part of the M32 motorway by sitting in the road. Hundreds of people also marched through Newcastle city centre, and other places that saw protests of varying scales included Birmingham, Liverpool, Newcastle, Bournemouth, Brighton, Weymouth and Luton.

"More than one in three teachers told a survey they had been verbally abused Teachers face ""derogatory sexualised"" language as well as violence and threats from pupils in the classroom, a union conference has heard. The NASUWT conference condemned schools and colleges that claim ""unacceptable"" student behaviour is ""part of the job"". A survey of over 4,700 union members found 38% had been verbally abused, and 10% threatened with violence. ""We need to reclaim our classrooms, but we cannot do it alone,"" said NASUWT executive member Wendy Exton. Teachers are often left with no access to appropriate support and many school and college leaders do not receive adequate training, a motion passed at the conference said. Teachers 'face weekly violence from pupils' 'We are kicked, spat on, hit and sworn at' Secondary school staff suffer work attacks The concerns from teachers come afterschool pupils sparked a government reviewby postingstories online about sexual harassment and abuseby their peers. The website Everyone's Invited has now gathered more than 13,400 testimonies of pupils' experiences. Ms Exton said criminal issues such as drugs, violence, knives and country lines ""spill over"" into the classroom, and go unreported ""as schools are afraid of the repercussions"". She said too many excuses were made for poor behaviour, ""from living on a council estate to trauma and even lack of tobacco"". ""Today's behaviour directed to us as teachers include not only vile language, but derogatory sexualised terms, threats to ourselves and our families, and indeed, violence itself,"" Ms Exton said. ""In classrooms, many staff are struggling alone with extreme behaviours."" The survey of 4,700 NASUWT members found that in addition to verbal abuse and threats, 6% of teachers had been subjected to physical violence by pupils in the last year. The motion at the conference applauded teachers who have balloted for industrial action in order to refuse to teach violent pupils. Rosemary Carabine, another member of the union's executive, questioned why teachers should have to use workplace grievance procedures or industrial action to feel safe at work from ""daily"" threats and aggression, in some cases. Dr Patrick Roach, NASUWT general secretary, said the union was ""unequivocal"" that teachers should not have to endure any form of abuse in the classroom or online. ""The union is continuing to take steps, up to and including industrial action and refusal to teach ballots, where members report to us that serious pupil indiscipline or abuse is going unchallenged by their school,"" he said. A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: ""In no circumstances should teachers be subjected to abuse simply for doing their jobs."" The department said it had ""ambitious plans"" to improve behaviour in schools, including making behaviour management a core part of early teacher training, and improving guidance for schools. It is also funding Â£10m ""behaviour hubs"", where schools with ""exemplary behaviour cultures"" share practices with others that want to improve, the spokesperson said. Meanwhile, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told the NASUWT conference that investing in the next generation of teachers was ""crucial"" to the pandemic recovery plans. In the pre-recorded speech, he said more needs to be done to improve teacher training as the quality of teaching was the ""single most important factor"" in education.

"The Ever Given has been anchored in the Great Bitter Lake, the canal's midway point, since being refloated on Monday The last ships stranded by the giant container vessel that was stuck in the Suez Canal have now passed through the waterway, the canal authorities say. More than 400 vessels were left waiting at either end of the canal when the 400m-long Ever Given became wedged across it on 23 March. But Egypt's Suez Canal Authority says the shipping traffic jam is now over. Officials have opened an investigation into the incident and expect to made their findings public early next week. The results could have major legal repercussions, as various parties seek to recoup the costs of the repairs to the ship and the canal, as well as the salvage operation. About 12% of global trade passes through the 193km (120-mile) canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe. The cost of the Suez Canal blockage How was the Suez Canal ship freed? In pictures: The epic task of refloating Suez ship The 220,000-tonne Ever Given was finally freed last Monday after a major salvage operation involving a flotilla of powerful tug boats and dredging vessels that shifted an estimated 30,000 cubic metres (1.1m cubic ft) of mud and sand. The operation allowed hundreds of ships, carrying millions of tons of cargo, to start moving through the waterway. This video can not be played (29 March 2021) The stranded container ship is seen finally on the move and no longer blocking the canal A total of85 ships, carrying cargo weighing 4.2 million tons, passed through the canal in both directions on Saturday, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) said,externalin a statement. These were expected to include the last 61 ships out of the 422 that were queuing when the Ever Given container vessel was dislodged. The canal authorities are under pressure to upgrade the waterway's technical infrastructure to avoid further disruption in the future. They have said they will demand at least $1bn (Â£720m) in compensation for the losses resulting from the blockage. In an interview with the privately-owned Sada el-Balad TV on Wednesday, SCA chairman Osama Rabie said that the Ever Given vessel would not leave the Great Bitter Lake, where it is currently being held, until the compensation was paid by the vessel's owner. Mr Rabie also said that about 800 people had helped to free the ship, adding that they would be rewarded for their ""great efforts"". The vessel's technical managers, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, said on Monday that its initial investigations suggestedit had veered off course due to strong wind,external. They also ruled out any mechanical or engine failure as a cause. However, Mr Rabie believes the impact of the wind was not the main reason for the incident, and that ""technical or human errors"" may have been to blame. ""The Suez Canal has never been closed because of bad weather,"" he earlier told reporters. He also denied size was a factor, saying larger ships had used the waterway.

"One landfill site in Wales is said to contain ""warfare chemicals"" including mustard gas Toxic waste including mustard gas is buried among more than 1,500 disused landfill sites across Wales. Environmental campaigners Greenpeace branded the 1,572 locations ""ticking time bombs"". Natural Resources Wales (NRW) data reveals hundreds of the sites contain hazardous waste and only a few dozen are protectively lined. The organisation said it worked with councils to ensure old landfills were not a pollution risk. Its data showed landfill lies beneath homes, leisure centres, hospitals, parkland and alongside rivers. Dr Paul Johnston of Greenpeace's Exeter University science unit said: ""Many of these landfill sites are ticking time bombs. ""There's a huge variety of problems out there, ranging from asbestos toPCBs,externalto radioactive material, to more recent chemicals likePFOA,externaland pesticide waste that has been dumped in a large number of locations."" At Rhydymwyn, Flintshire, the Ministry of Defence was part of the UK's atomic bomb project: ""Mustard gas, other warfare chemicals,"" the data said A tip used by the now-defunct agro-chemical company Monsanto, at Llwyneinion, near Wrexham, holds ""toxic waste"" It also tipped at Rhosymedre Quarry and near Penycae, Powys, where ""unknown"" chemical waste was dumped At Greenwood Old Quarry near Wenvoe, Vale of Glamorgan, is ""asbestos, toxic waste"" At Trecwn, Pembrokeshire, where there is a decommissioned Royal Navy armaments depot, the data described a ""munitions destruction and phosphorous burning area"" At Rhoose, Vale of Glamorgan, ""asbestos contaminated soils"" lie near the Wales Coast Path PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) were banned in 1986, having been used since the 1920s as cooling and insulating fluids for transformers and capacitors. When incinerated they can produce highly toxic dioxins - one was used in anassassination attempt on Ukranian politician Viktor Yushchenko in 2004,external.

Near Furnace, Ceredigion, the data said in 1989 ""landfill gas was in explosive concentration"" but was considered a ""minimal risk."" PAHs, or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, are said to be buried in Caerphilly. These have been linked to skin, lung, bladder, liver, and stomach cancers. Dr Paul Johnston has warned tips are ""ticking time bombs"" that must be dealt with Dr Johnston said: ""With the climate crisis set to bring more flooding and coastal erosion to the UK, some of these sites are at even higher risk of leaking their toxic contents. ""This is a difficult and costly problem to tackle, but we're going to have to do it at some point, or there'll be some nasty surprises in store."" Of the sites in Wales: 318 hold ""special"" waste. NRW said ""special"" was an old term that could be broadly replaced with ""hazardous"" 70 hold ""liquid sludge."" Dr Johnston previously told the ENDS Report,which has mapped landfill sites around the UK,external, liquid sludge could be ""anything from oily sludge to cyanide waste"" 826 sites contain industrial waste, 596 commercial, and 835 hold household waste Just 46 have lining to stop waste seeping into the ground Only 730 are licensed. NRW said those that were not ""probably"" predate the requirement for  permits Of the 1,572 sites, 117 do not appear in the data. They are closed but not classed as disused as they are in the ""aftercare"" phase Older landfills often were not lined before waste was dumped, meaning chemicals could leak. Even modern lined landfillswill eventually leak, according to studies,external. Prof Kate Spencer, of Queen Mary University of London, called landfill ""a huge problem"" that needed ""serious government investment"". ""At the moment it is being left to local authorities to deal with the problem when it almost becomes a crisis and we need a much more proactive response to assess what the scale of the situation is,"" she said. Old landfills were often not lined, meaning chemicals could leak from them, according to studies She feared a ""sticking plaster approach"" was being taken. Of 20,000 sites in the UK, about 1,500 were ""at risk"" on the coast, Prof Spencer said. ""We are talking about very large numbers of sites that are vulnerable to climate change,"" she added. ""We can't possibly just remove all that waste."" Prof Spencer asked whether sites could be remediated or repurposed, or waste from them recycled. Managing director of environmental consultancy firm Eunomia, Mike Brown, spent 20 years operating landfill sites. ""The occurrence of acute pollution events is presumably quite low, because we are not reading about them killing fish, or whatever else might be happening,"" he said, with the vast majority of sites being ""washed through"" over the decades. ""Most of them won't be causing a problem,"" he added, but moving Wales' landfill elsewhere could run into billions of pounds and he does not believe there is ""any prospect"" of it being moved. Prof Kate Spencer feared a ""sticking plaster approach"" was being taken to landfill It is unclear how much waste is in each site. ""If you have 200,000 tonnes in there that would cost you Â£40m to move. And you have got 1,500 sites there to move,"" Mr Brown said. The cost would be higher if waste was hazardous. ""Where's the money going to come from?"" he said. NRW's lead waste policy specialist, Gareth Lewis, said the agency worked with councils to stop old landfills becoming future pollution risks. He said it had ""details on the type and quantity of waste deposited"". ""We have addressed a number of closed sites that otherwise could have caused pollution incidents,"" he added. ""Older permitted sites like these are reviewed consistently by ourselves and local councils to ensure we minimise the risk to people, animals and the environment."" Environmental consultancy firm boss, Mike Brown, said most old landfill ""won't be causing a problem"" The Welsh Local Government Association said landfill use was falling because ""of higher recycling and use of energy from waste"". ""There are responsibilities for managing sites whilst operational and then for dealing with maintenance of closed sites,"" a spokesman said. He said ""most"" landfills were now owned privately and charged for dumping. ""Natural Resources Wales is responsible for licensing the sites and overseeing compliance with environmental legislation,"" he said. The Welsh government said it had previously given councils and NRW Â£12m for landfill ""investigation, risk assessment and remediation work"". ""We continue to provide funding for authorities to receive contaminated land training, ensuring relevant officers can manage and regulate matters of land contamination,"" a spokesman said. In 2015, Monsanto, BP and Veolia agreed to contribute to cleaning up Brofiscin Quarry, reportedly  polluted with Agent Orange derivatives. Thatbegan in 2011.

"The Ever Given has been anchored in the Great Bitter Lake, the canal's midway point, since being refloated on Monday The last ships stranded by the giant container vessel that was stuck in the Suez Canal have now passed through the waterway, the canal authorities say. More than 400 vessels were left waiting at either end of the canal when the 400m-long Ever Given became wedged across it on 23 March. But Egypt's Suez Canal Authority says the shipping traffic jam is now over. Officials have opened an investigation into the incident and expect to made their findings public early next week. The results could have major legal repercussions, as various parties seek to recoup the costs of the repairs to the ship and the canal, as well as the salvage operation. About 12% of global trade passes through the 193km (120-mile) canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe. The cost of the Suez Canal blockage How was the Suez Canal ship freed? In pictures: The epic task of refloating Suez ship The 220,000-tonne Ever Given was finally freed last Monday after a major salvage operation involving a flotilla of powerful tug boats and dredging vessels that shifted an estimated 30,000 cubic metres (1.1m cubic ft) of mud and sand. The operation allowed hundreds of ships, carrying millions of tons of cargo, to start moving through the waterway. This video can not be played (29 March 2021) The stranded container ship is seen finally on the move and no longer blocking the canal A total of85 ships, carrying cargo weighing 4.2 million tons, passed through the canal in both directions on Saturday, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) said,externalin a statement. These were expected to include the last 61 ships out of the 422 that were queuing when the Ever Given container vessel was dislodged. The canal authorities are under pressure to upgrade the waterway's technical infrastructure to avoid further disruption in the future. They have said they will demand at least $1bn (Â£720m) in compensation for the losses resulting from the blockage. In an interview with the privately-owned Sada el-Balad TV on Wednesday, SCA chairman Osama Rabie said that the Ever Given vessel would not leave the Great Bitter Lake, where it is currently being held, until the compensation was paid by the vessel's owner. Mr Rabie also said that about 800 people had helped to free the ship, adding that they would be rewarded for their ""great efforts"". The vessel's technical managers, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, said on Monday that its initial investigations suggestedit had veered off course due to strong wind,external. They also ruled out any mechanical or engine failure as a cause. However, Mr Rabie believes the impact of the wind was not the main reason for the incident, and that ""technical or human errors"" may have been to blame. ""The Suez Canal has never been closed because of bad weather,"" he earlier told reporters. He also denied size was a factor, saying larger ships had used the waterway.

"More than one in three teachers told a survey they had been verbally abused Teachers face ""derogatory sexualised"" language as well as violence and threats from pupils in the classroom, a union conference has heard. The NASUWT conference condemned schools and colleges that claim ""unacceptable"" student behaviour is ""part of the job"". A survey of over 4,700 union members found 38% had been verbally abused, and 10% threatened with violence. ""We need to reclaim our classrooms, but we cannot do it alone,"" said NASUWT executive member Wendy Exton. Teachers are often left with no access to appropriate support and many school and college leaders do not receive adequate training, a motion passed at the conference said. Teachers 'face weekly violence from pupils' 'We are kicked, spat on, hit and sworn at' Secondary school staff suffer work attacks The concerns from teachers come afterschool pupils sparked a government reviewby postingstories online about sexual harassment and abuseby their peers. The website Everyone's Invited has now gathered more than 13,400 testimonies of pupils' experiences. Ms Exton said criminal issues such as drugs, violence, knives and country lines ""spill over"" into the classroom, and go unreported ""as schools are afraid of the repercussions"". She said too many excuses were made for poor behaviour, ""from living on a council estate to trauma and even lack of tobacco"". ""Today's behaviour directed to us as teachers include not only vile language, but derogatory sexualised terms, threats to ourselves and our families, and indeed, violence itself,"" Ms Exton said. ""In classrooms, many staff are struggling alone with extreme behaviours."" The survey of 4,700 NASUWT members found that in addition to verbal abuse and threats, 6% of teachers had been subjected to physical violence by pupils in the last year. The motion at the conference applauded teachers who have balloted for industrial action in order to refuse to teach violent pupils. Rosemary Carabine, another member of the union's executive, questioned why teachers should have to use workplace grievance procedures or industrial action to feel safe at work from ""daily"" threats and aggression, in some cases. Dr Patrick Roach, NASUWT general secretary, said the union was ""unequivocal"" that teachers should not have to endure any form of abuse in the classroom or online. ""The union is continuing to take steps, up to and including industrial action and refusal to teach ballots, where members report to us that serious pupil indiscipline or abuse is going unchallenged by their school,"" he said. A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: ""In no circumstances should teachers be subjected to abuse simply for doing their jobs."" The department said it had ""ambitious plans"" to improve behaviour in schools, including making behaviour management a core part of early teacher training, and improving guidance for schools. It is also funding Â£10m ""behaviour hubs"", where schools with ""exemplary behaviour cultures"" share practices with others that want to improve, the spokesperson said. Meanwhile, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told the NASUWT conference that investing in the next generation of teachers was ""crucial"" to the pandemic recovery plans. In the pre-recorded speech, he said more needs to be done to improve teacher training as the quality of teaching was the ""single most important factor"" in education.

"The lockdown will last three days over Easter weekend Italy has entered a strict three-day lockdown to try to prevent a surge in Covid-19 cases over Easter. All regions are now in the ""red zone"" - the highest tier of restrictions - as the country battles a third wave, with about 20,000 new cases a day. Non-essential movement is banned, but people are allowed to share an Easter meal at home with two other adults. Churches are also open, but worshippers are being told to attend services within their own regions. For the second year, Pope Francis will deliver his Easter message to an empty St Peter's Square. Following the holiday weekend, different regions will then remain in either ""orange zone"" or ""red zone"" restrictions until the end of the month. Italy's restrictions come as countries across Europe try to control a surge in cases of the virus, while struggling with a delayed vaccine rollout. More than 110,328 people in total have died of the coronavirus in Italy, and there have been 3.6 million confirmed infections. Just over a year after Italy became the first western nation to be hit by a coronavirus epidemic. In February 2020 people in many northern areas were told to stay at home and the lockdown was later extended to the rest of the country. Free movement was restored in June, but Italy is now facing a third wave of Covid-19. On 1 April, it registered 23,634 new cases and 501 deaths. Under the new lockdown measures, all non-essential shops are closed and cafes and restaurants are running a takeaway-only service. All non-essential shops are shut Red zone restrictions normally mean all non-essential travel is banned, but over the Easter weekend an exception is being made to allow people to visit friends and relatives within their regions for a holiday meal. The Italian government also announced it was placing 70,000 extra police officers on surveillance nationwide, in order to enforce the lockdown rules. ""This is not the time to lower our guard, and to let go of that sense of responsibility shown so far,"" Interior Minister Luciana Lamorgese told the newspaper Il Messaggero. ""Because the progress recorded by the campaign for vaccines finally gives a glimpse of a different horizon that will allow us to gradually return to normal."" On Friday, the World Health Organization (WHO) criticised Europe's ""unacceptably slow"" vaccine rollout, and said the situation in the region is now worse than it has been for several months. ""Vaccines present our best way out of this pandemic... However, the rollout of these vaccines is unacceptably slow,"" WHO director for Europe Hans Kluge said in a statement. ""We must speed up the process by ramping up manufacturing, reducing barriers to administering vaccines, and using every single vial we have in stock, now."" In the meantime, as long as vaccine coverage remained low, he said EU countries would have to impose lockdowns and other measures to compensate for the delays. According to the WHO, only 10% of the nearly 900 million people in the region have had a single dose of coronavirus vaccine. French schools to close under third Covid lockdown Germany reverses plans for strict Easter lockdown Europe's vaccine rollout 'unacceptably slow' - WHO Earlier this week France, which is currently facing a peak of about 5,000 people in intensive care, announced it was entering a third national lockdown for at least three weeks. French schools are moving back to remote learning, and all non-essential shops have now closed. People are banned from travelling more than 10km (six miles) from home without good reason. And last month, German officials announced that the country would be placed in a strict Easter lockdown - only to reverse the decision just days later. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the plan for a lockdown from 1 to 5 April a ""mistake"", and said she took ""ultimate responsibility"" for the U-turn.

"Seven people have died from unusual blood clots after getting the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK, the medicines regulator has confirmed to the BBC. In total, 30 people out of 18 million vaccinated by 24 March had these clots. It is still not clear if they are just a coincidence or a genuine side effect of the vaccine. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency says the benefits continue to outweigh any risk. The World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency have echoed this conclusion. A spokeswoman for AstraZeneca said: ""Patient safety remains the company's highest priority."" However, concern has led to other countries including Germany, France, the Netherlands and Canada to restrict the vaccine's use only to older people. Thedata released by the MHRA on Friday,externalshowed 22 cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) which is a type of blood clot in the brain. These were accompanied by low levels of platelets, which help form blood clots, in the body. The MHRA also found other clotting problems alongside low platelet levels in eight people. Now the MHRA has confirmed, in an email to the BBC, that ""sadly seven have died"". Dr June Raine, the chief executive of the MHRA, said: ""The benefitsâ¦ in preventing Covid-19 infection and its complications continue to outweigh any risks and the public should continue to get their vaccine when invited to do so."" Investigations are under way to determine if the AstraZeneca vaccine is causing the very rare blood clots. Earlier this week the European Medicines Agency said it was ""not proven, but is possible"". AstraZeneca: Is there a blood clot risk? When will I get my Covid jab? What you need to know about vaccine safety Two issues are raising suspicions. The first is the unusual nature of the clots which, including low levels of platelets and rare antibodies in the blood that have been linked to other clotting disorders. ""This raises the possibility that the vaccine could be a causal factor in these rare and unusual cases of CVST, though we don't know this yet, so more research is urgently needed,"" said Prof David Werring, from the UCL Institute of Neurology. The other issue is the difference between the Oxford-AstraZeneca and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. There have been two cases of CVSTs after Pfizer in the UK, out of more than 10 million vaccinated, but these did not have the low platelet levels. However, there remains uncertainty around how common these clots normally are. Estimates range from two cases per million people every year to nearly 16 in every million in normal times and the coronavirus has been linked to abnormal clotting, which may be making these clots more common. Germany has reported 31 CVSTs and nine deaths out of the 2.7 million people vaccinated there, with most cases in young or middle-aged women. Similar data on who has been affected in the UK has not been published in the UK, but a wider mix of people are thought to have been affected. All medicines, from vaccines to paracetamol, have the potential to cause severe side effects. The seasonal flu jab has around a one-in-a-million chance of causing the nerve disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome. So, the real question is: Are the risks worth the benefits? Even if the vaccine was the cause, and this is still not proven, the numbers suggest around one death in every 2.5 million people vaccinated. However, this has to be weighed against the known threat posed by coronavirus. If 2.5 million 60-year-old people caught coronavirus then around 50,000 would die. If they were all 40-year-olds then around 2,500 would die. This balance of risk and benefit will continue to be assessed as more safety data comes in and as the vaccine programme moves into younger people, who are at lower risk of dying from Covid-19. One scientist has told the BBC that evidence is growing that the blood clot events are ""causally related"", although he stressed that the benefits of taking the AstraZeneca vaccine still far outweighed the risks of not getting the jab. Prof Paul Hunter, a medical microbiologist at the University of East Anglia, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It is not uncommon to get clusters of rare events purely by chance. ""But, once you find that cluster in one population and it then crops up in another - such as previously in the German and now in the English - then I think the chances of that being a random association is very, very low. ""Clearly more work needs to be done, but I think the evidence is shifting more towards it being causally related at the moment."" However, public health expert Prof Linda Bauld, of the University of Edinburgh, told BBC Breakfast the cases were ""rare events"" and stressed there was no event ""at the moment of a causal link - that the vaccine would be directly causing these outcomes"". She urged the public to continue coming forward for a jab, and added: ""Covid itself increases the risk of blood clots quite significantly and it's possible that that may be part of the explanation why we're seeing this.""

"The lockdown will last three days over Easter weekend Italy has entered a strict three-day lockdown to try to prevent a surge in Covid-19 cases over Easter. All regions are now in the ""red zone"" - the highest tier of restrictions - as the country battles a third wave, with about 20,000 new cases a day. Non-essential movement is banned, but people are allowed to share an Easter meal at home with two other adults. Churches are also open, but worshippers are being told to attend services within their own regions. For the second year, Pope Francis will deliver his Easter message to an empty St Peter's Square. Following the holiday weekend, different regions will then remain in either ""orange zone"" or ""red zone"" restrictions until the end of the month. Italy's restrictions come as countries across Europe try to control a surge in cases of the virus, while struggling with a delayed vaccine rollout. More than 110,328 people in total have died of the coronavirus in Italy, and there have been 3.6 million confirmed infections. Just over a year after Italy became the first western nation to be hit by a coronavirus epidemic. In February 2020 people in many northern areas were told to stay at home and the lockdown was later extended to the rest of the country. Free movement was restored in June, but Italy is now facing a third wave of Covid-19. On 1 April, it registered 23,634 new cases and 501 deaths. Under the new lockdown measures, all non-essential shops are closed and cafes and restaurants are running a takeaway-only service. All non-essential shops are shut Red zone restrictions normally mean all non-essential travel is banned, but over the Easter weekend an exception is being made to allow people to visit friends and relatives within their regions for a holiday meal. The Italian government also announced it was placing 70,000 extra police officers on surveillance nationwide, in order to enforce the lockdown rules. ""This is not the time to lower our guard, and to let go of that sense of responsibility shown so far,"" Interior Minister Luciana Lamorgese told the newspaper Il Messaggero. ""Because the progress recorded by the campaign for vaccines finally gives a glimpse of a different horizon that will allow us to gradually return to normal."" On Friday, the World Health Organization (WHO) criticised Europe's ""unacceptably slow"" vaccine rollout, and said the situation in the region is now worse than it has been for several months. ""Vaccines present our best way out of this pandemic... However, the rollout of these vaccines is unacceptably slow,"" WHO director for Europe Hans Kluge said in a statement. ""We must speed up the process by ramping up manufacturing, reducing barriers to administering vaccines, and using every single vial we have in stock, now."" In the meantime, as long as vaccine coverage remained low, he said EU countries would have to impose lockdowns and other measures to compensate for the delays. According to the WHO, only 10% of the nearly 900 million people in the region have had a single dose of coronavirus vaccine. French schools to close under third Covid lockdown Germany reverses plans for strict Easter lockdown Europe's vaccine rollout 'unacceptably slow' - WHO Earlier this week France, which is currently facing a peak of about 5,000 people in intensive care, announced it was entering a third national lockdown for at least three weeks. French schools are moving back to remote learning, and all non-essential shops have now closed. People are banned from travelling more than 10km (six miles) from home without good reason. And last month, German officials announced that the country would be placed in a strict Easter lockdown - only to reverse the decision just days later. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the plan for a lockdown from 1 to 5 April a ""mistake"", and said she took ""ultimate responsibility"" for the U-turn.
