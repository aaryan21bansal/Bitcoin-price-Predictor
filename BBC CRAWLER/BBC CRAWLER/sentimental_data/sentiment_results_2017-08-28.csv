"Several of the papers lead on the latest round of Brexit negotiations. The Daily Telegraph,externalsays Britain's relationship with Brussels appears close to breaking point. It quotes government sources accusing the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, of being ""ill-judged"" and ""ill-considered"" in his approach to the talks. The British side are reported to be scornful of the idea that the UK should pay to leave the EU and then, during a transitional period after Brexit, hand over money for access to the single market. ""We are not going to pay twice,"" one source tells the Telegraph. The Financial Times,externalpredicts Theresa May, who is hungry for a new trade agreement with Japan, is set to be disappointed during her visit to Tokyo this week. Officials in Japan tell the FT their priority is completing a free trade deal with the EU. Butthe Sun,externalreports that the Japanese car giant Nissan is to increase production by 20% at its Sunderland plant. The paper says the firm is also planning to double the British sourcing of parts to offset any tariffs as a result of Brexit. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external In its lead,the Guardian,externalreports that phone calls about mental health to Britain's biggest police force have hit a record - averaging about 13 an hour last year. It says the number being made to the Metropolitan Police has gone up by nearly a third since 2011. Inspector Michael Brown, the mental health co-ordinator for the College of Policing, blames a cut in funding for NHS services, saying most people making these calls don't need the police, they need a mental health professional. The Times,externalfollows up its lead from Monday - criticising an east London council for placing a five-year-old white Christian girl in the foster care of a devout Muslim family who don't speak English and couldn't meet her needs. In an editorial, it says Tower Hamlets council has struggled to recruit white families as foster carers, but points out the girl could have been found a home outside the area. The same story also makes the front page ofthe Daily Mail.,externalIt says MPs have called on the government to examine what happened. Tower Hamlets tells the paper it can't comment on individual cases but it gives absolute consideration to a child's cultural identity. Part of a stretch of coastline in East Sussex which was evacuated because of a chemical 'haze'. Many of the papers speculate on what caused the chemical haze that made people ill on the East Sussex coast. Both the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror hear a theory from a leading oceanographer that the chemical cloud could have been caused by a toxic algae bloom in the sea. Other theories in the Daily Mirror include traffic pollution, a chemical spillage or a ship unlawfully cleaning its tank. The Daily Mirror,externalleads with a study which says that statins could reduce the risk of breast cancer by 45%. According to the paper, researchers examined the cases of 1.2 million women admitted to hospital across the country to find out why those with high cholesterol were less likely to develop breast cancer. They concluded the likely explanation was they were taking statins. The paper says clinical trials will now follow to decide whether all women should be given the drug routinely. The Daily Express,externalalso focuses on a health story with a warning for arthritis sufferers who take ibuprofen for pain relief. Research suggests they are at greater risk of high blood pressure, heart disease and strokes, the paper reports.

"What happens between Cersei and Jamie Lannister? The seventh series of Game of Thrones has come to a dramatic conclusion. Fans are torn between being stunned by the major plot developments and heartbroken that the episode could be the last one on our screens until 2019. That's when the fantasy epic, based on George RR Martin's books, is rumoured to be coming back one last time. The finale was shown in the US on Sunday, and broadcast in the UK on Monday. So what have critics said? Game of Thrones: Who is the true heir? Revelations were made about Daenerys Targaryen's links to Jon Snow in the episode The Hollywood Reporter'sDaniel Fienberg said The Dragon and the Wolf episode had""action, twists and just a little incest"",external. Which all sounds pretty standard for Game of Thrones. In a series that has often been ""dumb"", it was a ""satisfying as heck"" conclusion, with the storylines between Jon Snow, played by Kit Harington, and Daenerys Targaryen, played by Emilia Clarke, coming to a climax - if you can excuse the pun. ""The finale worked better than most of the rest of the season for me because while it lacked not for dragons, it also delivered one great two-person chamber scene after another,"" wrote Fienberg. Ed Power, writing inthe Daily Telegraph, was a fan of the""solid 80 minutes of betrayal, nudity and skulduggery in dimly-lit rooms"",external. ""It was good to welcome the old, happy-stabby Game of Thrones back with a vengeful gleam in its eyes,"" he mused, describing it as a ""dark and slow-burning instalment"". But he noted that the revelation about Jon Snow's parentage was ""presented as an interesting nugget rather than continent-quaking pivot"". Fans found out who Jon Snow's parents are - and what his real name is On that note - inthe New York Times, Jeremy Egner had somegood and bad news,externalfor Snow. ""The good news is, you're not actually a bastard... The bad news? Say hi to your aunt."" Ouch. Egner noted, though, that the finale ""didn't offer much in the way of surprise"" and ""largely checked off boxes that have been broadly telegraphed throughout the season"". Sean T Collins, ofRolling Stone,said there were""moments of happiness and horror straight out of the biggest GoT nerd's dreams"",,externaland that it was quite right that ""the lion's share of screentime"" went to Cersei Lannister. He said the storyline had been ""hurtling to a point of no return"", adding: ""The lies, betrayals, power plays, and murders we've witnessed for seven years, and which still continue in this episode - they are all a distraction. We're all in this together, and we'd better realize it ASAP."" Christopher Hooten complained that the seventh series has become""bonkers and Top Trumps-esque"",external, but wrote inthe Independent: ""When it looks this gorgeous, the dialogue exchanges are this pithy and the action is this jaw-dropping and enthralling, it's hard to be mad about it. ""At some point in season eight, a living dragon is going to fight a dead dragon, jets of blue and red flame meeting in the middle like in a Manga, while dead giants and dead horses do battle with multiple races of men.

"Vicky Myres' family said she lived life to the full A man has appeared in court over the death of a cyclist killed in an alleged hit-and-run in Greater Manchester. Vicky Myres, 24, died in hospital after the crash in Stockport Road, Timperley, on Sunday morning. Gurparthab Ajay Singh, 26, of Hall Lane, Wythenshawe, is charged with causing death by dangerous driving, failing to stop after a road traffic collision and failing to report a road traffic collision. He is due at crown court next month. The crash happened at about 07:55 BST on Sunday Singh appeared at Manchester and Salford Magistrates' Court earlier and was remanded in custody ahead of his appearance at Minshull Street Crown Court on 26 September. A second man arrested after the crash, aged 35, was released while inquiries continue. Miss Myres, who was cycling with her boyfriend's mother at the time of the crash, had recently cycled from Land's End to John O'Groats. Her family, who described her as a ""lovely daughter"", said her death will leave a void that can never be filled. A family statement read:  ""Her life was perfect, she lived it to the full and, together with her devoted partner James, they were planning longer and more exotic trips.

"This video can not be played The European Union is ""ready to intensify negotiations"" The European Union's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has expressed concern about progress so far, as the third round of Brexit talks gets under way. He warned that UK ""ambiguity"" must be removed and progress on ""separation"" issues made before any talks on the future EU-UK relationship. For his part, UK Brexit Secretary David Davis said both sides had to show ""flexibility and imagination"". The two men spoke at a brief media call before the talks got started. The two sides have played down the prospect of a breakthrough in this week's talks. BBC Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly said the mood had been set by a series of briefings ""that betray a good deal of mutual exasperation"". What is at stake in EU-UK talks? All you need to know about Brexit The EU's point man on Brexit talks The EU has accused the UK side of ""magical thinking"" on the issue of the Irish border. And the UK has said the Europeans are ""massively over-egging"" their financial demands on the UK in terms of an ""exit"" bill. The third of the main ""separation"" issues to be resolved covers the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU after Brexit. Mr Barnier said: ""We need you to take positions on all separation issues. This is necessary to make sufficient progress. We must start negotiating seriously. ""We need UK papers that are clear in order to have constructive negotiations. And the sooner we remove the ambiguity, the sooner we will be in a position to discuss the future relationship and a transitional period. ""The EU 27 (the EU members excluding the UK) and the European Parliament stand united - they will not accept that separation issues are not addressed properly. ""I am ready to intensify negotiations over the coming weeks in order to advance."" Who's who: The people negotiating Brexit Keep single market for Brexit transition - Labour Economic issues first, say UK and German firms Mr Davis said that the UK's goal remained to secure a ""mutually beneficial"" agreement that works for people and businesses across Europe. He said this week's ""technical talks"" would build on the July round and the papers the UK has recently published on its vision for its withdrawal from the EU. ""For the UK, the week ahead is about driving forward the technical discussions across all the issues. ""We want to lock in the points where we agree, unpick the areas where we disagree, and make further progress on a range of issues. ""And we're ready to roll up our sleeves and get down to work again once more."" Mr Barnier said on Twitter last week that the focus of the third round of negotiations would be ""orderly withdrawal"". Officials from both sides will meet in working groups to discuss the detail behind each side's proposals, before the round is closed by Mr Davis and Mr Barnier on Thursday. Setting the scene - political correspondent Chris Mason Fairly technical. No big bang. No breakthrough. But no breakdown - 10 words that don't make for a great headline, I'm afraid. But it is the mood music around the Brexit talks resuming in Brussels. Meanwhile, at Westminster, there is ""a new politics around Brexit"" according to Phillip Blond, the director of the centre right Respublica think tank on BBC Breakfast this morning. He was talking about Labour's policy shift: promising to stay in the single market and a customs union for a transition period after Brexit. The reaction, on Radio 5 live's Your Call this morning, suggests the instinct of those on the winning side of a referendum is that such a vote should mark the end of the conversation on a subject: the people have spoken and we should leave, and leave properly. And those on the losing side think it should mark the start of a conversation: about what leave should look like, or whether we should leave at all. The UK is set to leave the EU by the end of March 2019, following last year's referendum vote. In the first phase of negotiations, British and EU officials are meeting each month for four days in Brussels. On Sunday, the shadow Brexit secretary said Labour would keep the UK in the single market and customs union for a transitional period after leaving the EU. Keir Starmer said this was needed to avoid a ""cliff edge"" for the economy. Blackley and Broughton Labour MP Graham Stringer, who supported the Leave campaign, said what Sir Keir had said was ""completely at odds"" with what the party leader and other Labour figures had said. Mr Stringer told Radio 4's PM programme it had been made ""quite clear"" a post-Brexit UK could not stay in the customs union and single market. ""The Labour Party's position should be to honour the decision made in the referendum and try to support the government in getting the best deal we can."" Meanwhile, the British Chambers of Commerce and the Association of German Chambers of Commerce have jointly pleaded with politicians to put economic interests first in their Brexit discussions.

"Police found several human body parts during a raid in a traditional healer's house Fear has gripped the village of Shayamoya in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province after the discovery of a decapitated body. The family of Zanele Hlatshwayo, 25, who has been missing since July, believe she was a victim of a cannibalism ring that has so far led to the arrest of five men. Her decomposing body was found after a man who claimed to be a traditional healer handed himself over to police last week and confessed that he was tired of eating human flesh. Police officers had initially dismissed his statement, according to reports. It is only after he produced a bloodied hand and foot as proof that he was immediately arrested. He led them to his rented home, where police found eight human ears in a cooking pot. It is believed they were to be served to his customers, who were told they had magic properties and would convey money, power and protection. Several other body parts were found stuffed in a suitcase. Zanele Hlatshwayo's body was found buried under these rocks Ms Hlatshwayo's bloodied and torn clothes were found among the human remains in the traditional healer's home. The clothes were identified by her family. However, police are still waiting for DNA test results to confirm if the remains belong to the mother of a two-year-old boy. Ms Hlatshwayo's family is yet to bury her. As I entered the Hlatshwayo homestead, I was greeted by a solemn hymn and the cries by the grieving family. ""We can only imagine how she begged for her life, she died an extremely painful death,"" said her elder sister Nozipho Ntelele as she wiped away tears. Nozipho Ntelele, in white top, said Ms Hlatshwayo's killing was brutal ""Her clothes were covered in grass and dust, which is a clear indication that she had been in a struggle to save her life,"" said Ms Ntelele. The traditional healer lived in a rented hut in Rensburgdrift near Estcourt. He is nicknamed ""Mkhonyovu"" which loosely translated means ""the corrupt one or corruption"" in the local Zulu language. He rented the hut from Philani Magubane, whose brother was also arrested for being the traditional healer's alleged accomplice. The traditional healer rented this hut from a brother of one of his accomplices Police had locked the hut but items used in rituals can be seen through a crack in the door ""I was shocked to find out that my younger brother fell for the traditional healer's fairytales - he promised them wealth when he was just as poor as I am,"" Mr Magubane told me. He said that one his tenants had been complaining about the smell of rotting meat that was coming from his next door neighbour. ""Mkhonyovu only moved into the house two months ago - I had no idea that he kept human remains here because I don't live in the same yard,"" said Mr Magubane. Mr Magubane said he believes that his brother, along with three other young men, were lured by the traditional healer to work for him as they had been struggling to find jobs. It is alleged that he sent the young men to dig graves in the middle of the night so he could make magic charms known locally as ""muti"". Mthembeni Majola, a local politician, convened a community meeting shortly after the cannibalism suspects made their first court appearance last week. Mthembeni Majola said some villagers had willingly eaten human flesh ""Most residents were shocked by this and now live in fear,"" but Mr Majola says others were not surprised. ""A few confessed to have consulted with the traditional healer and knowingly ate human flesh,"" he said. ""But what has angered most of us here is how gullible our people have become,"" saying that Mkhonyovu's customers were livestock thieves who were told he could make them invincible, even bulletproof, so that the police could not shoot them, said Mr Majola. Phepsile Maseko, from South Africa's Traditional Healer's Organisation, has condemned the alleged cannibalism practices. She said ""Mkhonyovu"" that was a fake healer who wanted to enrich himself and had brought ""our sacred practices into disrepute"". Phepsile Maseko says that the discovery gives a bad name to traditional healers who are doing honest work ""Ritual killings and the use of human tissue are not part of traditional healing... this angers us as traditional healers because we have to constantly defend our honest work,"" said Ms Maseko. The five men, who were arraigned in court on Monday, amid public protests outside the courtroom, abandoned their bail request and will make another court appearance at the end of September.

She's not the first star to rock up to a gig when full of the lurgy. So who else has battled on regardless? This video can not be played Amateur video shows Justin Bieber being sick on stage at his concert in Glendale, Arizona Fans got a bit more than they bargained for whenJustin Bieber was sick on stage- twice - back in 2012. He was performing in Arizona as part of the Believe tour when he vomited twice. He left the stage each time, but came back to finish the show and even did an encore. Bieber later told fans he was ""getting better"" and that ""milk was a bad choice"". The following year he had to take a20-minute break mid-set due to breathing problems- but once again, he insisted on getting to the end of the performance. What a pro. Perhaps Biebs could have shared stories with Rihanna about his experiences - as the same thing had happened to her while she was playing in Portugal. She was at Lisbon's Atlantico Arena when she had to run off during What's My Name to be sick. RiRi tweeted a fan at the time, saying she ""made it juuuust in time for RudeBoy"", with her dancers covering for her while she was ill. Last year, she had to cancel her Grammys performance though under doctor's orders - she was suffering from bronchitis that time. Este on stage at the BBC Radio 1 Big Weekend in Hull earlier this year Haim bassist Este has type one diabetes - which means her body can't control blood sugar levels and that she needs to inject insulin. But when she was playing on the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury 2013, she realised her sugar levels were plummeting due to the fact she'd not eaten enough. She came off stage and her manager checked her levels and rubbed chocolate inside her mouth to give her much-needed glucose. After two minutes, she got back on to perform the rest of the set with her sisters. Este admitted she had to do it ""sitting down like BB King"" however - and thatnow she makes sure she's had her ""fuel for the day"". When Dave Grohl fell off stage at a concert in Sweden two years ago, he broke his leg - an injury that led to the Foo Fighters cancelling their headline slot at Glastonbury that summer. But get this. Even though he was in pain, and would eventually need six metal screws put in his leg, he finished the show at the Ullevi Stadium before being taken to hospital. And then, a month after the accident, he took to the stage again. Grohl sat on a throne decorated with guitars for a show in Washington DC to mark the 20th anniversary of the band's first album. He's seen on it above at a gig in Seoul later that month. If you can't sing yourself, get the audience to do it Bit of a vintage one now. Marillion were appearing on Top of the Pops in 1985 - but the slight problem was that singer Fish had lost his voice. So what do you do in that situation? Cancel? Nope. Instead, Fish decided to take to the stage regardless - and hold up a flip chart with the lyrics to Lavender Blue on, ripping off the sheets as he went along. Luckily, the audience was up for a sing-a-long. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"Railway arch: The controversial bridge is a statement of Russian political control Russian engineers are installing a giant railway arch in the channel between Russia and Crimea, as a 19km (12-mile) road-rail bridge takes shape. It is a flagship political project, as Russia claims Ukraine's Crimea peninsula - which it annexed in March 2014 - as its own territory. It will take about a month to fix the arch, weighing 6,000 tonnes, to massive supports in the water. The road section of the Kerch Strait bridge will also have a giant arch. The project's official website (in Russian) -www.most.life,external- says the bridge should be completed by the end of next year, when the first cars will cross it. Then rail traffic will start crossing it in 2019. The EU and US have ratcheted up sanctions on Russia since first imposing restrictions over the seizure of Crimea. Western firms and politicians are banned from doing business with the Russian-installed Crimean government, or with Russian economic actors there. Russia's Vesti TV news says the Kerch Strait bridge will be Russia's longest. The bridge will not impede shipping, the project website says, as it will stand 35m (115ft) above the water. The four-lane highway is designed for a capacity of 40,000 vehicles per 24-hour period. According to a Ukrainian think tank, the bridge will be too low for some cargo vessels to get through to the Ukrainian port of Mariupol, north of the Kerch Strait. TheCenter for Army, Conversion and Disarmament Studies said,externalthe restriction could mean a 25-30% loss in the port's trade and could hit pig iron exports to US customers. The place that's rather difficult to get into What is Russia's end game in Crimea? Singer Jamala pushes boundaries on Crimea Crimean Tatar media 'silenced by Russia' Russia sees the bridge as a key strategic tool for developing Crimea, more efficient than the current ferry service. Crimea's land border with Ukraine is tense and heavily militarised, making cross-border deliveries slow and difficult. Ukraine and Western governments accuse Russia of crushing political opposition in Crimea, whose leadership is solidly loyal to President Vladimir Putin. Ethnic Russians are the majority group in Crimea, which used to be part of imperial Russia. In April 2016 the Crimean Tatars' Mejlis - an assembly representing the ethnic group's interests - was banned by Russia as an ""extremist"" organisation. Ruslan Zeytullayev, a Crimean Tatar activist serving a 15-year jail term in Russia's southern city of Rostov, has sent an open letter to the UN, urging international pressure on Russia to get ""political"" prisoners released. A month ago he went on an indefinite hunger strike. Russia found him and three other Crimean Tatars guilty of membership in a ""terrorist"" group - Hizb ut-Tahrir - and jailed them all. The group is not listed as ""terrorist"" in Ukraine. Amnesty International said the case raised ""numerous fair trial concerns"" - notably, several prosecution witnesses had retracted their pre-trial statements. A leading Crimean Tatar activist and deputy head of the Mejlis, Akhtem Chiygoz, is expected to be sentenced by a Russian court on 11 September. He is accused of organising ""mass disturbances"" during a pro-Ukrainian rally in 2014 before Russia's annexation of Crimea.

"Anti-inflammatory drugs could cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes, a study of 10,000 patients suggests. A trial of the drug canakinumab could represent the biggest breakthrough in treatment since the advent of statins to lower cholesterol, its authors say. The study reported a 15% reduction in the risk of a repeat heart attack among patients - but others questioned the drug's efficacy, side-effects and cost. Recipients of the drug had an increased risk of potentially fatal infections. However, the British Heart Foundation (BHF) said the ""exciting and long-awaited trial"" could still help save lives. Heart attack patients are routinely given cholesterol-lowering statins and blood-thinning drugs to help reduce the risk of repeat attacks. In this study,external, 10,000 patients who had previously had a heart attack were treated with the anti-inflammatory drug once every three months. The trial, held in almost 40 countries, monitored the individuals for up to four years. It found what researchers said were reductions in risk ""above and beyond"" those seen in patients who only took statins. However, it also found a ""significantly higher incidence"" of potentially fatal infection and sepsis among those treated with the drug, according to the study. The results were presented at the European Society of Cardiology meeting, held in Barcelona, Spain. Canakinumab was initially developed by pharmaceutical firm Novartis - which paid for the trial - to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Heart attack patients are routinely treated with statins A heart attack is a serious medical emergency in which the supply of blood to the heart is suddenly blocked. Experts have previously spoken about its possible link with inflammation of certain blood vessels. However, authors say such a link has never been proven before in humans. The study's lead author Dr Paul Ridker, of Brigham and Women's Hospital, part of Harvard Medical School, said the study represented ""a milestone in a long journey"". ""For the first time, we've been able to definitively show that lowering inflammation independent of cholesterol reduces cardiovascular risk,"" he said. ""This has far-reaching implications."" Dr Ridker continued: ""In my lifetime, I've gotten to see three broad eras of preventative cardiology. ""In the first, we recognised the importance of diet, exercise and smoking cessation. In the second, we saw the tremendous value of lipid-lowering drugs such as statins. Now, we're cracking the door open on the third era. This is very exciting."" Dr Ridker said the findings also indicated ""the possibility of slowing the progression of certain cancers"", but further research was required. Dr Robert Harrington, chair of the Stanford University School of Medicine, sounded a note of cautionin an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine,external. He said the effects of anti-inflammatories could be ""modest"", and the absolute clinical benefit of canakinumab ""cannot justify"" its routine use ""until we understand more about the efficacy and safety trade-offs, and unless a price restructuring and formal cost-effectiveness evaluation supports it."" Others, though, say the treatment could help those at risk of repeat heart attacks for whom statins are not enough. Prof Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the BHF, said: ""The findings suggest that existing anti-inflammatory drugs, such as canakinumab, could be given along with cholesterol-lowering drugs to treat survivors and further reduce their risk of another heart attack."" Gary Gibbons, director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, said the findings provided ""compelling evidence"". He called for further research into the findings.

"This week across America, millions of children will be getting ready to go back to school and returning home that evening with their first work assignment - an essay with the title: ""What I did on my summer holidays."" Now imagine for a second you're Donald Trump, and you've just been given that piece of homework. I think the first thing you're going to do is ask for a few extra sheets of paper because, what a summer. From distant, foggy memory, I also seem to remember that the one other instruction you got from the teacher was to make it descriptive, and not too much of a list. Well, sorry about that, Miss. This is what Donald and his pals in the White House got up to: Hires a new communications director called Anthony Scaramucci Press secretary Sean Spicer quits in protest. Says he's happy but is fulminating The Mooch (aka Scaramucci) gives obscene interview to New Yorker magazine Trump fires his chief of staff, the hapless Reince Priebus (abandoned at Andrews air force base) Hires a new one, Gen Kelly, who was the head of homeland security On Kelly's first day, the president fires the new communications director - Scaramucci has lasted just 10 days - less time than it takes for a pint of milk to go off He hires a new comms director, his fourth in seven months He publicly shames his attorney-general, numerous times, but Jeff Sessions clings on Loses a healthcare bill Publicly lashes the three Republicans who voted against it, several times Bans transgender people from the military, via Twitter, without telling the military Military chiefs say: ""Forget it, we don't take orders from tweets; there's a chain of command"" Makes political speech to Scouts aged between 11-18 Claims Scouts leader rang to congratulate him on greatest speech ever made Scouts leader says there was no such call, and issues statement apologising to Scouts for president's misjudged address Says the president of Mexico rang to congratulate him on his border policies Mexican president says no such call ever took place White House denies the president is a liar, but can't explain the president's claims Takes days to sign bipartisan sanctions bill and then criticises Congress for making him sign it Thanks Vladimir Putin for expelling hundreds of American diplomats Condemns leaks but then says he likes the leaks because it shows people love him Encourages police officers to be rough with suspects during arrests Police chiefs condemn statement. White House clarifies that it was a joke Publicly shames the Republican Senate leader, whom he needs to get anything done, several times Seems to respond to North Korea by threatening nuclear war Tells Guam, which has a big US military base which North Korea's leader threatened to attack, that the publicity will help tourism Chief strategist Steve Bannon contradicts president. Says: ""There's no military option in NK"" Threatens Venezuela with a military option After a neo-Nazi rally in which a woman was killed, the president blames both sides After backlash, cleans it up. Denounces white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan Cross at having been forced to do this, erases all of it and reverts to blaming both sides, saying there were ""fine people there"" Military high command issue statement condemning all forms of discrimination in thinly veiled attack on commander-in-chief Promotes his Virginia vineyard when asked if he will - as president - visit Charlottesville And gets condemnations from Democrats, Republicans, former presidents, world leaders, allies, his own staff, and the Pope. Publicly shames company bosses who abandon him. There's a mass walkout by execs leading to disbanding of key White House business bodies Fires Steve Bannon, his chief strategist and architect of Trump victory Does U-turn on Afghanistan and commits more troops, having repeatedly said he'd pull US forces out Threatens to close government down if he doesn't get funding for border wall with Mexico Appeals for unity of American people Next day lambasts his enemies and critics in highly partisan speech Day after that appeals for unity again Pardons ex-Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, who had been convicted for defying court order to stop traffic patrols targeting suspected immigrants And this is the quiet season. This is the still, millpond of August when nothing happens; when days are long and news bulletins are slim, when surfing dogs and the battle of the bake-offs should dominate the news cycle. Barack Obama's former chief of staff, and now the Mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, tweeted at one point that he was going to nominate the White House for a Tony award for most drama. Not best drama. Justmost. There is no shortage of pundits and political professionals in Washington who will tell you things can't continue like this, and that there is no way that Donald Trump can last a full four years in office. There is a degree of wishful thinking in that for some people. For others it is a genuine, cold-eyed assessment. The president's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, was just one high-profile summer departure from the White House I am unconvinced. For a start the drama, the chaos and noise are what this president thrives on. If he hated the drama, he wouldn't stoke and provoke as much as he does. Where it does matter is in his relationships with the lawmakers on Capitol Hill, with the business leaders across the country, with the money men on Wall Street, with the military high command who seem to have bristled at the way their commander-in-chief is behaving and with his fellow leaders around the world. Just consider for a minute his threat to allow a government shutdown if he doesn't get funding for the border wall with Mexico. The president says it's making good on a campaign pledge: the lawmakers, still under their breath, say: ""Yeah, and the other part of the pledge was that Mexico was going to pay."" He has publicly lambasted the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. On any number of occasions. How does that help him to get an infrastructure bill passed? How does that help to get tax reform through? And then there's the Trump base. Has support for Donald Trump fractured? Yes, a bit. Do the polls that chart approval ratings for him make alarming reading? Yep, the numbers disapproving seem to be rising, and the approving seem to be dwindling. But his base is still 100% with him. Cheering, whooping and lapping it up. He is their man, fighting the system and draining the swamp and taking on the establishment. Just look at the crowds in Phoenix, Arizona, last week. You see, I think there is a perfectly plausible scenario where by a squeak and a cigarette-paper width of margin he gets his legislative agenda through. In which case in 2020 he could go to the American people and say: ""Look, I delivered on what I promised."" President Trump's relations with Congress have, at times, been fractious There is perhaps a more likely set of circumstances where he is blocked and thwarted - and fails on all the big legislative tests - no repeal and replacement of Obamacare, no significant change to the tax code, no wall with Mexico, no change to America's crumbling infrastructure. But that doesn't mean it's over for Trump. He then goes to the country and says: ""The system is rigged. Draining the swamp is going to take even longer than I ever thought. Parts of the Republican leadership need to be swept away. The fight goes on. We'll Make America Great Again."" And that brings us to Donald Trump's ego - and maybe a choice that this White House must confront as it takes stock of this chaotic summer. Does Donald Trump want to go down in history as a heroic failure, or the winner who turned things around with his relentless energy and deal-making nous? If it's the latter then he needs to start nurturing all those people he has alienated, and in record fast time. And if it's the former, then carry on with the rallies that pump up the base and leave many others feeling queasy.

"BHS collapsed a year ago with the loss of 11,000 jobs More than half of the 160 BHS stores that closed after the retailer fell into administration a year ago are still sitting empty, according to new research. BBC business correspondent Emma Simpson visits one former site in south east London. This time last year Mandy Pickering and the other BHS staff in Bexleyheath, were selling off every last fixture and fitting they could. BHS was in its final hours, with nearly 90 years of trading about to come to an end. Now though, she's back on the same shop floor, but the space has been transformed. Another, smaller, department store chain, Morleys has moved in. ""It's the best thing that could've happened to this place,"" says Mandy. Sandy (left) and Mandy are pleased to be working for the new company She's one of around half a dozen former BHS staff who are now working for Morleys at this store in London. After 18 years at BHS, Sandy Glavin has also joined Mandy in working for Morleys. ""It's like moving out of a house, having it refurbished, and moving back in,"" says Sandy. ""We're very lucky. Morleys obviously saw the potential and made it so, so better - and everyone in the area thinks so as well."" It was also a great outcome for the new owners of the shopping centre where Morleys is now based. The former BHS store in Bexleyheath is now a Morleys Allan Lockhart, property director at NewRiver REIT, says: ""We acquired Broadway shopping centre in April 2016, shortly before BHS fell into administration, which could've created a large, unattractive vacancy at our shopping centre. ""However, we immediately began working closely with the council [the freeholder] to swiftly secure a desirable new anchor store. ""The introduction of a Morley's department store has been a big success, signalling revitalisation and a vote of confidence for the town."" Not every former BHS location has been so fortunate though, with 82% of the sites still unoccupied, according to new research by the Local Data Company, which tracks occupancy and vacancy rates across all of the UK's main shopping destinations. This drops to 60% or 96 shops if you strip out the stores which do have agreements in principle for the space to be taken, or are awaiting planning permission for redevelopment. Meanwhile, four stores have been demolished. One year on since the final BHS stores closed, only 25 have been re-let. So why have some stores been easier to occupy than others? ""I think it is a reflection of the challenges many high streets face, "" says Local Data Company director, Matthew Hopkinson. ""If you look at where retail has moved, much of it has gone to out of town retail parks and shopping centres. In other words, the traditional retailers who would've occupied a BHS have often moved elsewhere. ""Many of these units were also very large, with multiple floors, and costly to re-occupy. "" Stockport's BHS is one of the sites still stubbornly empty, taking up a large corner of the Merseyway shopping centre. The local council is investing hundreds of millions of pounds to revitalise the town centre. It recently bought the shopping centre, a 1960s style complex which had been starved of investment and ended up in receivership, as part of its regeneration plans. It doesn't own the BHS store, but its leader, Alex Ganotis, is convinced the vacant site has potential. ""It just doesn't look good that we've got a store this size in the middle of the Merseyway Shopping Centre,"" says Mr Ganotis. BHS shut up shop after administrators failed to find a buyer for the whole business ""It's a successful centre with 95% of units let, with high levels of footfall. We feel this store could easily be re-let."" And he is prepared to consider alternative uses for the site. ""Let's have a conversation,"" says Mr Ganotis. ""The council is willing to work with anyone who has new and imaginative ideas as we do to transform this area. ""It could be re-let as just one store or split up in to a number of different stores or it could be used for other purposes, like leisure."" BHS had been on the UK High Street for 88 years Creative solutions are being found. The BHS store on Edinburgh's Princes Street, for instance, is set to be transformed into a hotel with a rooftop restaurant, as well as retail on the ground floor. And in Taunton, a gym is being planned for the upper level of its former BHS store. Mr Hopkinson says: ""I think we've got to face the brutal facts that the councils and the landlords have got to come together and plan alternative uses. ""That could be food or beverage or it could be leisure, or it could be re-occupied as accommodation. But they won't be re-occupied as shops in the current climate,"" For some town centres, the consequences of the BHS collapse may be felt for many months if not years to come.

"Mary (on the left) and Rosie when they were aged three at Blair DrummondSafari Park When Rosie and Mary, now aged 13, started school it was the first time they realised other people were unable to tell them apart. Before that their mum Helen Peck had never dressed her identical twins in exactly the same outfits. When the local paper turned up to take photos of the new school entrants, it was Rosie and Mary who were picked out. There is something about twins and the start of the new school year that seems to capture the imagination of the media, and this is not a recent phenomenon. Allow Twitter content?

When identical twins Dennis and Mark started primary school back in 1972 they too were selected to appear in the local paper. ""That was my first recollection of our photograph being in the paper because of us being twins,"" Dennis recalls. The number of identical (monozygotic) twins has actually remained fairly constant across time. So teachers are no more likely to ""see double"" in their classroom today than they were 45 years ago. Dennis and Mark Forsyth were at school together and have gone into business together In the UK, about one in every 250 maternities result in the birth of identical twins. However, classrooms do have a much greater number of non-identical twins than when Dennis and Mark started school. The number of non-identical (dizygotic) twins increased dramatically in the 80s and 90s in UK. During this time the number of maternities resulting in multiple births (ie twins, triplets or more) in Scotland rose from 1.04% in 1985 to a rate of 1.42% in 1995. England and Wales saw a similar rise in the rate of multiple births - 1.01% to 1.41% between 1984 and 1995. Non-identical twins account for two-thirds of all the twins born in the UK. This has been attributed to more older women having children, and also an increase in fertility treatment. Yet this rate of twins is not significantly higher than at previous peaks in the 1920s and 1950s. Inverclyde Council gathered together all the sets of twins starting school this year Some twins are mirror images of each other - for example one may be right handed and the other left-handed The Yoruba tribe of Nigeria has the highest twinning rate in the world  - three sets of twins in every 19 births China has one of the lowest with multiple births occurring in one in 300 births The average time between the delivery of the first and second twin is 17 minutes Scientists believe twin conceptions greatly outnumber twin births, with some saying that as many as one in eight births began with twins Source: Twins UK,external Rosie (left) and Mary are now 13 Data for England and Wales, available from 1938, shows the rate of multiple births was between 1.2% and 1.3% until the mid 1950s when there was a sharp decline. GRO(S) data suggests the rate of twins in Scotland reached 1.39% between 1916-20, and again from 1946-50 and 1951-55. So although there has been an upward trend since the 1980s, certainly in Scotland, there has not been an unusually high number of twins born in recent decades. In England and Wales, there has been a slow increase in the number of multiple births since 1995, rising from 1.41% to a peak of 1.62% in 2009. Since then the rate has plateaued and in 2015 it sat at 1.61%. Records by the National Record of Statistics suggest that since 1995 the rate in Scotland has fluctuated between a low of 1.37% in 1999 and a high of 1.62% in 2008, and sat at 1.51% in 2016. This means there has been no significant change in the number of twins enrolling in Scottish primary schools for almost 20 years, and in England the increase has been relatively small during this time period. Yet our nation's fascination with twins in their new school uniform seems set to continue. Rosie and Mary's mum Helen, who is now Scottish coordinator for Tamba (Twins and Multiple Births Association), says: ""Rosie quite liked the attention to begin with, but Mary found it overwhelming. ""I remember her coming home from school and saying 'mum do you ever have one of those days when you want to strip yourself out of your body and shout? I just wish people would leave me alone.'"" ""They do get asked ridiculous questions. ""'Are you psychic', 'can you feel when the other is in a bad mood' and even 'do you ever get confused as to who you are?"" It's August 1972 and Dennis (left) and Mark Forsyth start their school life together Dennis (left) and Mark Forsyth with their aunt Maureen Dennis recalls the clichÃ©d labels ""terrible twins"" and ""double trouble"". He says: ""With all the attention we played up quite a bit. ""It was just high jinks. It left the teacher with the choice of penalising both of us or neither of us. ""It was a card that was easily played."" Helen's children and Dennis and Mark both shared a classroom with their sibling. Dennis, who now owns and runs pubs in Fraserburgh with his brother Mark, recalls being split up in the later years of primary school. ""We did well at school but with us being twins we did act up a bit,"" he says. Helen says: ""It can be more challenging when twins start school. ""You have to think whether it is best for them to be in the same class or separated classes. ""It has to be judged on an individual basis. ""It's about recognising the relationship that a set of twins may have and how that may affect them."" World's oldest twins on secret to long life Celebrity twins: 8 stars you didn't know had a sibling Three sets of twins achieve 30 'A' grade Highers While these parents may have more to think about when their children start school, there is more information available than in the past. Organisations likeTamba provide guidance,externalon the additional issues faced by parents of multiples. There is no doubt times have changed and Scottish non-identical twins Angela Russell Taylor and Jacqueline Hall, aged 57, know that better than most. You might want to spare a thought for their parents, as Angela explains: ""Back in the day my poor mother didn't even know she was expecting twins. ""My mother had to go into hospital to lie for a week before we were born and she was transferred to Aberdeen [from Fraserburgh] on a Friday. ""My father was working and and when he turned up on the bus on the Sunday he had two babies. ""He had no idea. He must have got an awful shock.""

"Chemist Thomas Midgley insisted that tetraethyl lead was safe Leaded petrol was safe. Its inventor was sure of it. Facing sceptical reporters at a press conference in October 1924, Thomas Midgley dramatically produced a container of tetraethyl lead - the additive in question - and washed his hands in it. ""I'm not taking any chance whatever,"" Midgley declared. ""Nor would I... doing that every day."" Midgley was - perhaps - being a little disingenuous. He had recently spent several months in Florida, recuperating from lead poisoning. Some of those who'd made Midgley's invention hadn't been so lucky, which is why reporters were interested. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. On the Thursday of the week before Midgley's press conference, at a Standard Oil plant in New Jersey, a worker named Ernest Oelgert started hallucinating. By Friday, he was running around the laboratory, screaming in terror. On Saturday, with Oelgert dangerously unhinged, his sister called the police. He was taken to hospital and forcibly restrained. By Sunday, he was dead. Within the week, so were four of his colleagues - and 35 more were in hospital. Only 49 people worked there. None of this surprised workers elsewhere in Standard Oil's facility. They knew there was a problem with tetraethyl lead. As Gerald Markowitz and David Rosner note in their book Deceit and Denial: The Deadly Politics of Industrial Pollution, the lab where it was developed was known as ""the loony gas building"". Nor should it have shocked Standard Oil, General Motors or the DuPont Corporation, the three companies involved with adding tetraethyl lead to gasoline. An aerial photograph of DuPont's Deepwater factory site, where tetraethyl lead was developed The first production line in Ohio had already been shut down after two deaths. A third plant elsewhere in New Jersey had also seen fatalities. Workers kept hallucinating insects - the lab was known as ""the house of butterflies"". Better working practices could make tetraethyl lead safe to produce. But was it really sensible to add it to petrol, when the fumes would be belched out on to city streets? About a century ago, when General Motors had first proposed adding lead to petrol - in order to improve performance - scientists were alarmed. They urged the government to investigate the public health implications. Midgley breezily assured the surgeon general that ""the average street will probably be so free from lead that it will be impossible to detect it or its absorption"", although he conceded that ""no actual experimental data has been taken"". Chemist Thomas Midgley with the Delco laboratory test engine General Motors funded a government bureau to conduct some research, adding a clause saying it had to approve the findings. The bureau's report was published amid the media frenzy over Oelgert's poisoned workmates. It gave tetraethyl lead a clean bill of health and was met with some scepticism. Under pressure, the government organised a conference in Washington DC in May 1925. The debate there exemplified the two extremes of approach to any new idea that looks risky, but useful. In one corner: Frank Howard, vice-president of the Ethyl Corporation - a joint venture between General Motors and Standard Oil. He called leaded petrol a ""gift of God"", arguing that ""continued development of motor fuels is essential in our civilization"". Dr Alice Hamilton argued the benefits of adding lead to petrol were outweighed by the risks In the other corner: Dr Alice Hamilton, the country's foremost authority on lead. She argued leaded petrol was a chance not worth taking. ""Where there is lead,"" she said, ""some case of lead poisoning sooner or later develops, even under the strictest supervision."" Hamilton knew that lead had been poisoning people for thousands of years. In 1678, workers who made lead white - a pigment for paint - were described as suffering ailments including ""dizziness in the head, with continuous great pain in the brows, blindness, stupidity"". The Romans used lead in water pipes. Lead miners often ended up mad or dead - and some correctly intuited that low-level, long-term exposure was also unwise. ""Water conducted through earthen pipes is more wholesome than that through lead,"" wrote the civil engineer Vitruvius, 2,000 years ago. ""This may be verified by observing the workers in lead, who are of a pallid colour."" Many societies still grapple with the general question on which Howard and Hamilton disagreed: how much pollution is a price worth paying for progress? There's some evidence that as countries get richer, they tend initially to get dirtier and later clean up. Economists call this the ""environmental Kuznets curve"", and it makes intuitive sense. If you're poor, you prioritise material gains. As your income grows, you may choose to spend some of it on a nicer, safer environment. The Roman civil engineer Vitruvius warned against the dangers of lead 2,000 years ago But was lead-free petrol really such an expensive luxury? True, the lead additive solved a problem: it enabled engines to use higher compression ratios, which made cars more powerful. However, it was not the only way to solve the problem. Ethyl alcohol had much the same effect and wouldn't mess with your head, unless you drank it. Midgley knew this, having combined petrol with practically every imaginable substance, from iodine to camphor to melted butter. Why did the petrol companies push tetraethyl lead instead of ethyl alcohol? Researchers who have studied the decision remain puzzled. Cynics might point out that any old farmer could distil ethyl alcohol from grain. It couldn't be patented, or its distribution profitably controlled. Tetraethyl lead could. The US didn't tax lead in petrol until the 1970s, then finally banned it as part of clean air legislation, as the country moved down the far side of the environmental Kuznets curve. Two decades later, in the 1990s, rates of violent crime started to go down. There are many reasons why this might have happened, but the economist Jessica Reyes had an intriguing thought. Children's brains are especially susceptible to chronic lead poisoning. Is it possible that kids who didn't breathe leaded petrol fumes grew up to commit less violent crime? Reyes could test her hypothesis: different US states phased out leaded petrol at different times. By comparing the dates of clean air legislation with subsequent crime data,she concluded that more than half the drop - 56% - was because of cars switching to unleaded petrol.,external Other researchers have foundsimilar links between lead water pipes and urban homicide.,external You can put a dollar figure on the value of crime reduction, Reyes found. It's about 20 times higher than the cost of de-leading petrol - and that's before you count other downsides of children breathing lead, like worse performance in school. How did the US get this so wrong for so long? Asbestos continued to be widely used in construction despite the emerging evidence of its dangers It's a tale of disputed science and delayed regulation, much like you could tell about asbestos, or tobacco, or other products we now know slowly kill us. The problem is that people who want to ban things aren't always disinterested visionaries like Hamilton. Sometimes they're obstructive cranks. The only way to tell the difference is by conducting studies. And, as Gerald Markowitz and David Rosner point out, ""For the next four decades, all studies of the use of tetraethyl lead were conducted by laboratories and scientists funded by the Ethyl Corporation and General Motors"". How Diesel's engine changed the world Battery bonanza: From frogs' legs to mobiles and electric cars Why the falling cost of light matters How a razor revolutionised the way we pay for stuff And what of the scientist who first put lead in petrol? By all accounts, Midgley was a genial man who may even have believed his own spin about the safety of a daily tetraethyl lead handwash. But, as an inventor, his inspirations seem to have been cursed. His second major contribution to civilisation was the chlorofluorocarbon, or CFC, which improved refrigerators, but destroyed the ozone layer. In middle age, afflicted by polio, Midgley applied his inventor's mind to lifting his weakened body out of bed. He devised an ingenious system of pulleys and strings. They tangled around his neck, and killed him. Tim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economyis broadcast on the BBC World Service.

"An underwater camera relayed images of a wheel on the sea bed Wreckage believed to be from a World War Two bomber has been discovered in the North Sea by engineers working on a subsea electricity project. Thought to be an RAF Short Stirling heavy bomber, it was found by specialists scanning the sea bed with sonar equipment. They were conducting surveys along the proposed route of a UK-Norway cable link. Short Stirlings were used to transport supplies to the Norwegian resistance. An aviation expert enlisted by the Norwegian Institute for Cultural Heritage Research believes the wreck to be one of several Short Stirlings which disappeared without trace on missions to Norway over the winter of 1944-45. Nigel Williams, North Sea Link project director for National Grid, said: ""We use advanced sonar equipment to scan the sea-bed at depths that range between 100 and 600 metres (330-1,970ft). ""Any objects or structures detected are marked as target points. A number of Short Stirlings which flew on missions to Norway are unaccounted for ""If we feel they need closer inspection we can send down a remotely operated underwater vehicle or a 'drop cam' so it can tell us more about what we are looking at. ""When images of what appeared to an aircraft wheel came through, you can imagine our surprise."" Sue Raftree, of the of the Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre (JCCC) within the UK's Ministry of Defence, said discoveries at sea were ""relatively rare due to their location"" and ""positive evidence"" would be needed before it could be confirmed as a Short Stirling. She added: ""We would class this aircraft as a war grave. It is protected under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 which covers crashed military aircraft in both UK territorial and international waters."" The North Sea Link project - a joint effort between National Grid and Norway's Statnett - will see a 720km long cable run between Blyth, in Northumberland, and Norway, which will enable the organisations to trade electricity.

"German firms employ an estimated 400,000 workers in the UK Shared economic interests must be a priority in the Brexit negotiations, UK and German trade bodies have urged. The British Chambers of Commerce  (BCC) and the Association of German Chambers of Commerce (DIHK) said uncertainty over ""business critical"" issues such as workers' rights, tax and customs arrangements needed to be tackled. DIHK said the uncertainty was affecting German firms which traded with the UK. Most BCC members say they want ""at least"" a three-year transition period. The groups called for political leaders to ""build an atmosphere of mutual trust and constructive dialogue"", to deliver clarity and certainty for businesses. With the third round of Brexit negotiationsgetting under way on Monday, a number of critical issues were still unresolved, while there are ""hundreds"" of practical and technical issues which also needed to be negotiated, they said. ""There is real business appetite from both sides for a focus on practical, day-to-day business concerns, and a desire for clarity on future trading arrangements,"" said BCC director general Dr Adam Marshall. ""The UK and the EU must begin work on transitional arrangements, particularly on customs, so that firms on both sides of the Channel have the confidence to make investment decisions."" The UK is the third largest market for the export of German goods, while Germany is the UK's second biggest market for exports of goods and services. German firms employ an estimated 400,000 workers in the UK, while British firms employ around 220,000 workers in Germany. DIHK chief executive Martin Wansleben said German companies were concerned that Brexit would have ""a major negative impact"", with more trade barriers such as extra bureaucracy, and stricter border controls, leading to higher costs. ""The terms of exit are still completely unclear. ""Many of our members are reporting that they are already shifting investments away from the UK in anticipation of these barriers,"" he added.

"Waste plastic bags are a major environmental problem in many African countries A ban on plastic carrier bags has come into force in Kenya, which means that anyone found selling, manufacturing or carrying them could face fines of up to $38,000 or prison sentences of up to four years. The government says the ban will help protect the environment. But manufacturers of the bags have argued that 80,000 jobs could be lost. A court on Friday rejected a challenge to the ban. Kenyans are estimated to use 24 million bags a month. Several other African countries have outlawed plastic carrier bags, including Rwanda, Mauritania and Eritrea. Kenya's ban is seen as one of the toughest in the world, although officials say that for now, ordinary shoppers will be warned and have their bags confiscated. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories Piles of waste plastic bags are a common site across Kenya, as in many African countries. Animals often graze on the rubbish and the United Nations' Environment Programme says huge amounts of polythene bags are pulled out of livestock in Nairobi's abattoirs - as many as 20 bags per cow - raising fears of plastic contamination in beef. Cows in Kenyan abattoirs are often found with plastic bags in their stomachs Kenya's Environment Minister Judy Wakhungu says the plastic bags take between 20 and 1,000 years to biodegrade. ""Plastic bags now constitute the biggest challenge to solid waste management in Kenya. This has become our environmental nightmare that we must defeat by all means,"" she told the BBC. Kenyans are slowly getting used to carrying their shopping using bags made from materials other than plastic. At a local supermarket, I saw a man stuff a bunch of unwrapped spinach into his backpack. Other customers bought bags made from fabric for 10 Kenyan shillings (10 US cents; 7 British pence). The $38,000 fine with the alternative of a four-year jail term has many people preferring to comply with the ban. The National Environment Management Authority (Nema) says that enforcement officers can, for now, only confiscate plastic bags but not arrest offenders. Reports say traders in the city's main meat market are still using plastic bags. Others say people are using old sacks, newspapers and envelopes. When these are not available, consumers are said to be carrying their goods with their bare hands. Travellers coming into Kenya with duty-free plastic shop bags will be required to leave them at the airport under the new rules, Nema has said. This video can not be played When Uganda banned plastic bags, Rusia Orikiriza spotted a business opportunity. This is the third attempt in the past 10 years to ban plastic bags in Kenya. The government had given a six-month window for adjustment which expired on Sunday night. Manufacturers who use polythene to wrap products are exempted from the ban. In its ruling last week, the High Court dismissed a case filed by two plastic bags importers urging it to drop the ban. The court ruled that environmental concerns were more important than commercial interests. Research in Europe has shown that a paper bag must be used three times to compensate for the larger amount of carbon used in manufacturing and transporting it. Likewise a plastic ""bag for life"" must be used four times, and a cotton bag must be used 131 times. Uganda's enterprising bag lady.

"Nathan Blecharczyk co-founded Airbnb in 2008 Nathan Blecharczyk was disrupting business models before the term was popular. The co-founder of Airbnb started coding at the age of 12 and launched an online marketing business while in high school with clients in over 20 countries. Earning nearly $1m ($780,000) from his entrepreneurial endeavour, he paid his own way through Harvard University where he studied computer science. After moving on to several jobs in engineering, Mr Blecharczyk took a calculated risk and joined two friends to start Airbnb in 2008 - the same time the financial crisis was in full swing. When they couldn't find enough funding to get the business off the ground, they got creative -selling cereal in custom-designed boxes,externalat the Democratic Convention during the 2008 presidential election. To raise money, the founders sold cereal in custom-designed boxes during the 2008 presidential election They sold enough ""Obama O's"" and ""Cap'n McCain's"" to raise $30,000 and eventually gain seed funding to get the company off the ground. Today, the online home-sharing service is one of Silicon Valley's most valuable companies. Its estimated worth is around $30bn. So where does it go next? Mr Blecharczyk, 34, who is also the firm's chief strategy officer, says it's firmly focused on expanding in Asia-Pacific. The region has roughly 60% of the world's millennials like himself, young adults between the ages of 19 and 35 who are the fastest growing generation of consumers. However, only about 15% of Airbnb's four million global listings are based in Asia. ""It's a huge population and so much of that population is becoming middle class,"" says Mr Blecharczyk. ""The first thing people want to do when they have discretionary income is travel. So, I think we'd be at a huge loss if we weren't popular in Asia, but huge everywhere else."" Perhaps its biggest challenge is finding success in mainland China. The number of outbound travellers from the country rose 6% to 135 million in 2016, according to the United Nations' World Tourism Organisation. But entry into the mainland market isn't a guarantee for success. For example, global ride-hailing app Uber stalled in China after launching there in 2014. It wound up buying a minority stake in its home grown rival Didi Chuxing last year. Airbnb is one of Silicon Valley's most valuable companies, estimated to be worth around $30bn Airbnb has roughly 100,000 listings in China, where it faces stiff competition from other online short-term rental platforms, especially Tujia.com which has more than 400,000 listings. Why does Mr Blecharczyk think it will succeed? ""All the local companies have destinations within China. But they haven't branched out and they'll find it difficult to do so. We have four million homes in 191 countries, so we're really focusing on our brand differentiation."" It is also learning from the mistakes of other global brands like New Balance and Michael Jordan who have faced legal battles with trademark infringement. This past March, Airbnb unveiled a new name in China - Aibiying (ç±å½¼è¿) - meaning welcome each other with love - which is easier to pronounce for Mandarin speakers. The firm is currently having the Pinyin and Mandarin versions of the name trademarked in the mainland. In Barcelona, banners reading ""no tourist flats"" hang from balconies protesting against holiday rental apartments While Airbnb has been successful in disrupting the traditional business model of the short-term housing and hotel industry, it's had its fair share of resistance from regulators across the globe. This year, for example, New York and Barcelona cracked down on home-sharing platforms amid criticism they drive up rents and reduce local housing stock. Airbnb hosts who advertise illegal room-rentals face heavy fines. While Mr Blecharczyk didn't discuss this, a spokeswoman for the firm says: ""The governments we work with understand the benefits of Airbnb to their cities... But it can take time for legislation to catch up to new innovations."" In Asia-Pacific, home-sharing companies won a legal battle in June 2017 when the Japanese government gave them their approval. In June Airbnb won approval to operate in Japan But other parts of the region will be harder to penetrate, says Prof Brian King, associate dean of the School of Hotel and Tourism Management at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. ""Examples of more difficult operating environments include Hong Kong and Singapore which is host to Airbnb's Asia-Pacific operations,"" he says. ""Singapore has recently softened the minimum rental requirement from six to three months which offers some hope for faster expansion in future. Progress varies by country but overall Airbnb is competing effectively with local equivalents.""

Hours after riots erupted in the US state of Virginia, it became one of the first companies to take a public stand and remove white nationalist users from its platform who attended the Virginia rally. ""We believe in the power of travel to bring people together to foster inclusion,"" Mr Blecharczyk says. ""And when we see things happening in the world that are contrary to that, we have to ask ourselves do we want to live by our values or are they things we just write down because they sound nice."" For Mr Blecharczyk, experiential travel is his passion. When the father of two is not at home in northern California, he's hopping around the world testing out different Airbnb accommodation and trying out itsnew featureTrips. This offers experiences where travellers can get a glimpse into the local culture through activities like cooking classes, hiking and cultural tours. Airbnb was founded by (L-R) Nathan Blecharczyk, Joe Gebbia and Brian Chesky If you find yourself renting an Airbnb in San Francisco, you may find Mr Blecharczyk delivering you fresh towels to the residence. He's also a host. Although he said most people don't know who he is because the account is set up discreetly. His own choice in accommodations varies. Mr Blecharczyk has stayed in a castle in Italy with a vineyard, a modern bamboo treehouse in Bali on his anniversary, and several luxury homes in Hawaii. But while he may have made Forbes' list of youngest self-made billionaires, he's not afraid to rough it. The cheapest place he rented a few years ago was in Latvia for $18 a night. ""I stayed with this guy for three days who gave his bedroom to me and he slept on the couch in the living room, a very small modest place. But it was super cool. ""Sometimes when you stay with a host, those turn out to be the most interesting experiences. He literally spent the next 48 hours with me taking me around town. ""It turns out we both like to ride bikes, so we spent the whole day riding bikes. For roughly 50 bucks, it turned out to be a very memorable experience."" Are tourists still welcome after protests?

"This video can not be played The European Union is ""ready to intensify negotiations"" The European Union's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has expressed concern about progress so far, as the third round of Brexit talks gets under way. He warned that UK ""ambiguity"" must be removed and progress on ""separation"" issues made before any talks on the future EU-UK relationship. For his part, UK Brexit Secretary David Davis said both sides had to show ""flexibility and imagination"". The two men spoke at a brief media call before the talks got started. The two sides have played down the prospect of a breakthrough in this week's talks. BBC Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly said the mood had been set by a series of briefings ""that betray a good deal of mutual exasperation"". What is at stake in EU-UK talks? All you need to know about Brexit The EU's point man on Brexit talks The EU has accused the UK side of ""magical thinking"" on the issue of the Irish border. And the UK has said the Europeans are ""massively over-egging"" their financial demands on the UK in terms of an ""exit"" bill. The third of the main ""separation"" issues to be resolved covers the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU after Brexit. Mr Barnier said: ""We need you to take positions on all separation issues. This is necessary to make sufficient progress. We must start negotiating seriously. ""We need UK papers that are clear in order to have constructive negotiations. And the sooner we remove the ambiguity, the sooner we will be in a position to discuss the future relationship and a transitional period. ""The EU 27 (the EU members excluding the UK) and the European Parliament stand united - they will not accept that separation issues are not addressed properly. ""I am ready to intensify negotiations over the coming weeks in order to advance."" Who's who: The people negotiating Brexit Keep single market for Brexit transition - Labour Economic issues first, say UK and German firms Mr Davis said that the UK's goal remained to secure a ""mutually beneficial"" agreement that works for people and businesses across Europe. He said this week's ""technical talks"" would build on the July round and the papers the UK has recently published on its vision for its withdrawal from the EU. ""For the UK, the week ahead is about driving forward the technical discussions across all the issues. ""We want to lock in the points where we agree, unpick the areas where we disagree, and make further progress on a range of issues. ""And we're ready to roll up our sleeves and get down to work again once more."" Mr Barnier said on Twitter last week that the focus of the third round of negotiations would be ""orderly withdrawal"". Officials from both sides will meet in working groups to discuss the detail behind each side's proposals, before the round is closed by Mr Davis and Mr Barnier on Thursday. Setting the scene - political correspondent Chris Mason Fairly technical. No big bang. No breakthrough. But no breakdown - 10 words that don't make for a great headline, I'm afraid. But it is the mood music around the Brexit talks resuming in Brussels. Meanwhile, at Westminster, there is ""a new politics around Brexit"" according to Phillip Blond, the director of the centre right Respublica think tank on BBC Breakfast this morning. He was talking about Labour's policy shift: promising to stay in the single market and a customs union for a transition period after Brexit. The reaction, on Radio 5 live's Your Call this morning, suggests the instinct of those on the winning side of a referendum is that such a vote should mark the end of the conversation on a subject: the people have spoken and we should leave, and leave properly. And those on the losing side think it should mark the start of a conversation: about what leave should look like, or whether we should leave at all. The UK is set to leave the EU by the end of March 2019, following last year's referendum vote. In the first phase of negotiations, British and EU officials are meeting each month for four days in Brussels. On Sunday, the shadow Brexit secretary said Labour would keep the UK in the single market and customs union for a transitional period after leaving the EU. Keir Starmer said this was needed to avoid a ""cliff edge"" for the economy. Blackley and Broughton Labour MP Graham Stringer, who supported the Leave campaign, said what Sir Keir had said was ""completely at odds"" with what the party leader and other Labour figures had said. Mr Stringer told Radio 4's PM programme it had been made ""quite clear"" a post-Brexit UK could not stay in the customs union and single market. ""The Labour Party's position should be to honour the decision made in the referendum and try to support the government in getting the best deal we can."" Meanwhile, the British Chambers of Commerce and the Association of German Chambers of Commerce have jointly pleaded with politicians to put economic interests first in their Brexit discussions.

"BHS collapsed a year ago with the loss of 11,000 jobs More than half of the 160 BHS stores that closed after the retailer fell into administration a year ago are still sitting empty, according to new research. BBC business correspondent Emma Simpson visits one former site in south east London. This time last year Mandy Pickering and the other BHS staff in Bexleyheath, were selling off every last fixture and fitting they could. BHS was in its final hours, with nearly 90 years of trading about to come to an end. Now though, she's back on the same shop floor, but the space has been transformed. Another, smaller, department store chain, Morleys has moved in. ""It's the best thing that could've happened to this place,"" says Mandy. Sandy (left) and Mandy are pleased to be working for the new company She's one of around half a dozen former BHS staff who are now working for Morleys at this store in London. After 18 years at BHS, Sandy Glavin has also joined Mandy in working for Morleys. ""It's like moving out of a house, having it refurbished, and moving back in,"" says Sandy. ""We're very lucky. Morleys obviously saw the potential and made it so, so better - and everyone in the area thinks so as well."" It was also a great outcome for the new owners of the shopping centre where Morleys is now based. The former BHS store in Bexleyheath is now a Morleys Allan Lockhart, property director at NewRiver REIT, says: ""We acquired Broadway shopping centre in April 2016, shortly before BHS fell into administration, which could've created a large, unattractive vacancy at our shopping centre. ""However, we immediately began working closely with the council [the freeholder] to swiftly secure a desirable new anchor store. ""The introduction of a Morley's department store has been a big success, signalling revitalisation and a vote of confidence for the town."" Not every former BHS location has been so fortunate though, with 82% of the sites still unoccupied, according to new research by the Local Data Company, which tracks occupancy and vacancy rates across all of the UK's main shopping destinations. This drops to 60% or 96 shops if you strip out the stores which do have agreements in principle for the space to be taken, or are awaiting planning permission for redevelopment. Meanwhile, four stores have been demolished. One year on since the final BHS stores closed, only 25 have been re-let. So why have some stores been easier to occupy than others? ""I think it is a reflection of the challenges many high streets face, "" says Local Data Company director, Matthew Hopkinson. ""If you look at where retail has moved, much of it has gone to out of town retail parks and shopping centres. In other words, the traditional retailers who would've occupied a BHS have often moved elsewhere. ""Many of these units were also very large, with multiple floors, and costly to re-occupy. "" Stockport's BHS is one of the sites still stubbornly empty, taking up a large corner of the Merseyway shopping centre. The local council is investing hundreds of millions of pounds to revitalise the town centre. It recently bought the shopping centre, a 1960s style complex which had been starved of investment and ended up in receivership, as part of its regeneration plans. It doesn't own the BHS store, but its leader, Alex Ganotis, is convinced the vacant site has potential. ""It just doesn't look good that we've got a store this size in the middle of the Merseyway Shopping Centre,"" says Mr Ganotis. BHS shut up shop after administrators failed to find a buyer for the whole business ""It's a successful centre with 95% of units let, with high levels of footfall. We feel this store could easily be re-let."" And he is prepared to consider alternative uses for the site. ""Let's have a conversation,"" says Mr Ganotis. ""The council is willing to work with anyone who has new and imaginative ideas as we do to transform this area. ""It could be re-let as just one store or split up in to a number of different stores or it could be used for other purposes, like leisure."" BHS had been on the UK High Street for 88 years Creative solutions are being found. The BHS store on Edinburgh's Princes Street, for instance, is set to be transformed into a hotel with a rooftop restaurant, as well as retail on the ground floor. And in Taunton, a gym is being planned for the upper level of its former BHS store. Mr Hopkinson says: ""I think we've got to face the brutal facts that the councils and the landlords have got to come together and plan alternative uses. ""That could be food or beverage or it could be leisure, or it could be re-occupied as accommodation. But they won't be re-occupied as shops in the current climate,"" For some town centres, the consequences of the BHS collapse may be felt for many months if not years to come.
