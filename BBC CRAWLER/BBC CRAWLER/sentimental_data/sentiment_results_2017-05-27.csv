"Celtic completed a domestic treble without losing a game as Tom Rogic fired in a stoppage-time goal against Aberdeen to win the Scottish Cup. A beautifully controlled half-volley from Jonny Hayes after nine minutes was reward for a fine Dons start. But Celtic were level within two minutes as Stuart Armstrong was given too much time to pick out the far corner from the edge of the box. Late Celtic pressure paid off as Rogic fired low past goalkeeper Joe Lewis. Injured Tierney 'may need surgery' A thrilling 90 minutes concluded with Celtic not only lifting the cup for the first time since 2013 but becoming the first side in Scotland to complete an unbeaten treble. It is the 37th time the Hoops have lifted the world's oldest national football trophy and the fourth time they have won the treble - and their first since 2001. Derek McInnes' Dons, looking to end a 27-year wait to win the competition for an eighth time, were left as runners-up to Brendan Rodgers' side in the Premiership, the League Cup and now the Scottish Cup. Celtic had already won the Premiership and the League Cup It was a pulsating cup final right from the start, Aberdeen coming out with an edge to their play that put their illustrious rivals on the back foot. Yes, Rodgers' team had won five out of five in the head-to-heads this season, with an aggregate score of 12-2, but this was an altogether different Dons to previous versions. In this classic, they were a team reborn. In the beginning, they harried Celtic's go-to men. Graeme Shinnie and Kenny McLean were commanding. They lived in their faces defensively and showed plenty offensively. The feeling was that Aberdeen had to take the lead to make a true fight of this final and that is precisely what they did. Having shipped three early goals to Celtic in their last meeting, the Dons changed the narrative. From a Niall McGinn corner, Hayes came round the blindside of Leigh Griffiths and smashed a volley past goalkeeper Craig Gordon and beyond Kieran Tierney on the line. It was a goal of quality and a goal that electrified the huge Aberdeen support. Celtic are champions, though, and their true selves emerged only two minutes later when Aberdeen unwisely stood off Armstrong, who thumped in the equaliser low to Lewis's left. Two early goals and the intensity only cranked up from there. Midway through the half, there was controversy. Jonny Hayes opened the scoring against Celtic Jayden Stockley - selected up front ahead of Adam Rooney - swung an arm into Tierney's face and the young Celtic full-back immediately signalled that he was in bother. Blood poured from his mouth and, after treatment, he had to leave the field. Stockley has a reputation for over-zealous use of his arms and elbows and was deeply fortunate not to see red for a fourth time this season. He claimed it was accidental, but Celtic were having none of it. They were incensed. Callum McGregor shifted to left-back and Rogic came into the final and things went up another level. Gordon made a double save in quick order and then made another from a Stockley header. Celtic were rattled, they were totally unable to get a hold of the game in the face of the Dons' aggressive edge. It was Celtic, however, who should have gone ahead just before the break when a delicious Griffiths delivery was put over from point-blank range by Scott Sinclair. The toe-to-toe nature of the contest carried on brilliantly. Griffiths and Sinclair went close then Aberdeen swept downfield on a breakaway and a priceless chance was wasted. Hayes had mugged McGregor down the right and, with McLean running free in the box, all they had to do was get their communication right and a goal was certain. They didn't. Hayes hit his pass slightly behind McLean and the midfielder couldn't hook it in. Agony for Aberdeen. Celtic then moved up a gear and now it was the Dons pinned on the ropes. Lewis pushed a Patrick Roberts shot on to his post. Celtic's Kieran Tierney had to go off after suffering a smack in the mouth from Jayden Stockley From the resulting corner, Celtic's Mikael Lustig tugged the ball just wide. The game opened up as wide as the Clyde. Aberdeen's Ash Taylor headed away from under his own crossbar, Dedryck Boyota headed just over, Gordon made a fine save from Shinnie and then it was Lewis's turn again, saving wonderfully from Griffiths. Lewis was immense for the Dons. As the final wore on, Celtic took an ever-tightening grip. Rodgers' side pressed and pressed and a tiring Aberdeen threw their bodies in front of shots to keep alive. Their scrambling defence was constant and heroic. But it wasn't enough. With all at Hampden steeling themselves for extra-time, Rogic ran at Aberdeen down the right, going past the utterly jaded Andrew Considine and slamming his shot low under Lewis. Extraordinary. The heartbroken Dons had made it a mighty battle, but Celtic showed their incomparable will and their domestic greatness. The history makers had done it again. A treble won. Truly, they are something special. Injured Tierney 'may need surgery' Celtic players revel in treble success.

"Second one-day international, Southampton: England 330-6 (50 overs):Stokes 101 (79), Buttler 65* (53) South Africa 328-5 (50 overs):De Kock 98, Plunkett 3-64 England won by two runs Match scorecard Mark Wood bowled a brilliant final over to give England a two-run win over South Africa that sealed the one-day international series in Southampton. The Proteas needed seven from the 50th over, but Wood limited them to four. Ben Stokes,an injury doubt before the game,was dropped twice in making a 79-ball 101 that helped England to 330-6. Quinton de Kock (98), AB de Villiers (52) and David Miller (71 not out) led the chase, but Chris Morris could not hit the last ball for four. The series concludes at Lord's on Monday in what will be England's final game before they begin the Champions Trophy against Bangladesh at The Oval on Thursday. Not only will they start as favourites with the bookmakers, but also on the back of a series victory against the world number ones. Relive England's thrilling victory with full video highlights Mark Wood conceded only 48 runs from his 10 overs England's batting is their great strength in ODIs - they have scored runs more quickly than other side for the past two years - but their bowling could be seen as a weakness, leaking runs faster than all teams but Sri Lanka. Wood had his winter wrecked by injury, but his pace offers a wicket-taking threat, albeit he struggled in the opening win atHeadingley on Wednesday. South Africa were ahead of the chase throughout, even after De Kock and De Villiers departed in the space of four overs after sharing a stand of 96. Miller arrived to muscle the ball to the leg side, while Morris punished any error in length - at one point Wood and Jake Ball conceded 20 runs in the space of six balls. With 10 balls remaining, South Africa needed only 10, but Ball regained his composure to make that seven from six. England took their time, the impressive Wood consulted with captain Morgan after every delivery and South Africa barely laid bat on ball. Asked to bat, England were wobbling at 80-3 and could have been in a worse position. Stokes was reprieved on nought off the spin of debutant spinner Keshav Maharaj - Hashim Amla did not even get a hand on the slip catch - and, from the next ball, wicketkeeper De Kock spilled a tougher chance. The left-hander made the Proteas pay in a second ODI ton full of power on the leg side and down the ground. He shared stands of 95 with Morgan and 77 with Jos Buttler, who overcame an uncertain start to post a welcome 65 not out from 53 balls. Stokes cleared the leg-side fence three times, his second 50 coming in only 29 balls before he was caught at long-off from the bowling of Maharaj. He then took the ball to claim England's first wicket - Amla caught at extra cover - but the knee problem limited the Durham man to only three overs in what is undoubtedly a concern ahead of the Champions Trophy. In the first ODI at Headingley, South Africa made a strong start in a chase of 340, only to fall away. Then they contributed to their own downfall, but here they were squeezed out by England. While De Kock and De Villiers were together, South Africa were cruising. De Kock, who survived a very tough caught-and-bowled chance to Stokes on 22, targeted mid-wicket, while De Villiers characteristically scored through 360 degrees. But after De Villiers gloved a Liam Plunkett short ball through to wicketkeeper Buttler, an increasingly twitchy De Kock edged a Moeen Ali off-break to the same man. Miller received little support from Farhaan Behardien, but the arrival of Morris once again made the highest successful run-chase by a visiting team in England seem possible. That was until Wood's final over. England captain Eoin Morgan:""Those are the sort of games you really want to win, you learn a more from these games. ""It really got away from us for a while but Mark Wood coming up with the goods at the end was awesome. ""The Champions Trophy is bound to be tight so this preparation is ideal. It helps us massively for the tournament. ""Woody usually bowls yorkers but he adjusted to conditions at the end with the short ball and it was really impressive."" Man of the match Ben Stokes:""Mark Wood bowled really well and it was an amazing effort from him. ""It shows what a bit of pace does - it makes it harder for batsmen at the end to strike the ball cleanly. ""Batting is fine but my bowling is affected by my knee. I'm not quite sure what it is but I have a couple more scans to come and hopefully it will settle down."" South Africa captain AB de Villiers:""I thought the boys played exceptionally well but England got their plans right and showed guts at the finish. ""The result is unfortunate but I'm proud of the way we played. I thought we paced it really well but we couldn't cross the line. ""I think our fielding was costly. We were a little bit careless at times, conceding one or two more boundaries than we should have done."" Former England off-spinner Graeme Swann:""That's a brilliant series win and on the brink of a major tournament in this country it's a fantastic win from that situation. Somehow Jake Ball and Mark Wood have only gone for a run a ball - quite brilliant death bowling. ""South Africa can't believe they haven't won that. England have snatched victory from the jaws of defeat.""

"Exeter won their first English title seven years after winning promotion to the top flight Aviva Premiership final Wasps (10) 20 Tries:Gopperth, DalyCons:Gopperth 2Pens:Gopperth 2 Exeter Chiefs (14) 23 Tries:Nowell, DollmanCons:Steenson 2Pens:Steenson 3 Exeter held firm to edge past Wasps in extra time and win their first ever Premiership title in a classic final. Jack Nowell finished in the corner, and Chiefs led 14-3 after Phil Dollman battled his way over. Jimmy Gopperth grabbed a try and Elliot Daly got another as Wasps rallied either side of half time, but Gareth Steenson kicked a last-minute penalty to make it 20-20 at full time. Steenson then slotted the winning kick with three extra-time minutes left. The title-winning three points came after the Devon club were denied a try by the television match official moments earlier. It was the first Premiership final to have gone to extra time since 2014, when Northampton beat Saracens in dramatic contest, and the 79,657 fans at Twickenham were braced for penalty kicks before Wasps were penalised at the scrum. Relive Exeter's extra-time victory over Wasps Dai Young's side had won their last 10 finals in all competitions, including four Premiership deciders, but fell agonisingly short in their first since 2008. But Exeter, who were beaten by Saracens in last season's showpiece event at Twickenham, are now unbeaten in 17 league matches dating back to October, equalling a record set by Leicester in the 1999-2000 campaign. Wasps were far from their fluent best before the break, as they struggled to get on the ball and made a number of errors. England wing Nowell opened the scoring in fantastic style from a rehearsed line-out, taking the ball at pace from Luke Cowan-Dickie before weaving his way to the line. Jack Nowell celebrates scoring Exeter's first try Exeter made their dominance count when veteran Dollman, given his first Wales call-up this week, held off Christian Wade to score from Ollie Devoto's offload. Rob Baxter's side should have held a larger advantage at the midway point, but turned down several kickable penalties and a slick Gopperth try with the last move of the half gave Wasps a lifeline at 14-10. The Coventry side went ahead in fortunate style, Wade's attempted kick and run bouncing perfectly for Daly to dot down, and it was 17 unanswered points when Gopperth kicked a penalty for free-flowing Wasps. Jack Yeandle (left) embraces match-winning team-mate Gareth Steenson With less than 20 minutes of normal time remaining, Steenson made a simple penalty to edge Chiefs to within three points, but the Wasps pack defended ferociously to prevent their opponents scoring a match-winning try. With just one final wave of attacks to hold out, the otherwise excellent Nathan Hughes was penalised and Steenson was again on target to force an extra time of two sets of 10 minutes. The first half of extra time was scoreless, though Exeter looked the fresher side and with just minutes remaining they were denied a try by the TMO, who could not see whether the ball had been grounded under a sea of bodies after 25 phases. But the Devon club did not relent and Steenson, who guided the side to top-flight promotion from the Championship in 2010, kicked the decisive points. Just 20 years ago Exeter were winning promotion from the third tier of English rugby, having previously played even further down the pyramid. The next big step in their rise to the top was coming up from the largely semi-professional second-tier competition in 2010, when the south-west side beat Bristol in a two-legged play-off final. While most promoted clubs have struggled to establish themselves in the Premiership, going straight back down or enduring financial difficulties, Baxter's Chiefs have somehow improved season upon season. In the one season their Premiership finishing position worsened, the 2013-14 campaign, they won the Anglo-Welsh Cup - the club's first ever major trophy. They did not quite do themselves justice in last year's Premiership final, as they were outfoxed by Saracens, but Exeter have responded in typical fashion to right those wrongs. The fact that three of the side that guided them up from the Championship - Steenson, Dollman and Ben Moon - all started against Wasps adds to the romanticism of the story, which has culminated in Exeter becoming the seventh side to be crowned champions in the league's present format. Exeter head coach Rob Baxter celebrates their win with his wife Jo and son Jack Exeter Chiefs head coach Rob Baxter told BBC Sport:""It does feel like it's been a long journey getting here. ""I've never once woken up feeling it's a dream because the people who have lived and breathed it every day know how hard we've worked and they know the sacrifices that have been made. ""As great as today is it can't be the defining thing about Exeter - if this is it now and we're on a nice downward spiral from now, I'll be hugely disappointed and I will have massively failed in a large part of my job."" Wasps director of rugby Dai Young told BBC Sport:""I'm trying not to be too disappointed because I think we've had a fantastic season and we showed some real qualities. ""We also showed we're a work in progress - there's still things for us to improve on and keep working on. ""On occasions we make it hard for ourselves but certainly the spirit and commitment was there - it hurts at the minute and there's not much I can say to the players to make it better for them."" There was a minute's silence observed at Twickenham in tribute to victims of the Manchester attack earlier in the week Gopperth scored all 10 of Wasps' first-half points Wasps' Nathan Hughes conceded the late penalty that allowed Exeter to level Gareth Steenson levelled scores at 20-20 to force the game into extra time, then won it with another penatly Wasps:Le Roux; Wade, Daly, Gopperth, Bassett; Cipriani, Robson; Mullan, Taylor, Swainston, Launchbury (capt), Symons, Haskell, Young, Hughes.
