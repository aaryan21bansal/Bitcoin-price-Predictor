"This video can not be played Gales and flooded cars in Saint Martin Hurricane Irma has caused considerable damage on French island territories in the Caribbean, and casualties are expected, France's president says. The impact of Irma on St Martin and St Barts would be ""hard and cruel"", Emmanuel Macron added. His overseas affairs minister later confirmed at least two people dead and another two seriously injured. The storm damaged more than 90% of buildings on Barbuda, Antigua and Barbuda's prime minister said. The category five hurricane, the highest possible level, is now passing over the northern Virgin Islands. The most powerful storm in a decade, with wind speeds of 295km/h (185mph),is also forecast by the US National Hurricane Center,externalto pass near or just north of Puerto Rico, then near or just north of the coast of the Dominican Republic on Thursday. Flooded streets in Saint Martin Hurricane Irma first hit Antigua and Barbuda, before moving on to St Martin and Saint BarthÃ©lemy - the French holiday destination popularly known as St Barts. Significant damage is also being reported in the Dutch section of St Martin, known as Sint-Maarten. French Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb said the hurricane had caused major floods, and destroyed buildings, including four of the ""most solid"" on the island. Hurricane Irma: All you need to know The world's most powerful storms How do you calculate the cost of a hurricane? Thousands of people have been evacuated from at-risk areas across the Caribbean. Residents have flocked to shops for food, water, and emergency supplies, and airports have closed on several islands which are popular holiday destinations. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the government was in touch with British overseas territories caught up in Irma, and was doing ""everything we can to help those afflicted"". In the US, Florida's Key West area has ordered a mandatory evacuation, with landfall expected at the weekend. Irma as seen from space at 11:30 GMT on Wednesday The French government said earlier it was worried about thousands of people who had refused to seek shelter on the islands. Officials in the French territory of Guadeloupe confirmed the following damage: On St Barts, the fire brigade station has been flooded with a metre of water, with engines out of service and crews sheltering on an upper floor; there is a total power blackout; many roofs have been blown off On St Martin, the prefecture building has been partially destroyed, with the prefect (chief officer) and 23 other people sheltering in a secure room; the fire station is out of order; there is a power blackout; several roofs at the police station have been blown off In the Dutch territory, known as Sint-Maarten, the airport has been closed withphotos,externalshowing debris strewn across the departures area and outside.

Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne announced the huge destruction on Barbuda, population 1,600, ina satellite phone call to local broadcaster ABS TV and radio,external. However, Antigua, population 80,000, escaped major damage, with no loss of life, he said earlier. US President Donald Trump has declared a state of emergency for Florida, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, mobilising federal disaster relief efforts. In Florida's Key West, visitors will be required to leave on Wednesday morning, with residents due to follow in the evening. ""Watching Hurricane closely,"" Mr Trump tweeted on Wednesday. ""My team, which has done, and is doing, such a good job in Texas, is already in Florida. No rest for the weary!"" Parts of Texas and Louisiana are dealing withthe damage done by Hurricane Harveyin late August. But it is not yet clear what impact Hurricane Irma might have on the US mainland. The US House of Representatives on Wednesday approved roughly $8bn (Â£6.1bn) in initial emergency aid for states affected by Harvey. The measure will now go to the Senate. Texas recovery from Harvey 'could cost $180bn' Uninsured and anxious, victims return home How hard has Harvey hit the local economy? A third storm further out in the Atlantic behind Irma swelled to category one hurricane strength on Wednesday,the US National Hurricane Center confirmed,external. Hurricane Jose has a maximum sustained wind speed of 75km/h. Seeing multiple storms developing in the same area of the Atlantic in close succession is not uncommon. Rarer though is the strength of the hurricanes, with Harvey making landfall in the US as a category four. There have never been two category four storms making landfall on the US mainland during the same season, since records began. Are you in the region?

"This video can not be played Ever had a date that ended like this? A woman who threw her poo out of her date's toilet window because it ""would not flush"" had to be rescued after she got stuck trying to retrieve it. The amateur gymnast was on a first date with Bristol student Liam Smith when she ""panicked"" and threw the faeces out of the window. It did not land in the garden, but became wedged between two non-opening windows. After climbing in head first after it, she became wedged. Mr Smith had to call the fire service for help. The story appeared on a crowdfunding page, set up by the University of Bristol student. If this story yanks your chain, you might also like these: Tales of your worst dates Woman 'teleported' inside toilet Boy finds python lurking in toilet Hapless burglar caught stuck in window Mr Smith, who is raising funds to fix his broken window, wrote that he was on a Tinder date with the woman and they went back to the shared house he lives in. ""We'd had a really nice evening,"" he said. ""We'd had a meal at a well-known chicken restaurant, had a few beers and then gone back to mine for a bottle of wine and a film."" After the fire service had ""composed themselves,"" Mr Smith said they set to work freeing his date from the window He said the woman went to the toilet and when she came back she had a ""panicked look in her eye"" and told him what she had done. He said the toilet window opened into a narrow gap separated by another double glazed window. ""It was into this twilight zone that my date had thrown her poo,"" he said. He went to find a hammer to smash the window, but she decided to ""climb in head first"" after the ""offending package"" and became jammed. ""I was starting to grow concerned, so I called the fire brigade and once they had composed themselves, they set to work removing her from the window."" Liam Smith relived the post-Nando's incident in a BBC interview The ""offending package"" was trapped between two ""non-opening"" double glazed windows Although the woman was rescued unharmed, Mr Smith said his bathroom window was destroyed. ""I'm not complaining, they did what they had to do,"" he said. ""Problem is, I've been quoted north of Â£300 to replace the window and as a postgraduate student, that is a significant chunk of my monthly budget."" Mr Smith originally set a crowdfunding target of Â£200, but has already raised more than Â£1,200. He said he and his date had decided to split the extra cash between two charities, one supporting firefighters and another that builds and maintains flushing toilets in developing countries. Unsurprisingly, the woman does not want to be named but Mr Smith said he had seen her since and ""who knows what the future holds"". ""We had a lovely night on the second date but it's too early to say if she's the one. But we got on very very well and she's a lovely girl,"" he said. ""And we've already got the most difficult stuff out of the way first."" Avon Fire and Rescue service confirmed it had received a call and freed a woman trapped between external and double glazing.

"Quamari and his mother Lillian Serunkuma A 15-year-old boy has been sentenced for stabbing to death another teenager outside his school gates in an act described as ""pure evil"". Quamari Serunkuma-Barnes, also 15, was chased and stabbed three times outside Capital City Academy in Willesden, west London, in January. The defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was found guilty of murder after a trial at the Old Bailey. He was detained for at least 14 years. Following the trial, the boy admitted attacking Quamari. In a statement, he said: ""I don't know why I did it. I was scared and confused. ""I'm telling the truth for Quamari's mum and dad. I'm sorry. ""I didn't mean Quamari to get so hurt. ""I'm not a murderer. I didn't want him to die. The motive behind the killing remains unknown ""I want to have a different life but I don't know how. I'm trying."" In a statement read out in court, Quamari's mother Lillian Serunkuma described the killer's actions as ""pure evil"". ""You never gave Quamari a second chance to defend himself. ""You took his life in a cold and malicious way.""

He said: ""It is very unusual to admit a murder after conviction. It is a mature decision rather than taking your chances in the Court of Appeal."" But he added: ""This is a bad case of its kind because Quamari can have done nothing to merit an attack of this severity.

"The Air Accident Investigation Branch has sent an investigation team to the airport One person has died after a light aircraft crashed onto the runway at an airport in north Wales. Police were called to Caernarfon Airport at 18:29 BST on Wednesday after the plane crashed and burst into flames on the runway. The pilot was pronounced dead at the scene and an investigation has begun. Ch Insp Sharon McCairn, of North Wales Police, said: ""A cordon is in place around the site and we are urging the public to remain clear of the area."" The Air Accident Investigation Branch has sent a team to the airport. Mark Hancock, a guest at the nearby Morfa Lodge holiday park, said he saw what looked like a twin-engine plane crash as it came into land. ""The first thing I noticed was that the plane had no landing gear on, its wheels weren't down,"" he said. ""It was coming in way too fast and then the bottom of it did a sort of belly flop on the runway. It caught fire and then it bounced back up into the air and when it hit the ground again it burst into flames. ""It was like a massive fireball and there was black smoke everywhere. We could feel the heat from where we were standing. There were bits of plane all over the runway."" Caernarfon Airport, near Dinas Dinlle, operates training flights and is also home to the Wales Air Ambulance and the HM Coastguard Helicopters operated by Bristow.

"Facebook says it has discovered a Russian-funded campaign to promote divisive social and political messages on its network. The company says $100,000 (Â£77,000) was spent on about 3,000 ads over a two-year period, ending in May 2017. The ads did not back any political figures specifically but instead posted on topics including immigration, race and equal rights. Facebook said it was co-operating with a US investigation into the matter. It is handing over its evidence to special prosecutor Robert Mueller,who is overseeing an inquiry into alleged Russian interference in last year's US presidential election. Russia: The 'cloud' over the Trump White House Can US election hack be traced to Russia? The advertisements directed users towards around 470 accounts that spread false information or were otherwise in breach of Facebookâs terms and conditions, the site said. âThe ads and accounts appeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum,â the company said in ablog post published on Wednesday,external. The company said elsewhere it believed, but could not independently confirm, that the accounts were created by the so-called Internet Research Agency, a St Petersburg-based group known for posting pro-Kremlin messages on social media. The accounts in question have now been shut down, Facebook's chief security officer Alex Stamos added. The campaign was uncovered as part of Facebook's internal investigation into ways in which the network may have been abused during the last US presidential election campaign. The site, and its founder Mark Zuckerberg, came under extremely heavy criticism for not taking the issue seriously in the days following President Donald Trump's election win. Mr Zuckerberg dismissed the notion that ""fake news"" on Facebook had swayed the election as ""crazy"". In Wednesday's post, Mr Stamos went into detail about how the campaign was uncovered. ""[We] looked for ads that might have originated in Russia, even those with very weak signals of a connection and not associated with any known organised effort. ""This was a broad search, including, for instance, ads bought from accounts with US IP addresses but with the language set to Russian - even though they didn't necessarily violate any policy or law. ""In this part of our review, we found approximately $50,000 in potentially politically related ad spending on roughly 2,200 ads."" US-Russia sanctions: How did we get here? US official: Russia 'hacked' 21 US states in election News of Facebook's discovery came on the same day Facebook was accused of inflating its advertising reach. According to a reportin the Wall Street Journal,external, Facebook told potential advertising partners that it could reach 41 million 18-24 year olds in the US. However, according to official US census data, there should only be 31 million people of that age in the country. Richard Newman, a lawyer specialising in online marketing, said the scale of the issue was too small to cause Facebook any significant headache - but the company did need to get on top of the issue. ""Facebook clearly has a dominant position in social media space and internet advertising,"" he told the BBC. ""I don't really foresee that as a problem at all as long as they take preventative measures with respect to policing fake news and trying to gauge the authenticity of advertisements on its platform."" Update 7 September 2017: Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said Russia had nothing at all to do with the campaign. ""We have never heard of this, we do not know anything about this, let alone have anything to do with these affairs,"" he was quoted as saying by the state news agency Tass. By Andrey Soshnikov, BBC Russian Service The Internet Research Agency is one of the many names used by a media conglomerate known informally as the ""Russian troll factory"". The wider operation is linked to Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, a friend of President Vladimir Putin since the 1990s. His nickname is ""Putin's cook"" since he was actually a cook, whose food was admired by the president. The business has never publicly been declared but is thought to be building pro-Kremlin public opinion via a big number of fake internet identities. Such activity is sometimes known as astro-turfing or internet sock-puppeting. Russian trolls also engage in cyberbullying and harassing people with democratic views on the internet. Although Mr Prigozhin has never acknowledged his involvement, about a dozen whistleblowers from the ""troll factory"" have talked to the media. At least one popular pro-Trump, anti-Clinton Facebook community called Secured Borders was managed from the operation, according a report by RBC magazine. Secured Borders boasted 140,000 subscribers. One of its posts, published at the height of the election campaign and heavily advertised on Facebook, reached four million people on the social network. It was ""liked"" more than 300,000 times and shared more than 80,000 times. The Secured Borders community has since been deleted. ___________ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370 Russia protests over US compound 'search' Grand jury used in Trump-Russia probe Reality Check: What are the sanctions against Russia?

"This video can not be played Jo Johnson: ""I do not want to read about VC pay in the newspapers"" Spiralling rates of pay for university vice-chancellors are to be curbed by a series of new measures being set out by the universities minister. Jo Johnson urged institutions to show restraint, when it emerged that dozens of university heads were earning Â£300,000, and some more than Â£400,000. Now, he wants universities to justify pay rates topping Â£150,000 a year to a new regulator, the Office for Students. Details of staff earning above Â£100,000 year would also have to be made public. Universities have argued that their leaders are managing large institutions, have enormous responsibilities and huge budgets, and therefore command large salaries. Mr Johnson called for ""transparency and openness"" in the way pay is set for university heads and ""greater restraint"" in vice-chancellor and senior-level salaries. ""We [need to] put an end to the spate of damaging headlines we've seen over recent weeks,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Johnson is setting out the plans in a speech to university heads at the annual conference of the umbrella body Universities UK, in west London on Thursday. The plans, which will be consulted on, could see the Office for Students using its powers to impose fines if institutions do not give good reasons for high pay. The new regulator, which is to be headed by Nicola Dandridge, the former chief executive of Universities UK, will also issue new guidance on the role and independence of pay committees. Ms Dandridge herself volunteered for an 18% pay cut from Â£200,000 a year to Â£165,000, a move Mr Johnson said was ""out of the spirit of public service"". Mr Johnson also told Today that student fees would rise next year with inflation. ""It's important there's confidence fees are put to the uses we intend them to be  - we want fees to deliver great teaching and world-class research,"" he said. Mr Johnson said the debate over student finance had increased public scrutiny of how universities spent the money they received. ""When students and taxpayers invest so heavily in our higher education system, excessive vice-chancellor salaries send a powerful signal to the outside world."" He added: ""Exceptional pay can only be justified by exceptional performance, which is why I will ask the new Office for Students to take action to ensure value for money and transparency for students and the taxpayer."" Prof Janet Beer, president of Universities UK and vice-chancellor of the University of Liverpool, said in her conference address that it was understandable that high pay was being questioned. ""It is right to expect that the process for determining pay for senior staff is rigorous and the decision-making process is transparent. ""It is also reasonable to expect that decisions are explained and justified."" She also addressed the issue of the student funding, calling on the government to consider providing targeted maintenance grants for those most in need of this support. The government should also ""consider reducing the interest rate payable, not for all, but specifically for low- and middle-income earners through changes in earning thresholds to which interest rates apply"", she said. The overall cost of salary and benefits for vice-chancellors rose 2.5% to an average remuneration of Â£257,904 in 2015-16 on the previous year. When pension contributions are included, the rise was 2.2% to an average of Â£280,877. And several high profile cases revealed pay levels substantially higher than this. Imperial College London pays its vice-chancellor, Alice Gast, a Â£430,000 yearly wage and pension package. She was recruited from an American university some years ago where she was paid Â£679,754. The University of Birmingham pays Sir David Eastwood Â£426,000 in salary and pensions. Sir David was previously chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council since 2006 - the post responsible for overseeing the university finance system in England. University of Exeter vice-chancellor, also a former chairman of Universities UK, Sir Steve Smith receives a Â£426,000 package, according to the Times Higher Education newspaper. The Russell Group, an association which represents 24 leading UK universities, says its institutions ""recognise the need to act responsibly"". Dr Tim Bradshaw, acting director of the group, said Russell Group universities have demonstrated strong and effective governance around senior remuneration and will continue to do so. But, he stressed, universities operate in a competitive market, saying salaries help to maintain the UK's position as a ""world leader in science and innovation"". General secretary of the University and College Union Sally Hunt said soaring vice-chancellor pay, which her union has highlighted over the years, had become a real embarrassment for the higher education sector. She accused vice-chancellors of hiding behind ""shadowy remuneration committees"".

" As night falls on Falluja and darkness takes the edge off the blistering summer heat, Anas al-Janabi switches on the lights. A creaky ferris wheel, with saucer-like gondolas in primary colours, starts to turn. Below, customers begin to arrive, attracted by an oasis of coloured lights and booming music. There are dodgems and spinning teacup rides. There’s popcorn and a bearded Smurf, shimmying like a bellydancer despite the heat and his bulky yellow costume. Children don party hats and families take selfies - relaxed moments in a city that has been on edge for most of the past 14 years. But there’s a tentative air to it all. The children laugh and run but their parents seem wary. Perhaps it’s the memories of 2014 when Falluja became the first city to fall to so-called Islamic State. After a year of widespread protests across the Sunni heartland of Anbar province, often put down with violence by Iraq’s Shia-dominated government, Falluja fell to an assortment of local tribal fighters and members of IS. The group found themselves in control of, among other things, a newly built funfair. Despite their reputation for brutally enforced austerity, IS were happy to use Falluja’s fairground for their own ends. In September 2015 the group released pictures purporting to show the “grand opening”. The images were supposed to show happy normality within the self-declared caliphate. “But there was no music,” says the owner Anas al-Janabi. “Only slogans.” Anas al-Janabi IS established a media centre and court on the premises, he says. Both were later targeted in airstrikes. The entrepreneur had spent a year, and $1.4m (£1.1m), getting his fairground ready in 2013. It was bad timing. “We barely managed to get the business started when Daesh took over,” he says, using the common Arabic acronym for Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham/the Levant - Isis or Isil. Two years later, in 2016, IS were driven out of Falluja by the Iraqi army. Anas could finally return to the city but his precious fairground had not been spared by IS. “When they left, they burned down the café and the area was completely flattened,” says Anas. Sahira Karim, Falluja resident Now, with most of the city’s inhabitants back, Anas says he’s on a mission to cheer up people who have endured terrible suffering. The funfair re-opened in May and families are starting to come back. “They have forgotten what joy means,” says Anas, surveying his handiwork. “By the grace of God, happiness will return to Falluja and its decent people.” But he understands why the crowds are a little thin - why customers keep glancing over their shoulders. A month ago, while the fairground was packed, a bomb exploded nearby. No-one was killed, but the impact on business was immediate. Anas has been offering discounts and prizes in an effort to lure people back. “We can say that Daesh is finished, but we still feel fear,” says Sahira Karim, visiting the fairground with her husband Raif and her grandson, Mohammed. Sitting quietly beside his grandmother, eight-year old Mohammed lacks the carefree demeanour of the children all around him. His cheeks, temple and the bridge of his nose are scarred and he rests a badly damaged left hand on the table. He appears to have lost all sensation in the fingers. Eight-year-old Mohammed lost a leg in 2014 When he gets up and walks, it is with the studied concentration of someone still getting used to living with a prosthetic. Sahira tells how he was playing in the garden, early in 2014, when an artillery round exploded, inflicting terrible injuries. Doctors amputated Mohammed’s right leg. He still suffers nightmares. Sahira is mentally scarred too. She lives in a state of constant anxiety, feels nervous at the park, and particularly hates checkpoints. The legacy of IS runs deep. “Frankly, fear is inside my heart. I always feel something will happen. This is what they left behind.” When government forces re-entered Falluja in June 2016, they uncovered evidence of the group’s reign of fear. In makeshift prisons, they found tiny metal cages in windowless rooms, where prisoners were kept in cramped, filthy conditions. 2016: Cages in a former IS prison, pictured shortly after the fall of Falluja In some cages, prisoners had been forced to stand, or kneel. There were signs of torture, and documents which suggested people had been jailed for smoking or violating the self-declared caliphate’s strict dress code. Accounts of life in Falluja during the IS years are hard to come by. Those who stayed in the city during the group’s two-and-a-half years in charge give guarded accounts, coloured by what they think government officials, or journalists, want to hear. At first, it seems, the new masters behaved well, told people not to be afraid and said they were there to help. After two years of increasingly bitter relations with the government in Baghdad, many were willing to give the men in masks a chance. Anti-government fighters in Falluja, 2014 In this conservative, Sunni city, the notion of a state governed along stricter religious lines was not unwelcome to some residents. In fact, some Fallujis even celebrated the arrival of IS, calling it “the Islamic Conquest”. But the honeymoon didn’t last long, as the jihadists sought to impose their increasingly medieval vision. Masked men came to the city... within two days they controlled everything.” Rules against smoking and Western-style haircuts were rigorously enforced. Women were told to stay at home unless accompanied by a male relative. Stories emerged of beheadings in the main market. Disloyal clerics and former policemen were particular targets. And as the war with the government in Baghdad intensified, IS introduced conscription. Huge numbers of people fled, scattering to other Iraqi cities or to camps for internally displaced people (IDPs) on the desert fringes of the Euphrates valley. Local businessman Abdul Rahman Modhan went to the Kurdish city of Irbil, only returning once government control had been re-established. He vividly remembers the days leading up to the arrival of IS in Falluja. Months of unrest throughout Anbar province had turned into armed clashes, pitting Shia-dominated security forces against Sunni tribal militias. The government of former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki ordered its forces to withdraw, ostensibly to calm the situation. Abdul Rahman says local people pleaded with the police to stay, even offering to help protect the city. But the officers stripped off their uniforms, laid down their weapons and left.  It was a foretaste of what would happen, five months later, in Mosul. For a couple of days, Abdul Rahman says, Falluja seemed to be in the hands of teenagers.  But it wasn’t long before the city’s new masters made their first appearance. “We noticed that masked people came to the city and took over the police stations. We started to see them in the streets. Within two days, they controlled everything in the city.” The jihadists were dour, and taciturn. “It wasn’t easy to talk to them. If you spoke to them, they gave you very short answers. Yes. No. Inshallah [God willing].” Abdul Rahman recalls the moment he decided it was time to go. He’d been watching militants digging up streets and laying explosives. He asked one of the gunmen what would happen if one of the buried bombs went off prematurely. “He answered me, laughing, and said you’ll go to heaven.  That afternoon, I collected my things, put my family in my car and left the city. For three years.” A short drive south from the centre of town, under police escort, brings us to the suburb of Shuhada. It’s a dusty, almost deserted place, full of unmade roads, potholes and wrecked buildings.Falluja has fared better than some other cities caught up in the government’s battle with IS. After taking back nearby Ramadi, in February 2016, Iraqi forces surrounded Falluja and began capturing nearby villages at the end of May. A month later, the operation was over. The militants didn’t fight to the death in Falluja, as they did later in Mosul. Many IS leaders fled the city, with their families. Some made it to other parts of the self-declared caliphate. Others were hit by airstrikes as they headed out into the desert. But if the city wasn’t levelled, it certainly took a battering, and nowhere more so than Shuhada, scene of the worst fighting. No building is unscathed. Many have been flattened. Here and there, despite the heat, people are rebuilding their homes. It feels like a lonely business. Ahmad and Mahmud Hussein have been working on the family home since February. When he and his family returned from Suleimaniya in November 2016, after three years away, they found the house looted and burned. The first floor had been wrecked by an explosion which destroyed the house next door. Thanks to funds from a Norwegian charity, he’s able to afford a team of plasterers, who are putting the final touches to several downstairs rooms. But his extended family of 11 is fed up with living in rented accommodation. Ahmad is growing impatient. “It’s very hard, especially when I have no money,” he tells me. “If the government paid compensation, that would help. But there’s destruction everywhere and the government says it doesn’t have any money. Because of the war.” The government’s titanic struggle against IS, coupled with a long-running budget crisis, have left Iraq’s coffers dangerously empty. There’s not much to spare for reconstruction, leaving thousands of people like Ahmad and Mahmud to fend for themselves, with a bit of international assistance. The UN Development Programme says at least 15,000 homes have been damaged in Falluja and estimates it will take another 18 months to repair them. It has put aside $2,000 for each house, but in a report earlier this month, it said only 78 homes had been rehabilitated so far. “I feel angry,” Ahmad says. “I waited for the government to help, but I got nothing.” Outside the Wahida (Unity) mosque, after Friday prayers, the city’s hard-pressed mayor, Issa al-Issawi, is surrounded by frustrated locals, and forced to field a barrage of questions. “The government should support us. There’s no opportunity, no work.” “No-one’s compensating us. How can we rebuild our houses?” “There’s no electricity. No water. How can we live?” In fact, the city’s largest water treatment plant, al-Azrakiya, reopened in June. In theory, nearly two-thirds of the city now has access to safe water. UN experts had to remove unexploded devices from 40,000 sq metres of land. But a year after the fighting ended, electricity is rationed to 10 hours per day and there are problems with distribution. Falluja hums to the sound of generators. There are other grievances. “The army’s been occupying my house for the past ten months.” “We are under collective punishment by the government.” “We don’t like Baghdad. But let us live here!” The notion that Falluja is being punished by the central government for the sin of rebellion is a common thread. Time and time again, people talk about feeling trapped by the military checkpoints that still ring the city. The most notorious, Suqoor, sits astride the main highway just east of the city, blocking the way to Baghdad, which ought to be less than an hour’s drive away. It’s a place of gridlock, frayed tempers and occasional danger. On the Baghdad side, trucks carrying cement, bricks and other building materials line up, waiting for clearance. Most of them will drive on past Falluja to Ramadi, the capital of Anbar, which was much more badly damaged in last year’s fighting. But it’s on the Falluja side of Suqoor that the real problems lie. Almost no one from the city is allowed to drive through. Anyone hoping to reach Baghdad must walk to the checkpoint, in searing heat, present papers and hope that the soldiers on duty are in an indulgent mood. The lingering threat posed by suicide bombers makes the soldiers twitchy and hostile. We’re living in a prison” Days before our arrival, a double suicide attack in nearby Garma killed eight soldiers and pro-government militiamen. And just after we left, three policemen on duty at the Halabsa checkpoint, just west of Falluja, were killed by a car bomb. The high levels of paranoia at checkpoints are understandable. No-one wants to be the officer responsible for allowing a would-be bomber to make it to Baghdad. But the result, for tens of thousands of law-abiding Fallujis, more than a year after the jihadists were driven out, is painful to watch. “I spent seven hours at the checkpoint,” says one Friday worshipper, “trying to get my sick relative out.” “We’re living in a prison,” says another. This disruption, coupled with a lack of investment and the local government’s reluctance to reopen Falluja’s main industrial zone, has led to dangerously high levels of unemployment. The city's young must be found something to do. Even in the early evening, the mercury in Falluja is still at 40C, and the city’s young men cool off on the banks of the Euphrates. Using the sawn-off trunk of a palm tree as a springboard, they hurl themselves, some fully-clothed, into the grey-green river. If you followed the river upstream - beyond the cities of Ramadi, Hit and Haditha - you’d find the dwindling heartland of the so-called Islamic State. The border town of Qaim is one of the jihadists’ last strongholds in Iraq and the only place where IS still controls the border with Syria. In 2014, its jubilant fighters made a very public show of erasing the old frontier, a product of the Anglo French Sykes-Picot agreement of 1916. Beyond Qaim, the river leads on to the Syrian battlefields of Deir al-Zour and, finally, Raqqa. From the air, it’s a narrow but unbroken ribbon of green, weaving through the inhospitable wastes of western Iraq and eastern Syria. But here in Falluja, on the river bank, beyond the laughter and the splashing bodies, are reminders of the city’s traumatic recent past. Picked out against the setting sun is the broken silhouette of the ""English bridge"", built during the British mandate of the 1920s. Sections of its green metal structure are semi-submerged. Locals say the bridge was blown up by IS fighters during their retreat from the city last year. Thirteen years ago, this bridge was briefly the most notorious place in Iraq. On 31 March 2004, four American contractors from the private military company Blackwater were ambushed and killed nearby. With echoes of an attack on US soldiers in Somalia a decade earlier, there were gruesome scenes as the Americans were dragged from their burning vehicle, beaten to death and dragged through the streets. With crowds celebrating wildly, two charred bodies were later strung up from the English bridge. As far as the US-led coalition was concerned, Falluja was fast becoming the heart of darkness. US soldiers patrol the English bridge in 2004 It hadn’t started out that way. When the Americans arrived, early in April 2003, Abdul Rahman Modhan remembers soldiers handing out sweets, asking: “Is it safe?” Anbar province had fallen without a fight. But Falluja was home to many of ousted dictator Saddam Hussein’s army and intelligence officers, as well as members of his ruling Baath Party. In May 2003, President George W Bush’s special envoy for Iraq, Paul Bremer, newly arrived in the country, signed orders banning the Baath Party and dismantling the army. Falluja was stunned. “It affected thousands of families,” says Abdul Rahman. “Fathers and brothers came and said: ‘I’ve lost my job, my salary.’” With popular opinion quickly turning against the invaders, the security situation started to deteriorate. Coalition commanders came to regard the Sunni Triangle, north and west of Baghdad, as the baddest of all Iraqi badlands. As fighting raged, two of the most notorious figures in Iraq were often in Falluja. One, the Jordanian Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was already  bombing and beheading his way to the top of Washington’s most wanted list in Iraq. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi His violent jihadist group, al-Qaida in Iraq (AQI), had started attacking American targets just months after the invasion. In May 2004, in the first grainy video of its kind, he was seen beheading a 26-year old American hostage, Nick Berg. The other dangerous militant was, for the time being, less well-known. When they arrested him in April, just outside Falluja, the Americans knew him only as 33-year old Awad Ibrahim al-Badry. He was held for 10 months before being released as a “low level prisoner”. Ten years later, in July 2014, he ascended the steps inside Mosul’s Great Mosque of al-Nuri, and declared himself leader of the self-proclaimed Islamic State. By now, he was better known as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi But back in 2004, it was Zarqawi, not Baghdadi, who preoccupied the US-led coalition. For a while, his group’s religious fundamentalism had some appeal in conservative Falluja. Piety was already a way of life for many in the City of Mosques. Men were bearded, women wore the hijab. The sale of alcohol was prohibited. Falluja was not a mixed city, like Mosul. It was almost entirely Sunni, and it was burning with resentment. After the four Blackwater contractors were killed, the Americans launched two major assaults on Falluja, designed to root out Zarqawi’s increasingly successful group. The second, Operation Phantom Fury, at the end of 2004, was described by the US military as some of the heaviest urban warfare seen since Vietnam. Most of Falluja’s population fled ahead of the battle, but hundreds who remained were killed. The city was devastated. Of Falluja’s 200 mosques, dozens were damaged or destroyed. As many as 1,500 insurgents were killed but it would be another 18 months before the AQI leader would be killed by an airstrike while hiding out in a village north of Baghdad. Falluja was finally retaken, but it took months for people to return to their shattered city. And when they did they found a situation still fraught with danger. “At first, al-Qaida only killed Americans,” says Abdul Rahman. “But then they started to kill us.” Local politicians and religious leaders were assassinated. Kidnap for ransom was suddenly commonplace. Eventually, the people of Anbar turned against AQI. Sunni tribes joined forces with the Americans. The Anbar Awakening marked the end of AQI’s reign of terror. But the Shia-dominated government in Baghdad was deeply suspicious of the movement, which soon had tens of thousands of Sunnis – so-called Sons of Iraq - under arms. After the Americans left Iraq, in 2011,  the government stopped paying the Sons of Iraq. Coupled with a wider purge of Sunnis in government, it had an inevitable effect - Sunnis once again felt they had no place in post-Saddam Iraq. In Falluja, Abdul Rahman watched as history repeated itself. Sunni officials were sacked and replaced by Shia. A Shia officer was put in charge of the Falluja police. And there was a fresh wave of kidnapping, believed to be by pro-government militias. In the popular unrest which followed, says Abdul Rahman, a new generation of jihadists sensed an opportunity. Just as AQI had done the previous decade. They became Islamic State. For those who’ve returned to the city in recent months, life in Falluja is hard enough. But out in the desert, beyond the city limits, are thousands of people who still can’t go back. No-one wants them. On the southern shore of Lake Habbaniya, thousands of people displaced during the war against Islamic State are living in a fly-blown Saddam-era tourist village. As the battle against IS has moved from city to city – causing some to flee their homes, others to return - so the population of this and other camps has fluctuated. But one group remains - the families of those accused of working for, or with, IS. Away from the main camp, there’s an area reserved for people from the agricultural village of Saqlawiya, just a few miles north-west of Falluja. Row upon row of white canvas tents flap in the hot desert wind. Children tussle for handouts. Either side of a wide, dusty avenue, people fill buckets from raised water tanks. Saqlawiya gained a reputation as an IS stronghold. The fighting there in May and June of last year was particularly intense. The people living here have watched others going home and wonder when it will be their turn to follow. Badriya Hassan has been here with her extended family – 22 people in all – for 14 months. Badriya Hassan They stayed in Saqlawiya under IS rule, only fleeing at the start of the government offensive last year. With mainly Shia militias now controlling her village, she’s been warned not to go back. Her sons have been accused of belonging to IS. “They’re waiting to take revenge on us in Saqlawiya,” Badriya says. “We phoned the man in charge. We said give us proof that any of my sons held a machine gun or dressed in the Kandahar [Taliban] style.” The young men, seated around her in the tent, all profess their innocence. One of them, Mohammed, shows off two laminated permits, both secured in the last few months, which appear to show he’s in the clear. They’re addressed to all security services and, crucially, checkpoints: “The Falluja crime, intelligence and counterterrorism units have already been approached with regards to this individual. For the time being, he's not wanted by any security service.” Waving her tattooed hands in the air, Badriya makes a blood-curdling pledge about her sons. “If you have any proof they’re Daesh, we’re ready to slaughter them.” It’s hard to know the precise nature of the charges against her sons or whether they’re merely a cover for something more petty - local or tribal rivalries or perhaps a dispute over land or property. Mohammed says three vehicles have already been confiscated and now there are people in Saqlawiya who are looking to take his house. The authorities tend to regard anyone who stayed in IS territory as a likely collaborator. “Everyone? They can’t say that,” insists Mohammed. “Thousands of people stayed.” Mohammed fears his property and home is being stolen while he is in a camp Pointing to a scar on his forehead, he says he was beaten up by IS members in 2015 after a dispute involving his two sisters. Another son, Haitham, has made it back to Saqlawiya, apparently without incident. But other family members, including a cousin, have been picked up at checkpoints and not heard from since. The missing. Everyone here seems to know someone who has disappeared. Arriving in Habbaniya, we were immediately surrounded by people who spoke of relatives being detained at checkpoints and then simply vanishing. Most said this was the work of the so-called Popular Mobilisation Forces, mainly Shia militias who were involved in last year’s recapture of Falluja, and who still play a security role in the area. Some say Sunnis are still being picked up in revenge for the June 2014 IS massacre of at least 1,500 Shia air force cadets at Camp Speicher, near Tikrit. The people of Saqlawiya have particular reason to be fearful. When PMF fighters captured the village in May 2016, they arrested 1,200 men. Around half were released, thanks to the intervention of the local police. Many of them ended up in hospital, bearing signs of severe physical abuse. But 643 are still missing. Following pressure from human rights groups, Iraq’s current  Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi set up a government committee to investigate what happened. More than a year on, there’s been no news. “The fact that over a year later we don’t have a single answer from the authorities is to me deeply disturbing,” says Belkis Wille, senior Iraq researcher for Human Rights Watch. Shia armed groups, Wille says, are committing abuses against Sunni communities with complete impunity. “It’s yet another sign that things really haven't changed in terms of trying to end this era of impunity,” she says. “The very impunity that pushed a lot of young men to join Isis in the first place.” HRW has also highlighted administrative measures being taken to prevent so-called “Isis families” from going home. A decree, issued immediately after the recapture of Falluja, said that people who “promoted” IS would not be allowed to return “until their charges are reviewed”. But when will this be? The authorities argue that it’s important to know who was and who wasn’t involved with IS. It’s extremely likely that IS sympathisers, including men with blood on their hands, remain in the camps. When Falluja fell, some of those who’d thrown in their lot with the militants hoped to disappear back into the general population. Other measures taken by local councils in recaptured areas have included orders to demolish homes of those involved in terrorist activities. Images of revenge killings of IS members in Mosul caused outrage in July. When pictures of abuses by an Iraqi special forces unit were published, Prime Minister Abadi said those responsible would face prosecution. But Wille says it’s the camps, where people languish for months, perhaps years, under clouds of suspicion, that pose a greater long-term danger. “What I fear is that these camps are going to be the key breeding ground for whatever Isis looks like tomorrow,” says Wille. In the centre of Falluja, close to the spot where IS militants hanged an Iraqi soldier in 2015, a billboard warns residents to avoid the pitfalls of the past. “If we want to create an educated and secure society,” it reads, above silhouettes of a masked man wielding a rocket propelled grenade and a hand brandishing a knife, “it’s our duty to confront those who displaced us, destroyed our cities and tried to poison the ideas of our youth.” At Friday prayers, the imam’s message is the same. “Our ship will sink again if we go back to the same ideology,” he tells his congregation, without ever mentioning Islamic State by name. In Falluja, clerics have risked their lives talking this way. In November 2005, the grand mufti of the city, Sheikh Hamza al-Issawi, was shot dead outside the Wahida mosque. His killers, part of Zarqawi’s al-Qaida network, were determined to punish him for his refusal to condemn the Americans. Other moderate clerics, fearing for their lives, fled the city. Ten years later, Islamic State supporters demolished the mufti’s shrine and moved his body. Even in death, it seemed, his reputation seemed to threaten their authority. Not surprisingly, no-one living in the city today is willing to defend the record of IS. Far from addressing Sunni grievances, the group merely ushered in another dismal chapter in Falluja’s grim recent history. “We don’t want to lose our city again,” says the businessman Abdul Rahman Modhan. But since 2003, Falluja has fallen out of government control, twice, when the authorities in Baghdad – first American, then Iraqi – felt they could ignore the interests of Iraq’s Sunni minority. Sunnis felt they were being punished, first for their allegiance to the former dictator, Saddam Hussein, and later for the willingness of some tribal leaders to harbour the violent jihadists of al-Qaida and Islamic State. Falluja is only 40 miles west of Baghdad, but a gulf of suspicion and resentment has separated the two cities for 14 years. Unless it’s bridged, another violent upheaval cannot be ruled out. Mayor Al-Issawi is candid about the danger. “There was a gap between the government and the people of Falluja in particular and Anbar in general,” he says. “This is one reason why Falluja fell to Daesh.” Mayor Al-Issawi: ""We are making progress"" “The gap still hasn’t closed completely, but we are making progress to restore trust and achieve security.” Could his city throw its lot in with another insurgency? He pauses for thought, and when he answers it doesn’t sound like a slogan. “The people of Falluja have learned their lesson, and suffered a lot, so I don’t think they’ll co-operate with any such insurgency.” For now, the city seems intent on picking up the pieces and making life as tolerable as possible. For all the lingering hardship, the bustling streets are a far cry from the liberated ghost town of last year. “When we arrived, there was not one civilian in Falluja. Not one,” says Lise Grande, from the UN Development Programme. “Security had to be restored, rubble and debris cleared and the transport, water, sewage and electrical grids all had to be repaired as quickly as possible. “Today it is a city being reborn.” But knitting together the country’s torn sectarian fabric is an even bigger job. Every round of conflict tears it a little bit more, and since 2003, the periods of respite have rarely been long enough. Many believe Prime Minister Abadi has a less sectarian agenda than his predecessor, Nouri al-Maliki. But he has rejected accusations of human rights violations by members of the PMF. In August, he dismissed a call from the powerful Shia cleric and former militia leader, Moqtada al-Sadr, to disband the PMF. The caliphate, declared by IS with such violence and ferocious enthusiasm three years ago, is vanishing. The militants have been picked off in one city after another. But even when the last stronghold has fallen, few people think the struggle is over. You can destroy a caliphate, kill its self-proclaimed leaders, restore borders and, if there’s any money left, rebuild cities. But the conflicts in Iraq and Syria have so many drivers – sectarian, political, criminal and regional – that both countries will remain breeding grounds for violent opposition until this toxic mix is addressed. A recent spate of IS bombings in Baghdad suggested that the group’s loss of territory is unlikely to kill off its ability to cause mayhem elsewhere. When do you think the war will end, I ask an officer over tea and our own protracted wait to pass through the Suqoor checkpoint “It’s never going to end,” he replies. Hardly surprising, then, that Anas al-Janabi’s customers keep a wary look out, under the bright lights of his shiny new Falluja fairground. Built with Shorthand",Positive,1.0
"There's a new call for politicians tolook at maintenance grantsfor the poorest students. More than a hundred universities are calling for a rethink on costs. Universities UK says the main worry for undergraduates is ""money in their pocket"" while they are studying. It's estimated those from low income families will also leave with debts of Â£57,000. We speak to students who paid for their studies by working several jobs. Arwen Hawley-Brandt (above) is in her final year at Falmouth University studying filmmaking. ""I've had to waitress, work in a fish and chip shop and sell loads of things on eBay in order to fund my way through my studies,"" she tells Newsbeat. Although she says the course itself is a lot of fun, she's not sure if the costs she's incurred will be worth it. ""I've contemplated dropping out but the only reason I'm staying is I'm in so much debt as it is, I might as well get the degree."" The 23-year-old had no option but to take out a credit card. ""Then because I couldn't pay it off, I had to leave university early to go back to my parents and work, because they kept getting letters."" ""Worrying about money has caused me a lot of anxiety and feelings of depression. I've had to stay in student halls again because I couldn't afford the Â£3,000 for a deposit on a house share."" Stephen Rooney, 30, from Newcastle had four jobs when he was studying politics. ""I did pedi-cabbing, worked in a call centre doing sales and service at Direct Line motor insurance, worked with a Polish builder doing some manual labour and fundraised for the university development and alumni office,"" he rattles off. He says the multiple workplaces helped give him ""additional disposable income"" and ""independence from my parents"". ""I had plenty of free time beyond my studies to earn some extra cash and I found balancing work and student life very easy."" ""My favourite job was being a lifeguard and activity co-ordinator for Disney in America,"" says Gregor Hollerin, 32. He also worked on a potato farm. ""I loved the competitive element; we always tried to beat the record for most plants in a day,"" he tells Newsbeat. During term time he worked in bars and restaurants. ""It was very flexible and managed to easily fit it around my studies and sport,"" he says. He was also a street fundraiser for a time but gave that one up. He's now a PR consultant. ""I took my student loan every year, but it didn't cover more than the basics so I needed to work,"" explains Nicki Smith, 22, who has just finished her degree in business management at the University of Strathclyde. ""I would work Friday night and Saturday and Sundays at a range of venues owned by Kained Holdings... it was essentially like working in nine different places but they were all good opportunities. ""Some weeks I found it challenging with deadlines but buying a diary was a saviour,"" she laughs. But the 22-year-old has no regrets. ""It was definitely worth it, because I'm about to start my graduate job in hospitality in a few weeks."" Natalie Smythe, 25, worked three jobs and volunteered while studying biology at the University of Southampton. The 25-year old is from a single-parent household and says it was a struggle to get anything more than a ""pitiful loan"". ""I worked as a silver service waitress, so no tips, and as a tutor and proof reader to cover my rent and expenses,"" she explains. She says her lowest point was in the third year, writing her dissertation and doing lab work, while keeping the jobs going. ""I'm sure working unsociable shifts impacted my grades."" Andrew Mackin, 40, is a music teacher who is still paying off his student debt. ""I first moved away to study music at Manchester City College at the age of 23. In order to pay for my living costs and tuition I'd work as a chef and also give private guitar lessons,"" he tells Newsbeat. ""Working really put a squeeze on the time I had left. ""Three nights a week, I'd finish college and go straight to work finishing up at 11.30pm, then get on with course work until around 4am and do it all again the next day,"" he says. Andrew still has Â£17,000 of debt to pay back. Until a short time ago Ben Boreham, 21, worked as a chef in Plymouth. He was sacked because the business didn't need him anymore and has struggled to find work since. ""I think it's really hard to get about eight to 20 hours work a week. I get the impression people don't want to take on students,"" he says. He says short-term work is tough to find. ""They say they would take me on but they don't employ students. We are not sought after because we are too transient."" ""I don't want to have to ask my parents as I've got twin brother and sister who have just started university. I want to show my family I can sort myself out.""

"Confusingly, there is no single definition of what constitutes a low-skilled job or a low-skilled worker. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), for example, defines low-skilled on the basis of the person (and their education level) rather than on the basis of the job. But that doesn't necessarily capture what is happening in the UK labour market, where (anecdotally at least) many people with high levels of education are performing relatively unskilled jobs such as driving taxis or making coffee. Official government statistics are based on a skills classification formula put together by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which is based on the time necessary for someone to learn how to perform the task required of them, whether through formal qualifications or on-the-job experience. This is also used as a basis for deciding whether low-skilled workers from outside the EU can come to the UK. The latest figures we have come froma report issued in 2014,externalby the Migration Advisory Committee (an independent public body that advises the government) using 2013 statistics. It says an estimated 870,000 citizens from other EU countries were employed in low-skilled jobs. That's roughly 6% of all low-skilled employment, which doesn't sound like much. But compared with the most recent net migration figures we have (246,000 in the year ending March 2017), 870,000 is obviously a significant number. Many business owners argue that it is so high because the demand to employ that many people exists. Interestingly, (again these are estimates put together by the Migration Advisory Committee in 2014) about 60% of migrants in low-skilled jobs come from non-EU countries: roughly 1.2 million people. Unlike the arrivals from the EU, though, most of them came to the UK at least a decade ago. Most low-skilled migrants who came to the UK between 2004 and 2014 were from Central and Eastern Europe. It depends. At the moment, overall employment is at record levels, as is employment among UK nationals. Last year,a report from the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies,externalconcluded there was no evidence foreign workers took jobs away from UK citizens (unless you are talking about very specific cases such as Premier League footballers). A Home Office report in 2014,externalfound that there was no effect on native-born workers from immigration when the economy was strong. But there could be an effect during an economic downturn, and that effect tended to be concentrated on lower-skilled individuals. A 2015 paper from the Bank of England,externalfound that for semi-skilled and unskilled workers in the service sector, a 10 percentage point increase in the proportion of immigrants working in the sector would be associated with a 1.88% reduction in pay. This is one of the reasons why there is support for curbs on immigration on the left as well as the right. But many business leaders and politicians argue that the impact on wages needs to be put in the context of the positive impact of immigration on the strength of the economy and overall national wealth. Yes, under freedom of movement rules anyone can come from elsewhere in the EU to take up a job or to look for work. If after six months they have not found a job, and have no realistic possibility of finding one, and require support from the welfare system, they can be removed from the country. There are no official figures to show how many people have been deported on this basis, but the numbers are thought to be low. Thelatest ONS migration figures showed,externalthat of the 230,000 EU citizens estimated to have arrived in the UK in the year ending March 2017, 112,000 had a definite job, while another 47,000 were looking for work. (Others were coming to study or to join other family members.) ONS data for 2015 estimates that the most popular industry for EU workers overall is ""households as employers"" (nannies and au pairs to you and me), in which they make up about 16% of the workforce. Next comes accommodation and food (roughly 13%), followed by administration and manufacturing (10%), transport (8%) and construction (7%). But these figures refer to very broad sectors of the economy. In some specific jobs - such as waiters or fruit pickers - the numbers will be far higher.

"This video can not be played Refugee doctor: 'I hope to make the UK proud' Doctors who have travelled to Scotland as refugees are being given the chance to start working for the NHS through a training scheme. The BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has been to meet those involved. ""When people say, 'I had a couple of beers', they don't mean two,"" jokes instructor Dr Patrick Grant, a retired A&E doctor training refugees to work for NHS Scotland - including in how to overcome cultural barriers. One of his students is Fatema, who previously worked as a surgeon in the Middle East until she was forced to flee. Having treated anti-government protesters in her home country, she herself had become a government target. ""I wish one day this country will be proud of me,"" she says. Fatema is one of 38 refugees and asylum seekers on the course - a Â£160,000 programme funded by the Scottish government. Based in Glasgow, it provides the doctors with advanced English lessons, medical classes and placements with GPs or hospitals. The aim is to give the refugee doctors - who commit to working for NHS Scotland - the skills to get their UK medical registration approved. Fatema says coming to the UK and not being able to work as a surgeon had felt like being ""handcuffed"". ""I'm a qualified medical doctor. It's hard to start again from zero,"" she explains. Maggie Lennon, founder of the Bridges Programmes which runs the scheme, says it is important for the UK to utilise its high-skilled refugees. Maggie Lennon says the refugee doctors' clinical skills are very similar to those of doctors trained in the UK ""I always say to people, 'I imagine taking out an appendix in Peshawar is not that different to taking out an appendix in Paisley'. ""I don't think there's actually any difference in the clinical skills, I think where there is a huge difference is attitudes to patients and how medicine is performed,"" she explains. The scheme is designed to overcome such hurdles, including the case of one surgeon who, Ms Lennon says, was unaware he would have to speak to patients, having previously only encountered them in his home country after they had been put to sleep. WatchCatrin Nye's full film on refugee doctorson the Victoria Derbyshire programme's website. Laeth Al-Sadi, also on the course, used to be a doctor in the Iraqi army. He came to Scotland to study but his life was threatened in Iraq and he was never able to go back. One of the ways he has learned to work with patients in the UK is to use informal terms that might put them at ease - ""How are the waterworks down there?"" being one example. Laeth Al-Sadi says being part of the scheme allows him to feel like he ""belongs somewhere"" Language classes are an important part of the course, and placements with GPs and hospitals also allow the refugees to take note of local dialects. Another doctor says he was confused by a patient who said they had a headache because of a ""swally"" - a term for an alcoholic drink. Before refugees can even take their medical exams, they must pass tests to ensure they speak English at a high level. They must pass a test called IELTS with a level of 7.5 - which even some doctors from the US and Australia have failed in the past. Refugees take classes in ""situational judgement"" All classes are taught in English. In one ""situational judgement"" lesson, the refugees are taught to assess what is wrong with a dummy patient based on its ""symptoms"". Laeth says he feels lucky to be offered the possibility of a job in NHS Scotland. ""Lots of colleagues, or people who are doctors, are living here, and they are working other jobs. ""Some of them are even taxi drivers, which has [led to a loss of] hope for a lot of people."" Ms Lennon says this issue of under-employment among the refugee population ""is as serious as unemployment"". ""If someone's a qualified accountant and they're working pushing trolleys [in a supermarket], then there is an argument that they're taking a job from a poorly qualified person in this country,"" she adds. Language classes are an important part of the scheme Fatema says that despite having to leave the Middle East, she is glad she took the decision to treat anti-government protesters. ""My promise at medical graduation [was to] treat people equally, and try to do whatever is possible to help people. So I would do it again."" Dr Greg Jones, clinical lead at NHS Education Scotland, defended the use of government money on the scheme. ""As well as getting people back to their careers as doctors being the right thing to do from a humanitarian standpoint,"" he explains, ""it's also the right thing to do financially. ""It would be a hugely wasted resource if people who'd already gone through medical training were not used as doctors."" Laeth says being part of the scheme allows him to feel like he ""belongs somewhere"". ""It means the world,"" he adds. From Syrian refugee to NHS doctor.

"Customers at some Argos stores are unable to take home a catalogue Traditional glossy catalogues have been removed from a number of Argos stores as increasing numbers of consumers choose to shop online. The retail giant said the move is part of a small scale trial ""testing demand"" for the take-home glossy catalogues. It is understood that the two stores in Inverness - at the city's retail park and in the Eastgate Centre - are part of the experiment. But it has sparked an outcry among some shoppers on social media. Sheena Hendry said it was ""astonishing"" that there were no catalogues to pick up from an Argos in the Highland capital. In a message to the business on Facebook, she said she was disappointed that there appeared to be plans to phase them out. She said: ""Do you even realise how many hours of peace and quiet that catalogue gives to parents of young children who sit flicking through the toy section?"" Speaking to BBC Scotland news, she said: ""I love the Argos catalogue. It's great for browsing and getting inspiration, and the kids love it especially at Christmas. ""I wouldn't even mind paying a couple of quid for one.""

Ch Insp Sharon McCairn, of North Wales Police, said: ""A cordon is in place around the site and we are urging the public to remain clear of the area."" The Air Accident Investigation Branch has sent a team to the airport. Mark Hancock, a guest at the nearby Morfa Lodge holiday park, said he saw what looked like a twin-engine plane crash as it came into land. ""The first thing I noticed was that the plane had no landing gear on, its wheels weren't down,"" he said. ""It was coming in way too fast and then the bottom of it did a sort of belly flop on the runway. It caught fire and then it bounced back up into the air and when it hit the ground again it burst into flames. ""It was like a massive fireball and there was black smoke everywhere. We could feel the heat from where we were standing. There were bits of plane all over the runway."" Caernarfon Airport, near Dinas Dinlle, operates training flights and is also home to the Wales Air Ambulance and the HM Coastguard Helicopters operated by Bristow. Wales Air Ambulance said the crash did not involve any of its aircraft.

"Some of the personnel may have changed but the recipe is pretty much unchanged The second episode of The Great British Bake Off was watched by an average of 5.4 million viewers on Channel 4, according to overnight figures - rising to six million including +1. That's lower than the show's ratings on the BBC - but Channel 4 won't be worried. In his Poetics, Aristotle says that tragedy contains six elements, and the first two are the most important: plot and character. His rules apply beyond tragedy of course, to drama more broadly. And the basic ingredients of story-telling haven't changed much in the past two millennia. To a very great extent, top quality television is still a union of these two elements. In poaching Bake Off from the BBC, Channel 4 had to ensure they retained excellent plots and characters. The former they could largely leave to Love Productions, the independent company who achieved such success with the format on the BBC. The pressure's on in the tent again... The latter was a trickier mission. But the near universal acclaim - among critics at least - for the combination of Noel Fielding, Sandy Toksvig and Prue Leith with Paul Hollywood suggests that they've scored on this front as well. The ratings for the first programme also gave the broadcaster hope that this expensive gamble was well-judged. It is true that the 6.5 million viewers they achieved in the overnight ratings for the first episode was well down on the 13.4 million that was achieved when Nadiya Hussain won the 2015 final. And it was the lowest figure for an opening episode of GBBO since 2013 - when the show attracted 5.6 million viewers to BBC Two. Bake Off is ratings hit for Channel 4 How viewers reacted to the new GBBO Meet the new Bake Off contestants 33 things to know about the new Bake Off But there are several reasons for this, and Channel 4 wouldn't have expected to get anywhere near those dizzy heights with their first episodes. Channel 4 simply has a lower baseline audience than BBC One. To attract audiences of over 10 million, Channel 4 would need both an outstanding product (which they may well have) and a degree of marketing and media hype which could only build over a series. Even though this was their first episode and they put a lot of resources into promoting it, their hope will be that if the characters and plot develop well, the audience will gradually build. Channel 4 will also see their first year with Bake Off as something of a learning experience: years two and three need to be bigger still. It is possible that some residual loyalty to the BBC, and distaste for ads, will have dissuaded previous Bake Off viewers from making the switch to Channel 4. But if Channel 4 sticks to Aristotle's formula, and craft a narrative that is truly compelling, its audience will grow - and their investment will seem prudent.

"Firms that rely on EU workers have warned of the ""catastrophic"" impact of proposals to slash unskilled migration on the day Britain leaves the EU. Underthe draft plan, leaked to the Guardian,external, firms would have to recruit locally unless they could prove an ""economic need"" to employ EU citizens. They could face a skills tax to boost training of UK workers if they still chose to employ unskilled EU staff. But business groups say a ""sudden"" cut could cause ""massive disruption"". The National Farmers' Union claimed the ""entire food supply chain"" could be threatened. Reality Check: Who are the low-skilled EU workers? Davis: Big differences over Brexit bill All you need to know about Brexit EU warning over Irish border post-Brexit NFU deputy president Minette Batters said: ""We are calling for an urgent and clear commitment from government to ensure that farmers and growers have access to sufficient numbers of permanent and seasonal workers post-Brexit. ""And we need clarity on the new rules for EU nationals living and working in the UK well before free movement ends in March 2019."" The leaked Home Office document has not been signed off by ministers, who will set out their post-Brexit migration plans later this year. But Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: ""The public voted to leave the European Union. That means freedom of movement has to end."" He said ""people with the right skills"" would still be ""welcome"". But he added: ""Equally we have to make sure that British companies are also prepared to train up British workers. Analysis BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg The prime minister has at least two big reasons for wanting to get this right. For Theresa May, the referendum result was a clear instruction from the British people that they wanted to reduce the levels of immigration. Politically, therefore, she believes it's a demand she has to meet. And as home secretary for six years, when the government continually flunked its own immigration target, the new system that will control immigration is finally, perhaps, a chance to meet her own long-missed goal. So Wednesday's mega-leak from the Home Office of the potential design of the post Brexit system is significant.Read more Simon Jack: Business sounds alarm ""The public are very clear, they want to see immigration not stopped but brought properly under control."" His message was echoed by Theresa May at Prime Minister's Questions, who told MPs immigration had to be cut to ease the strain on public services, adding that it ""often hits those at the lower end of the income scale hardest in depressing their wages"". The EU has not issued an official response to the leaked document. Unnamed sources have told The Times the EU would block access to the single market during the transition period the UK wants after Brexit if it presses ahead with the proposals. Michael Fallon said the government would take the views of business into account when drawing up its migration policy. But business groups have hit back at his suggestion that they are using cheap foreign labour rather than training up British workers. The British Hospitality Association said: ""If these proposals are implemented it could be catastrophic for the UK hospitality industry and for those who enjoy the hospitality it brings."" The BHA claims 75% of waiters, 25% of chefs and 37% of housekeepers in the UK are EU nationals and at least 60,000 new EU workers are needed every year to fill vacancies. The organisation said it would take 10 years to train up enough British workers to plug the gap and some businesses would fail in the meantime, ""taking UK jobs with them"". Ian Wright, director general of the Food and Drink Federation, said: ""If this does represent the government's thinking it shows a deep lack of understanding of the vital contribution that EU migrant workers make - at all skill levels - across the food chain."" A trade body representing Britain's manufacturers, the EEF described the leaked proposals as a ""mixed bag"". ""On the highly skilled side, the system described is one we can work with, after some changes,"" a spokesman said, but it had ""grave concerns"" about low-skilled workers, ""with many UK manufacturers telling us that they simply don't get jobs applications from prospective UK workers"". The Home Office document obtained by the Guardian, entitled the Border, Immigration and Citizenship System After the UK Leaves the EU, is marked extremely sensitive and dated August 2017. Among the ideas in it are: A cap on the number of unskilled workers from the EU Introducing a salary and skills threshold Preventing EU migrants from job-seeking in the UK Ending the right to settle in Britain for most European migrants Placing new restrictions on their rights to bring in family members ""The government will take a view on the economic and social needs of the country as regards EU migration, rather than leaving this decision entirely to those wishing to come here and employers,"" the document states. Low-skilled migrants would be offered residency for a maximum of two years while those in ""high-skilled occupations"" would be granted permits to work for a longer period of three to five years. EU citizens coming as tourists, on short-term business trips or visits to friends and family would be able to enter the UK without needing permission, under the draft proposals. Those staying longer would need to register for a residence permit by showing proof of employment, study or self-sufficiency. Applicants' fingerprints could also be taken. Reality Check: Brexit catch-up Reality Check: Migration to the UK The document says the new regime would only come fully into force at the end of a transition period, which could last up to three years. The proposals would not affect EU nationals already living and working in the UK - the government says they should be given the right to apply for ""settled status"" after five years of being lawful residents, although agreement on this has yet to be reached in Brexit talks. The leaked document says: ""Put plainly, this means that, to be considered valuable to the country as a whole, immigration should benefit not just the migrants themselves but also make existing residents better off."" Sources have told the BBC that the proposals have been updated six times since the leaked document was written in August and although the broad principles in it are correct, it has yet to be discussed by the cabinet. Lord Green, of the Migration Watch pressure group, said: ""These proposals rightly focus on low-skilled migration and by doing so could reduce net migration from the EU by 100,000 a year over time."" UKIP also welcomed the proposals, saying they should be implemented ""without fudging"" - but Labour MP Yvette Cooper said they appeared to fly in the face of Home Secretary Amber Rudd's commitment earlier this summer to consult on a post-Brexit immigration system. The TUC said the ""back of the envelope plans"" would ""create an underground economy, encouraging bad bosses to exploit migrants and undercut decent employers offering good jobs"". Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable claimed Theresa May had suppressed ""up to nine reports"" showing immigration did not hit the wages or jobs of existing UK workers when she was home secretary - claims denied by Downing Street. Italy's minister for European Affairs, Sandro Gozi, has described the proposals as ""very restrictive and unacceptable"". He told the BBC News Channel that it was ""the wrong direction in our analysis"" and ""we won't be ready to negotiate along those lines"".

"This video can not be played Gales and flooded cars in Saint Martin Hurricane Irma has caused considerable damage on French island territories in the Caribbean, and casualties are expected, France's president says. The impact of Irma on St Martin and St Barts would be ""hard and cruel"", Emmanuel Macron added. His overseas affairs minister later confirmed at least two people dead and another two seriously injured. The storm damaged more than 90% of buildings on Barbuda, Antigua and Barbuda's prime minister said. The category five hurricane, the highest possible level, is now passing over the northern Virgin Islands. The most powerful storm in a decade, with wind speeds of 295km/h (185mph),is also forecast by the US National Hurricane Center,externalto pass near or just north of Puerto Rico, then near or just north of the coast of the Dominican Republic on Thursday.

Hurricane Irma: All you need to know The world's most powerful storms How do you calculate the cost of a hurricane? Thousands of people have been evacuated from at-risk areas across the Caribbean. Residents have flocked to shops for food, water, and emergency supplies, and airports have closed on several islands which are popular holiday destinations. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the government was in touch with British overseas territories caught up in Irma, and was doing ""everything we can to help those afflicted"". In the US, Florida's Key West area has ordered a mandatory evacuation, with landfall expected at the weekend. Irma as seen from space at 11:30 GMT on Wednesday The French government said earlier it was worried about thousands of people who had refused to seek shelter on the islands.

"The AlphaBay market is one of many shut down by police action The notorious dark web marketplaces Alphabay and Hansa were shut down in July following ""landmark"" action by police forces in the US and Europe to unmask who was running them. They join a long list of other forums, chat rooms and boards that appeared and were blazingly popular with the criminal underworld before they were compromised and closed. But those sites, including Dark Market, Carders Market, Shadow Crew, Carder.su, Darkode, GhostMarket and the Silk Road, have more in common than just the trajectory of their genesis and demise. They all follow the modus operandi of a landmark forum set up in 2001 called Carder Planet. Designed for criminals who specialised in monetising lists or ""dumps"" of credit card numbers, it has had an influence far beyond that select group. ""Carder Planet created the framework for the current criminal underground,"" said Andrei Barysevich, now a director at security firm Recorded Future but who, at the time the site operated, was helping to monitor cyber-crime in Eastern Europe. The site was set up online shortly after a face-to-face meeting at a restaurant in Odessa attended by some of Ukraine and Russia's top credit card thieves, said Mr Barysevich. ""Odessa was, and still is, the ground zero for cyber-crime,"" he said. ""It is a very criminalised city and a centre of white collar crime."" Cyber-thieves targeted small restaurants to scoop up credit card details Before Carder Planet was set up, anyone who wanted to make money from stealing card numbers had to be a jack of all trades, said Liam O'Murchu, a researcher at Symantec who has spent years tracking online crime forums. Not only did they have to find ways to steal the card numbers, often involving malware or hacking, they also had to work out how to turn those numbers into cash and not get caught. ""What they decided to do was pool everyone's resources, so they did not have to be perfectly skilled in everything in order to be able to do crime,"" he said. ""They set up the forum where people could come together and trade skills and nobody had to be an expert in the entire chain from beginning to end,"" said Mr O'Murchu. The site proved an immediate success and soon had thousands of members all busily trading with each other. Police investigators have regularly compromised cyber-crime forums and marketplaces ""They got so blase and so sure of themselves that they organised the first real life meet-up of Carder Planet members,"" said Mr Barysevich. ""Forum members were invited to a resort outside Odessa where they hung out together. ""They had good food, drink and girls and had a pretty good time,"" he said. It was not only the attendees who enjoyed themselves. The police did too because news about the conference, as well as pictures of attendees, were leaked to the authorities. It was the first time that many of the cyber-thieves had been photographed and the images were widely studied, he said. Despite the attention, Carder Planet kept going and enjoyed significant success, said Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder of CrowdStrike and a veteran cyber-crime researcher, who has helped to track down and expose some of its key members. ""It was the right place at the right time,"" he said. ""You had a lot of smart folks in Russia and Ukraine at the time and you had the proliferation of the internet in those days in the former Soviet Union and the economy was doing very, very poorly."" Given that, he said, it was not surprising that those with technical skills and nothing legitimate to do with them turned to crime. Coupled with this was the rise of online shopping in the US, much of which was powered by people using credit cards. Unfortunately, many of the firms setting up online were better at selling than security, meaning the thieves were regularly able to steal large amounts of card numbers. Mr Alperovitch said the board explicitly modelled itself on more traditional organised crime groups - specifically the Italian mafia. The rise of online shopping helped cyber-thieves cash in Occasional contributors were called ""soldiers"" and the more someone got involved the higher up the ranks they rose. At the top, he said, were the ""dons"" and ""capos"" who ran the biggest scams and collected financial tributes from the people they set working on them. He said it was also a board on which reputation mattered a lot - a trait seen on many other criminal forums ever since. Before any criminals worked together they looked for ""vouches"" - essentially personal recommendations from other thieves about whether someone was trustworthy or not. Without those endorsements a collaboration between say a spammer and a malware writer was unlikely to get started. Anyone with a persistently bad reputation would find that no-one would work with them. Carder Planet was shut down voluntarily by its creators in 2004 - largely to avoid the fate of other boards, many of which were compromised by police and used to gather intelligence about members. Many of its members did keep on stealing cards and some of them, notably Roman Vega (aka Boa) and Vladislav Horohorin (aka Badb), have been tracked down and arrested. Those arrests were a consequence of the open atmosphere on Carder Planet, said Mr Alperovitch. ""They've realised they were quite naive about law enforcement engagement and they did not realise that law enforcement was paying very close attention,"" he said.

"Nova Victoria has won the dubious honour of being the UK's worst new building of 2017 A London office block described as a ""bright red hideous mess"" has been named the UK's worst building. Nova Victoria, London won the 2017 Carbuncle Cup with one judge describing it as ""cringe-worthy"". It is the sixth consecutive time a London building has scooped the dubious honour run by Building Design Magazine (BD). Architects PLP described the Â£380m office complex as a ""distinct and architecturally daring"" building. But judges disagreed, describing the building as ""crass, over-scaled and a hideous mess"". PLP described the Â£380m office complex as ""distinct and architecturally daring"" Judge Catherine Croft said: ""It makes me want to cringe physically. It's a crass assault on all your senses from the moment you leave the Tube station."" David Rudlin said the red cathedral like spire on Nova South was a particular cause for concern. ""It's got the same proportions as Salisbury Cathedral. For me the spire gives it carbuncular status - otherwise it's just a bad building"", he said. The development, which occupies a whole city block near London's Victoria station, consists of two office buildings designed by PLP Architecture and a residential building designed by Benson & Forsyth. The title was awarded to PLP Architecture for the office buildings. The other buildings on the 2017 Carbuncle Cup shortlist were as follows: Preston Railway Station Butler Street Entrance by AHR Greetham Street Student Halls, Portsmouth by Cooley Architects Extension on 8 Somers Road, Malvern, Worcestershire by Vivid Architects Circus West, Battersea Power Station, London by Simpson Haugh Park Plaza London Waterloo by ESA Architecture Circus West, Battersea Power Station was shortlisted for the 2017 award Building Design started the award in 2006 as a ""light-hearted way of drawing attention to a serious problem - bad architecture blighting the country's towns and cities"".

"Lucy Fernandez from Toronto says she wouldn't buy Chapel Down's white wine France, Italy and Spain are some of the world's best known wine producing countries but could a growing English wine making industry ever threaten their dominance? At English winemaker Chapel Down the opinions of a group of tourists sampling the various wines it produces are mixed. ""A bit bitter,"" is Toronto tourist Lucy Fernandez's take on the vineyard's Flint Dry white wine. She says Canadians are open to drinking wines from all over the world, but she wouldn't buy this variety. However, Andrew from Adelaide has tried the Bacchus 2016 white and says it ""compares quite well"" to wines he's used to back in South Australia. Beatrice Ness from Paris is impressed with Chapel Down's sparkling wine Beatrice Ness, a teacher from Paris, has sampled a sparkling variety, arguably what the Kent-based vineyard is best known for, and is clearly impressed. ""This is as good as Moet champagne,"" she says of the Three Graces 2011, costing Â£29.99 a bottle. ""We buy a lot of foreign wines in Paris and I think people would go for this."" It's no secret that English wine-making has taken off over the last decade,with industry sales hitting a record Â£130m,external. However, while aroundfour to five million bottles are produced each year,external, less is said about UK exports,which stood at just 250,000 in 2015,external, the most recent year for which figures are available. Chapel Down is best known for its sparkling wines Despite the small scale of the export industry, its reach is growing. English sparkling wines were shipped to 27 markets last year compared with 19 in 2015, official statistics show. With more UK landbeing used for grape growing,external, andthe industry targeting exports of 2.5 million bottles by 2020,external, could the country be on track to becoming a serious wine producer on the world stage? Chapel Down's chief executive, Frazer Thompson, urges caution. He says the firm has seen ""consistent growth"" over the last seven years and is tapping a wider range of markets, from North America to South East Asia. ""You need a dose of realism,"" says Frazer Thompson, chief executive of Chapel Down Like most English winemakers, the majority of his exports are of sparkling wines, which account for just over half of the firm's production. But he points out that exports are only a ""part of the story"" and the firm is still largely focused on the UK, one of the world's biggest wine markets. ""In the rest of the world there is potential but you need a dose of realism,"" he says. ""It took the French 350 years to export 50% of their champagne and the UK is their largest market."" Producers tend to see certain international markets as better bets than others, preferring places that like wine but don't have huge domestic industries of their own. Bob Lindo co-founded Camel Valley in Cornwall France, Italy and Spain are ""hard work"", says Bob Lindo, who founded the Cornish winery Camel Valley with his wife Annie in 1989. But countries such as Japan, China and the US, which is his biggest market, buy much more. ""We are sold in 23 US states now,"" Mr Lindo says. ""There are a lot of parts of America that don't grow wine and there's a very enthusiastic wine culture."" The Camel Valley winery in Cornwall has done well in international competitions Helpfully, English wine has shed its once negative reputation and is doing well in major competitions such as the Euposia International Challenge (Bollicine del Mondo) in Italy, which attracts sparkling wines from around the world. Organiser Carlo Rossi says English brands regularly make the top 10 in various categories, with wine producers Nyetimber, Hambledon and Camel Valley all having won golds in the recent past. ""About 10 years ago it seemed a joke that the English could make excellent sparkling wine, but there has been a surge in interest,"" he says. Chapel Down grows a variety of grapes at its vineyards, including Chardonnay, Pinot Blanc and Bacchus Chapel Down's Mr Thompson believes better marketing is the key to exposing the talent in the industry. He notes how countries such as France play on the fact they are associated with producing fantastic food and drink, ""so we buy French, even their lager which isn't actually that good"". ""So England needs to sell itself as a quality producer of food and drink, which it still doesn't do well enough and wine can be a flag-bearer."" Not everyone is convinced about English wine, though. Malcolm Gluck, a British wine critic who has penned numerous books, says there is a ""marvellous conspiracy"" among winemakers and writers to pretend English wine is great. ""There are English wines that are interesting that cost Â£12-15,"" he adds. ""But they cost two to three times more than comparable wines from South America or France, Italy and Spain."" The UK has a shortage of land suited to wine growing There are other barriers to building a world-beating wine industry, including a shortage of land suitable for grape growing and high set-up costs. The English climate also limits production mainly to the south of England, although rather perversely, things could improve in that respect because of global warming. A study last year by climatologists at UCL suggested rising temperatures and rainfall could let vineyards thrive as far north as Elgin near Inverness by 2100. They also claimed the Thames estuary would become warm enough to grow Malbec grapes.

Camel Valley's Mr Lindo believes exports will increase gradually as the reputation of English wine flourishes but he's not chasing them. He says he is busy enough catering to restaurants and supermarkets up and down the UK. He also thinks we should not judge the industry's success by its scale. ""A lot of City money is going into English wine and there is a risk it will become too commercialised,"" he says. ""You have to be really committed to run a vineyard, but if the market gets flooded, producers who have been here from the start will suffer. ""There's also been a lot of cooperation between English producers and I don't want it to stop.""

"IVF will no longer be available free on the NHS in Cambridgeshire Free fertility treatment on the NHS is to be scrapped in the county where the procedure was pioneered 40 years ago. The Cambridgeshire and Peterborough area has become the third place in the UK to withdraw free IVF treatment. Government guidelines,externalrecommend that women under 40 should be offered three free cycles if they have been trying to conceive for three years. The local clinical commissioning group (CCG) said the decision would save the county Â£700,000 a year. It comes after a 20-week public consultation - and will stop with immediate effect. The decision will be reviewed next in April 2019. Read more Cambridgeshire stories here Clinical commissioning groups inCroydonand parts ofEssexwere the first to withdraw routine free IVF treatment on the NHS. Cambridgeshire and Peterborough CCG chair Dr Gary Howsam, said it was ""one of the hardest decisions we've had to take"". ""I think there's a recognition that the NHS funding situation is desperate in our region,"" he said. ""The CCG has finite resources to fund a whole range of health services and treatments. ""We need to save Â£46.5m this financial year, and so we have had to review all areas of our spending and to make some difficult decisions."" He described suspending routine specialist fertility services as ""financially necessary"". IVF was pioneeredby biologist Robert Edwards, who with gynaecologist Patrick Steptoe, fertilised the first human egg in a Cambridge laboratory in 1978. Since then, nearly four million children have been born using the technology. Cambridge University Hospitals Trust, which provides the local NHS IVF service, said it was still committed to helping as many patients as possible start families. Consultant embryologist Stephen Harbottle described the decision as ""devastating"". ""NHS care should be available equitably to everyone. Even within the eastern region, care is still available but the people of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough will not have access to it. ""People see IVF treatment as non-essential care but the effect of withdrawing it can be devastating for their mental health, their relationships, and financially."" IVF pioneers Robert Edwards (L) and Patrick Steptoe (R) pose with the world's first IVF baby, Louise Brown He said patients could now expect to pay a minimum of Â£4,000-Â£5,000 per treatment cycle. More than 2,300 people have signed an onlinepetition,externalcalling for the CCG to reverse its decision. The CCG added that only a handful of exceptions would apply, such as for patients undergoing cancer treatment that could make them infertile. Couples who had already been referred for specialist fertility services would still receive one cycle of IVF.

"This video can not be played Ryanair reviewed its second carry-on bag allowance after ""abuse"" contributed to delays Ryanair has said many customers will no longer be able to take two pieces of luggage into the cabin. Thebudget airline said,externalpassengers without priority boarding would have to put their second bag in the hold free of charge at the gate. For bigger bags Ryanair is cutting fees from Â£35 to Â£25 to encourage customers to check in more luggage. Ryanair said it was making the changes from November to ease delays after too many customers took two bags on board. The airline said earlier this year it was a victim of its own ""niceness"" after allowing customers to bring a second carry-on bag for free. It said ""abuse"" of that policy was contributing to flight delays, with people taking on bags up to three times the permissible size. Under the changes announced on Wednesday, Ryanair passengers without priority boarding will only be able to take one smaller carry-on bag on board the aircraft. At the same time it is lowering checked-bag fees and increasing the check-in bag allowance from 15kg to 20kg. Put simply, from November, Ryanair won't let you bring your wheelie bag into the cabin any more, unless you pay to be a priority boarder. But you'll still have to carry that bag through security, which means you still can't pack razors, liquids etc. They then take it off you at the gate, for free. Ryanair makes money by filling its planes and minimising delays on the ground. But full planes don't have enough space for everyone to have a wheelie bag, which leads to that big, time-consuming bun fight before every flight where the late boarders are looking for bag space. By changing the policy, Ryanair will cut delays and save money. That keeps fares down, but it means you'll have your own delay, waiting for your bag to come around the carousel at the other end. Ryanair chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs, said: ""These bag policy changes will cost Ryanair over 50m euros (Â£46m) per annum in reduced checked bag fees. ""However, we believe offering bigger bags at reduced fees will encourage more customers to consider checking-in a bag, which will reduce the high volume of customers we have with two carry-on bags at the boarding gates."" The range of fees for putting baggage in the hold is so varied that some airlines produce hefty tables detailing the various charges. The cost depends on the date of departure, the route, and the ticket type, as well as the obvious elements such as the size of the luggage. Travel with equipment such as golf clubs brings additional costs. Most airlines charge a lot more than the prices below for baggage that is checked-in at the airport rather than online. The major competitors to Ryanair include: easyJet,external- charges between Â£13 and Â£30 for hold luggage up to 20kg Wizz Air,external- charges between 16 euros (Â£15) and 55 euros for hold luggage up to 20kg Norwegian,external- various charges ranging from Â£7 to Â£50 for the first piece of hold luggage British Airways,external- free luggage allowance on some tickets, but on basic fares can range from Â£20 to Â£60 Ryanair carried nearly 13 million customers in August, 10% more than a year ago, and its planes were 97% full. It flew 126 million passengers in the 12 months to the end of August, a rise of 13%. The airline reported a 55% increase in pre-tax profits to 397m euros (Â£356m) in its most recent quarter. Rival easyJet said on Wednesday that it carried 8 million passengers last month, a rise of 9%. Shares in Ryanair and easyJet both fell nearly 1% in London.

"Forget a dash of tonic with lemon and lime - gin has been spiriting its way into our mealtimes, with supermarkets now selling gin-flavoured foods, from yoghurt to fish. So does gin belong in the pantry as well as the pub? Tubs of gin-flavoured yoghurt - containing 0.25% alcohol - went on sale in Sainsbury's this summer, which says more gin foods are on their way. Meanwhile, gin-infused salmon, gin-flavoured popcorn and sweets, gin and tonic ice cream and gin sauces are stocking supermarket shelves across the UK. Gin's resurgence in liquid form has been dubbed a ""Ginaissance"", with sales of the spirit surpassing Â£1bn last year and micro-distilleries opening across the UK. ""Sure, there's an element of gimmickry, but why not?"" says cocktail expert and writer Ben Reed, who has 20 years' bartending experience. It is an ""obvious step"" for chefs to use gin, he says, adding it can enhance flavours in foods. ""By choosing gins with the appropriate botanical additions you can add complex combinations,"" he says. Gin's trendy reputation is now a far cry from the spirit's age-old nickname as ""Mother's ruin"" - a favourite vice drink of the poor, and thought to bring on a miscarriage if consumed while in a hot bath. Supermarkets are confident people will tuck into gin-flavoured food as gin's rise continues. Why is the price of butter going up? The English wine makers taking on the Europeans Why I gave up being vegan Nicola Bramley, a food development chef at Sainsbury's, says the supermarket's premium gin sales are rising 25% year-on-year, and insists the trend ""isn't limited to your glass of G&T"". ""There's plenty more to come,"" she says, adding that the retailer has plans to introduce a smoked salmon patÃ© with a gin & tonic glaze. Gin, like other spirits such as vodka, has a neutral flavour but gets its character from botanicals used to flavour it - the taste we think of as ""gin"" comes from juniper, which tastes like pine. Miles Beale, chief executive of the Wine and Spirits Trade Association (WSTA) says our love of gin means flavoured food is ""selling like hot cakes"". He says the ""quintessentially British"" drink is supporting a wider industry, with gin-themed gifts and gin-flavoured foods. ""It is fantastic to see,"" he adds. Rachel's gin and lemon yoghurt with 0.5% organic gin (Sainsbury's, Â£2) Gin-infused Scottish smoked salmon (Waitrose, Â£7.99) Gin and tonic ""alcoholic popcorn"" (Â£4.99, Etsy) Jude's gin and tonic ice cream (Â£1.85, Ocado) Gin mini-bottle advent calendar (Â£99.95, online retailers) It is now commonplace to see flavoured gins from seaweed  to tea - but some think using the spirit in snacks is a step too far. ""Gin with yoghurt or gin-flavoured crisps don't seem like natural bedfellows to me,"" says Barney Desmazery, a chef and BBC Good Food magazine's editor-at-large. He says food manufacturers are jumping on gin's resurgence to make their products seem more enticing, rather than matching the right flavours. ""It's without doubt got a place in the kitchen,"" Barney says, instead suggesting gin fans experiment with homemade treats, such as agin and tonic cake,external. He recommends the spirit's alcoholic flavour be ""used sensitively"". And Nick King, a spirits teacher at the Wine and Spirit Education Trust, says ""you'd have to be some kind of god-like taster"" to detect gin flavours in many of these foods. ""They're not necessarily very strongly flavoured - not least because if it's in the yoghurt aisle and it's notably alcoholic, there might be confusion at the till,"" he says. He says alcohol-flavoured food is nothing new. ""You've had rum and raisin ice cream for donkeys years, liquor chocolates - and of course my mother's legendary brandy butter."" But he admits the products tap into a booming gin market - mainly comprising people in their 20s and 30s - who like anything quirky. ""As an idea, it makes perfect sense in cashing in on and appealing to those people,"" he says. ""We're looking at a generation that's much more interested in flavour and interesting and exciting things."" He adds: ""Gin will be around when our grandchildren are talking about it, but whether gin ice cream will be is another thing altogether.""

"This video can not be played Alison Strand has lost power and is facing ""dangerous conditions"" in Anguilla Britons in the Caribbean and Florida have been urged to follow evacuation orders as the most powerful Atlantic storm in a decade hits the region. The Foreign Office warned that Hurricane Irma would bring hazardous conditions to the area. Briton James Fairs, who lives on the island of St Kitts, said experiencing the storm was ""pretty scary"". Airlines were forced to ground or divert flights, and British Airways evacuated 326 passengers from Antigua. Some travellers have been left stranded after being unable to get a flight following the category five hurricane - the highest possible level. The storm - which has sustained wind speeds reaching 295km/h (185mph) - has already caused major flooding and damage to buildings on several islands. France's overseas affairs minister confirmed two people have been killed and another two seriously injured in the French Caribbean territories of St Martin and St Barts. Latest updates: Hurricane Irma batters Caribbean The eye of the storm hit the island of Barbuda, which has a population of about 2,000 people, shortly after 01:00 local time (05:00 GMT). It has since hit Antigua, before moving on to St Martin and St Barts. Mas Rezai, from London, is on holiday in the Dominican Republic with his family but has not been able to leave the island. ""We want to go home but British Airways say they do not have flights available,"" he said. ""When I complained and asked why British Airways wasn't providing a plane to get British citizens out they told me they simply had nothing available. ""Now we are hearing the airport is closed too. We just want to go home as soon as possible."" BA sent an aircraft to Antigua on Tuesday to collect 326 customers. ""We are making sure our customers are well looked after in their hotels and are constantly monitoring the situation and liaising with the airport authorities in the region,"" a spokesman said.

The impact of Irma on St Martin and St Barts would be ""hard and cruel"", Emmanuel Macron added. His overseas affairs minister later confirmed at least two people dead and another two seriously injured. The storm damaged more than 90% of buildings on Barbuda, Antigua and Barbuda's prime minister said. The category five hurricane, the highest possible level, is now passing over the northern Virgin Islands.

Significant damage is also being reported in the Dutch section of St Martin, known as Sint-Maarten. French Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb said the hurricane had caused major floods, and destroyed buildings, including four of the ""most solid"" on the island. Hurricane Irma: All you need to know The world's most powerful storms How do you calculate the cost of a hurricane? Thousands of people have been evacuated from at-risk areas across the Caribbean.

The mainland has not been hit by two category four hurricanes in one season since the storms were first recorded in 1851. Texan officials told the Associated Press that 60 people are dead, or are feared dead, from Hurricane Harvey. Not all of these are confirmed. A string of US stars, including BeyoncÃ©, George Clooney and Oprah Winfrey, have reportedly signed up to take part in a fundraising telethon for victims.

"Lucy Fernandez from Toronto says she wouldn't buy Chapel Down's white wine France, Italy and Spain are some of the world's best known wine producing countries but could a growing English wine making industry ever threaten their dominance? At English winemaker Chapel Down the opinions of a group of tourists sampling the various wines it produces are mixed. ""A bit bitter,"" is Toronto tourist Lucy Fernandez's take on the vineyard's Flint Dry white wine. She says Canadians are open to drinking wines from all over the world, but she wouldn't buy this variety. However, Andrew from Adelaide has tried the Bacchus 2016 white and says it ""compares quite well"" to wines he's used to back in South Australia. Beatrice Ness from Paris is impressed with Chapel Down's sparkling wine Beatrice Ness, a teacher from Paris, has sampled a sparkling variety, arguably what the Kent-based vineyard is best known for, and is clearly impressed. ""This is as good as Moet champagne,"" she says of the Three Graces 2011, costing Â£29.99 a bottle. ""We buy a lot of foreign wines in Paris and I think people would go for this."" It's no secret that English wine-making has taken off over the last decade,with industry sales hitting a record Â£130m,external. However, while aroundfour to five million bottles are produced each year,external, less is said about UK exports,which stood at just 250,000 in 2015,external, the most recent year for which figures are available. Chapel Down is best known for its sparkling wines Despite the small scale of the export industry, its reach is growing. English sparkling wines were shipped to 27 markets last year compared with 19 in 2015, official statistics show. With more UK landbeing used for grape growing,external, andthe industry targeting exports of 2.5 million bottles by 2020,external, could the country be on track to becoming a serious wine producer on the world stage? Chapel Down's chief executive, Frazer Thompson, urges caution. He says the firm has seen ""consistent growth"" over the last seven years and is tapping a wider range of markets, from North America to South East Asia. ""You need a dose of realism,"" says Frazer Thompson, chief executive of Chapel Down Like most English winemakers, the majority of his exports are of sparkling wines, which account for just over half of the firm's production. But he points out that exports are only a ""part of the story"" and the firm is still largely focused on the UK, one of the world's biggest wine markets. ""In the rest of the world there is potential but you need a dose of realism,"" he says. ""It took the French 350 years to export 50% of their champagne and the UK is their largest market."" Producers tend to see certain international markets as better bets than others, preferring places that like wine but don't have huge domestic industries of their own. Bob Lindo co-founded Camel Valley in Cornwall France, Italy and Spain are ""hard work"", says Bob Lindo, who founded the Cornish winery Camel Valley with his wife Annie in 1989. But countries such as Japan, China and the US, which is his biggest market, buy much more. ""We are sold in 23 US states now,"" Mr Lindo says. ""There are a lot of parts of America that don't grow wine and there's a very enthusiastic wine culture."" The Camel Valley winery in Cornwall has done well in international competitions Helpfully, English wine has shed its once negative reputation and is doing well in major competitions such as the Euposia International Challenge (Bollicine del Mondo) in Italy, which attracts sparkling wines from around the world. Organiser Carlo Rossi says English brands regularly make the top 10 in various categories, with wine producers Nyetimber, Hambledon and Camel Valley all having won golds in the recent past. ""About 10 years ago it seemed a joke that the English could make excellent sparkling wine, but there has been a surge in interest,"" he says. Chapel Down grows a variety of grapes at its vineyards, including Chardonnay, Pinot Blanc and Bacchus Chapel Down's Mr Thompson believes better marketing is the key to exposing the talent in the industry. He notes how countries such as France play on the fact they are associated with producing fantastic food and drink, ""so we buy French, even their lager which isn't actually that good"". ""So England needs to sell itself as a quality producer of food and drink, which it still doesn't do well enough and wine can be a flag-bearer."" Not everyone is convinced about English wine, though. Malcolm Gluck, a British wine critic who has penned numerous books, says there is a ""marvellous conspiracy"" among winemakers and writers to pretend English wine is great. ""There are English wines that are interesting that cost Â£12-15,"" he adds. ""But they cost two to three times more than comparable wines from South America or France, Italy and Spain."" The UK has a shortage of land suited to wine growing There are other barriers to building a world-beating wine industry, including a shortage of land suitable for grape growing and high set-up costs. The English climate also limits production mainly to the south of England, although rather perversely, things could improve in that respect because of global warming. A study last year by climatologists at UCL suggested rising temperatures and rainfall could let vineyards thrive as far north as Elgin near Inverness by 2100.

"Firms that rely on EU workers have warned of the ""catastrophic"" impact of proposals to slash unskilled migration on the day Britain leaves the EU. Underthe draft plan, leaked to the Guardian,external, firms would have to recruit locally unless they could prove an ""economic need"" to employ EU citizens. They could face a skills tax to boost training of UK workers if they still chose to employ unskilled EU staff. But business groups say a ""sudden"" cut could cause ""massive disruption"". The National Farmers' Union claimed the ""entire food supply chain"" could be threatened. Reality Check: Who are the low-skilled EU workers? Davis: Big differences over Brexit bill All you need to know about Brexit EU warning over Irish border post-Brexit NFU deputy president Minette Batters said: ""We are calling for an urgent and clear commitment from government to ensure that farmers and growers have access to sufficient numbers of permanent and seasonal workers post-Brexit. ""And we need clarity on the new rules for EU nationals living and working in the UK well before free movement ends in March 2019."" The leaked Home Office document has not been signed off by ministers, who will set out their post-Brexit migration plans later this year. But Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: ""The public voted to leave the European Union. That means freedom of movement has to end."" He said ""people with the right skills"" would still be ""welcome"". But he added: ""Equally we have to make sure that British companies are also prepared to train up British workers. Analysis BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg The prime minister has at least two big reasons for wanting to get this right. For Theresa May, the referendum result was a clear instruction from the British people that they wanted to reduce the levels of immigration. Politically, therefore, she believes it's a demand she has to meet. And as home secretary for six years, when the government continually flunked its own immigration target, the new system that will control immigration is finally, perhaps, a chance to meet her own long-missed goal. So Wednesday's mega-leak from the Home Office of the potential design of the post Brexit system is significant.Read more Simon Jack: Business sounds alarm ""The public are very clear, they want to see immigration not stopped but brought properly under control."" His message was echoed by Theresa May at Prime Minister's Questions, who told MPs immigration had to be cut to ease the strain on public services, adding that it ""often hits those at the lower end of the income scale hardest in depressing their wages"". The EU has not issued an official response to the leaked document. Unnamed sources have told The Times the EU would block access to the single market during the transition period the UK wants after Brexit if it presses ahead with the proposals. Michael Fallon said the government would take the views of business into account when drawing up its migration policy. But business groups have hit back at his suggestion that they are using cheap foreign labour rather than training up British workers. The British Hospitality Association said: ""If these proposals are implemented it could be catastrophic for the UK hospitality industry and for those who enjoy the hospitality it brings."" The BHA claims 75% of waiters, 25% of chefs and 37% of housekeepers in the UK are EU nationals and at least 60,000 new EU workers are needed every year to fill vacancies. The organisation said it would take 10 years to train up enough British workers to plug the gap and some businesses would fail in the meantime, ""taking UK jobs with them"". Ian Wright, director general of the Food and Drink Federation, said: ""If this does represent the government's thinking it shows a deep lack of understanding of the vital contribution that EU migrant workers make - at all skill levels - across the food chain."" A trade body representing Britain's manufacturers, the EEF described the leaked proposals as a ""mixed bag"". ""On the highly skilled side, the system described is one we can work with, after some changes,"" a spokesman said, but it had ""grave concerns"" about low-skilled workers, ""with many UK manufacturers telling us that they simply don't get jobs applications from prospective UK workers"". The Home Office document obtained by the Guardian, entitled the Border, Immigration and Citizenship System After the UK Leaves the EU, is marked extremely sensitive and dated August 2017. Among the ideas in it are: A cap on the number of unskilled workers from the EU Introducing a salary and skills threshold Preventing EU migrants from job-seeking in the UK Ending the right to settle in Britain for most European migrants Placing new restrictions on their rights to bring in family members ""The government will take a view on the economic and social needs of the country as regards EU migration, rather than leaving this decision entirely to those wishing to come here and employers,"" the document states. Low-skilled migrants would be offered residency for a maximum of two years while those in ""high-skilled occupations"" would be granted permits to work for a longer period of three to five years. EU citizens coming as tourists, on short-term business trips or visits to friends and family would be able to enter the UK without needing permission, under the draft proposals. Those staying longer would need to register for a residence permit by showing proof of employment, study or self-sufficiency. Applicants' fingerprints could also be taken. Reality Check: Brexit catch-up Reality Check: Migration to the UK The document says the new regime would only come fully into force at the end of a transition period, which could last up to three years. The proposals would not affect EU nationals already living and working in the UK - the government says they should be given the right to apply for ""settled status"" after five years of being lawful residents, although agreement on this has yet to be reached in Brexit talks. The leaked document says: ""Put plainly, this means that, to be considered valuable to the country as a whole, immigration should benefit not just the migrants themselves but also make existing residents better off."" Sources have told the BBC that the proposals have been updated six times since the leaked document was written in August and although the broad principles in it are correct, it has yet to be discussed by the cabinet. Lord Green, of the Migration Watch pressure group, said: ""These proposals rightly focus on low-skilled migration and by doing so could reduce net migration from the EU by 100,000 a year over time."" UKIP also welcomed the proposals, saying they should be implemented ""without fudging"" - but Labour MP Yvette Cooper said they appeared to fly in the face of Home Secretary Amber Rudd's commitment earlier this summer to consult on a post-Brexit immigration system. The TUC said the ""back of the envelope plans"" would ""create an underground economy, encouraging bad bosses to exploit migrants and undercut decent employers offering good jobs"". Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable claimed Theresa May had suppressed ""up to nine reports"" showing immigration did not hit the wages or jobs of existing UK workers when she was home secretary - claims denied by Downing Street. Italy's minister for European Affairs, Sandro Gozi, has described the proposals as ""very restrictive and unacceptable"". He told the BBC News Channel that it was ""the wrong direction in our analysis"" and ""we won't be ready to negotiate along those lines"".

"HMS Queen Elizabeth was built in blocks across six cities before being assembled in Rosyth A new national shipbuilding strategy intended to benefit UK shipyards is being unveiled by Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon. The government plans to buy at least five frigates, and share the work between shipyards around the UK. The first batch of new Type 31e frigates will bolster a depleted Royal Navy fleet, but it is hoped future ships will be bought by foreign navies. It comes as the Ministry of Defence aims to save billions of pounds. The new frigates would be built across different shipyards, but assembled at a central site, and ready for service by 2023. Their cost would be capped at Â£250m each. By Jonathan Beale, BBC defence correspondent The strategy has been called ""ambitious"" and with reason. Will there be enough work to sustain several shipyards in the UK? Will there really be demand from abroad for British-designed warships? And can you really build a frigate for just Â£250m? Defence doesn't have a great record of keeping costs under control. And that highlights a larger problem. The MoD's budget is once again in crisis. It's equipment programme has become more expensive because of a fall in the pound. It still has to find tens of billions of pounds in ""efficiency savings"". And all three services are struggling to recruit and retain key personnel. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon boasts of a growing defence budget. But the sums still don't add up. To balance the books, the MoD will need to make another round of painful defence cuts. Sir Michael told BBC Breakfast this was a ""huge opportunity"" for UK shipyards which could bid for these ""big contracts"" next year, with building expected to start the following year. ""It's a great day for the Royal Navy."" The navy currently uses Type 23 frigates, which would be slowly phased out, added Sir Michael. They are to be replaced by eight Type 26 frigates, which are being built in Glasgow, and five of the smaller Type 31e frigates. This video can not be played Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon tells Radio 4's Today the defence budget will ""continue to increase"" He acknowledged previous warships had been over-budget and delivered late. But he insisted that the new approach of fixing the price at the start, as recommended by industrialist Sir John Parker inhis 2016 shipbuilding review,external, would allow them to take advantage of the ""renaissance"" in shipbuilding. ""We have to get back to making things,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said the defence budget would increase from Â£36bn this year to Â£37bn next year. ""I'm determined our armed forces will have the new equipment they need,"" he added. Scottish National Party defence spokesman Stewart McDonald said the plans had ""nothing to do with ambition"". ""It is all about squeezing costs to the bone and cutting corners, and still leaves real uncertainties for the future for workers at Scottish shipyards and the communities that depend on them."" GMB, the union for workers in the shipbuilding industry, said it would watch the government closely to see whether it ""backs its warm words with deeds"" to protect the UK's shipbuilding future. ""Without a clear commitment from government, it will be foreign competitors who will benefit from vital work that should be taking place in UK yards,"" GMB national officer Ross Murdoch warned.

"The observatory was funded largely by the Scottish Meteorological Society Scientists are seeking the public's assistance in rescuing a unique set of weather records gathered at the summit of the UK's highest mountain. From 1883 to 1904, meteorologists were stationed atop Ben Nevis, logging temperature, precipitation, wind and other data around the clock. Their measurements are held in five big volumes that now need to be digitised to be useful to modern researchers. The public can help with the conversion at thewww.weatherrescue.org,externalwebsite. It will involve copying tables into a database. Experts say the Ben Nevis records contain some fascinating reports on major storms from the period. This video can not be played Prof Ed Hawkins: ""Just a few minutes of someone's time can contribute to improving our knowledge"" It is not uncommon for the summit to be covered in a thick mist There are also likely insights to be gained on the peculiarities of mountain weather. A fresh analysis could possibly lead to improvements in the performance of today's forecasting models. ""The data these men took is incredible, and it's arguably the most detailed mountain weather measurements we still have even today,"" said Reading University's Prof Ed Hawkins, who leads the Operation Weather Rescue: Ben Nevis project. ""And because the data was acquired over a century ago, it's a very good baseline from which to try to assess any changes that we've seen since then to our weather."" The Royal Society of Edinburgh published the data volumes between 1890 and 1910 The Ben Nevis observatory was set up to collect upper-atmosphere information. Nowadays, this function is performed by satellites, radars, and radiosondes (balloons). But in Victorian times, placing thermometers, rain gauges and anemometers on a tall mountain was the only systematic way to obtain the necessary data. And at an altitude of 1,345m (4,411ft), the imposing Munro fitted the requirements perfectly. The Scottish Meteorological Society largely funded the exercise, paying to put in a pony track, a low-rise building and a telegraph wire. It also had a second station set up in Fort William at the base of the mountain. This allowed comparisons to be made with the weather at sea-level. High ambition: The meteorologists of the day wanted to acquire data from further up in the atmosphere Three or four men would man the summit observatory at any one time. One of these staffers would be the cook. They also had a pet cat. Working in shifts, the meteorologists tracked hourly changes in temperature, pressure, rainfall, sunshine, cloudiness, wind strength and wind direction. And those parameters could be pretty brutal on occasions, with hurricane force winds and very heavy precipitation. ""At the start, when the snow was very bad, they had to tunnel their way out to make measurements,"" said Marjory Roy, former Superintendent of Met Office Edinburgh and author of the definitive book on the observatory - The Weathermen of Ben Nevis. ""They had a plan, though, for a tower - that's what you see in the photographs. The tower allowed them to mount an anemometer and other instruments, but it also allowed them to get out in winter when the snow was at roof-level."" The observatory closed when the sources of private and public funding would no longer cover the Â£1,000-a-year running costs. Calum MacColl is a meteorologist who hails from Fort William, and recognises the Ben's many moods. He says modern models still struggle on occasions with their forecasts for the conditions on the highest ground, and he is hopeful the Victorian information can bring new benefits. ""In the last 10-20 years, the models have come on leaps and bounds and have a real good go at trying to mark out the complex orography (mountain topography). But they don't always get the peaks right and that can translate into inaccuracies in terms of the temperature, where the cloud base is going to be, and, somewhat more vital from the mountaineer's perspective - the strength of wind speed. ""It can be out by 30, 40 or 50 knots. Taking the old information into the new models could make a difference."" Looking southeast with fog trapped below a temperature inversion (warm air above cold) In addition to their weather tables, the old volumes also contain some wonderful sketches of the Northern Lights and some of the optical effects that can be created when sunlight interacts with the likes of ice crystals or dust in the atmosphere. These aspects, however, are to be investigated separately. Recovering old weather information is a daunting task. There are literally millions of records from centuries past that would undoubtedly aid modern scientific study if only they could be converted into a useable form. The Royal Navy, for example, has a colossal archive of hand-written logbooks that will need to be transferred to digital form at some point. Prof Hawkins says optical character-recognition tools can play their part in getting this old information into modern databases, but he believes citizen scientists are a powerful force. ""In part this is about trust,"" he told BBC News. ""Do we trust a computer to read some of these old logbooks perfectly, or do we trust three sets of human eyes instead? And I think for accuracy, the human eyes still do it better."" Close to the edge: Hurricane force winds can blow at the summit A companion station was operated in Fort William to collect complementary sea-level data The Operation Weather Rescue: Ben Nevis project aims to have recovered two million data points from the mountain volumes by November. The deadline coincides with the UK Natural Environment Research Council's free public event in Edinburgh in the middle of that month calledUnEarthed. Staged at the Dynamic Earth venue,externalnext to the Scottish parliament, it will showcase wide-ranging endeavours of Britain's environmental scientists.

"Anders Johansen prefers watching lower-league football - such as at eighth-tier Spalding United in Lincolnshire In a modest County Durham football ground, a cross-country summer adventure will end tonight. The match, between Darlington Railway Athletic and Tow Law Town, takes place in Northern League Division Two. It is the 10th tier of English football, where games are sometimes still played on mud patches and the players smell of Deep Heat. The crowd will be 100, at most. If it rains, it will be half that. But among them, come rain or shine, will be Anders Johansen. Anders, 44, is from Norway. This match will be the 27th he has seen in Britain in 24 days. While some people seek out the sun, Anders has spent his summer holiday watching teams such as Llandrindod Wells, Quorn, and Percy Main Amateurs. ""My friends think I'm mad,"" he admits. In total, Anders has seen matches at 445 grounds in England, most in the past few years (two years ago, he saw 117 games in one season). He's also been to 18 grounds in Scotland, three in Wales, and two in Northern Ireland. In short, he is a groundhopper. While others collect stamps, Anders collects football grounds. Groundhoppers collect football grounds, as well as supporting their own team Some watch more than 200 matches a season Tony Incenzo,external, a QPR fan, has visited more than 2,000 grounds in total John Stancombe, who is blind, has been to more than 1,600 grounds Some leagues hold groundhopping weekends to enable people to visit new grounds Anders grew up watching English football. In Norway, First Division matches were broadcast live on Saturday afternoons, and a whole generation was hooked. In the early 1990s, an English friend introduced Anders to Reading FC. Anders became a fan, travelling from Norway a couple of times a season to watch matches. But, by 2010, he was ""falling out of love"" with the club. Reading were in a golden era - spending two seasons in the Premier League from 2006 to 2008 - but Anders was disillusioned. ""I always wanted Reading to reach the Premier League,"" he says. ""But when we got there I found it boring. ""I don't like the top level any more. It's not for me. It's been reduced to business. It's all about money - foreign owners, foreign managers, foreign players. ""And I don't like the new grounds. They all look the same. Plastic bowls."" During one visit to England, in between Reading games, Anders went to a non-league match (in England, non-league means anything below the top four divisions of the Premier League and Football League). ""I fell in love again,"" he says. ""At the top level, you're just a customer. A number. In non-league, you always get a welcome."" Anders at Pollok FC in Glasgow Anders has been welcomed in every corner of Britain: from Falmouth Town (Cornwall) to Forres Mechanics (near Inverness). In Shildon, County Durham, where he visited on August Bank Holiday Monday, he got a full English - and a pint - in the clubhouse before the game. At Sheringham, Norfolk, which he visited on 18 August, he got a club shirt and a lift back to the station. ""Things like that are typical,"" says Anders. ""People are kind."" And the hospitality goes both ways. At Horden Colliery Welfare, Anders won the raffle not once, but twice. Both times, the prizes - a bottle of wine and a box of chocolates - were given back to the club. Horden Colliery Welfare in County Durham, where Anders won the raffle - twice It is the community, as much as the football, that keeps Anders flying over the North Sea. Although he does visit bigger clubs - he has been to Sunderland and Tranmere Rovers this summer - Anders enjoys the grassroots grounds the most. ""In Norway, below the top two or three divisions, most football grounds are very boring,"" he says. ""They are council-owned plastic pitch complexes. A number of teams groundshare. It is no-one's home. ""They are not allowed to sell alcohol, so people come a minute before kick-off and leave at the final whistle. ""But in Britain, most teams have a clubhouse. People get there early. The football clubs are like a little community hub."" After visiting more than 450 British grounds, Anders is well known in non-league football - ""I often see a friendly face,"" he says - but he prefers to travel alone. ""That way I can go where I want."" He uses a rail pass to keep costs down and stays in budget hotels and B&Bs, or with friends. Anders, who's from Drobak, a town 20 miles south of Oslo, used to work in warehousing but quit to follow his passion. He now earns money writing guides to English football. ""So far it's been okay,"" he says. ""But I am considering finding another job."" One of Anders' favourite grounds: Salts FC in West Yorkshire After tonight's match in Darlington, Anders will fly home on Friday. He is due back in England on Boxing Day. How long he stays depends on how much money he saves before then. But what about when the grounds run out? What will he do when there are no more worlds to conquer? ""There are always new grounds to visit,"" he says, laughing. ""And in the last year or two, I've taken a liking to Scottish grounds."" Is Liam the UK's youngest 'groundhopper'?

"The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, says Britain's economic model is broken, as the gap between the richest and poorest parts of the UK widens. Britain stands at a watershed and must make ""fundamental choices"" about the direction of the economy, he said. The remarks come in a report by a commission set up by the centre-left Institute for Public Policy Research. The UK Treasury said: ""Employment is at a record high, the deficit is down and inequality is at a 30-year low."" The IPPR's interim Commission on Economic Justice report says the UK economy is the most unbalanced in Europe, and contains more workers overqualified for their jobs than the rest of the European Union. Britain's economic model is simply unfit for the 2020s, the IPPR argues. The organisation proposes a ""fundamental reform"" of the economy, on a scale comparable with the Atlee reforms of the 1940s and the Thatcher revolution of the 1980s. Committee members include the Archbishop, along with leading figures from business and civil society. The archbishop said: ""Our economic model is broken. Britain stands at a watershed moment where we need to make fundamental choices about the sort of economy we need. ""We are failing those who will grow up into a world where the gap between the richest and poorest parts of the country is significant and destabilising."" The report sets out new analysis which suggests that, although GDP per head has risen by 12% since 2010, average earnings per employee have fallen by 6%. It says that since the 1970s, the share of national income that has gone to wages has gradually declined, from 80% to 73%, while the share going to profits has increased. The wage share is now the lowest it has been since the World War Two. The report says that economic growth and earnings have ""'decoupled"" since the financial crisis. It states: ""The UK economy no longer translates economic growth into rising earnings. Gains from growth have gone largely into profits rather than wages, and the UK economy is now in the longest period of earnings stagnation for 150 years."" The Commission is calling for an urgent public debate on taxation, the role of the financial sector, the power of trade unions as well as looking at the impact of new company models including Google and Amazon. Cable: Inherited wealth fuels inequality Rise in Living Wage 'may have to wait' 'My life as a Deliveroo rider' Inflation-busting jobs: Why you should be a pilot Overall, the report's analysis finds that the economy is no longer raising living standards for a majority of the population. It says this growth was a ""promise"" that has underpinned public life since 1945 and the economy's deep weaknesses make it ""unfit"" to face the challenges of the 2020s. A Treasury spokesman said the government was proud of its record but there was more to be done: ""That is why we are investing Â£23bn in infrastructure, R&D and housing, while also reforming technical education to prepare for the high paid, high skilled jobs of the future."" Among the main points of the IPPR's research: The UK is experiencing the longest period of earnings stagnation for 150 years, and young people today are set to be poorer than their parents The UK is the most geographically unbalanced economy in Europe, with 40% of output produced in London and the South East and average incomes in the North West, South West, West Midlands and Wales now more than 30% lower than in London The labour market is increasingly casualised, with more workers on low pay than 10 years ago, 3% of the workforce on zero-hours contracts and more employees overqualified for their jobs than anywhere else in the EU The UK is the most unequal of western European countries, with nearly a third of children living in poverty. More of the poor now live in working households (54%) than in non-working households (46%). The report calls for public debate on a range of reforms, including: A fairer and simpler tax system, that incentivises economic ""goods"" such as investment and employment and dis-incentivises ""bads"" such as pollution and property prices. It suggests that taxes could be ""hypothecated"", or earmarked for health and social care A better distribution of wealth, potentially through new taxes and a sovereign wealth fund to better distribute national wealth Much greater economic power for the UK's nations and regions, including greater ""fiscal devolution"" and regional banks to support local economies Stronger trade unions, to help raise wages and protect workers in the ""gig economy"" Better regulation and taxation of monopoly digital companies to ensure that data created by consumers is used for public benefit and supports widespread innovation. As well as the Archbishop of Canterbury, the IPPR commission's members include Sir Charlie Mayfield, the chairman of John Lewis, Juergen Maier, the chief executive of German electronics giant Siemens, and Frances O'Grady, the general secretary of the TUC.
