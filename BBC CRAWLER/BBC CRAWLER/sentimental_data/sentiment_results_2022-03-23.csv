"Motorists will have noticed that the price of petrol and diesel has been creeping up in recent weeks. These rising costs may pile further pressure on families whose budgets are already being squeezed. Petrol and diesel prices have been on a rollercoaster ride this year. Recent data from 13 August puts petrol at an average of 149.1p per litre on UK forecourts. In just two weeks, it has shot up by more than 4p and it marks the highest price seen since February. Diesel stands at an average of 150.6p per litre - a level not seen since late May. Although it now costs about Â£82 to fill up a 55-litre family car, prices have fallen back from the record highs seen last summer, which were sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Luke Bosdet, the AA's spokesman on road fuel prices, said that this recent surge would, however, ""lump pressure back on diesel users, particularly on small businesses"". Fuel prices in the UK move together with changes in the price of crude oil - which it is made from. They are also affected by the exchange rate between the pound and dollar, as crude oil is traded in dollars. A weaker pound would mean that fuel gets more expensive. Oil prices have risen in recent weeks as producers have tried to restrict output. Oil rich nations such as Saudi Arabia and Russia that form part of a group called Opec+ have cut back production. They are grappling with slow demand as economies around the world struggle with high prices and the adjustment after the Covid pandemic. The West has accused Opec of manipulating prices. As the biggest exporter and the leader of the pack, Saudi Arabia wants oil prices to stay elevated to make sure it has a steady stream of income while it tries to diversify its economy. What is Opec and what is happening to oil prices? Livia Gallarati, an oil markets analyst at Energy Aspects, said that prices could grind higher still because of supplies being dented. She suggested Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, could even move above $90 (Â£71) per barrel. Supplies have also been affected by recent outages at oil refineries across the United States and Asia. Oil prices jumped following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with Brent crude hitting more than $120 a barrel in June 2022. Russia used to be one of the world's largest oil exporters, but that wasbefore punishing sanctions were imposed by the West. After peaking in summer last year, oil prices fell back to a little above $70 a barrel in March this year amid concerns over weak demand. Experts have said that motorists shouldn't expect petrol prices to go up much more unless garages and supermarkets decide to take a bigger cut - or margin - per litre sold. The price of diesel, however, might rise in the autumn and winter because large parts of Europe rely on it for their heating. Retailers said in July that they will to workwith the UK's competition watchdog to set up a scheme to allow motorists to compare live fuel prices online. It came after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that weak competition meant that the average annual supermarket margins on fuel had increased by 6p per litre between 2019 and 2022 - equivalent to Â£900m in extra costs for drivers. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said that despite the recent announcement, ""there is still far too much regional variation in prices, particularly among the big four supermarkets, which unfairly penalises drivers in some areas."" He urged drivers to shop around where they can in a bid to save cash. In March, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt also announced that fuel duty - a tax motorists pay when buying fuels such as petrol and diesel - would be frozen for another year, having been cut by 5p the year before. It will cost the government more than Â£5bn and think tanks such as theInstitute for Government have suggested,externalit might sit awkwardly with its climate-related pledges.

"Alex, lying face-down, practices his accuracy at long range Alex lowers himself into position on a camping mat - face down - with the careful moves of a man who knows backache. ""It gets painful staying like this for long,"" he says, with a smoker's husky laugh. But lying in wait is the task of the sniper. That's the wartime role for Alex, who used to have an office job in financial control. The 45-year-old settles in behind the rifle sights, with most of his face covered by a camouflage balaclava. He has been a hunter since boyhood, he says - ""always with a licence"" he quickly adds. When Russian invaded Ukraine, Alex joined the territorial defence force, along with some 100,000 others according to the authorities here. ""I wanted to do something for my motherland,"" he says. Now, in a forest on the outskirts of Kyiv, he's doing target practice. He radios ahead before firing one careful shot at a time. A member of his unit radios back with results: ""You missed the target. It's 15cm (6in) wide,"" he says, to swears from Alex. Tomorrow, he will practise again. He knows his role could be crucial. ""In history, in any war, when snipers appear on the battlefield, their work is very important,"" he says. ""They can protect other troops. This is very hard and very useful."" Recruits take a rest from their combat training in the forest Does he expect Russian forces to try to enter the city, or just keep bombarding it from the outside? ""I don't know,"" he says, ""but we must be prepared. We must practise, and we must defend the streets, the fields, and the forests"". He is unflinching and unapologetic about his switch from hunting game to hunting the enemy. ""I think there is no difference between the animals which I try to shoot and the animals which come here to kill our people, kill our children, destroy our buildings and destroy our life."" Nearby, other recruits to the 128th Battalion of the Kyiv territorial defence force are being trained in urban combat by an instructor from Georgia. Levan - now married with a family in Ukraine - fought the Russians in the war in his homeland in 2008. He's constantly in motion, crouching, shooting, shouting commands to the recruits. The grip of his handgun is decorated with an image of a white skull - from a vigilante character in Marvel comics called The Punisher. Levan lectures some troops while showing off a hand grenade He insists this is a war for freedom, not just a war for Ukraine. ""Nobody knows what the future holds,"" he says, ""but we are here, and we will fight. ""We have brave hearts. That's the most important thing."" Will that be enough to save Kyiv - the city President Putin covets? So far, Ukrainians troops have fought hard and fought well across the country. Russia has failed to take any major city - apart from Kherson in the South - but it is pulverising the strategic port of Mariupol and may soon control the ruins. When it comes to the capital, the defenders have many advantages. Kyiv is a city full of high-rise blocks and bomb shelters. Ukrainian forces can control the heights and take cover below ground. For an invading army, a ground assault would be a nightmare scenario. And Russia's slow progress has given the city time to kit up. Since I arrived in Kyiv - almost a month ago - this ancient city has developed a new architecture. There are sandbagged lookout posts, spiky metal tank traps, barricades, and roadblocks - all aimed at stopping or slowing a Russian ground attack. It's an ugly addition to a city famed for its onion-domed cathedrals and elegant facades. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Anna kept a video diary of her new life under attack in Kyiv Bridges have been blocked. Checkpoints have mushroomed across the city, manned by troops who are often on edge. Passports and press cards are checked and checked again. Driving here these days is a stop-start business. Russia troops remain about 15km (9 miles) north-west of Kyiv and about 30km to the east - just as they were last week, according to the latest assessment from the Pentagon. A full-on ground attack looks unlikely, but British defence officials expect Russia to prioritise encircling the capital in the coming weeks. And in the meantime, Russia may keep terrorising the city with missile attacks and shelling. The thud of explosions and the wail of air raid sirens is now the soundtrack of a city that has otherwise fallen largely silent. Back in the forest, recruits like 32-year-old Arthur prepare for whatever may come, including death. In the midst of war, he's trying to safeguard the future of his four-year-old daughter Leia (he's a Star Wars fan). ""I am trying to prepare my will, while notaries are still working, so that my money will be transferred to my family,"" he says. ""This is a lottery, like Russian roulette. You may live, and you may not. I am making arrangements with my friends in Ukraine and outside to support my family for some time if I die."" Arthur speaks to the BBC's Orla Guerin about preparing for the worst Leia is in the relative safety of the Western city of Lviv, but the separation is hard. ""Yesterday, I couldn't call her because we were on alert, and now she thinks I didn't want to speak to her. I cannot even explain it to her,"" he says.  ""We are in an absolutely parallel universe, an absolutely different world, like a nightmare."" Arthur is an articulate softly-spoken member of the Maidan generation - the young Ukrainians who spearheaded the pro-European revolution of 2014. He's spent the years since then trying to reform and develop his country. Now he's staying to fight, so that Leia can grow up in her homeland, not in exile. His mood is sombre. So too his forecast. ""What everyone is afraid of,"" he says, ""is that it's going to be a long war. It would be a battle of resources and resilience. How long will we live like this as a society, and how long will they?"" And he has another fear - that ""because of hate"" Russia will raze to the ground what it cannot have. ""I am not sure that they will be able to besiege Kyiv,"" he tells me. ""It's a very long city with a lot of defences, and it will be really hard to encircle it. But what I am really afraid of is that out of weakness, out of despair, because they are losing this war, they will destroy it as much as possible.""

"The UK is facing its biggest drop in living standards on record as wages fail to keep pace with rising prices. Soaring energy prices could push inflation to a 40-year high of 8.7% in the final three months of 2022, the government forecaster said. Rising prices and tax hikes mean living standards will not recover to their pre-pandemic level until 2024-25, the Office for Budget Responsibility said. The chancellor said government would ""stand by"" people hit by higher prices. Living standards - disposable household incomes when adjusted for inflation - are expected to drop by 2.2% this year, the OBR said. That would be their largest fall in a financial year since records began in 1956. In the Spring Statement, Rishi Sunak said a 5p a litre fuel duty cut would take effect at 18:00 GMT, and he raised the threshold at which workers start paying National Insurance from Â£9,600 to Â£12,570. But the OBR, which publishes its economic forecasts twice a year, said Russia's invasion of Ukraine had ""major repercussions for the global economy, whose recovery from the worst of the pandemic was already being buffeted by Omicron, supply bottlenecks, and rising inflation"". The jump in oil and gas prices brought about by the conflict would ""weigh heavily on a UK economy that has only just recovered its pre-pandemic level"", it added. Petrol prices had already risen by 20% since the OBR's previous forecast, and household energy bills are set to increase by 54% in April. If wholesale energy prices remained as high as expected, then energy bills would rise by another 40% in October to take the bill for a typical household to Â£2,801 a year. The energy regulator Ofgem has already said bills will increase 54% to Â£1,971 for a typical household from April. With prices rising at such a rapid rate, wages would not keep up and and people would spend less, according to the OBR. As a result, it has dramatically slashed its growth forecast. In October prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine it expected the UK economy to grow 6% this year. Now it expects growth of just 3.8% this year. The chancellor promised to ""stand by"" families - but some of  those families may feel more like he's put his arms around them - only to pick their pockets. Much of their increased burden isn't the government's fault, reflecting global energy and food costs and supply issues. Come April the average household has to find nearly Â£1000 extra per year - just to afford the same stuff they did a year ago. And that's without counting the National Insurance increases, which are still going ahead. In total, the extra government help announced since October, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility will only compensate for a third of the prospective blow to living standards in the next 12 months. And it's not just household's fortunes that are at stake but the entire recovery - upon which the chancellor has pinned his hopes of rebuilding the public purse. The following year will also see slower growth than the OBR predicted five months ago. In 2023, the UK is expected to grow 1.8%, down from 2.1%. However, from 2024 growth is expected to accelerate faster than expected, rising 2.1% that year and 1.8% in 2025, up from 1.6% and 1.3% respectively. GDP or Gross Domestic Product is one of the most important ways of showing how well, or badly, an economy is doing. It's a measure - or an attempt to measure - all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in an economy. Stevie and Pauline Stevie Hall in Halifax says rising food, fuel and energy bills have nudged her into debt already. She told the BBC she had been batch cooking to save money and is only driving when there is a real need. ""We're just trying to get by, I'm trying to stay upbeat about it,"" she said. GDP allows businesses to judge when to expand and hire more people, and for government to work out how much to tax and spend. The OBR said the cut in living standards would have been worse without government support for households, including today's temporary 5p cut in fuel duty; the increase in the National Insurance contributions threshold; and a Â£9bn energy bill rebate scheme announced in February. ""Taking account of both energy and non-energy pressures on household incomes, the policy measures announced since October offset a third of the overall fall in living standards that would otherwise have occurred in the coming 12 months,"" it said in its report. But Institute for Fiscal Studies director Paul Johnson said: ""Perhaps what really stands out today is what was missing. ""In the face of what the OBR calls the biggest hit to household finances since comparable records began in 1956-57, [Mr Sunak] has done nothing more for those dependent on benefits, the very poorest, besides a small amount of extra cash for local authorities to dispense at their discretion. ""Their benefits will rise by just 3.1% for the coming financial year. Their cost of living could well rise by 10%.""

"The chancellor has announced a 5p a litre cut to fuel duty as motorists struggle with record fuel prices. Rishi Sunak said the move, which kicked in at 18:00 GMT on Wednesday and will last until next March, was ""the biggest cut to all fuel duty rates ever"". However, motoring company the RAC said the 5p cut only took prices ""back to where they were just over a week ago"". It said the reduction would take Â£3.30 off the cost of filling a typical 55-litre family car. Motorists have been hit by record pump prices since Russia's invasion of Ukraine led to an increase in the cost of oil because of supply fears. How much will the fuel duty cut on petrol save you? Spring Statement: Key points at a glance How Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement will affect you Average pump prices hit new records on Tuesday, with petrol topping Â£1.67 a litre and diesel close to hitting Â£1.80 for the first time, the RAC said. That left the cost of filling an average family car with petrol at more than Â£92 and nearly Â£99 for diesel. Fuel duty - a government tax which makes up part of the price when you buy petrol or diesel - is currently 58p per litre and has been for 11 years. The Treasury said the fuel duty cut - the first is more than a decade - would cost it Â£2.4bn and means a one-car family will save Â£100 on average over the next 12 months. The average van driver will save Â£200, it said, while hauliers will save Â£1,500. But RAC head of policy Nicholas Lyes said the cut was ""a drop in the ocean"" given the recent huge rise in fuel costs, which have not fallen despite crude oil coming off its record highs of earlier in March. He also warned there was a ""very real risk retailers could just absorb some or all of the duty cut themselves by not lowering their prices"". ""If this proves to be the case it will be dire for drivers,"" Mr Lyes said. ""It also wouldn't be totally unexpected based on the biggest retailers not reducing their prices late last year when the oil price fell sharply."" The RAC added although fuel duty had been cut to 53 per litre, it could take time to be reflected in pump prices due to it being charged on wholesale purchases by retailers, who are yet to buy new fuel at the lower rate. In response to Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement,supermarket chains Asda, Morrisons, Tesco and Sainsburys cut pump prices by 6p a litre, including a 1p reduction in VAT, but smaller independent fuel retailers have said they have to wait until current levels are depleted, before they can benefit from the tax relief in their next orders. The average price of a litre of petrol has risen by more than 40p since last year's Spring Statement, which means the government is getting an extra 7p per litre in VAT, which is the other tax the government imposes on fuel. Diesel prices are up by nearly 50p a litre, almost 9p of which is VAT. The fuel duty cut will be welcomed by many drivers, particularly those with large vehicle or who drive long distances - but it also runs counter to environmental goals. The website Carbon Brief calculated that the decision in 2010 to freeze fuel duty had led to an increase in emissions of up to 5%. The Treasury said it had acted to cut fuel duty now because: ""Unique circumstances globally, including the war in Ukraine, have pushed pump prices up to unprecedented levels."" AA president Edmund King said he was concerned that the benefit would be lost unless retailers passed it on. ""Since the start of the year, the 20p-a-litre surge in pump prices has been the shock that rocked the finances of families."" He said there had been a substantial reduction in wholesale fuel costs since 9 March. ""That needs to drive lower pump prices also,"" he added. ""The road fuel trade shouldn't leave the Treasury to do the heavy lifting when cutting motoring costs."" Fuel prices, which were already rising as global economies recovered from the coronavirus pandemic, surged after the war in Ukraine pushed up global oil prices. Changes in prices at the pump are mainly determined by crude oil prices and the dollar exchange rate, because crude oil is traded in dollars. Russia is one of the world's major oil exporters and it is being targeted by economic and trading sanctions. After Brent crude oil - a global benchmark for prices - hit a near 14-year high of $139 a barrel during the early stages of the conflict, prices fell back to around $100, but have since risen again and were trading at about $120 a barrel on Wednesday.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says it looks to him as if P&O Ferries has ""broken the law"" Doubts have been cast on a claim by Boris Johnson that the sudden sacking of 800 workers by P&O Ferries may have broken UK employment law. The prime minister told the Commons the firm could face fines ""running into millions of pounds"" if found guilty. But employment lawyers told the BBC Mr Johnson had misunderstood the law and P&O had not broken the rules. It came as the boss of the ferry firm apologised for the mass sacking, saying he understood the ""anger and shock"". The sackings - along with claims that workers paid as little as Â£1.81 an hour will replace the fired staff - have sparked outrage. At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said: ""Under section 194 of the trades union and labour relations act of 1992, it looks to me as though the company concerned has broken the law. ""And we will be taking action therefore, and we will be encouraging workers themselves to take action under the 1996 employment rights act."" P&O Ferries offers Â£100,000 to some sacked staff Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal? According toSection 194 of the act,external, firms are meant to notify the Secretary of State before they sack 100 people or more. However, Tim Tyndall, employment partner at Keystone Law, told the BBC the law had changed in 2018 due to the implementation of an EU directive. Chris Grayling was the Secretary of State for Transport from 2016 to 2019 when the change was made. Firms no longer need to inform the UK government about mass dismissals but instead must tell the governments of the countries where boats are registered, he said. Protestors marched through London on Monday Eight P&O Ferries ships are registered overseas in countries including Cyprus and The Bahamas. ""The obligation to notify the government of P&O actions has not been breached as the competent authority for these foreign registered ships is the government of where they are registered,"" Mr Tyndall said. ""It would appear the government did not understand its own legislation when writing in the terms that it did to P&O."" A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ""The requirement to inform the flagged authorities of workforce changes was introduced in 2018 in order to implement a directive from the European Union. ""The government is strongly committed to protecting UK seafarers and those who work in UK waters continue to be protected by National Minimum Wage laws despite the 2018 legal change."" Separately, Nautilus International, the trade union for maritime professionals, has accused P&O Ferries of breaking UK law because it did not notify the relevant flag states of its decision to sack workers. It said under UK Law, P&O Ferries was ""obliged to provide 45 days' notice to the Cypriot authorities, and 30 days' notice to the Bahamian and Bermudan authorities"". ""We believe the government must penalise P&O Ferries for their omission,"" said general secretary Mark Dickinson. The BBC has approached P&O for comment following the union's claim. On Wednesday, P&O boss Mr Hebblethwaite said he understood people's anger. ""I want to say sorry to the people affected and their families for the impact it's had on them, and also to the 2,200 people who still work for P&O and will have been asked a lot of difficult questions about this,"" he said. ""Over the last week, I've been speaking face-to-face to seafarers and their partners. They've lost their jobs and there is anger and shock and I completely understand."" He added that the sackings were necessary to keep the loss-making firm afloat. ""This was an incredibly difficult decision that we wrestled with but once we knew it was the only way to save the business, we had to act,"" Mr Hebblethwaite said. ""I wish there was another way and I'm sorry."" It comes after reports that Indian agency workers paid as little as Â£1.81 an hour have already replaced sacked P&O workers at the Port of Dover. Last week, P&O said the figure was inaccurate but said it could not comment on how much agencies pay workers on ferries. At Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government should immediately cancel a Â£50m freeports contract awarded to P&O's owner, DP World. Ministers have said such contracts are under review. ""DP World must be quaking in their boots,"" the Labour leader said. ""The prime minister says how disappointed he is in them whilst handing them Â£50m.""

"The 54-year-old tennis star - who denies all the charges - is on trial at Southwark Crown Court Boris Becker, the six-time Grand Slam tennis champion, offered his wedding ring in a bid to pay off his debts, a court has heard. Mr Becker also wanted to sell his Mallorca estate in an effort to cancel his bankruptcy, the jury was told. The 54-year-old German national was declared bankrupt in June 2017 after borrowing more than Â£3m from a bank. He is on trial at Southwark Crown Court charged with 24 offences under the Insolvency Act. He denies all charges. The former men's world number one is accused of hiding, or failing to hand over, assets including nine trophies and medals from his tennis career. His 1985 and 1989 Wimbledon men's singles titles, his Australian Open trophies from 1991 and 1996 and his 1992 Olympic gold medal are among the items he is alleged to have concealed. As the third day of his trial began on Wednesday, the court heard that Mr Becker had been interviewed at his London home in July 2017 by Michael Bint from the Insolvency Service. The prosecution is being brought by the Insolvency Service on behalf of the business secretary. In court, Mr Bint agreed with Mr Becker's barrister - Jonathan Laidlaw QC - that the tennis star had been ""co-operative"" during the hour-long discussion, which happened amid time pressures due to Mr Becker working for the BBC at a nearby tennis tournament. ""He offered to let you walk around the house in Wimbledon to see what was there, he volunteered an expensive wedding ring to you,"" Mr Laidlaw said. The barrister added that Mr Becker's ""overriding concern was to seek an annulment of the bankruptcy"". But the former tennis champion is accused by prosecutors of failing to hand over various high-value items. The jury was told the tennis star was interrupted on about 20 occasions by his adviser, who allegedly spoke of ""work in progress"" or ""investigations being in hand"" at least 14 times. Mr Bint said he had failed to get Mr Becker to sign a preliminary information questionnaire document  - the only time he has forgotten in hundreds of cases since 2007 - because ""Mr Becker had to simply run away to go to Wimbledon"". ""Normally I would ask for a signed copy,"" Mr Bint added. Mr Becker is also alleged to have hidden â¬1.13 million (Â£940,000) from the sale of a Mercedes car dealership he owned in Germany, which was paid into his Boris Becker Private Office (BBPOL) account. On Tuesday, Prosecutor Rebecca Chalkley said: ""It is the prosecution case that Mr Becker used the BBPOL sterling account as an extension of his own account, effectively as his own piggy bank, for everyday personal expenses such as school fees for the children and such like."" Ms Chalkley told the jury that the former world number one spent hundreds of pounds at Harrods, bought online groceries at Ocado and treated himself to Ralph Lauren clothes. At the start of the trial, Judge Deborah Taylor instructed the jury of 11 men and one woman to ignore Mr Becker's celebrity. ""You must treat him in exactly the same way you would treat someone you have not heard of and is not in the public eye,"" she said. The 24 charges Mr Becker has been accused of include: Nine counts of failing to deliver up trophies and other awards; Seven counts of concealing property totalling more than â¬1.5m Five counts of failing to disclose estate, including the properties in Germany and London, shares and a bank account Two of removal of property amounting to almost â¬500,000 One of concealing â¬825,000 of debt The trial, which is expected to last up to three weeks, continues.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has been delivering his Spring Statement as the costs of fuel, energy and food soar Sunak says 70% of workers will get an effective tax cut as he raises the threshold for paying National Insurance (NI) by Â£3,000 He also announces a 5p cut to fuel duty to come into force at 18:00 tonight And he announces that the basic rate of income tax will go from 20% to 19% by the end of Parliament in 2024 The Office for Budget Responsibility says inflation and higher taxes from April mean households face the biggest fall in living standards since records began Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves says Sunak should have scrapped the planned rise to NI and put a windfall tax on oil and gas companies The chancellor's challenge has been laid bare as prices rose by 6.2% in the 12 months to February - the fastest for 30 years Edited by Alex Therrien That's the end of our live coverage of the Spring Statement, though you can find further reaction and analysis on the BBC website. The live page writers today were Jennifer Scott, Paul Seddon, Jennifer Meierhans, Ben King and Marie Jackson. The page was edited by Alex Therrien and Georgina Pattinson. Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled his Spring Statement as the costs of fuel, energy and food soar We'll soon be bringing our live coverage of the Spring Statement to a close. But before we do, here's a recap of what happened today. Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled his Spring Statement in Parliament amid a backdrop of soaring fuel, energy and food prices.  Spring Statement: The key points at a glance The measures in the Spring Statement will not stop eateries from having to pass on higher costs to customers, who are already leaving bad reviews over meal prices, a restaurant boss says. Suleman Raza, boss of the Spice Village restaurant group, tells BBC News that it was ""very likely"" that customers would see further price rises when they go out for dinner. ""The customers are already not happy. Some of the prices have already increased because we were not able to absorb this inflation and we are getting a lot of bad reviews on Google and other social media platforms where people are not happy about this price increase. ""We attract everyday, normal customers and they can't afford these prices so this mini budget is definitely not for ordinary people."" He also says the fuel duty reduction of 5p a litre is ""not going to make a massive difference"" to food suppliers. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The most high-profile energy supplier to collapse during the last year is Bulb, which has 1.6 million customers. It was put into special administration in November after facing rising wholesale costs it was unable to pass on to customers. In effect it was rescued and quasi-nationalised by the government. Office for Budget Responsibility documents published today reveal that decision has cost the government Â£1.2bn so far, with expectations of a further Â£1bn bill in the next financial year. Even then, the volatility of global energy markets means the OBR has said: ""There remains uncertainty around the final cost."" Rishi Sunak said the UK was facing the same challenges as many countries around the world Sunak is also asked how he felt when he saw analysis from the Office for Budget Responsibility saying UK households are set to see the biggest drop in their spending power in 2022-23 since records began in 1956, The chancellor doesn't answer directly. Instead he says the UK is facing the same challenges as many countries around the world, with rising prices and high inflation. He repeats that he cannot protect everyone from the full impact, but says: ""Where we can make a difference of course we will and that is why the policies announced today are a significant intervention. ""We are on people's side at this difficult time."" The chancellor filled up a customer's car after his Spring Statement After his appearance in Parliament, Rishi Sunak headed off to south London to talk to the public - and reporters - at a Sainsbury's petrol station. He was pictured filling up the tank of one of the customers, and appeared to even pay for the fuel, as well as a can of drink and a chocolate bar for good measure. But back to the matter of today's announcements, the chancellor said there were ""uncertain times ahead"". He adds: ""I can't protect everyone from all the global challenges we face, [but] the policies announced today will put billions of pounds back into the pockets of hard-working families."" Asked why there wasn't more help for people on welfare, Sunak says the government has already helped by changing the taper rate for universal credit - brought in after the Â£20 uplift was removed - and today the Treasury is providing more money to councils to support them. ""But the best way to help people in welfare over time is to support them to get into work and that is what we are doing,"" he adds.  Green Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay attacks the chancellor for failing to mention climate The Green Party has responded to the chancellor's Spring Statement, saying he has focused on ""the interests of fossil fuel companies and his partyâs
backbenchers, while ignoring the plight of millions on lower incomes"". The party's co-leader Adrian
Ramsay says it is ""negligence
in the extreme to have offered so little to help those struggling through this
cost of living crisis"". And he attacks Rishi Sunak for failing to mention climate once. The party did welcome the VAT cut on energy
efficiency measures, such as solar panels and heat pumps. But Ramsay says the promise of a future tax cut ""shows the chancellor is focused on
winning the next general election, and not helping those on benefits and lower
incomes who are in desperate need right nowâ. Reality Check In his Spring Statement, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said it was âthanks to Brexitâ that he could get rid of VAT on solar panels and heat pumps for the next five years. He said homeowners would no longer need to pay 5% VAT on them. After Brexit, the UK does have more freedom to set its VAT rates, but the EU is also planning to exempt these products from VAT. On 2 March 2022, the EU Parliament approved plans to allow member states to exempt a number of products from VAT, including solar panels and green heating systems, as part of its new environmental policy. The EU changes have not yet come into effect, while Sunakâs will start next month. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The rise in National Insurance contributions was directly
linked to increasing funding for the NHS and paying for Englandâs cap on social care costs. So naturally one question being asked is how the decision
to increase the threshold at which National Insurance is paid affects that? In
the short-term, it doesnât. The health budget in England is
set until 2025 and nothing in todayâs statement suggests the government will
revisit that. The same is true for the care cap â although the overall
budget for the care system has not been set. In the longer term, some are warning this will lead to less
money than expected being available for public services more generally. And the rising cost of living has a wider societal
impact on health - by pushing more people into poverty, which is one of the key
drivers of poor health. This, in turn, will increase demands on health and care, NHS
leaders are warning. The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, has welcomed a further Â£500m for councils, announced by the chancellor in his Spring Statement, to provide targeted welfare support to low-income households. Councillor Shaun Davies, from LGA, said councils would need maximum flexibility and quick details on
  allocations to make sure funding reaches those in need and
  can help to prevent families from reaching crisis point in the first
  place. He said the increase in funding through the Household Support Fund - essentially council grants aimed at helping the most vulnerable pay for food, clothing and bills - was a positive step but could not address underlying cost of living pressures on its own, nor help people make the most of their money and strengthen financial resistance. ""With many households likely to be economically
  vulnerable for some time to come, councils also want to work with government
  on an effective long-term solution to preventing poverty and disadvantage that
  moves away from providing crisis support towards improving life chances,"" he added. Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent By 2027 the highest will be at the highest level since the late 1940s - when Sir Stafford Cripps was chancellor Despite todayâs tax concessions, the fine print of Rishi Sunakâs plans suggest heâs a way off being the lower-tax chancellor he ultimately wants to be. By 2027, 36.3% of the nation's income is set to be siphoned off to the tax man, the biggest tax burden since the late 1940s. The concessions heâs unveiled today only offset a sixth of the tax rises introduced since 2020. Some of the increased tax burden is understandable - hundreds of billions of public money was spent on pandemic support packages which successfully protected the vast majority of livelihoods. But bringing it down will be harder given the pressures on the public purse: By 2027, the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's economic watchdog, reckons public spending will have âsettledâ at 41.1% of national income, which is 2.1% higher than pre-pandemic 2019-20 levels, and the highest sustained level since the late 1970s.  This video can not be played Earlier today shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves accused the chancellor of not understanding the scale of the challenge. ""His choices are making the cost of living crisis worse - not better,"" she told MPs, speaking after Rishi Sunak had delivered his Spring Statement. Watch the video above. Greenpeace UK praises the announcement by the chancellor that the government will cut VAT on energy-saving items, like insulation, heat pumps and solar panels. Policy Director Dr Doug Parr says it is a ""welcome start to  ending that huge
waste of energy, helping keep bills down and cut our gas use"". But he says it can only be the start. ""We
need to see around Â£10bn of support, part raised by a windfall tax on oil and
gas companies, for delivering the help families need to install the clean
technologies that will get us off gas,"" he adds. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent First-time buyers may wonder how they can afford to save for a deposit when their spending power is falling. Predictions from the Office for Budget Responsibility show that the average proportion of income which is saved is going to fall. Last year, owing in part to the pandemic, individuals typically saved more than 10% of their income. Next year it will be 3.1%. However, the silver lining for young buyers is that the runaway house price rises of recent years will slow, according to the OBR. The forecaster says the average UK house price will go up by 7.4% this year, then 1.3% next year, before accelerating again to 1.5%, 2.5% and 3.1% in subsequent years. Unitegeneral secretary Sharon Graham has criticised the chancellor for ""tinkering around the edges"" of the cost-of-living crisis, saying he had done nothing to tackle the corporate elite. ""Workers will still be facing sleepless nights worrying about how to make ends meet, overwhelmed by rocketing prices,"" she said. ""Once again, ordinary working people bear the broadest burden while the super-rich get off scot-free."" Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of theNational Education Union, called on the government to reverse the real terms cuts to teacher pay if they want to protect living standards and building a strong economy. AndTUCgeneral secretary Frances O'Grady said families did not get the urgent help with soaring bills they needed, and said the National Insurance threshold rise would mostly benefit the better-off. ""The small print shows that pay packets are now expected to fall in value by Â£11 a week this year,"" she added. Manuel Cortes,Transport Salaried Staffs' Associationgeneral secretary, said the statement was a missed opportunity. ""This government is fuelling - quite literally - a car-led recovery instead of promoting climate-friendly solutions such as public transport."" More from financial journalist Martin Lewis who says the measures announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak are ""not going to lift that many people out of the mire"". He describes the National Insurance threshold rise as a squirrel rather than the rabbit out of the hat he was hoping for. He tells Radio 5 Live: ""The cost of living crisis is still going to be a substantial net loss in people's real income over the next year and what has happened today will not cover that for people on lower or higher incomes but it will mitigate some of the impact. ""There will still be many people who will be struggling and having to choose between freezing and starving but there will be fewer. ""And there will be clearly be people who are going to have to curtail their lifestyles due to the cost of living... and some of them won't have to curtail it quite as much."" Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The National Insurance threshold change means people earning up to about Â£34,000 a year will be better off. The chancellor has moved the point at which people start paying National Insurance from just over Â£9,500 last year to just over Â£12,500 from July. But once you start paying National Insurance, the rate will be higher than it was last year (13.25% instead of 12%). How does that net out?
Putting both changes together, youâll be paying less National Insurance this year if you earn less than Â£34,000. Nearly 70% of employees earn less than that, so most people will be see a smaller employeeâs National Insurance bill in their payslip this year. Someone earning Â£20,000 will pay about Â£180 less National Insurance this year than last year, while  someone earning Â£50,000 will be paying about Â£200 more. Mel Stride chairs the Treasury Select Committee of MPS The chair of the MPs' Treasury Committee praises some of the ""helpful measures"" brought forward by Rishi Sunak to ""alleviate cost of living pressures faced by low-income households"". But the chancellor will be facing more questions from the MP and his colleagues. In a statement after the chancellor's speech, the Tory MP says: ""The Treasury Committee will be particularly interested in establishing
whether the balance struck between support measures introduced now, and planned
tax cuts later, is the right one. ""We will also wish to assess whether the
amount of fiscal headroom that the Chancellor has maintained is appropriate,
given the many risks present in the OBRâs forecast, and the pressing need to
provide cost of living support now.â Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor There are some interesting measures that have been announced by the chancellor today. But the figure that courses through all of this is that very high inflation. It affects everything - how much borrowing there is, the debt interest payments too - and the prediction of it reaching 9% by the end of the year is pretty extraordinary. Rishi Sunak has kept the National Insurance rise to pay for the NHS and social care - starting next month. But he announced today that in July, after three months, half of that gets given back mainly to lower earners in the form of a higher National Insurance threshold. Then the rest of it goes back via a tax cut, but only if the conditions are met in his tax plan in a couple of years time. Overall, it means he hasn't had to reverse the National Insurance rise he had already announced and he continues to go big on being a ""tax cutting chancellor"". But if you look at the OBR's documentas, he has only cut back about one sixth of all the taxes that have been raised since he came into No 11. You still have corporation tax going up, you still have NI going up in people's pay packets this April, and you still have council tax going up. BBC Politics LiveBBC2's lunchtime political programme The leader of the Liberal Democrats says the Spring Statement has been a ""total swindle"" by Rishi Sunak, ""giving with one hand and taking with another"". Sir Ed Davey tells BBC's Politics Live: ""We are facing a cost of living crisis which is the worst for over 50 years, according to the OBR, [with] inflation already at the highest for 40 years. ""People are drowning with those higher energy bills, those higher food costs, those higher fuel bills. They needed a life boat and the chancellor has utterly failed them."" He said the Lib Dems would have provided a much bigger one-off cut in VAT, costing the Treasury Â£18bn, but giving household Â£600 to ""help reflate the economy"". Sir Ed adds: ""That's the sort of bold measure we needed."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Trust me, I'm a tax cutter. Rishi Sunak cares so much about tax, the chancellor even had his own ten-page glossy pamphlet that came with the Spring Statement document. It was tucked under his arm as he emerged from No 11 Downing Street to pose for the cameras before going to the Commons. There was a practical imperative for him to make some move to help with the cost of living, after demands from all parts of the political spectrum. And it seems, a self-imposed political imperative to show that despite presiding over enormous rises in tax and borrowing, that he really is a tax cutter at heart. Sunak vows to cut income tax before next election Is Rishi Sunak a tax-cutter? How Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement will affect you Two eye-catching cuts were therefore flourished at the dispatch box. The level at which workers start paying National Insurance gets a chunky increase. From July, it will kick in at the same level of income tax. In effect, that's a tax cut for millions of workers. But remember, not that long ago, that Rishi Sunak himself had resolved to put that tax up. So what will be trumpeted as a tax cut by the Tories whenever they get the chance is also a partial reversal of a rise that they themselves decided to do. No surprise then it's been branded the ""hokey cokey"" by Labour: not quite in then out - but up, then partly down. Fuel duty on petrol and diesel will be cut by 5p, in a bid to help motorists with prices at the pumps Second, the chancellor confirmed what many had long suspected: that he would hold back some financial fire power now, to dangle tax cuts to the voting public in the run-up to the election. This strategy is not exactly a surprise. But what's deeply unusual is that Mr Sunak chose to announce this giveaway, a penny off income tax, two years before it would kick in. It's certainly unusual to announce election goodies this far out, not just because it kills any element of political surprise, but also it ties the chancellor's hands in the years ahead. While the moves seem to designed to polish up Mr Sunak's credentials as a tax cutter, the black and white of the statement documents beg to differ. As chancellor, he has increased taxes massively more than he has just reduced them. As the official number crunchers at the OBR put it: ""The chancellor has undone just over a quarter of the overall value of the personal tax rises he announced last year, and around a sixth of the overall net tax rises he has announced since becoming chancellor."" In other words, he's giving a pound back for every six that he's already taken. That's why one right-of-centre think tank, Bright Blue, has branded him the confused chancellor this afternoon. Another, the free-market Adam Smith Institute, warns the chancellor giveth, and the chancellor taketh away. With such strong warnings about the drop in living standards that looms, political signalling on tax may be swamped by a much tougher reality. With the chancellor's chosen big focus on tax, there was less significant attention on immediate help for firms and families who will struggle the most with bills. There was no mention of increases on benefits, extra cash for public services that might be hit by inflation, and only one mention of the government mantra of ""levelling up"". It was always the case that the Treasury favoured a ""wait and see"" approach when it comes to extra help to people as energy and prices spiral. The inflation spike came before the invasion of Ukraine, but accelerates the trend and makes the next few months so much more uncertain. Just because No 10 didn't press the button on more support today doesn't mean it's not likely in October. The Conservative benches, and many members of the public too, may be heartened after two years of mammoth public spending to hear the party's money man talk about giving cash back. Cutting tax at the pump matters. Raising the NI threshold makes a difference. But at a time of potential peril, Rishi Sunak may have left himself vulnerable to the charge that he hasn't yet understood the scale of the squeeze so many families and firms really face. He wants to focus on tax cuts, but many voters may very soon be more preoccupied with the unavoidable cut in the standard of how they can afford to live. Is Rishi Sunak a tax-cutter?

But bringing it down will be harder given the pressures on the public purse: By 2027, the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's economic watchdog, reckons public spending will have âsettledâ at 41.1% of national income, which is 2.1% higher than pre-pandemic 2019-20 levels, and the highest sustained level since the late 1970s.

""His choices are making the cost of living crisis worse - not better,"" she told MPs, speaking after Rishi Sunak had delivered his Spring Statement. Watch the video above. Greenpeace UK praises the announcement by the chancellor that the government will cut VAT on energy-saving items, like insulation, heat pumps and solar panels. Policy Director Dr Doug Parr says it is a ""welcome start to  ending that huge
waste of energy, helping keep bills down and cut our gas use"". But he says it can only be the start. ""We
need to see around Â£10bn of support, part raised by a windfall tax on oil and
gas companies, for delivering the help families need to install the clean
technologies that will get us off gas,"" he adds. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent First-time buyers may wonder how they can afford to save for a deposit when their spending power is falling. Predictions from the Office for Budget Responsibility show that the average proportion of income which is saved is going to fall. Last year, owing in part to the pandemic, individuals typically saved more than 10% of their income. Next year it will be 3.1%. However, the silver lining for young buyers is that the runaway house price rises of recent years will slow, according to the OBR. The forecaster says the average UK house price will go up by 7.4% this year, then 1.3% next year, before accelerating again to 1.5%, 2.5% and 3.1% in subsequent years. Unitegeneral secretary Sharon Graham has criticised the chancellor for ""tinkering around the edges"" of the cost-of-living crisis, saying he had done nothing to tackle the corporate elite. ""Workers will still be facing sleepless nights worrying about how to make ends meet, overwhelmed by rocketing prices,"" she said. ""Once again, ordinary working people bear the broadest burden while the super-rich get off scot-free."" Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of theNational Education Union, called on the government to reverse the real terms cuts to teacher pay if they want to protect living standards and building a strong economy. AndTUCgeneral secretary Frances O'Grady said families did not get the urgent help with soaring bills they needed, and said the National Insurance threshold rise would mostly benefit the better-off. ""The small print shows that pay packets are now expected to fall in value by Â£11 a week this year,"" she added. Manuel Cortes,Transport Salaried Staffs' Associationgeneral secretary, said the statement was a missed opportunity. ""This government is fuelling - quite literally - a car-led recovery instead of promoting climate-friendly solutions such as public transport."" More from financial journalist Martin Lewis who says the measures announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak are ""not going to lift that many people out of the mire"". He describes the National Insurance threshold rise as a squirrel rather than the rabbit out of the hat he was hoping for. He tells Radio 5 Live: ""The cost of living crisis is still going to be a substantial net loss in people's real income over the next year and what has happened today will not cover that for people on lower or higher incomes but it will mitigate some of the impact. ""There will still be many people who will be struggling and having to choose between freezing and starving but there will be fewer. ""And there will be clearly be people who are going to have to curtail their lifestyles due to the cost of living... and some of them won't have to curtail it quite as much."" Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The National Insurance threshold change means people earning up to about Â£34,000 a year will be better off. The chancellor has moved the point at which people start paying National Insurance from just over Â£9,500 last year to just over Â£12,500 from July. But once you start paying National Insurance, the rate will be higher than it was last year (13.25% instead of 12%). How does that net out?
Putting both changes together, youâll be paying less National Insurance this year if you earn less than Â£34,000. Nearly 70% of employees earn less than that, so most people will be see a smaller employeeâs National Insurance bill in their payslip this year. Someone earning Â£20,000 will pay about Â£180 less National Insurance this year than last year, while  someone earning Â£50,000 will be paying about Â£200 more. Mel Stride chairs the Treasury Select Committee of MPS The chair of the MPs' Treasury Committee praises some of the ""helpful measures"" brought forward by Rishi Sunak to ""alleviate cost of living pressures faced by low-income households"". But the chancellor will be facing more questions from the MP and his colleagues. In a statement after the chancellor's speech, the Tory MP says: ""The Treasury Committee will be particularly interested in establishing
whether the balance struck between support measures introduced now, and planned
tax cuts later, is the right one. ""We will also wish to assess whether the
amount of fiscal headroom that the Chancellor has maintained is appropriate,
given the many risks present in the OBRâs forecast, and the pressing need to
provide cost of living support now.â Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor There are some interesting measures that have been announced by the chancellor today. But the figure that courses through all of this is that very high inflation. It affects everything - how much borrowing there is, the debt interest payments too - and the prediction of it reaching 9% by the end of the year is pretty extraordinary. Rishi Sunak has kept the National Insurance rise to pay for the NHS and social care - starting next month. But he announced today that in July, after three months, half of that gets given back mainly to lower earners in the form of a higher National Insurance threshold. Then the rest of it goes back via a tax cut, but only if the conditions are met in his tax plan in a couple of years time. Overall, it means he hasn't had to reverse the National Insurance rise he had already announced and he continues to go big on being a ""tax cutting chancellor"". But if you look at the OBR's documentas, he has only cut back about one sixth of all the taxes that have been raised since he came into No 11. You still have corporation tax going up, you still have NI going up in people's pay packets this April, and you still have council tax going up.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has been delivering his Spring Statement as the costs of fuel, energy and food soar Sunak says 70% of workers will get an effective tax cut as he raises the threshold for paying National Insurance (NI) by Â£3,000 He also announces a 5p cut to fuel duty to come into force at 18:00 tonight And he announces that the basic rate of income tax will go from 20% to 19% by the end of Parliament in 2024 The Office for Budget Responsibility says inflation and higher taxes from April mean households face the biggest fall in living standards since records began Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves says Sunak should have scrapped the planned rise to NI and put a windfall tax on oil and gas companies The chancellor's challenge has been laid bare as prices rose by 6.2% in the 12 months to February - the fastest for 30 years Edited by Alex Therrien That's the end of our live coverage of the Spring Statement, though you can find further reaction and analysis on the BBC website. The live page writers today were Jennifer Scott, Paul Seddon, Jennifer Meierhans, Ben King and Marie Jackson. The page was edited by Alex Therrien and Georgina Pattinson. Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled his Spring Statement as the costs of fuel, energy and food soar We'll soon be bringing our live coverage of the Spring Statement to a close. But before we do, here's a recap of what happened today. Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled his Spring Statement in Parliament amid a backdrop of soaring fuel, energy and food prices.  Spring Statement: The key points at a glance The measures in the Spring Statement will not stop eateries from having to pass on higher costs to customers, who are already leaving bad reviews over meal prices, a restaurant boss says. Suleman Raza, boss of the Spice Village restaurant group, tells BBC News that it was ""very likely"" that customers would see further price rises when they go out for dinner. ""The customers are already not happy. Some of the prices have already increased because we were not able to absorb this inflation and we are getting a lot of bad reviews on Google and other social media platforms where people are not happy about this price increase. ""We attract everyday, normal customers and they can't afford these prices so this mini budget is definitely not for ordinary people."" He also says the fuel duty reduction of 5p a litre is ""not going to make a massive difference"" to food suppliers. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The most high-profile energy supplier to collapse during the last year is Bulb, which has 1.6 million customers. It was put into special administration in November after facing rising wholesale costs it was unable to pass on to customers. In effect it was rescued and quasi-nationalised by the government. Office for Budget Responsibility documents published today reveal that decision has cost the government Â£1.2bn so far, with expectations of a further Â£1bn bill in the next financial year. Even then, the volatility of global energy markets means the OBR has said: ""There remains uncertainty around the final cost."" Rishi Sunak said the UK was facing the same challenges as many countries around the world Sunak is also asked how he felt when he saw analysis from the Office for Budget Responsibility saying UK households are set to see the biggest drop in their spending power in 2022-23 since records began in 1956, The chancellor doesn't answer directly. Instead he says the UK is facing the same challenges as many countries around the world, with rising prices and high inflation. He repeats that he cannot protect everyone from the full impact, but says: ""Where we can make a difference of course we will and that is why the policies announced today are a significant intervention. ""We are on people's side at this difficult time."" The chancellor filled up a customer's car after his Spring Statement After his appearance in Parliament, Rishi Sunak headed off to south London to talk to the public - and reporters - at a Sainsbury's petrol station. He was pictured filling up the tank of one of the customers, and appeared to even pay for the fuel, as well as a can of drink and a chocolate bar for good measure. But back to the matter of today's announcements, the chancellor said there were ""uncertain times ahead"". He adds: ""I can't protect everyone from all the global challenges we face, [but] the policies announced today will put billions of pounds back into the pockets of hard-working families."" Asked why there wasn't more help for people on welfare, Sunak says the government has already helped by changing the taper rate for universal credit - brought in after the Â£20 uplift was removed - and today the Treasury is providing more money to councils to support them. ""But the best way to help people in welfare over time is to support them to get into work and that is what we are doing,"" he adds.  Green Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay attacks the chancellor for failing to mention climate The Green Party has responded to the chancellor's Spring Statement, saying he has focused on ""the interests of fossil fuel companies and his partyâs
backbenchers, while ignoring the plight of millions on lower incomes"". The party's co-leader Adrian
Ramsay says it is ""negligence
in the extreme to have offered so little to help those struggling through this
cost of living crisis"". And he attacks Rishi Sunak for failing to mention climate once. The party did welcome the VAT cut on energy
efficiency measures, such as solar panels and heat pumps. But Ramsay says the promise of a future tax cut ""shows the chancellor is focused on
winning the next general election, and not helping those on benefits and lower
incomes who are in desperate need right nowâ. Reality Check In his Spring Statement, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said it was âthanks to Brexitâ that he could get rid of VAT on solar panels and heat pumps for the next five years. He said homeowners would no longer need to pay 5% VAT on them. After Brexit, the UK does have more freedom to set its VAT rates, but the EU is also planning to exempt these products from VAT. On 2 March 2022, the EU Parliament approved plans to allow member states to exempt a number of products from VAT, including solar panels and green heating systems, as part of its new environmental policy. The EU changes have not yet come into effect, while Sunakâs will start next month. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The rise in National Insurance contributions was directly
linked to increasing funding for the NHS and paying for Englandâs cap on social care costs. So naturally one question being asked is how the decision
to increase the threshold at which National Insurance is paid affects that? In
the short-term, it doesnât. The health budget in England is
set until 2025 and nothing in todayâs statement suggests the government will
revisit that. The same is true for the care cap â although the overall
budget for the care system has not been set. In the longer term, some are warning this will lead to less
money than expected being available for public services more generally. And the rising cost of living has a wider societal
impact on health - by pushing more people into poverty, which is one of the key
drivers of poor health. This, in turn, will increase demands on health and care, NHS
leaders are warning. The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, has welcomed a further Â£500m for councils, announced by the chancellor in his Spring Statement, to provide targeted welfare support to low-income households. Councillor Shaun Davies, from LGA, said councils would need maximum flexibility and quick details on
  allocations to make sure funding reaches those in need and
  can help to prevent families from reaching crisis point in the first
  place. He said the increase in funding through the Household Support Fund - essentially council grants aimed at helping the most vulnerable pay for food, clothing and bills - was a positive step but could not address underlying cost of living pressures on its own, nor help people make the most of their money and strengthen financial resistance. ""With many households likely to be economically
  vulnerable for some time to come, councils also want to work with government
  on an effective long-term solution to preventing poverty and disadvantage that
  moves away from providing crisis support towards improving life chances,"" he added. Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent By 2027 the highest will be at the highest level since the late 1940s - when Sir Stafford Cripps was chancellor Despite todayâs tax concessions, the fine print of Rishi Sunakâs plans suggest heâs a way off being the lower-tax chancellor he ultimately wants to be. By 2027, 36.3% of the nation's income is set to be siphoned off to the tax man, the biggest tax burden since the late 1940s. The concessions heâs unveiled today only offset a sixth of the tax rises introduced since 2020. Some of the increased tax burden is understandable - hundreds of billions of public money was spent on pandemic support packages which successfully protected the vast majority of livelihoods.

"Everyone across the UK is facing the sharpest rise in their cost of living for decades. Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement is primarily an update on the current state, and future expectations, of the nation's finances. But he also announced some big, new policies that will affect our personal budgets in the coming months and years. Bringing together expected changes in earnings, reforms to taxes, and the recently announced energy measures, a middle earner on Â£27,500 per year can expect to be about Â£360 worse off this year than they were last, according to economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Many of the necessities we buy - notably food, fuel and energy - have been rising in price. On Wednesday, official figures revealed that the cost of a whole host of goods and services, from furniture to toys, have also been increasing sharply. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) saidprices rose by 6.2% in the 12 months to February- the fastest for 30 years. The chancellor's Spring Statement confirmed that consumers should be braced for things getting more expensive at a faster rate later in the year. Official forecasts, from the Office for Budget Responsibility, suggest inflation (which charts the rising cost of living) will average 7.4% this year, peaking at around 9% at the end of the year. The big question for anyone with a job is whether their pay will rise in line with prices. We already knew that the minimum pay rate for those aged 23 and above - the National Living Wage - will go up by 6.6%, as the hourly rate increases from Â£8.91 to Â£9.50. Inflation-matching wage rises in themselves could create a problem for the economy as a whole, by creating an inflationary spiral. It remains highly unlikely that employers will put up wages by that much when facing their own cost pressures, particularly their firm's energy bills. In September, the government announced that employees will pay 1.25p more in the pound from their pay packet in National Insurance contributions from this April. In a significant move, he has now said that the earnings threshold at which people start to pay National Insurance will rise. What will National Insurance changes cost me? At present, most workers start paying National Insurance contributions when their income hits Â£9,568. They pay 12% of earnings between Â£9,568 and Â£50,270, then 2% on any earnings above Â£50,270. Now the chancellor has said, from July, National Insurance will be paid on income over Â£12,570 a year - the same level as income tax starts being paid. In practice, the two measures will mean that anyone earning less than about Â£35,000 a year will pay less National Insurance during the year. That is about 70% of all workers. Those who earn more will see a tax rise, albeit smaller than they would have expected. For an employee earning Â£20,000 a year, it means an annual National Insurance cut of Â£180 in 2022-23, instead of an Â£89 rise expected before the announcement, according to accountancy firm Deloitte For a Â£40,000 earner, it means a rise of Â£70, instead of a previously expected Â£339 rise For a Â£60,000 earner, it means a Â£320 rise, instead of a previously expected Â£589 rise Self-employed people, who pay at a different rate, will see slightly less of a benefit from the chancellor's decision. Over time, this threshold is frozen, which will steadily mean more low-earners will have to pay. Early last year Mr Sunak said the thresholds at which income tax is paid would be frozen at April 2021 levels for five years (although Scotland has different levels). That means pay rises will push more people into higher tax bands. At the end of his speech, he pledged to reduce the basic rate of income tax by 1p in the pound before the end of the Parliament in 2024. Millions of households are facing a Â£693 (54%) rise in the cost of a typical annual gas and electricity bill, to about Â£2,000, when the regulator's new, higher price cap takes effect on 1 April. The latest analysis from Cornwall Insight suggests there will be a further Â£541 a year (27%) rise in October, before falling back. The OBR has predicted a Â£850 rise in October. Mr Sunak said he had already taken ""decisive action"", in helping people with their bills. This includes a Â£150 council tax rebate for 80% of households, followed by a Â£200 discount on bills in October which will need to be repaid, and an expansion to a support scheme for vulnerable people. In a longer-term move, he said that VAT would be cut from 5% to 0% on energy efficiency products such as solar panels, insulation and heat pumps. Prices to fill up the car with fuel were rising before the war in Ukraine - and the fallout from Russia's invasion has made things worse. The average price of petrol has risen by more than 40p per litre since last year's Spring Statement. The chancellor announceda 5p a litre reduction in fuel dutyfor the next year, which takes some of the sting out of rising prices, The RAC motoring organisation said that move would knock Â£3.30 off the cost of filling a typical 55 litre family car. Benefits and the state pension are rising by 3.1% in April, well below the rising cost of living. This prompted many charities to call on the chancellor to go further. Mr Sunak did not agree, saying nothing new about benefit and pension levels. However, if inflation does reach the levels predicted by the OBR. then benefits and the state pension could see a significant rise in April 2023 - as the increases are usually linked to the inflation rate in the preceding autumn. Local councils will be given another Â£500m in the Household Support Fund, which supports vulnerable people with payments and grants such as vouchers to help pay their bills.

"This video can not be played Watch: Chancellor Rishi Sunak announces that income tax will be cut by 2024 Chancellor Rishi Sunak has set out measures aimed at combating soaring energy, food and fuel prices, in his Spring Statement. He cut fuel duty by 5p but resisted calls to scrap April's National Insurance rise of 1.25p in the pound. He warned the UK's post-pandemic recovery had been blown off course by the war in Ukraine. But he held out the promise of an income tax cut in 2024 when he said the economy would be in better shape. Labour said he had made an ""historic mistake"" by pushing ahead with next month's National Insurance increase, which the party warned would hit workers hard. But the chancellor said the money raised was needed for the NHS - and instead he said he would raise the threshold at which workers start paying National Insurance from Â£9,600 to Â£12,570. Spring Statement: Key points at a glance How Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement will affect you Squeeze on households overwhelms tax reversal More than a million face poverty, think tank warns This would amount to ""a Â£6bn personal tax cut for 30 million people across the United Kingdom, a tax cut for employees worth over Â£330 a year,"" said the chancellor. Mr Sunak warned the economic outlook was uncertain and the full impact of the war in Ukraine was not yet clear. The Office for Budget Responsibility painted a bleak picture of the UK's immediate economic prospects, saying that living standards are set to take the biggest hit since records began in the 1950s. It said inflation was set to peak at 8.7% at the end of this year and this - combined with rising taxes - will ""weigh heavily on living standards in the coming 12 months"". The watchdog said the UK's tax burden will be at the highest level since the 1940s. Other measures in the chancellor's mini-Budget include: VAT on solar panels, heat pumps, roof insulation and other energy saving measures will be reduced from 5% to zero for five years The employment allowance will increase from Â£4,000 to Â£5,000, allowing small businesses to reduce their National Insurance payments Green technology will be exempt from business rates from April, saving firms Â£35m in 2022-23 Councils get another Â£500m for the Household Support Fund from April, designed to help vulnerable households with rising living costs Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Mr Sunak had failed to appreciate the scale of the cost of living crisis facing workers and pensioners. This video can not be played WATCH: Labour's Rachel Reeves responds to Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement She told MPs: ""In eight days, people's energy bills will be rising by 54%, two weeks today the chancellor's tax hike will start hitting working people and their employers. ""His National Insurance tax rise was a bad idea last September and he's admitted it's an even worse one today."" She repeated Labour's call for a windfall tax on energy companies. Later, the chancellor answered questions on a phone-in on LBC radio. One woman said that despite a good salary ""on paper"", she was leaving her heating and lights off - and her family were wearing coats at home, to try to save on energy bills. She also said she was taking on extra cleaning and delivery jobs, and had cut her grocery shop down to Â£15 a week for her and her two children - and she often went without. ""Please tell me what else I can be doing,"" she asked. Mr Sunak paid tribute to her for working her ""socks off"" - and pointed to the energy bill rebate and higher national insurance threshold that will give a tax cut in July. UK faces biggest drop in living standards on record Fuel duty cut by 5p a litre to help motorists What's deeply unusual is that Mr Sunak chose to announce this giveaway, a penny off income tax, two years before it would kick in. It's certainly unusual to announce election goodies this far out, not just because it kills any element of political surprise, but also it ties the Chancellor's hands in the years ahead. While the moves seem to designed to polish up Mr Sunak's credentials as a tax cutter, the black and white of the statement documents beg to differ. As chancellor, he has increased taxes massively more than he has just reduced them. Read Laura's full blog The SNP criticised Mr Sunak over his decision not to reverse the removal of the Â£20-a-week top-up to Universal Credit payments, or to increase other benefits, ""at a time when people need it the most"". Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said ""the very poorest"" could see their cost of living increase by 10%, despite a ""small amount of extra cash"" promised by the chancellor for local authorities to help those on benefits. Sir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the Spring Statement was a ""total swindle"" by Mr Sunak, who he said was ""giving with one hand and taking with another"". And the Green Party criticised him for not mentioning climate issues. Its co-leader Adrian Ramsay accused Mr Sunak of ""[looking] after the interests of fossil fuel companies"". Mr Sunak promised the government would ""stand by"" families struggling with the cost of living. And in a surprise announcement at the end of his statement, he said his ambition was to cut the basic rate of income tax by 1p in the pound. ""It would clearly be irresponsible to meet this ambition this year,"" he told MPs, but official forecasts said inflation would be ""back under control"" and national debt falling by 2024, making a cut possible then, he added. ""I can confirm, before the end of this Parliament, in 2024, for the first time in 16 years, the basic rate of income tax will be cut from 20p to 19p in the pound. ""A tax cut for workers, for pensioners, for savers. A Â£5bn tax cut for 30 million people. It is fully costed and fully paid for in the plan announced today.""

"This video can not be played Major incident declared at London Aquatics Centre Twenty-nine people were taken to hospital with breathing problems and a major incident was declared following a gas leak at the London Aquatics Centre. About 200 people were evacuated from the venue at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, Stratford, on Wednesday after a large amount of chlorine gas was released. Almost 50 people were treated by paramedics for breathing difficulties. People could be seen being placed in ambulances while others wore blankets. Residents in the area were asked to close windows and doors. About 200 people were evacuated from the London Aquatics Centre The London Aquatics Centre was one of the main venues for the London Olympic Games in 2012, and was used for swimming, diving and synchronised swimming. It opened to the public in 2014. Surrounding roads were also cordoned off once the alarm was raised and members of the public were denied access to the park. The London Fire Brigade said the gas leak had been caused by a chemical reaction, causing a ""high quantity of chlorine gas"" to be released. Homerton Hospital in east London said it had admitted 12 adults and seven children with respiratory problems, while nearby Newham Hospital and The Royal London Hospital also said they were treating patients. There are thousands of homes in and around the former Olympics site, including several high-rise developments. Local resident Usman Hussain lives in the 28th floor of a nearby block with his baby. He told BBC London: ""It's quite scary and we are quite concerned."" The London Fire Brigade said ""positive pressure ventilation fans"" would be used to disperse chlorine gas into the atmosphere. The incident involved chlorine gas Commander Shaun Coltress said: ""We've not taken that decision lightly, we've got our scientific adviser and our hazardous materials adviser on scene."" Local people should keep their doors and windows closed for the ""next few hours"", he added, but stressed people living nearby should not be worried. ""We've got the right people here, we're used to responding to chemical incidents, we've taken the right advice, we've got the right cordons in place."" The centre is operated by Greenwich Leisure Limited (GLL), which said the release of gas occurred when ""the facilities management company that operates the plant room took delivery of pool chemicals"". ""We are working to support all those affected,"" it said. London Ambulance Service said it was attending a major incident in Stratford ""We are awaiting guidance from the facilities management company, London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) and the emergency services on when the centre will be able to reopen."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: ""Please avoid the area which has been cordoned off and evacuated. ""I remain in close contact with our emergency services who are dealing with a gas-related incident at the London Aquatics Centre this morning,"" he added. London Ambulance Service said it had sent a number of resources BBC News correspondent Greg McKenzie It looks and feels like a major incident - emergency service resources are huge and there is a cordon in place. There are lots of fire engines and ambulance personnel I can see, and it looks like they've created a makeshift centre to treat those with medical problems. I am standing about 800m away from the Aquatics Centre, but I have been able to speak with one woman who was there this morning. She was there for a morning swim and there was quite a few people there with children. They were told there was an issue with chlorine and they had to be evacuated quickly. As they were leaving, she could see some people struggling to breathe, but she said the evacuation was efficient and emergency services were quick on scene to help.

"This video can not be played Watch: Chancellor Rishi Sunak announces that income tax will be cut by 2024 Chancellor Rishi Sunak has set out measures aimed at combating soaring energy, food and fuel prices, in his Spring Statement. He cut fuel duty by 5p but resisted calls to scrap April's National Insurance rise of 1.25p in the pound. He warned the UK's post-pandemic recovery had been blown off course by the war in Ukraine. But he held out the promise of an income tax cut in 2024 when he said the economy would be in better shape. Labour said he had made an ""historic mistake"" by pushing ahead with next month's National Insurance increase, which the party warned would hit workers hard. But the chancellor said the money raised was needed for the NHS - and instead he said he would raise the threshold at which workers start paying National Insurance from Â£9,600 to Â£12,570. Spring Statement: Key points at a glance How Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement will affect you Squeeze on households overwhelms tax reversal More than a million face poverty, think tank warns This would amount to ""a Â£6bn personal tax cut for 30 million people across the United Kingdom, a tax cut for employees worth over Â£330 a year,"" said the chancellor. Mr Sunak warned the economic outlook was uncertain and the full impact of the war in Ukraine was not yet clear. The Office for Budget Responsibility painted a bleak picture of the UK's immediate economic prospects, saying that living standards are set to take the biggest hit since records began in the 1950s. It said inflation was set to peak at 8.7% at the end of this year and this - combined with rising taxes - will ""weigh heavily on living standards in the coming 12 months"". The watchdog said the UK's tax burden will be at the highest level since the 1940s. Other measures in the chancellor's mini-Budget include: VAT on solar panels, heat pumps, roof insulation and other energy saving measures will be reduced from 5% to zero for five years The employment allowance will increase from Â£4,000 to Â£5,000, allowing small businesses to reduce their National Insurance payments Green technology will be exempt from business rates from April, saving firms Â£35m in 2022-23 Councils get another Â£500m for the Household Support Fund from April, designed to help vulnerable households with rising living costs Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Mr Sunak had failed to appreciate the scale of the cost of living crisis facing workers and pensioners.

"The UK is facing its biggest drop in living standards on record as wages fail to keep pace with rising prices. Soaring energy prices could push inflation to a 40-year high of 8.7% in the final three months of 2022, the government forecaster said. Rising prices and tax hikes mean living standards will not recover to their pre-pandemic level until 2024-25, the Office for Budget Responsibility said. The chancellor said government would ""stand by"" people hit by higher prices. Living standards - disposable household incomes when adjusted for inflation - are expected to drop by 2.2% this year, the OBR said. That would be their largest fall in a financial year since records began in 1956. In the Spring Statement, Rishi Sunak said a 5p a litre fuel duty cut would take effect at 18:00 GMT, and he raised the threshold at which workers start paying National Insurance from Â£9,600 to Â£12,570. But the OBR, which publishes its economic forecasts twice a year, said Russia's invasion of Ukraine had ""major repercussions for the global economy, whose recovery from the worst of the pandemic was already being buffeted by Omicron, supply bottlenecks, and rising inflation"". The jump in oil and gas prices brought about by the conflict would ""weigh heavily on a UK economy that has only just recovered its pre-pandemic level"", it added. Petrol prices had already risen by 20% since the OBR's previous forecast, and household energy bills are set to increase by 54% in April. If wholesale energy prices remained as high as expected, then energy bills would rise by another 40% in October to take the bill for a typical household to Â£2,801 a year. The energy regulator Ofgem has already said bills will increase 54% to Â£1,971 for a typical household from April. With prices rising at such a rapid rate, wages would not keep up and and people would spend less, according to the OBR. As a result, it has dramatically slashed its growth forecast. In October prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine it expected the UK economy to grow 6% this year. Now it expects growth of just 3.8% this year. The chancellor promised to ""stand by"" families - but some of  those families may feel more like he's put his arms around them - only to pick their pockets. Much of their increased burden isn't the government's fault, reflecting global energy and food costs and supply issues. Come April the average household has to find nearly Â£1000 extra per year - just to afford the same stuff they did a year ago. And that's without counting the National Insurance increases, which are still going ahead. In total, the extra government help announced since October, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility will only compensate for a third of the prospective blow to living standards in the next 12 months. And it's not just household's fortunes that are at stake but the entire recovery - upon which the chancellor has pinned his hopes of rebuilding the public purse. The following year will also see slower growth than the OBR predicted five months ago. In 2023, the UK is expected to grow 1.8%, down from 2.1%. However, from 2024 growth is expected to accelerate faster than expected, rising 2.1% that year and 1.8% in 2025, up from 1.6% and 1.3% respectively. GDP or Gross Domestic Product is one of the most important ways of showing how well, or badly, an economy is doing. It's a measure - or an attempt to measure - all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in an economy. Stevie and Pauline Stevie Hall in Halifax says rising food, fuel and energy bills have nudged her into debt already. She told the BBC she had been batch cooking to save money and is only driving when there is a real need. ""We're just trying to get by, I'm trying to stay upbeat about it,"" she said. GDP allows businesses to judge when to expand and hire more people, and for government to work out how much to tax and spend. The OBR said the cut in living standards would have been worse without government support for households, including today's temporary 5p cut in fuel duty; the increase in the National Insurance contributions threshold; and a Â£9bn energy bill rebate scheme announced in February. ""Taking account of both energy and non-energy pressures on household incomes, the policy measures announced since October offset a third of the overall fall in living standards that would otherwise have occurred in the coming 12 months,"" it said in its report. But Institute for Fiscal Studies director Paul Johnson said: ""Perhaps what really stands out today is what was missing. ""In the face of what the OBR calls the biggest hit to household finances since comparable records began in 1956-57, [Mr Sunak] has done nothing more for those dependent on benefits, the very poorest, besides a small amount of extra cash for local authorities to dispense at their discretion. ""Their benefits will rise by just 3.1% for the coming financial year. Their cost of living could well rise by 10%.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says it looks to him as if P&O Ferries has ""broken the law"" Doubts have been cast on a claim by Boris Johnson that the sudden sacking of 800 workers by P&O Ferries may have broken UK employment law. The prime minister told the Commons the firm could face fines ""running into millions of pounds"" if found guilty. But employment lawyers told the BBC Mr Johnson had misunderstood the law and P&O had not broken the rules. It came as the boss of the ferry firm apologised for the mass sacking, saying he understood the ""anger and shock"". The sackings - along with claims that workers paid as little as Â£1.81 an hour will replace the fired staff - have sparked outrage. At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said: ""Under section 194 of the trades union and labour relations act of 1992, it looks to me as though the company concerned has broken the law. ""And we will be taking action therefore, and we will be encouraging workers themselves to take action under the 1996 employment rights act."" P&O Ferries offers Â£100,000 to some sacked staff Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal? According toSection 194 of the act,external, firms are meant to notify the Secretary of State before they sack 100 people or more. However, Tim Tyndall, employment partner at Keystone Law, told the BBC the law had changed in 2018 due to the implementation of an EU directive. Chris Grayling was the Secretary of State for Transport from 2016 to 2019 when the change was made. Firms no longer need to inform the UK government about mass dismissals but instead must tell the governments of the countries where boats are registered, he said. Protestors marched through London on Monday Eight P&O Ferries ships are registered overseas in countries including Cyprus and The Bahamas. ""The obligation to notify the government of P&O actions has not been breached as the competent authority for these foreign registered ships is the government of where they are registered,"" Mr Tyndall said. ""It would appear the government did not understand its own legislation when writing in the terms that it did to P&O."" A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ""The requirement to inform the flagged authorities of workforce changes was introduced in 2018 in order to implement a directive from the European Union. ""The government is strongly committed to protecting UK seafarers and those who work in UK waters continue to be protected by National Minimum Wage laws despite the 2018 legal change."" Separately, Nautilus International, the trade union for maritime professionals, has accused P&O Ferries of breaking UK law because it did not notify the relevant flag states of its decision to sack workers. It said under UK Law, P&O Ferries was ""obliged to provide 45 days' notice to the Cypriot authorities, and 30 days' notice to the Bahamian and Bermudan authorities"". ""We believe the government must penalise P&O Ferries for their omission,"" said general secretary Mark Dickinson. The BBC has approached P&O for comment following the union's claim. On Wednesday, P&O boss Mr Hebblethwaite said he understood people's anger. ""I want to say sorry to the people affected and their families for the impact it's had on them, and also to the 2,200 people who still work for P&O and will have been asked a lot of difficult questions about this,"" he said. ""Over the last week, I've been speaking face-to-face to seafarers and their partners. They've lost their jobs and there is anger and shock and I completely understand."" He added that the sackings were necessary to keep the loss-making firm afloat. ""This was an incredibly difficult decision that we wrestled with but once we knew it was the only way to save the business, we had to act,"" Mr Hebblethwaite said. ""I wish there was another way and I'm sorry."" It comes after reports that Indian agency workers paid as little as Â£1.81 an hour have already replaced sacked P&O workers at the Port of Dover. Last week, P&O said the figure was inaccurate but said it could not comment on how much agencies pay workers on ferries. At Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government should immediately cancel a Â£50m freeports contract awarded to P&O's owner, DP World. Ministers have said such contracts are under review. ""DP World must be quaking in their boots,"" the Labour leader said. ""The prime minister says how disappointed he is in them whilst handing them Â£50m.""

"KitKat bar Swiss food giant Nestle is pulling its popular brands out of Russia but will still sell essential foods. The firm stopped investment in the country earlier this month but has now suspended sales of brands such as KitKat and Nesquik. It follows fierce criticism of the firm by Ukrainian politicians. A growing number of Western brands have suspended operations in Russia in protest at the war but a few are staying put. ""As the war rages in Ukraine, our activities in Russia will focus on providing essential food - not on making a profit,"" Nestle said. ""We are fully complying with all international sanctions on Russia,"" it added. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy criticised Nestle for still conducting business in Russia in a streamed speech to protesters on Saturday. And earlier, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal tweeted that Nestle boss Mark Schneider ""shows no understanding"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

That led to #BoycottNestle trending on Twitter. The company has been gradually reducing its activity in Russia since the the start of the Ukraine war, but has been under pressure to pull out altogether. It scrapped advertising and capital investments and earlier this month stopped shipments of non-essential products like Nespresso coffee capsules and San Pellegrino water. But it continued to sell many of its brands saying: ""We have a responsibility toward our more than 7,000 employees in Russia - most of whom are locals"". The latest move will leave it selling just infant food and medical and hospital nutrition. ""While we do not expect to make a profit in the country or pay any related taxes for the foreseeable future in Russia, any profit will be donated to humanitarian relief organisations,"" it said. ""We stand with the people of Ukraine and our 5,800 employees there."" So far international brands such asMcDonald's,cosmetics firm L'Oreal, fashion retailer H&M and tech giant Apple have suspended or limited their activities in Russia. A minority of others continue to produce non-essential goods in the country, while companies such as M&S and Burger King say complex franchise agreements make it impossible to close their shops in Russia.

"The cost of living continued to soar last month, according to official figures. Prices rose by 6.2% in the 12 months to February - the fastest for 30 years - as fuel, energy and food costs surged. Prices are rising faster than wages and the Bank of England thinks it could hit double digits this year. Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Prime Minister Boris Johnson have been under pressure to do more to help struggling households. Inflation is the rate at which prices rise. If a bottle of milk costs Â£1 and that rises by 5p, then milk inflation is 5%. Why are prices rising so quickly? How could Rishi Sunak's plans affect you? Since December last year, prices have been rising at their fastest rate since the 1990s. Inflation is expected to speed up in April when the energy price cap is increased. This will push up the average household fuel bill up by Â£693 a year in England, Scotland and Wales, while a planned rise in National Insurance will also put pressure on household budgets. ""Rising inflation remains a significant concern for the economy, squeezing household incomes and increasing cost pressures on retailers,"" said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the pick up in inflation ""adds to the pressure on the chancellor to offset more of the cost of living crisis"". In his Spring Statement, Mr Sunak said that the war in Ukraine had a ""significant impact"" on the cost of living in the UK. In the statement he cut fuel duty by 5p per litre, raised the threshold for National Insurance to Â£12,570, and announced a cut to the basic rate of income tax to 19% from 20% in 2024. But Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Mr Sunak's choices ""were making the cost of living crisis worse, not better"". She said he should have put a windfall tax on oil and gas companies and scrapped the national insurance hike. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said gas prices were almost a third higher in February than a year earlier, and electricity prices were up by nearly a fifth. Average diesel prices hit their highest on record during the month, while food prices rose nearly 1% - the largest monthly increase since 2012. ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said prices of other goods such as toys, clothing and furniture also climbed. ""The price of goods leaving UK factories has also been rising substantially and is now at its highest rate for 14 years,"" he added. What these figures lay bare is that the cost of living crunch is unavoidable. Consumers have already been facing the financial reality of more expensive food, fuel and energy - all of which are necessities for pretty much every household. Now the ONS has confirmed that price rises are more widespread. Buying your child a toy for their birthday is more expensive than it was a year ago. Getting a new sofa takes a bigger chunk of your disposable income. The worry is that there is more of this to come, not least that analysts are predicting that a typical household energy bill will rise by Â£500 a year in October, on top of the annual Â£693 increase which takes effect at the start of April. As pandemic restrictions have eased around the world, firms have faced higher energy, shipping and wage costs, which they have passed on to consumers. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is now driving the price of oil and other commodities even higher. Average petrol and diesel prices hit new record highs on Tuesday, according to the RAC, with petrol hitting 167.30p per litre and diesel hitting 179.72p. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said cheaper wholesale prices had yet to be passed on to consumers. ""The cost of filling an average 55-litre family car with petrol is now more than Â£92 and nearly Â£99 for diesel, making the Â£100 tank inevitable,"" he said.

Andrew Selley is chief executive of Bidfood, one of the largest UK food wholesalers, which supplies more than 45,000 caterers and food firms.

Nothing exotic - these are standard food staples and we're seeing much bigger increases in those at the moment."" Mr Selley said that compared with last year the price of diesel was up by 40% and electricity by 250%, ""and those two things together make up over 10% of our total costs"". He added that a cut in fuel duty would help: ""I mean, fuel is obviously a driver across the whole industry, both from getting [food] from the farmer to the manufacturer, from the manufacturers to ourselves and from ourselves to the customers, so any relief on fuel would help to mitigate some of those increases coming through.""

"Motorists will have noticed that the price of petrol and diesel has been creeping up in recent weeks. These rising costs may pile further pressure on families whose budgets are already being squeezed. Petrol and diesel prices have been on a rollercoaster ride this year. Recent data from 13 August puts petrol at an average of 149.1p per litre on UK forecourts. In just two weeks, it has shot up by more than 4p and it marks the highest price seen since February. Diesel stands at an average of 150.6p per litre - a level not seen since late May. Although it now costs about Â£82 to fill up a 55-litre family car, prices have fallen back from the record highs seen last summer, which were sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Luke Bosdet, the AA's spokesman on road fuel prices, said that this recent surge would, however, ""lump pressure back on diesel users, particularly on small businesses"". Fuel prices in the UK move together with changes in the price of crude oil - which it is made from. They are also affected by the exchange rate between the pound and dollar, as crude oil is traded in dollars. A weaker pound would mean that fuel gets more expensive. Oil prices have risen in recent weeks as producers have tried to restrict output. Oil rich nations such as Saudi Arabia and Russia that form part of a group called Opec+ have cut back production. They are grappling with slow demand as economies around the world struggle with high prices and the adjustment after the Covid pandemic. The West has accused Opec of manipulating prices. As the biggest exporter and the leader of the pack, Saudi Arabia wants oil prices to stay elevated to make sure it has a steady stream of income while it tries to diversify its economy. What is Opec and what is happening to oil prices? Livia Gallarati, an oil markets analyst at Energy Aspects, said that prices could grind higher still because of supplies being dented. She suggested Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, could even move above $90 (Â£71) per barrel. Supplies have also been affected by recent outages at oil refineries across the United States and Asia. Oil prices jumped following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with Brent crude hitting more than $120 a barrel in June 2022. Russia used to be one of the world's largest oil exporters, but that wasbefore punishing sanctions were imposed by the West. After peaking in summer last year, oil prices fell back to a little above $70 a barrel in March this year amid concerns over weak demand. Experts have said that motorists shouldn't expect petrol prices to go up much more unless garages and supermarkets decide to take a bigger cut - or margin - per litre sold. The price of diesel, however, might rise in the autumn and winter because large parts of Europe rely on it for their heating. Retailers said in July that they will to workwith the UK's competition watchdog to set up a scheme to allow motorists to compare live fuel prices online. It came after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that weak competition meant that the average annual supermarket margins on fuel had increased by 6p per litre between 2019 and 2022 - equivalent to Â£900m in extra costs for drivers. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said that despite the recent announcement, ""there is still far too much regional variation in prices, particularly among the big four supermarkets, which unfairly penalises drivers in some areas."" He urged drivers to shop around where they can in a bid to save cash. In March, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt also announced that fuel duty - a tax motorists pay when buying fuels such as petrol and diesel - would be frozen for another year, having been cut by 5p the year before. It will cost the government more than Â£5bn and think tanks such as theInstitute for Government have suggested,externalit might sit awkwardly with its climate-related pledges. Watch your speed:The RAC says 45-50mph is the most efficient speed to drive for fuel efficiency Switch off the air conditioning: Extra energy is needed to power a car's air conditioning system and turning it on can increase your fuel consumption by up to 10%, according to the AA Check your tyre pressure:Underinflated tyres will use up extra petrol.

"The chancellor has announced a 5p a litre cut to fuel duty as motorists struggle with record fuel prices. Rishi Sunak said the move, which kicked in at 18:00 GMT on Wednesday and will last until next March, was ""the biggest cut to all fuel duty rates ever"". However, motoring company the RAC said the 5p cut only took prices ""back to where they were just over a week ago"". It said the reduction would take Â£3.30 off the cost of filling a typical 55-litre family car. Motorists have been hit by record pump prices since Russia's invasion of Ukraine led to an increase in the cost of oil because of supply fears. How much will the fuel duty cut on petrol save you? Spring Statement: Key points at a glance How Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement will affect you Average pump prices hit new records on Tuesday, with petrol topping Â£1.67 a litre and diesel close to hitting Â£1.80 for the first time, the RAC said. That left the cost of filling an average family car with petrol at more than Â£92 and nearly Â£99 for diesel. Fuel duty - a government tax which makes up part of the price when you buy petrol or diesel - is currently 58p per litre and has been for 11 years. The Treasury said the fuel duty cut - the first is more than a decade - would cost it Â£2.4bn and means a one-car family will save Â£100 on average over the next 12 months. The average van driver will save Â£200, it said, while hauliers will save Â£1,500. But RAC head of policy Nicholas Lyes said the cut was ""a drop in the ocean"" given the recent huge rise in fuel costs, which have not fallen despite crude oil coming off its record highs of earlier in March. He also warned there was a ""very real risk retailers could just absorb some or all of the duty cut themselves by not lowering their prices"". ""If this proves to be the case it will be dire for drivers,"" Mr Lyes said. ""It also wouldn't be totally unexpected based on the biggest retailers not reducing their prices late last year when the oil price fell sharply."" The RAC added although fuel duty had been cut to 53 per litre, it could take time to be reflected in pump prices due to it being charged on wholesale purchases by retailers, who are yet to buy new fuel at the lower rate. In response to Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement,supermarket chains Asda, Morrisons, Tesco and Sainsburys cut pump prices by 6p a litre, including a 1p reduction in VAT, but smaller independent fuel retailers have said they have to wait until current levels are depleted, before they can benefit from the tax relief in their next orders. The average price of a litre of petrol has risen by more than 40p since last year's Spring Statement, which means the government is getting an extra 7p per litre in VAT, which is the other tax the government imposes on fuel. Diesel prices are up by nearly 50p a litre, almost 9p of which is VAT. The fuel duty cut will be welcomed by many drivers, particularly those with large vehicle or who drive long distances - but it also runs counter to environmental goals. The website Carbon Brief calculated that the decision in 2010 to freeze fuel duty had led to an increase in emissions of up to 5%. The Treasury said it had acted to cut fuel duty now because: ""Unique circumstances globally, including the war in Ukraine, have pushed pump prices up to unprecedented levels."" AA president Edmund King said he was concerned that the benefit would be lost unless retailers passed it on. ""Since the start of the year, the 20p-a-litre surge in pump prices has been the shock that rocked the finances of families."" He said there had been a substantial reduction in wholesale fuel costs since 9 March. ""That needs to drive lower pump prices also,"" he added. ""The road fuel trade shouldn't leave the Treasury to do the heavy lifting when cutting motoring costs."" Fuel prices, which were already rising as global economies recovered from the coronavirus pandemic, surged after the war in Ukraine pushed up global oil prices. Changes in prices at the pump are mainly determined by crude oil prices and the dollar exchange rate, because crude oil is traded in dollars. Russia is one of the world's major oil exporters and it is being targeted by economic and trading sanctions. After Brent crude oil - a global benchmark for prices - hit a near 14-year high of $139 a barrel during the early stages of the conflict, prices fell back to around $100, but have since risen again and were trading at about $120 a barrel on Wednesday.

"The UK is facing its biggest drop in living standards on record as wages fail to keep pace with rising prices. Soaring energy prices could push inflation to a 40-year high of 8.7% in the final three months of 2022, the government forecaster said. Rising prices and tax hikes mean living standards will not recover to their pre-pandemic level until 2024-25, the Office for Budget Responsibility said. The chancellor said government would ""stand by"" people hit by higher prices. Living standards - disposable household incomes when adjusted for inflation - are expected to drop by 2.2% this year, the OBR said. That would be their largest fall in a financial year since records began in 1956. In the Spring Statement, Rishi Sunak said a 5p a litre fuel duty cut would take effect at 18:00 GMT, and he raised the threshold at which workers start paying National Insurance from Â£9,600 to Â£12,570. But the OBR, which publishes its economic forecasts twice a year, said Russia's invasion of Ukraine had ""major repercussions for the global economy, whose recovery from the worst of the pandemic was already being buffeted by Omicron, supply bottlenecks, and rising inflation"". The jump in oil and gas prices brought about by the conflict would ""weigh heavily on a UK economy that has only just recovered its pre-pandemic level"", it added. Petrol prices had already risen by 20% since the OBR's previous forecast, and household energy bills are set to increase by 54% in April. If wholesale energy prices remained as high as expected, then energy bills would rise by another 40% in October to take the bill for a typical household to Â£2,801 a year. The energy regulator Ofgem has already said bills will increase 54% to Â£1,971 for a typical household from April. With prices rising at such a rapid rate, wages would not keep up and and people would spend less, according to the OBR. As a result, it has dramatically slashed its growth forecast. In October prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine it expected the UK economy to grow 6% this year. Now it expects growth of just 3.8% this year. The chancellor promised to ""stand by"" families - but some of  those families may feel more like he's put his arms around them - only to pick their pockets. Much of their increased burden isn't the government's fault, reflecting global energy and food costs and supply issues. Come April the average household has to find nearly Â£1000 extra per year - just to afford the same stuff they did a year ago. And that's without counting the National Insurance increases, which are still going ahead. In total, the extra government help announced since October, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility will only compensate for a third of the prospective blow to living standards in the next 12 months. And it's not just household's fortunes that are at stake but the entire recovery - upon which the chancellor has pinned his hopes of rebuilding the public purse. The following year will also see slower growth than the OBR predicted five months ago. In 2023, the UK is expected to grow 1.8%, down from 2.1%. However, from 2024 growth is expected to accelerate faster than expected, rising 2.1% that year and 1.8% in 2025, up from 1.6% and 1.3% respectively. GDP or Gross Domestic Product is one of the most important ways of showing how well, or badly, an economy is doing. It's a measure - or an attempt to measure - all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in an economy. Stevie and Pauline Stevie Hall in Halifax says rising food, fuel and energy bills have nudged her into debt already. She told the BBC she had been batch cooking to save money and is only driving when there is a real need. ""We're just trying to get by, I'm trying to stay upbeat about it,"" she said. GDP allows businesses to judge when to expand and hire more people, and for government to work out how much to tax and spend. The OBR said the cut in living standards would have been worse without government support for households, including today's temporary 5p cut in fuel duty; the increase in the National Insurance contributions threshold; and a Â£9bn energy bill rebate scheme announced in February. ""Taking account of both energy and non-energy pressures on household incomes, the policy measures announced since October offset a third of the overall fall in living standards that would otherwise have occurred in the coming 12 months,"" it said in its report. But Institute for Fiscal Studies director Paul Johnson said: ""Perhaps what really stands out today is what was missing. ""In the face of what the OBR calls the biggest hit to household finances since comparable records began in 1956-57, [Mr Sunak] has done nothing more for those dependent on benefits, the very poorest, besides a small amount of extra cash for local authorities to dispense at their discretion. ""Their benefits will rise by just 3.1% for the coming financial year. Their cost of living could well rise by 10%.""

Since December last year, prices have been rising at their fastest rate since the 1990s. Inflation is expected to speed up in April when the energy price cap is increased. This will push up the average household fuel bill up by Â£693 a year in England, Scotland and Wales, while a planned rise in National Insurance will also put pressure on household budgets. ""Rising inflation remains a significant concern for the economy, squeezing household incomes and increasing cost pressures on retailers,"" said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the pick up in inflation ""adds to the pressure on the chancellor to offset more of the cost of living crisis"". In his Spring Statement, Mr Sunak said that the war in Ukraine had a ""significant impact"" on the cost of living in the UK. In the statement he cut fuel duty by 5p per litre, raised the threshold for National Insurance to Â£12,570, and announced a cut to the basic rate of income tax to 19% from 20% in 2024. But Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Mr Sunak's choices ""were making the cost of living crisis worse, not better"". She said he should have put a windfall tax on oil and gas companies and scrapped the national insurance hike. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said gas prices were almost a third higher in February than a year earlier, and electricity prices were up by nearly a fifth. Average diesel prices hit their highest on record during the month, while food prices rose nearly 1% - the largest monthly increase since 2012. ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said prices of other goods such as toys, clothing and furniture also climbed. ""The price of goods leaving UK factories has also been rising substantially and is now at its highest rate for 14 years,"" he added. What these figures lay bare is that the cost of living crunch is unavoidable. Consumers have already been facing the financial reality of more expensive food, fuel and energy - all of which are necessities for pretty much every household. Now the ONS has confirmed that price rises are more widespread. Buying your child a toy for their birthday is more expensive than it was a year ago. Getting a new sofa takes a bigger chunk of your disposable income. The worry is that there is more of this to come, not least that analysts are predicting that a typical household energy bill will rise by Â£500 a year in October, on top of the annual Â£693 increase which takes effect at the start of April. As pandemic restrictions have eased around the world, firms have faced higher energy, shipping and wage costs, which they have passed on to consumers. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is now driving the price of oil and other commodities even higher. Average petrol and diesel prices hit new record highs on Tuesday, according to the RAC, with petrol hitting 167.30p per litre and diesel hitting 179.72p. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said cheaper wholesale prices had yet to be passed on to consumers. ""The cost of filling an average 55-litre family car with petrol is now more than Â£92 and nearly Â£99 for diesel, making the Â£100 tank inevitable,"" he said.

"Governments borrow to fund ""day-to-day"" spending, as well as long-term infrastructure projects like the Elizabeth Line The UK government generally spends more than it raises in tax. To fill this gap it borrows money, but that has to be paid back - with interest. The government gets most of its income from taxes. For example, workers payincome tax and national insurance, everyone pays VAT on certain goods, and companies pay tax on profits. It could, in theory, cover all of its spending from taxes, and that sometimes happens. But, if it can't, the government covers the gap by raising taxes, cutting spending or borrowing. Higher taxes mean people have less money to spend, so businesses make less profit, which can be bad for jobs and wages. Lower profits also mean companies pay less tax. So, governments often decide to borrow to boost the economy. They also borrow to pay for big projects, like new railways and roads. How the government raises and spends Â£1 trillion a year The government borrows money by selling financial products called bonds. A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments. UK government bonds - known as ""gilts"" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid. Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies. The government sells short and long-term gilts to let it borrow money over different time periods, with varying interest rates. The amount the government borrows fluctuates from month to month. For instance, it tends to borrow less in January, when many people pay a large chunk of their annual tax bill in one go. So, it is more helpful to look across a whole year, or the year-to-date. In the last full financial year, to March 2024, the government borrowed Â£125.1bn. The most recent monthly figures show thegovernment borrowed Â£11.2bn in November 2024,which was Â£3.4bn lower than in the same month the previous year, and the lowest November figure since 2021. Borrowing since March stands at Â£113.2bn, which is the third highest financial year-to-November borrowing total since monthly records began in 1993. The total amount the government owes is called the national debt. It is currently about Â£2.8 trillion - or Â£2,800,000,000,000. That is roughly the same asthe value of all the goods and services produced in the UK in a year, known as the gross domestic product, or GDP. The current level is more than double that seen from the 1980s through to the financial crisis of 2008. The combination of the financial crash and the Covid pandemic pushed the UK's debt up. But, in relation to the size of the economy, UK debt figures are still low compared with much of the last century. They are also less than the equivalent figures for some other leading economies. The larger the national debt, the more interest the government pays. That cost was not as great when interest rates were low during the 2010s, but became more noticeable after the Bank of England started raising interest rates in 2021. The amount of interest the government pays on national debt also varies from month to month. It was Â£3bn in November 2024, the lowest November figure for five years. However, interest rates for long-term borrowing have risen to theirhighest levels this century., with the government paying 5.25% on 30-year gilts. If the government has to set aside more cash for paying debts, it may mean it has less to spend on public services. Some economists fear the government is borrowing too much, at too great a cost. Others argue extra borrowing helps the economy grow faster - generating more tax in the long run. The increase in long-term interest rates seen in January prompted some economists to warn that the government is ""on course"" to miss its own borrowing targets. Labour decided to stick to a rule followed by the previous government that the total amount of money owed must have fallen as a proportion of the UK economy in five years' time. In October's Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeveschanged the definition of debt that the government would use in the target to enable her to raise more money for investment. It will now track a different, broader measure of debt called public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL). This includes, for example, the money the government gets from people repaying their student loans. Downing Street said there was ""no doubt about the government's commitment to economic stability"", and that ""meeting our fiscal rules is non-negotiable"". The independentOffice for Budget Responsibility (OBR)- which monitors the government's financial performance - will present its latest economic forecast to Parliament in late March. It has previously warned that public debt could soar as the population ages and tax income falls. In an ageing population, the proportion of people of working age drops, meaning the government takes less in tax while paying out more in pensions. Budget 2024: Key points at a glance Rachel Reevesâ tax-raising Budget will affect you for years Debtis the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years. Thedeficitis the gap between the government's income and the amount it spends. When a government spends less than its income, it has what is known as a surplus.

"Everyone across the UK is facing the sharpest rise in their cost of living for decades. Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement is primarily an update on the current state, and future expectations, of the nation's finances. But he also announced some big, new policies that will affect our personal budgets in the coming months and years. Bringing together expected changes in earnings, reforms to taxes, and the recently announced energy measures, a middle earner on Â£27,500 per year can expect to be about Â£360 worse off this year than they were last, according to economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Many of the necessities we buy - notably food, fuel and energy - have been rising in price. On Wednesday, official figures revealed that the cost of a whole host of goods and services, from furniture to toys, have also been increasing sharply. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) saidprices rose by 6.2% in the 12 months to February- the fastest for 30 years. The chancellor's Spring Statement confirmed that consumers should be braced for things getting more expensive at a faster rate later in the year. Official forecasts, from the Office for Budget Responsibility, suggest inflation (which charts the rising cost of living) will average 7.4% this year, peaking at around 9% at the end of the year. The big question for anyone with a job is whether their pay will rise in line with prices. We already knew that the minimum pay rate for those aged 23 and above - the National Living Wage - will go up by 6.6%, as the hourly rate increases from Â£8.91 to Â£9.50. Inflation-matching wage rises in themselves could create a problem for the economy as a whole, by creating an inflationary spiral. It remains highly unlikely that employers will put up wages by that much when facing their own cost pressures, particularly their firm's energy bills. In September, the government announced that employees will pay 1.25p more in the pound from their pay packet in National Insurance contributions from this April. In a significant move, he has now said that the earnings threshold at which people start to pay National Insurance will rise. What will National Insurance changes cost me? At present, most workers start paying National Insurance contributions when their income hits Â£9,568. They pay 12% of earnings between Â£9,568 and Â£50,270, then 2% on any earnings above Â£50,270. Now the chancellor has said, from July, National Insurance will be paid on income over Â£12,570 a year - the same level as income tax starts being paid. In practice, the two measures will mean that anyone earning less than about Â£35,000 a year will pay less National Insurance during the year. That is about 70% of all workers. Those who earn more will see a tax rise, albeit smaller than they would have expected. For an employee earning Â£20,000 a year, it means an annual National Insurance cut of Â£180 in 2022-23, instead of an Â£89 rise expected before the announcement, according to accountancy firm Deloitte For a Â£40,000 earner, it means a rise of Â£70, instead of a previously expected Â£339 rise For a Â£60,000 earner, it means a Â£320 rise, instead of a previously expected Â£589 rise Self-employed people, who pay at a different rate, will see slightly less of a benefit from the chancellor's decision. Over time, this threshold is frozen, which will steadily mean more low-earners will have to pay. Early last year Mr Sunak said the thresholds at which income tax is paid would be frozen at April 2021 levels for five years (although Scotland has different levels). That means pay rises will push more people into higher tax bands. At the end of his speech, he pledged to reduce the basic rate of income tax by 1p in the pound before the end of the Parliament in 2024. Millions of households are facing a Â£693 (54%) rise in the cost of a typical annual gas and electricity bill, to about Â£2,000, when the regulator's new, higher price cap takes effect on 1 April. The latest analysis from Cornwall Insight suggests there will be a further Â£541 a year (27%) rise in October, before falling back. The OBR has predicted a Â£850 rise in October. Mr Sunak said he had already taken ""decisive action"", in helping people with their bills. This includes a Â£150 council tax rebate for 80% of households, followed by a Â£200 discount on bills in October which will need to be repaid, and an expansion to a support scheme for vulnerable people. In a longer-term move, he said that VAT would be cut from 5% to 0% on energy efficiency products such as solar panels, insulation and heat pumps. Prices to fill up the car with fuel were rising before the war in Ukraine - and the fallout from Russia's invasion has made things worse. The average price of petrol has risen by more than 40p per litre since last year's Spring Statement. The chancellor announceda 5p a litre reduction in fuel dutyfor the next year, which takes some of the sting out of rising prices, The RAC motoring organisation said that move would knock Â£3.30 off the cost of filling a typical 55 litre family car. Benefits and the state pension are rising by 3.1% in April, well below the rising cost of living. This prompted many charities to call on the chancellor to go further. Mr Sunak did not agree, saying nothing new about benefit and pension levels. However, if inflation does reach the levels predicted by the OBR. then benefits and the state pension could see a significant rise in April 2023 - as the increases are usually linked to the inflation rate in the preceding autumn. Local councils will be given another Â£500m in the Household Support Fund, which supports vulnerable people with payments and grants such as vouchers to help pay their bills.

"The chancellor is preparing for Wednesday's Spring Statement Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have proudly described themselves as ""tax-cutting Conservatives"". They claim, like most members of their party and its supporters, that as far as possible individuals and not the government should decide how to spend their own money. As the chancellor gives an update on the economy in the Spring Statement, while households face acute financial pressure, there is an expectation on him to match his words with actions. But the government's record so far suggests that cutting taxes is not always Mr Sunak or the prime minister's first instinct. I will help with costs where I can, says Sunak Why is the cost of living going up? What Tory MPs want from Sunak Figures compiled by theInstitute for Fiscal Studies,externalshow how far taxes have risen under Boris Johnson as prime minister and during the Conservatives' time in power since 2010. As a proportion of the economy, taxes have gone up as much as they did during Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair's time in power and more than the previous three Conservative leaders. Tax rises under the Conservatives since 2010 have outstripped the previous Labour government's and contrast starkly to an overall reduction during Margaret Thatcher's tenure. There are many caveats to these broad headline figures, not least the pandemic which prompted huge state intervention - and the fact that Boris Johnson's government may yet cut taxes on several fronts. But as the IFS notes, the trajectory for now is upwards: ""If the chancellor's plans remain unchanged, next month will mark the beginning of a steep ascent in the path of UK taxation."" Both the chancellor and prime minister have cited the pandemic as justification for an increase in taxes. Rishi Sunak has said that while he ""firmly believes in cutting taxes"", he had to take ""difficult decisions"" to get the economy back on track post Covid. But some argue that even before the pandemic there was clear evidence of political decisions being behind the trend toward higher taxation. ""The rising tax burden is not purely, or even primarily, a response to Covid. Mr Johnson had announced an end to austerity in 2019,"" Helen Miller, deputy director of the IFS told the BBC. ""There were already various pressures to spend more, including to provide more healthcare for an ageing population, to meet the net zero pledge and to achieve the levelling-up agenda. ""Mr Johnson has now chosen to permanently increase taxes in order to fund a permanently larger state."" The rise in National Insurance contributions due to take effect in April has become a test case for the tolerance of Conservative MPs to higher taxes. While most agreed on the need to fund the NHS and social care, many have questioned the timing of the rise earmarked to pay for it and argued for the policy to be scrapped or delayed. Kwarteng: No U-turn on National Insurance tax rise Opposition MPs urge rethink on April NI tax rise The chancellor and prime minister committed to going ahead with the rise, but it's possible that the threshold could be changed to protect those on lower incomes from paying it for now. Among other things Tory backbenchers would like to see are a cut in fuel duty, a reduction in the rate of VAT or environmental taxes on energy bills being scrapped. Rishi Sunak has pledged to ""stand by"" households feeling the squeeze, but the Spring Statement is not usually the time for big tax and spending decisions. In fact, any major tax cuts are far more likely to come closer to a general election. Why are prices rising in the UK? Blackford calls on chancellor to increase benefits.

"The final preparation is done. The photographs of the chancellor getting ready have been released. In one, life imitating political art at least, Rishi Sunak appears to be gazing at an interview and picture of himself - one of the previews of his big day. Expectation has been more muted than normal - given the horror of events in Ukraine - but the Spring Statement is still a significant event that matters for all of us. The decisions he announces at the dispatch box will affect the prices we pay, the pound in our pocket. Before the conflict, there was already a squeeze on everyone's wallet coming. Since the outbreak, day by day, the uncertainty around the economy, and the impact of what's unfolding, has only become more acute. Sunak to give Spring Statement amid price pressures What to expect from Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement How could the chancellor's plans affect you? As the chancellor practised a final run through of the speech on Tuesday evening, with aides and pizza, his intention was not to reveal a massive financial package to meet this moment. If the size of his dinner matches the scale of the spending, the opposition will be disappointed - he only had one slice. The big decisions were, in the main, taken several weeks ago. Don't roll the drums for big financial drama at lunchtime. Despite lots of chatter about increasing defence spending, for example, I'm told there wasn't actually a formal request from the Ministry of Defence for any extra funding. Although every day brings new calls for more help with rocketing energy bills, the Treasury has been reluctant to move from the extra support they promised already, which was only announced last month. That's in part because the Treasury is instinctively cautious with cash. But also because price rises are so hard to predict and may go on for many, many months. Is Rishi Sunak a tax-cutter? The caution will also come because it is a matter of political choice. For Mr Sunak, Wednesday's speech is also a continuation of a path he set out in the autumn Budget. He talked then, in what was an echo of Margaret Thatcher, about the limitations of government, saying: ""There's a reason we talk about the importance of family, community, and personal responsibility. ""Not because these are an alternative to the market or the stateâ¦ it's because they are more important than the market or the state. ""The moments that make life worth living aren't created by government, aren't announced by government, aren't granted by government."" It was a message to his party that despite presiding over months of mammoth spending during the pandemic, he was reluctant to splurge. It was a message to his next door neighbour too, that No 11 wouldn't release the purse strings to pay for all of No 10's political desires. And it was a message to the country that the government's money man was serious about trying to get the books under control. This video can not be played The headlines of Rishi Sunak's Budget last October There was a contradiction then, in October, because the man who was standing at the despatch box arguing the case for small government was a tax raising, billions spending, big borrowing chancellor. His justification for his temporary political personality transplant was, of course, the pandemic, an emergency that called for it. He wanted to draw a line under that period, and call the end of that economic emergency. But even before the war in Ukraine, many families and firms faced different financial emergencies of their own. And that situation seems only likely to get worse. Of course, the details of the statement in black and white will be what matters on Wednesday lunchtime, more important than any of the warm up in advance. Every chancellor likes to keep something under wraps, and there could of course yet be a big surprise. Yet there's a risk that Rishi Sunak could be accused of creating another contradiction - a chancellor that is at pains to say he wants to help with the cost of living however he can, but won't act boldly enough to help people when it really hurts.

"The Treasury shared pictures of Chancellor Rishi Sunak preparing his statement Chancellor Rishi Sunak will unveil his Spring Statement later, against a backdrop of rising energy, fuel and food costs. He is expected to announce measures to help people with the cost of living, including a cut to fuel tax. He has come under increasing pressure to act, with prices rising by 6.2% in the 12 months to February - thefastest for 30 years. Labour wants him to go further and scrap a planned tax hike next month. National Insurance is set to rise by 1.25p in the pound to pay for healthcare - but the party has said the increase is the wrong way to fund investment. Mr Sunak has ruled out scrapping the increase to NI, but there is speculation he could allow people to earn more before they have to start paying it. However, the full details of Mr Sunak's speech will not be known until he takes to the dispatch box at 12:30 GMT. What to expect from Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement How could the chancellor's plans affect you? How much would cutting fuel duty on petrol save you? Is Rishi Sunak a tax-cutter? The Spring Statement, one of two financial statements the chancellor makes every year, does not normally see big tax and spending decisions announced. However, this year Mr Sunak is facing pressure to act on living standards amid soaring energy costs and rising household bills due to increasing inflation. Millions of households are facing sharp rises in energy bills from next month, when the government'sprice cap to contain recent rises is set to go up. Petrol prices have also soared in recent weeks, while inflation is also pushing up the price of household food items. On Monday, Environment Secretary George Eustice said surging oil and gas prices would lead to ""inevitable"" rises in food prices this year, with the increasing price of wheat also feeding through into higher prices for products such as chicken. The chancellor is expected to say the war in Ukraine will make these price pressures worse - but add that a stronger British economy is vital in responding to the ""challenge to our values"" presented by Russian President Vladimir Putin. His statement is also expected to set out government plans ""to create a new culture of enterprise"", including more training and investment. Expectation has been more muted than normal - given the horror of events in Ukraine - but the Spring Statement is still a significant event that matters for all of us. The decisions he announces at the dispatch box will affect the prices we pay; the pound in our pocket. Before the conflict, there was already a squeeze on everyone's wallet coming. Since the outbreak, day by day, the uncertainty around the economy, and the impact of what's unfolding, has only become more acute. Although every day brings new calls for more help with rocketing energy bills, the Treasury has been reluctant to move from the extra support they promised already, which was only announced last month. That's in part because the Treasury is instinctively cautious with cash. But also because price rises are so hard to predict and may go on for many, many months. Read more from Laura here Labour has criticised Mr Sunak ahead of his speech, branding him ""the high-tax chancellor"" and saying there is no evidence to believe his frequent claims that he wants to cut taxes in the long term. The SNP has also called for the National Insurance rise to be scrapped, dubbing Mr Sunak ""the poverty chancellor"" forremoving the Â£20 uplift for universal creditandbreaking his pledge to keep the pension triple lock. Some Conservative MPs have also called for the NI rise to be cancelled, with the official budget watchdog expected to say the UK's deficit - the difference between the government's income and what it spends - is better than last predicted in the autumn. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said this would give Mr Sunak room to help households with costs, but he would not be able to help people on ""average sorts of incomes"" with the increases. A cut to fuel duty has also been a key demand of Tory MPs in recent weeks, with more 50 Tory writing to Mr Sunak last week to make the demand. Tory MP Robert Halfon, who led the charge, said the country was ""heading to a de facto lockdown, where parents can't afford to take their kids to school [and] where workers can't afford to commute by car and have to stay at home"". But the Green Party said cutting fuel duty would not fix the cost of living crisis, and would be the wrong policy at the time of a climate emergency. Co-leader Adrian Ramsay said: ""We absolutely know people need help right now - but cuts to fuel duty aren't targeted to support the poorest and the greatest numbers of people."" Instead, the party wants a windfall tax on fossil fuel companies to pay for the restoration and doubling of the universal credit uplift, and to extend emergency fuel payments. The Conservative Environment Network of Tory MPs is also making its own request, calling on Mr Sunak to cut VAT for energy-saving products and home installation to 5%. The group said the move would cut the cost of installing cavity insulation by Â£142 and loft insulation by Â£120 for the average household, helping to lower energy bills by up to Â£399 and Â£493 at the current energy price cap - and going even further when the rise kicks in. Tory MP Stephen Crabb said: ""Insulating homes is one of the quickest ways to lower people's energy bills and reduce our reliance on imported energy. ""With millions of draughty British homes and soaring energy bills, we should cut this tax on energy efficiency."" Inflation hits new 30-year high in February Is Rishi Sunak a tax-cutter?

"Nato leaders will approve major increases in its forces in eastern Europe at an emergency summit, Nato's secretary general says Jens Stoltenberg says four new battlegroups will be sent to Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania US President Joe Biden is travelling to Brussels for the Nato summit on Thursday The US says that members of Russia's forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine There are reports of the Ukrainian flag being raised again in the suburb of Makariv, west of the capital Kyiv But Russian bombardment of the southern port city of Mariupol continues unabated, with some 100,000 people said to be trapped there Edited by Jude Sheerin For technical reasons we're moving our live coverage to a new webpage. Please follow ushere for all the latest from the Ukraine war. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to announce on Thursday that the UK will provide Ukraine with about 6,000 extra missiles. At the Nato and G7 leaders' meetings in Brussels, Johnson will also unveil Â£25m ($33m) of funding to help pay Ukrainian soldiers and pilots. The UK government will also provide Â£4.1m for the BBC World Service to help support its Ukrainian and Russian language services in the region. ""The United Kingdom will work with our allies to step up military and economic support to Ukraine, strengthening their defences as they turn the tide in this fight,"" Johnson said. ""One month into this crisis, the international community faces a choice. We can keep the flame of freedom alive in Ukraine, or risk it being snuffed out across Europe and the world."" Britain said the new package will come on top of around 4,000 missiles already provided by the UK to Ukrainian forces. The latest funding is in addition to Â£400m already committed in humanitarian and economic aid, said UK officials.  Boris Johnson vowed ""to keep the flame of freedom alive in Ukraine"" Nada TawfikBBC News, New York Itâs getting harder and harder for Russia to deny its isolation on the international stage. Besides its ally, China, all 13 members abstained from voting on Moscowâs draft. The common message from most members was if Russia cared, and wanted to relieve the suffering of the Ukrainian people, it could end its war now. Instead, Russiaâs draft does not even recognise it is the sole cause of the humanitarian disaster or respond to the realities on the ground. Ukraine has its own humanitarian resolution set for a vote in the General Assembly, where Russia cannot wield its veto. Still, Moscow doesnât show any sign of changing course. It denounced the latest General Assembly vote as another anti-Russian show and blamed the humanitarian devastation on Ukrainian ""nationalists and radicals"". As British diplomat Barbara Woodward told me after the vote: ""I think Russia has consistently misplayed its hand here, and seriously underestimated the consequences of what it's done and the international perception of what it's done. ""They tabled this resolution over a week ago and they kept it on the table and rolled it forward. And, we saw the result today. Only one country supported Russia."" Ukraine's forces are ""increasing pressure"" on Russian troops occupying the region north-east of Kyiv, according to the latest intelligence assessment from the UK Ministry of Defence. Ukraine is continuing to carry out ""successful counter attacks"" on Russians outside the capital, the report says, and the Ukrainians have probably retaken the towns of Makariv and Moschun. ""There is a realistic possibility that Ukrainian forces are now able to encircle Russian units in Bucha and Irpin,"" assesses the MoD. British military officials note that Russian troops along the axis north-east of Kyiv are facing ""considerable supply and morale issues"". ""It is likely that successful counter attacks by Ukraine will disrupt the ability of Russian forces to reorganise and resume their offensive towards Kyiv,"" says the report. Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent Russiaâs unprovoked invasion of its Slavic neighbour has triggered Europeâs worst security crisis since the Second World War. And yet, one month on, Russian forces have failed to exert full control over a single major city, their advance has stalled on several fronts and in some places they have even lost ground to Ukrainian counter-attacks. Bolstered by hi-tech weaponry from Britain and other Nato countries, Ukrainians have proven themselves both brave and resilient. But their defiance has come at a terrible cost. The southern port of Mariupol will go down in history as one of the most bombed and shattered cities of our time. Its destruction has been labelled a war crime. And Ukraine still faces major challenges. Its forces are running low on weapons and ammunition, armed Russian drones are now operating largely with impunity and Moscow is calling up reinforcements. President Putin appears set on subjugating Ukraine even if that means reducing it to a smouldering ruin. Zelensky spoke in English during his nightly address Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been delivering nightly video addresses since the start of the war, has called on people around the world to publicly protest on Thursday - the one month anniversary of Russia's invasion. ""The war of Russia is not only the war against Ukraine. Its meaning is much wider,"" Zelensky says, for the first time delivering his address in English. ""Russia started the war against freedom,"" he continues, adding: ""This is only the beginning for Russia."" ""Russia is trying to defeat the freedom of all people in Europe. Of all the people in the world."" ""It tried to show that only crude and cruel force matters,"" he continues. He adds: ""The world must stop Russia. The world must stop the war."" ""One month already. That long. It breaks my heart, the hearts of all Ukrainians and every free person on the planet."" He goes on to call for street demonstrations and for protesters to march while wearing Ukrainian symbols. ""Come to your squares, your streets. Make yourself visible and heard,"" he says. ""Say that people matter, freedom matters, people matter, peace matters. Ukraine matters."" A Russian-drafted resolution has failed to pass the UN Security Council. The resolution called for aid access in Ukraine, but made no mention of Moscow's role in the war. Russia and China were the only members to vote yes, while the remaining 13 members abstained. A rival humanitarian resolution drafted by Ukraine is due to be voted on in the General Assembly in the coming days. Biden was greeted at the Brussels airport by Belgium's prime minister If you're just joining us, here's a quick recap of some of the latest developments on day 28 of Russia's invasion of Ukraine: A Ukrainian soldier holds a US-based Javelin missile launcher outside Kharkiv The first shipments of weapons for Ukraine that were pledged by American lawmakers in a recently passed aid package will be sent to Ukraine in the next day or two, a senior US defence official told Reuters. The weapons will reach Ukraine quickly after departure, the unnamed official said, also refusing to specify which weapons would be delivered. The official added that weapons already in use by Ukrainian troops would be prioritised for delivery. ""We are already aggregating stocks in the United States and we're getting ready to ship them over there,"" the official said.

Bethany BellBBC News, Vienna The head of the UNâs nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has again stressed what he called âthe urgent needâ to send experts and equipment to Ukraine to help ensure the safety and security of its nuclear facilities and prevent the risk of a severe accident. Grossi said he remained gravely concerned about the situation in Ukraine. He said he hoped to work out an agreement to provide technical assistance for the safe and secure operation of Ukrainian nuclear sites, but that a positive solution had not yet been reached. ""We cannot afford to lose any more time,"" he said. ""We need to act now."" Ukraineâs atomic facilities include 15 reactors as well as Chernobyl, the site of the worldâs worst nuclear accident in 1986. Ukrainian officials have said that more than 4,500 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities via humanitarian corridors on Wednesday. Nearly 3,000 of them travelled from the besieged city of Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine's deputy prime minister said,according to the Kyiv Independent newspaper,external. An evacuee from Berdyansk checks his phone Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Oleg Syromolotov has denounced US claims that Russia is planning cyber attacks in retaliation for western businesses pulling out of Russia. ""These accusations against us are absurd,"" he said in a statement. On Monday, President Biden said that it was the patriotic duty of American companies to shore up their cyber defences against possible Russian attacks. Mr Syromolotov called the warning a ""new outburst of Russophobia against the backdrop of the situation in Ukraine"". Read more: Biden: Russia 'exploring' US cyber-attacks Russia has blocked access to Google News after accusing the news aggregation site of spreading false information about the war. The decision came at the request of Russia's Prosecutor-General's Office, Interfax news agency reported. The office determined that the website ""provided access to numerous publications and materials containing unreliable socially significant information about the course of a special military operation on the territory of Ukraine,"" according to the report. Numerous English language-websites - including Facebook and Instagram - have been blocked in Russia since the invasion of Ukraine. A new law there makes it illegal to report on events that could discredit Russian forces. Alphabet - the parent company of Google - had said earlier that they would block advert payments to websites and YouTube videos that spread false and harmful information about the war. In an email to publishers seen by Reuters, Google said it would not run adverts alongside ""claims that imply victims are responsible for their own tragedy or similar instances of victim blaming, such as claims that Ukraine is committing genocide or deliberately attacking its own citizens"". French car manufacturer Renault has announced that it is suspending work at its Moscow factory once more. Earlier today, Ukraine's president called on Renault and other French companies to quit Russia as he addressed the French parliament via videolink. ""They must stop financing the murders of women and children,"" he told French MPs. Renault had restarted operations in Moscow this week, after pausing work following the invasion of Ukraine. Ina statement released on Wednesday evening it,externalstressed that it was already complying with international sanctions on Russia. Chelsea football club will be allowed to sell tickets to away games, cup matches and games involving the women's team after the UK government made alterations to the club's special licence. The club have been unable to sell tickets since owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the government as part of its response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Under the changed licence, the club will not receive any revenue from ticket sales. Proceeds will go directly to the Premier League and then be distributed to the relevant party. Chelsea fans can purchase tickets for future Premier League away games, with any revenue going to the host team. The move means Chelsea will be able to sell tickets for their home Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid on 6 April and the FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace at Wembley Stadium on the weekend of 16 April.

Valeriia, whose family moved in, said it was ""such a relief"" to arrive in the UK after fleeing the war-torn north-eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. ""Maybe I can feel like I've got a home again,"" said the 37-year-old. ""I did so much, my family, for us to live there, to earn money, nice place to live, work for kids.

Speaking on board Air Force One as the president travels to Brussels, Biden's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said that the US would be announcing more sanctions on political figures and oligarchs on Thursday. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is entering its fourth week with no end in sight, and, sanctions aside, the path ahead for the US-Europe alliance is far from clear. Here's a look from our senior North America reporter Anthony Zurcher at the most pressing concerns facing Mr Biden as he meets European leaders and allies in the days ahead: A cancer surgeon in Lviv has told the BBC that his hospital has seen a large influx of patients needing urgent treatment arriving from eastern Ukraine. Roman Shyyan says his hospital lacks enough chemotherapy drugs to treat all the patients - though more are being shipped now from Kyiv and other parts of the country. Help from Poland is proving hard to get because of logistical problems on the Poland/Ukraine border, he says. Some technicians working all hours to try and provide the radiotherapy that the extra patients need were unable to leave the hospital for days in a row - having worked late to offer treatments they were then trapped by the curfew rules, Shyyan said. The surgeon's team are limiting the number of post-operative patients they have in the hospital, he said, as they need to be able to move everyone safely into the basement when the air-raid sirens go off. Russian state media says the foreign ministry has given the US embassy a list of American diplomats it is expelling. The move comes after 12 Russian diplomats were expelled from its mission to the United Nations in New York earlier this month. The Russian foreign ministry said that the Americans were ""firmly told that any hostile actions of the United States against Russia will receive a decisive and adequate response"", Interfax reported.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has been delivering his Spring Statement as the costs of fuel, energy and food soar Sunak says 70% of workers will get an effective tax cut as he raises the threshold for paying National Insurance (NI) by Â£3,000 He also announces a 5p cut to fuel duty to come into force at 18:00 tonight And he announces that the basic rate of income tax will go from 20% to 19% by the end of Parliament in 2024 The Office for Budget Responsibility says inflation and higher taxes from April mean households face the biggest fall in living standards since records began Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves says Sunak should have scrapped the planned rise to NI and put a windfall tax on oil and gas companies The chancellor's challenge has been laid bare as prices rose by 6.2% in the 12 months to February - the fastest for 30 years Edited by Alex Therrien That's the end of our live coverage of the Spring Statement, though you can find further reaction and analysis on the BBC website. The live page writers today were Jennifer Scott, Paul Seddon, Jennifer Meierhans, Ben King and Marie Jackson. The page was edited by Alex Therrien and Georgina Pattinson. Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled his Spring Statement as the costs of fuel, energy and food soar We'll soon be bringing our live coverage of the Spring Statement to a close. But before we do, here's a recap of what happened today. Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled his Spring Statement in Parliament amid a backdrop of soaring fuel, energy and food prices.  Spring Statement: The key points at a glance The measures in the Spring Statement will not stop eateries from having to pass on higher costs to customers, who are already leaving bad reviews over meal prices, a restaurant boss says. Suleman Raza, boss of the Spice Village restaurant group, tells BBC News that it was ""very likely"" that customers would see further price rises when they go out for dinner. ""The customers are already not happy. Some of the prices have already increased because we were not able to absorb this inflation and we are getting a lot of bad reviews on Google and other social media platforms where people are not happy about this price increase. ""We attract everyday, normal customers and they can't afford these prices so this mini budget is definitely not for ordinary people."" He also says the fuel duty reduction of 5p a litre is ""not going to make a massive difference"" to food suppliers. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The most high-profile energy supplier to collapse during the last year is Bulb, which has 1.6 million customers. It was put into special administration in November after facing rising wholesale costs it was unable to pass on to customers. In effect it was rescued and quasi-nationalised by the government. Office for Budget Responsibility documents published today reveal that decision has cost the government Â£1.2bn so far, with expectations of a further Â£1bn bill in the next financial year. Even then, the volatility of global energy markets means the OBR has said: ""There remains uncertainty around the final cost."" Rishi Sunak said the UK was facing the same challenges as many countries around the world Sunak is also asked how he felt when he saw analysis from the Office for Budget Responsibility saying UK households are set to see the biggest drop in their spending power in 2022-23 since records began in 1956, The chancellor doesn't answer directly. Instead he says the UK is facing the same challenges as many countries around the world, with rising prices and high inflation. He repeats that he cannot protect everyone from the full impact, but says: ""Where we can make a difference of course we will and that is why the policies announced today are a significant intervention. ""We are on people's side at this difficult time."" The chancellor filled up a customer's car after his Spring Statement After his appearance in Parliament, Rishi Sunak headed off to south London to talk to the public - and reporters - at a Sainsbury's petrol station. He was pictured filling up the tank of one of the customers, and appeared to even pay for the fuel, as well as a can of drink and a chocolate bar for good measure. But back to the matter of today's announcements, the chancellor said there were ""uncertain times ahead"". He adds: ""I can't protect everyone from all the global challenges we face, [but] the policies announced today will put billions of pounds back into the pockets of hard-working families."" Asked why there wasn't more help for people on welfare, Sunak says the government has already helped by changing the taper rate for universal credit - brought in after the Â£20 uplift was removed - and today the Treasury is providing more money to councils to support them. ""But the best way to help people in welfare over time is to support them to get into work and that is what we are doing,"" he adds.  Green Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay attacks the chancellor for failing to mention climate The Green Party has responded to the chancellor's Spring Statement, saying he has focused on ""the interests of fossil fuel companies and his partyâs
backbenchers, while ignoring the plight of millions on lower incomes"". The party's co-leader Adrian
Ramsay says it is ""negligence
in the extreme to have offered so little to help those struggling through this
cost of living crisis"". And he attacks Rishi Sunak for failing to mention climate once. The party did welcome the VAT cut on energy
efficiency measures, such as solar panels and heat pumps. But Ramsay says the promise of a future tax cut ""shows the chancellor is focused on
winning the next general election, and not helping those on benefits and lower
incomes who are in desperate need right nowâ. Reality Check In his Spring Statement, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said it was âthanks to Brexitâ that he could get rid of VAT on solar panels and heat pumps for the next five years. He said homeowners would no longer need to pay 5% VAT on them. After Brexit, the UK does have more freedom to set its VAT rates, but the EU is also planning to exempt these products from VAT. On 2 March 2022, the EU Parliament approved plans to allow member states to exempt a number of products from VAT, including solar panels and green heating systems, as part of its new environmental policy. The EU changes have not yet come into effect, while Sunakâs will start next month. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The rise in National Insurance contributions was directly
linked to increasing funding for the NHS and paying for Englandâs cap on social care costs. So naturally one question being asked is how the decision
to increase the threshold at which National Insurance is paid affects that? In
the short-term, it doesnât. The health budget in England is
set until 2025 and nothing in todayâs statement suggests the government will
revisit that. The same is true for the care cap â although the overall
budget for the care system has not been set. In the longer term, some are warning this will lead to less
money than expected being available for public services more generally. And the rising cost of living has a wider societal
impact on health - by pushing more people into poverty, which is one of the key
drivers of poor health. This, in turn, will increase demands on health and care, NHS
leaders are warning. The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, has welcomed a further Â£500m for councils, announced by the chancellor in his Spring Statement, to provide targeted welfare support to low-income households. Councillor Shaun Davies, from LGA, said councils would need maximum flexibility and quick details on
  allocations to make sure funding reaches those in need and
  can help to prevent families from reaching crisis point in the first
  place. He said the increase in funding through the Household Support Fund - essentially council grants aimed at helping the most vulnerable pay for food, clothing and bills - was a positive step but could not address underlying cost of living pressures on its own, nor help people make the most of their money and strengthen financial resistance. ""With many households likely to be economically
  vulnerable for some time to come, councils also want to work with government
  on an effective long-term solution to preventing poverty and disadvantage that
  moves away from providing crisis support towards improving life chances,"" he added. Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent By 2027 the highest will be at the highest level since the late 1940s - when Sir Stafford Cripps was chancellor Despite todayâs tax concessions, the fine print of Rishi Sunakâs plans suggest heâs a way off being the lower-tax chancellor he ultimately wants to be. By 2027, 36.3% of the nation's income is set to be siphoned off to the tax man, the biggest tax burden since the late 1940s. The concessions heâs unveiled today only offset a sixth of the tax rises introduced since 2020. Some of the increased tax burden is understandable - hundreds of billions of public money was spent on pandemic support packages which successfully protected the vast majority of livelihoods. But bringing it down will be harder given the pressures on the public purse: By 2027, the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's economic watchdog, reckons public spending will have âsettledâ at 41.1% of national income, which is 2.1% higher than pre-pandemic 2019-20 levels, and the highest sustained level since the late 1970s.  This video can not be played Earlier today shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves accused the chancellor of not understanding the scale of the challenge. ""His choices are making the cost of living crisis worse - not better,"" she told MPs, speaking after Rishi Sunak had delivered his Spring Statement. Watch the video above. Greenpeace UK praises the announcement by the chancellor that the government will cut VAT on energy-saving items, like insulation, heat pumps and solar panels. Policy Director Dr Doug Parr says it is a ""welcome start to  ending that huge
waste of energy, helping keep bills down and cut our gas use"". But he says it can only be the start. ""We
need to see around Â£10bn of support, part raised by a windfall tax on oil and
gas companies, for delivering the help families need to install the clean
technologies that will get us off gas,"" he adds. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent First-time buyers may wonder how they can afford to save for a deposit when their spending power is falling. Predictions from the Office for Budget Responsibility show that the average proportion of income which is saved is going to fall. Last year, owing in part to the pandemic, individuals typically saved more than 10% of their income. Next year it will be 3.1%. However, the silver lining for young buyers is that the runaway house price rises of recent years will slow, according to the OBR. The forecaster says the average UK house price will go up by 7.4% this year, then 1.3% next year, before accelerating again to 1.5%, 2.5% and 3.1% in subsequent years. Unitegeneral secretary Sharon Graham has criticised the chancellor for ""tinkering around the edges"" of the cost-of-living crisis, saying he had done nothing to tackle the corporate elite. ""Workers will still be facing sleepless nights worrying about how to make ends meet, overwhelmed by rocketing prices,"" she said. ""Once again, ordinary working people bear the broadest burden while the super-rich get off scot-free."" Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of theNational Education Union, called on the government to reverse the real terms cuts to teacher pay if they want to protect living standards and building a strong economy. AndTUCgeneral secretary Frances O'Grady said families did not get the urgent help with soaring bills they needed, and said the National Insurance threshold rise would mostly benefit the better-off. ""The small print shows that pay packets are now expected to fall in value by Â£11 a week this year,"" she added. Manuel Cortes,Transport Salaried Staffs' Associationgeneral secretary, said the statement was a missed opportunity. ""This government is fuelling - quite literally - a car-led recovery instead of promoting climate-friendly solutions such as public transport."" More from financial journalist Martin Lewis who says the measures announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak are ""not going to lift that many people out of the mire"". He describes the National Insurance threshold rise as a squirrel rather than the rabbit out of the hat he was hoping for. He tells Radio 5 Live: ""The cost of living crisis is still going to be a substantial net loss in people's real income over the next year and what has happened today will not cover that for people on lower or higher incomes but it will mitigate some of the impact. ""There will still be many people who will be struggling and having to choose between freezing and starving but there will be fewer. ""And there will be clearly be people who are going to have to curtail their lifestyles due to the cost of living... and some of them won't have to curtail it quite as much."" Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The National Insurance threshold change means people earning up to about Â£34,000 a year will be better off. The chancellor has moved the point at which people start paying National Insurance from just over Â£9,500 last year to just over Â£12,500 from July. But once you start paying National Insurance, the rate will be higher than it was last year (13.25% instead of 12%). How does that net out?
Putting both changes together, youâll be paying less National Insurance this year if you earn less than Â£34,000. Nearly 70% of employees earn less than that, so most people will be see a smaller employeeâs National Insurance bill in their payslip this year. Someone earning Â£20,000 will pay about Â£180 less National Insurance this year than last year, while  someone earning Â£50,000 will be paying about Â£200 more. Mel Stride chairs the Treasury Select Committee of MPS The chair of the MPs' Treasury Committee praises some of the ""helpful measures"" brought forward by Rishi Sunak to ""alleviate cost of living pressures faced by low-income households"".

But the figure that courses through all of this is that very high inflation. It affects everything - how much borrowing there is, the debt interest payments too - and the prediction of it reaching 9% by the end of the year is pretty extraordinary. Rishi Sunak has kept the National Insurance rise to pay for the NHS and social care - starting next month. But he announced today that in July, after three months, half of that gets given back mainly to lower earners in the form of a higher National Insurance threshold. Then the rest of it goes back via a tax cut, but only if the conditions are met in his tax plan in a couple of years time. Overall, it means he hasn't had to reverse the National Insurance rise he had already announced and he continues to go big on being a ""tax cutting chancellor"". But if you look at the OBR's documentas, he has only cut back about one sixth of all the taxes that have been raised since he came into No 11.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Protesters block superyacht linked to Abramovich at Bodrum A superyacht linked to Roman Abramovich has had to leave a port in Turkey, as Western powers ramp up pressure on Russian oligarchs. The MY Solaris sailed to Bodrum last month after the billionaire was included in both UK and EU sanctions. It was greeted by protests from a boatload of young Ukrainians, who tried to stop the yacht docking there. But after two weeks in Bodrum, Global Port Holdings, which operates the cruise terminal,said it had decided not to accept payment for berthing the ship.,external The company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, said it ""has always strictly adhered to and will continue to adhere to... international sanctions rules and the requirements of the applicable laws, as well as to the legal conditions of its concession agreement in Bodrum."" In its statement, it said that it was not involved in deciding which ships could dock in the port, which is the responsibility of the Turkish authorities. MY Solaris has since moved off from Bodrum to anchor in nearby YalÄ±kavak, while a second yacht linked to Mr Abramovich, the Eclipse, remains in Marmaris, a popular tourist destination along the Turkish Riviera. Both vessels cost more than $500m and are among a number tracked by Lloyd's List Intelligence. The shipping data experts have been monitoring on-board tracking devices and have shared this information exclusively with the BBC, enabling the journeys of these and other vessels linked to sanctioned Russians to be plotted. The UK, US and EU have said they will target superyachts, andsome havealreadybeen seizedin European ports. More remain at large - some are on the move, others are moored in places that are currently safe from sanctions, including the Maldives. Many superyachts are linked to Russian billionaires but ownership is shrouded in secrecy - they are often registered through a series of offshore companies. The team at Lloyd's List sifted through registration papers, credit reports and other records to determine who they believe is linked to each superyacht. MY Solaris, which is estimated to have cost $600m, boasts a pool and a helipad. It has a crew of up to 60 and can accommodate more than 30 guests. It left Barcelona on 8 March where it was undergoing repairs, and docked off Tivat in Montenegro days after Mr Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK. Tivat is a hub for superyachts and boasts a large marina. MY Solaris left Tivat and was sailing off the Greek west coast when the EU sanctioned Mr Abramovich on 15 March. After this date, the yacht's tracking data shows it was steering clear of Greek territorial waters (Greece is in the EU) and sailing in international waters, where it cannot be seized. On 21 March, it arrived in the Turkish resort of Bodrum, which has a modern marina and can accommodate superyachts up to 140m in length. But its path was blocked by a small dinghy carrying eight children from a Ukrainian junior sailing team and their coach, waving Ukrainian flags. Coach Paulo Donstov told the BBC they were there to compete in a sailing championship and were tipped off about the arrival of MY Solaris. Protesters from a junior sailing team try to prevent MY Solaris docking ""We want the world to know that Ukraine wants freedom and peace,"" said Mr Donstov, whose family are still in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa. Turkey has said it has ""no intention"" of joining EU sanctions on Russians and, unlike most European countries, it is still allowing direct flights from Russia. The captain of one vessel linked to a wealthy Russian, who did not want to be identified, told the BBC that Turkish officials had made it clear that Russian ships are ""very welcome and will be treated as any other vessel"". TheEclipseis one of the world's largest superyachts. It has nine decks, three helipads and a three-person submarine. It is also rumoured to have a missile-defence system and a laser-directed light system to deter photographers from taking pictures of the vessel. It was docked off the Caribbean island of Sint Maarten - a Dutch overseas territory linked to the EU - but left at the beginning of March. It then sailed east through the Mediterranean, north of Algeria. On 22 March, the data showed it arriving at Marmaris in Turkey. The resort, a former fishing village, is another popular destination for superyachts. There is a marina, an Ottoman castle and more than 50 diving sites nearby. Sea Rhapsodyhas also been on the move. It has been linked to Andrei Kostin, president of the Russian state-owned VTB bank, who has been sanctioned by the US, EU and UK authorities. The vessel, which boasts a cinema and a gym, left Fethiye in Turkey on 18 February, heading for Oman before arriving in the Seychelles on 3 March, where it has remained since. The superyachtCliois linked to Oleg Deripaska, an industrialist with close ties to President Putin, who has been sanctioned by the UK and the US. It has its own support vessel called Sputnik - complete with its own helipad. Clio's on-board tracker located it near the Maldives in mid-March. It left these waters on 19 March, headed towards Oman and then the north-west coast of India, before turning back towards the Maldives.It has since headed north again, this time through the Gulf of Aden. Several other vessels linked to sanctioned Russians were in or near the Maldives, including theOcean Victorylinked to Viktor Rashnikov andNordlinked to Alexei Mordashov. TheMadame Gu- linked to Andrey Skoch who has been sanctioned by the EU, UK and US - is in Dubai. AndLe Grand Bleu,a yacht linked to Eugene Shvidler, who is under UK sanctions, was sailing in the Caribbean and is now in Puerto Rico (a US territory). The Maldives, the Seychelles and Dubai don't have an agreement with the US, UK or EU that would allow the authorities to seize property, protecting yachts there from any sanctions. But they may not be able to stay in safe waters indefinitely. ""These things are living, guzzling animals on the water that need maintenanceâ¦ so you need ports that can cater to that,"" says Capucine de VallÃ©e, CEO of Boatbookings. ""All the leading shipyards are in northern Europe."" She believes manufacturers may stop offering parts and maintenance due to sanctions. A superyacht linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the past sailed back to Russian waters before the invasion of Ukraine began. Gracefulmoved from Germany to the coast of Kaliningrad, Russia, in mid-February. But Lloyd's List says the movement data is limited as the vessel turned off its tracking device for several weeks. Under the UN Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention, ships must have their onboard-trackers switched on at all times unless there is a danger to the safety of the crew and vessel. Several other yachts linked to Russians have also occasionally turned off their tracking data in the last month. US officials are examining the ownership of a second yacht, theScheherazadewhich is currently docked off the Italian town of Marina di Carrara. Supporters of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny have linked the 140m vessel, estimated to be worth $700m, to President Putin. At this time of year, many superyachts would usually start heading toward popular European destinations, such as Port Hercule in Monaco or Marina Grande on the Italian island of Capri. But some countries in Europe have now seized yachts linked to sanctioned Russians. The US and Spanish authorities recently conducted a joint operation in Mallorca to seize the yacht Tango.  It's linked to Viktor Vekselberg,who was sanctioned by the US in 2018.,external Sailing Yacht A - linked to Andrei Melnichenko - was seized in Trieste, Italy There have been other vessels seized as well: Sailing Yacht Aseized in Trieste, Italy (linked to Andrei Melnichenko) Lenaseized in San Remo, Italy (linked to Gennadiy Timchenko) Lady Mseized in Imperia, Italy (linked to Alexei Mordashov) Amore Veroseized in La Ciotat, France (linked to Russian oligarch Igor Sechin) Valerieseized near Barcelona, Spain (linked to Sergei Chemenov) Crescentseized in Tarragona, Spain Lady Anastasiaseized in Port Adriano, Spain (linked to Alexander Mikheev) Axiomaseized in Gibraltar (linked to Dmitrievich Pumpyansky) There is still confusion about the status of one of the world's biggest superyachts, theDilbar- linked to sanctioned Russian businessman Alisher Usmanov. It was reported that it had been seized in Hamburg, but the local authorities told us that this was not the case and that it was docked for ongoing repairs. And a further two yachts are reported to have been seized in France, but the details have not yet been confirmed by the authorities. Italian officials on board the Lena yacht - linked to Gennadiy Timchenko Lloyds List looked at more than 40 superyachts that they linked to wealthy Russians. Many of them haven't been sanctioned and there are clusters of them (highlighted in blue) still in the Mediterranean. But they are already getting a frosty welcome in some ports. Crew members have been shunned in Monaco, according to Ms de Vallee, with some contractors refusing to carry out maintenance work because of fears they might have their payments confiscated by the EU. The captain of one superyacht told us: ""Our line of credit is completely cut, which makes operating very difficult.""

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has been delivering his Spring Statement as the costs of fuel, energy and food soar Sunak says 70% of workers will get an effective tax cut as he raises the threshold for paying National Insurance (NI) by Â£3,000 He also announces a 5p cut to fuel duty to come into force at 18:00 tonight And he announces that the basic rate of income tax will go from 20% to 19% by the end of Parliament in 2024 The Office for Budget Responsibility says inflation and higher taxes from April mean households face the biggest fall in living standards since records began Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves says Sunak should have scrapped the planned rise to NI and put a windfall tax on oil and gas companies The chancellor's challenge has been laid bare as prices rose by 6.2% in the 12 months to February - the fastest for 30 years Edited by Alex Therrien That's the end of our live coverage of the Spring Statement, though you can find further reaction and analysis on the BBC website. The live page writers today were Jennifer Scott, Paul Seddon, Jennifer Meierhans, Ben King and Marie Jackson. The page was edited by Alex Therrien and Georgina Pattinson. Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled his Spring Statement as the costs of fuel, energy and food soar We'll soon be bringing our live coverage of the Spring Statement to a close. But before we do, here's a recap of what happened today. Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled his Spring Statement in Parliament amid a backdrop of soaring fuel, energy and food prices.  Spring Statement: The key points at a glance The measures in the Spring Statement will not stop eateries from having to pass on higher costs to customers, who are already leaving bad reviews over meal prices, a restaurant boss says. Suleman Raza, boss of the Spice Village restaurant group, tells BBC News that it was ""very likely"" that customers would see further price rises when they go out for dinner. ""The customers are already not happy. Some of the prices have already increased because we were not able to absorb this inflation and we are getting a lot of bad reviews on Google and other social media platforms where people are not happy about this price increase. ""We attract everyday, normal customers and they can't afford these prices so this mini budget is definitely not for ordinary people."" He also says the fuel duty reduction of 5p a litre is ""not going to make a massive difference"" to food suppliers. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The most high-profile energy supplier to collapse during the last year is Bulb, which has 1.6 million customers. It was put into special administration in November after facing rising wholesale costs it was unable to pass on to customers. In effect it was rescued and quasi-nationalised by the government. Office for Budget Responsibility documents published today reveal that decision has cost the government Â£1.2bn so far, with expectations of a further Â£1bn bill in the next financial year. Even then, the volatility of global energy markets means the OBR has said: ""There remains uncertainty around the final cost."" Rishi Sunak said the UK was facing the same challenges as many countries around the world Sunak is also asked how he felt when he saw analysis from the Office for Budget Responsibility saying UK households are set to see the biggest drop in their spending power in 2022-23 since records began in 1956, The chancellor doesn't answer directly. Instead he says the UK is facing the same challenges as many countries around the world, with rising prices and high inflation. He repeats that he cannot protect everyone from the full impact, but says: ""Where we can make a difference of course we will and that is why the policies announced today are a significant intervention. ""We are on people's side at this difficult time."" The chancellor filled up a customer's car after his Spring Statement After his appearance in Parliament, Rishi Sunak headed off to south London to talk to the public - and reporters - at a Sainsbury's petrol station. He was pictured filling up the tank of one of the customers, and appeared to even pay for the fuel, as well as a can of drink and a chocolate bar for good measure. But back to the matter of today's announcements, the chancellor said there were ""uncertain times ahead"". He adds: ""I can't protect everyone from all the global challenges we face, [but] the policies announced today will put billions of pounds back into the pockets of hard-working families."" Asked why there wasn't more help for people on welfare, Sunak says the government has already helped by changing the taper rate for universal credit - brought in after the Â£20 uplift was removed - and today the Treasury is providing more money to councils to support them. ""But the best way to help people in welfare over time is to support them to get into work and that is what we are doing,"" he adds.  Green Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay attacks the chancellor for failing to mention climate The Green Party has responded to the chancellor's Spring Statement, saying he has focused on ""the interests of fossil fuel companies and his partyâs
backbenchers, while ignoring the plight of millions on lower incomes"". The party's co-leader Adrian
Ramsay says it is ""negligence
in the extreme to have offered so little to help those struggling through this
cost of living crisis"". And he attacks Rishi Sunak for failing to mention climate once. The party did welcome the VAT cut on energy
efficiency measures, such as solar panels and heat pumps. But Ramsay says the promise of a future tax cut ""shows the chancellor is focused on
winning the next general election, and not helping those on benefits and lower
incomes who are in desperate need right nowâ. Reality Check In his Spring Statement, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said it was âthanks to Brexitâ that he could get rid of VAT on solar panels and heat pumps for the next five years. He said homeowners would no longer need to pay 5% VAT on them. After Brexit, the UK does have more freedom to set its VAT rates, but the EU is also planning to exempt these products from VAT. On 2 March 2022, the EU Parliament approved plans to allow member states to exempt a number of products from VAT, including solar panels and green heating systems, as part of its new environmental policy. The EU changes have not yet come into effect, while Sunakâs will start next month. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The rise in National Insurance contributions was directly
linked to increasing funding for the NHS and paying for Englandâs cap on social care costs. So naturally one question being asked is how the decision
to increase the threshold at which National Insurance is paid affects that? In
the short-term, it doesnât. The health budget in England is
set until 2025 and nothing in todayâs statement suggests the government will
revisit that. The same is true for the care cap â although the overall
budget for the care system has not been set. In the longer term, some are warning this will lead to less
money than expected being available for public services more generally. And the rising cost of living has a wider societal
impact on health - by pushing more people into poverty, which is one of the key
drivers of poor health. This, in turn, will increase demands on health and care, NHS
leaders are warning. The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, has welcomed a further Â£500m for councils, announced by the chancellor in his Spring Statement, to provide targeted welfare support to low-income households. Councillor Shaun Davies, from LGA, said councils would need maximum flexibility and quick details on
  allocations to make sure funding reaches those in need and
  can help to prevent families from reaching crisis point in the first
  place. He said the increase in funding through the Household Support Fund - essentially council grants aimed at helping the most vulnerable pay for food, clothing and bills - was a positive step but could not address underlying cost of living pressures on its own, nor help people make the most of their money and strengthen financial resistance. ""With many households likely to be economically
  vulnerable for some time to come, councils also want to work with government
  on an effective long-term solution to preventing poverty and disadvantage that
  moves away from providing crisis support towards improving life chances,"" he added. Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent By 2027 the highest will be at the highest level since the late 1940s - when Sir Stafford Cripps was chancellor Despite todayâs tax concessions, the fine print of Rishi Sunakâs plans suggest heâs a way off being the lower-tax chancellor he ultimately wants to be. By 2027, 36.3% of the nation's income is set to be siphoned off to the tax man, the biggest tax burden since the late 1940s. The concessions heâs unveiled today only offset a sixth of the tax rises introduced since 2020. Some of the increased tax burden is understandable - hundreds of billions of public money was spent on pandemic support packages which successfully protected the vast majority of livelihoods. But bringing it down will be harder given the pressures on the public purse: By 2027, the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's economic watchdog, reckons public spending will have âsettledâ at 41.1% of national income, which is 2.1% higher than pre-pandemic 2019-20 levels, and the highest sustained level since the late 1970s.  This video can not be played Earlier today shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves accused the chancellor of not understanding the scale of the challenge. ""His choices are making the cost of living crisis worse - not better,"" she told MPs, speaking after Rishi Sunak had delivered his Spring Statement. Watch the video above. Greenpeace UK praises the announcement by the chancellor that the government will cut VAT on energy-saving items, like insulation, heat pumps and solar panels. Policy Director Dr Doug Parr says it is a ""welcome start to  ending that huge
waste of energy, helping keep bills down and cut our gas use"". But he says it can only be the start. ""We
need to see around Â£10bn of support, part raised by a windfall tax on oil and
gas companies, for delivering the help families need to install the clean
technologies that will get us off gas,"" he adds. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent First-time buyers may wonder how they can afford to save for a deposit when their spending power is falling. Predictions from the Office for Budget Responsibility show that the average proportion of income which is saved is going to fall. Last year, owing in part to the pandemic, individuals typically saved more than 10% of their income. Next year it will be 3.1%. However, the silver lining for young buyers is that the runaway house price rises of recent years will slow, according to the OBR. The forecaster says the average UK house price will go up by 7.4% this year, then 1.3% next year, before accelerating again to 1.5%, 2.5% and 3.1% in subsequent years. Unitegeneral secretary Sharon Graham has criticised the chancellor for ""tinkering around the edges"" of the cost-of-living crisis, saying he had done nothing to tackle the corporate elite. ""Workers will still be facing sleepless nights worrying about how to make ends meet, overwhelmed by rocketing prices,"" she said. ""Once again, ordinary working people bear the broadest burden while the super-rich get off scot-free."" Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of theNational Education Union, called on the government to reverse the real terms cuts to teacher pay if they want to protect living standards and building a strong economy. AndTUCgeneral secretary Frances O'Grady said families did not get the urgent help with soaring bills they needed, and said the National Insurance threshold rise would mostly benefit the better-off. ""The small print shows that pay packets are now expected to fall in value by Â£11 a week this year,"" she added. Manuel Cortes,Transport Salaried Staffs' Associationgeneral secretary, said the statement was a missed opportunity. ""This government is fuelling - quite literally - a car-led recovery instead of promoting climate-friendly solutions such as public transport."" More from financial journalist Martin Lewis who says the measures announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak are ""not going to lift that many people out of the mire"". He describes the National Insurance threshold rise as a squirrel rather than the rabbit out of the hat he was hoping for. He tells Radio 5 Live: ""The cost of living crisis is still going to be a substantial net loss in people's real income over the next year and what has happened today will not cover that for people on lower or higher incomes but it will mitigate some of the impact. ""There will still be many people who will be struggling and having to choose between freezing and starving but there will be fewer. ""And there will be clearly be people who are going to have to curtail their lifestyles due to the cost of living... and some of them won't have to curtail it quite as much."" Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The National Insurance threshold change means people earning up to about Â£34,000 a year will be better off. The chancellor has moved the point at which people start paying National Insurance from just over Â£9,500 last year to just over Â£12,500 from July. But once you start paying National Insurance, the rate will be higher than it was last year (13.25% instead of 12%). How does that net out?
Putting both changes together, youâll be paying less National Insurance this year if you earn less than Â£34,000. Nearly 70% of employees earn less than that, so most people will be see a smaller employeeâs National Insurance bill in their payslip this year. Someone earning Â£20,000 will pay about Â£180 less National Insurance this year than last year, while  someone earning Â£50,000 will be paying about Â£200 more.

"The cost of living continued to soar last month, according to official figures. Prices rose by 6.2% in the 12 months to February - the fastest for 30 years - as fuel, energy and food costs surged. Prices are rising faster than wages and the Bank of England thinks it could hit double digits this year. Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Prime Minister Boris Johnson have been under pressure to do more to help struggling households. Inflation is the rate at which prices rise. If a bottle of milk costs Â£1 and that rises by 5p, then milk inflation is 5%. Why are prices rising so quickly? How could Rishi Sunak's plans affect you? Since December last year, prices have been rising at their fastest rate since the 1990s. Inflation is expected to speed up in April when the energy price cap is increased. This will push up the average household fuel bill up by Â£693 a year in England, Scotland and Wales, while a planned rise in National Insurance will also put pressure on household budgets. ""Rising inflation remains a significant concern for the economy, squeezing household incomes and increasing cost pressures on retailers,"" said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the pick up in inflation ""adds to the pressure on the chancellor to offset more of the cost of living crisis"". In his Spring Statement, Mr Sunak said that the war in Ukraine had a ""significant impact"" on the cost of living in the UK. In the statement he cut fuel duty by 5p per litre, raised the threshold for National Insurance to Â£12,570, and announced a cut to the basic rate of income tax to 19% from 20% in 2024. But Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Mr Sunak's choices ""were making the cost of living crisis worse, not better"". She said he should have put a windfall tax on oil and gas companies and scrapped the national insurance hike. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said gas prices were almost a third higher in February than a year earlier, and electricity prices were up by nearly a fifth. Average diesel prices hit their highest on record during the month, while food prices rose nearly 1% - the largest monthly increase since 2012. ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said prices of other goods such as toys, clothing and furniture also climbed. ""The price of goods leaving UK factories has also been rising substantially and is now at its highest rate for 14 years,"" he added. What these figures lay bare is that the cost of living crunch is unavoidable. Consumers have already been facing the financial reality of more expensive food, fuel and energy - all of which are necessities for pretty much every household. Now the ONS has confirmed that price rises are more widespread. Buying your child a toy for their birthday is more expensive than it was a year ago. Getting a new sofa takes a bigger chunk of your disposable income. The worry is that there is more of this to come, not least that analysts are predicting that a typical household energy bill will rise by Â£500 a year in October, on top of the annual Â£693 increase which takes effect at the start of April. As pandemic restrictions have eased around the world, firms have faced higher energy, shipping and wage costs, which they have passed on to consumers. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is now driving the price of oil and other commodities even higher. Average petrol and diesel prices hit new record highs on Tuesday, according to the RAC, with petrol hitting 167.30p per litre and diesel hitting 179.72p. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said cheaper wholesale prices had yet to be passed on to consumers. ""The cost of filling an average 55-litre family car with petrol is now more than Â£92 and nearly Â£99 for diesel, making the Â£100 tank inevitable,"" he said.

She told the BBC she had been batch cooking to save money and is only driving when there is a real need. ""We're just trying to get by, I'm trying to stay upbeat about it,"" she said. Andrew Selley is chief executive of Bidfood, one of the largest UK food wholesalers, which supplies more than 45,000 caterers and food firms. He told the BBC's Today programme that food prices were rising fast. ""We're seeing much bigger increases on things like cooking oil, chicken, cheese, butter. Nothing exotic - these are standard food staples and we're seeing much bigger increases in those at the moment."" Mr Selley said that compared with last year the price of diesel was up by 40% and electricity by 250%, ""and those two things together make up over 10% of our total costs"". He added that a cut in fuel duty would help: ""I mean, fuel is obviously a driver across the whole industry, both from getting [food] from the farmer to the manufacturer, from the manufacturers to ourselves and from ourselves to the customers, so any relief on fuel would help to mitigate some of those increases coming through.""

"Anne Frank's diary, written in hiding from the Nazis, is widely read more than 70 years after her death A book that claimed to have solved the question of who betrayed Anne Frank has been recalled by its Dutch publisher after its findings were discredited. The book's investigating teamsuggested a Jewish man called Arnold van den Bergh was responsible for her and her family's arrests during World War Two. But since it was published in January,the work has been widely criticised. Now a new report by a team of World War Two experts and historians has said its research does not stand up to scrutiny. Anne Frank was a Jewish girl who wrote a diary about her two years in hiding before she died in a Nazi concentration camp in 1945. The book - called The Betrayal of Anne Frank: A Cold Case Investigation - said Jewish notary Van den Bergh had probably given up the Franks' hiding location to save his own family. Its investigating team, led by a retired FBI investigator, spent six years to try to crack the cold case. But the book, by Canadian author Rosemary Sullivan, prompted a backlash from Jewish groups and historians. The European Jewish Congress urged publisher HarperCollins to pull its English language edition, saying it had tarnished Anne Frank's memory and the dignity of Holocaust survivors. The new report into the book contradicted its findings, calling its work ""amateurish"". ""There is not any serious evidence for this grave accusation,"" the experts found. In response, Dutch publishing house Ambo Anthos said the book would no longer be available and asked bookshops to return their stocks. The publisher offered its ""sincere apologies"" to those offended by the book's content, while the granddaughter of Van den Bergh has called on HarperCollins to drop the English-language edition. ""With this story, you are exploiting the story of Anne Frank, you are falsifying history and you are contributing to great injustice,"" she said. The BBC has contacted HarperCollins for comment. The book's investigating team has previously stood by their research, saying they never claimed to have uncovered the complete truth.

"This video can not be played Major incident declared at London Aquatics Centre Twenty-nine people were taken to hospital with breathing problems and a major incident was declared following a gas leak at the London Aquatics Centre. About 200 people were evacuated from the venue at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, Stratford, on Wednesday after a large amount of chlorine gas was released. Almost 50 people were treated by paramedics for breathing difficulties. People could be seen being placed in ambulances while others wore blankets. Residents in the area were asked to close windows and doors. About 200 people were evacuated from the London Aquatics Centre The London Aquatics Centre was one of the main venues for the London Olympic Games in 2012, and was used for swimming, diving and synchronised swimming. It opened to the public in 2014. Surrounding roads were also cordoned off once the alarm was raised and members of the public were denied access to the park. The London Fire Brigade said the gas leak had been caused by a chemical reaction, causing a ""high quantity of chlorine gas"" to be released. Homerton Hospital in east London said it had admitted 12 adults and seven children with respiratory problems, while nearby Newham Hospital and The Royal London Hospital also said they were treating patients. There are thousands of homes in and around the former Olympics site, including several high-rise developments. Local resident Usman Hussain lives in the 28th floor of a nearby block with his baby. He told BBC London: ""It's quite scary and we are quite concerned."" The London Fire Brigade said ""positive pressure ventilation fans"" would be used to disperse chlorine gas into the atmosphere. The incident involved chlorine gas Commander Shaun Coltress said: ""We've not taken that decision lightly, we've got our scientific adviser and our hazardous materials adviser on scene."" Local people should keep their doors and windows closed for the ""next few hours"", he added, but stressed people living nearby should not be worried. ""We've got the right people here, we're used to responding to chemical incidents, we've taken the right advice, we've got the right cordons in place."" The centre is operated by Greenwich Leisure Limited (GLL), which said the release of gas occurred when ""the facilities management company that operates the plant room took delivery of pool chemicals"". ""We are working to support all those affected,"" it said. London Ambulance Service said it was attending a major incident in Stratford ""We are awaiting guidance from the facilities management company, London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) and the emergency services on when the centre will be able to reopen."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: ""Please avoid the area which has been cordoned off and evacuated. ""I remain in close contact with our emergency services who are dealing with a gas-related incident at the London Aquatics Centre this morning,"" he added. London Ambulance Service said it had sent a number of resources BBC News correspondent Greg McKenzie It looks and feels like a major incident - emergency service resources are huge and there is a cordon in place. There are lots of fire engines and ambulance personnel I can see, and it looks like they've created a makeshift centre to treat those with medical problems. I am standing about 800m away from the Aquatics Centre, but I have been able to speak with one woman who was there this morning. She was there for a morning swim and there was quite a few people there with children. They were told there was an issue with chlorine and they had to be evacuated quickly. As they were leaving, she could see some people struggling to breathe, but she said the evacuation was efficient and emergency services were quick on scene to help.

"The CJI report says inspectors considered cells at three locations to be potentially unsafe - Magherafelt, Lisburn and Limavady Custody cells in many of Northern Ireland courts ""are not fit for purpose"", according to a report. Criminal Justice Inspection (CJI) found some issues ""were impossible to rectify"" in centuries-old court buildings. That is despite significant investment having been undertaken. It said problems included cramped conditions and a lack of natural light or ventilation. There are cells in 17 courthouses, where individuals are usually held for an hour or more before appearing in the dock. CJI found nine court buildings have cells which failed to meet expectations. They are Ballymena, Downpatrick, Enniskillen, Limavady, Lisburn, Londonderry, Magherafelt, Newtownards and Omagh. The CJI report went on to state that inspectors considered cells at three locations to be potentially unsafe - Magherafelt, Lisburn and Limavady. ""They were built in an era when the standards of accommodation for holding people accused of offences were very different,"" Jacqui Durkan, from the CJI, said. ""However, they are still in use today. ""During the Covid pandemic significantly fewer detainees were required to appear in court in person. ""The potential to sustain these arrangements and reduce detention in unsuitable courthouse cells could be explored."" Prisoners' 'solitary confinement' breaches UN rules Services for at-risk NI prisoners 'over-stretched' An attempt to close some ""unsuitable and underutilised"" courthouses was halted by legal action in 2016, but the CJI said that course of action is still required. The report also found staff treated detainees ""respectfully and with dignity"".

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has been delivering his Spring Statement as the costs of fuel, energy and food soar Sunak says 70% of workers will get an effective tax cut as he raises the threshold for paying National Insurance (NI) by Â£3,000 He also announces a 5p cut to fuel duty to come into force at 18:00 tonight And he announces that the basic rate of income tax will go from 20% to 19% by the end of Parliament in 2024 The Office for Budget Responsibility says inflation and higher taxes from April mean households face the biggest fall in living standards since records began Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves says Sunak should have scrapped the planned rise to NI and put a windfall tax on oil and gas companies The chancellor's challenge has been laid bare as prices rose by 6.2% in the 12 months to February - the fastest for 30 years Edited by Alex Therrien That's the end of our live coverage of the Spring Statement, though you can find further reaction and analysis on the BBC website. The live page writers today were Jennifer Scott, Paul Seddon, Jennifer Meierhans, Ben King and Marie Jackson. The page was edited by Alex Therrien and Georgina Pattinson. Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled his Spring Statement as the costs of fuel, energy and food soar We'll soon be bringing our live coverage of the Spring Statement to a close. But before we do, here's a recap of what happened today. Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled his Spring Statement in Parliament amid a backdrop of soaring fuel, energy and food prices.  Spring Statement: The key points at a glance The measures in the Spring Statement will not stop eateries from having to pass on higher costs to customers, who are already leaving bad reviews over meal prices, a restaurant boss says. Suleman Raza, boss of the Spice Village restaurant group, tells BBC News that it was ""very likely"" that customers would see further price rises when they go out for dinner. ""The customers are already not happy. Some of the prices have already increased because we were not able to absorb this inflation and we are getting a lot of bad reviews on Google and other social media platforms where people are not happy about this price increase. ""We attract everyday, normal customers and they can't afford these prices so this mini budget is definitely not for ordinary people."" He also says the fuel duty reduction of 5p a litre is ""not going to make a massive difference"" to food suppliers. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The most high-profile energy supplier to collapse during the last year is Bulb, which has 1.6 million customers. It was put into special administration in November after facing rising wholesale costs it was unable to pass on to customers. In effect it was rescued and quasi-nationalised by the government. Office for Budget Responsibility documents published today reveal that decision has cost the government Â£1.2bn so far, with expectations of a further Â£1bn bill in the next financial year. Even then, the volatility of global energy markets means the OBR has said: ""There remains uncertainty around the final cost."" Rishi Sunak said the UK was facing the same challenges as many countries around the world Sunak is also asked how he felt when he saw analysis from the Office for Budget Responsibility saying UK households are set to see the biggest drop in their spending power in 2022-23 since records began in 1956, The chancellor doesn't answer directly. Instead he says the UK is facing the same challenges as many countries around the world, with rising prices and high inflation. He repeats that he cannot protect everyone from the full impact, but says: ""Where we can make a difference of course we will and that is why the policies announced today are a significant intervention. ""We are on people's side at this difficult time."" The chancellor filled up a customer's car after his Spring Statement After his appearance in Parliament, Rishi Sunak headed off to south London to talk to the public - and reporters - at a Sainsbury's petrol station. He was pictured filling up the tank of one of the customers, and appeared to even pay for the fuel, as well as a can of drink and a chocolate bar for good measure. But back to the matter of today's announcements, the chancellor said there were ""uncertain times ahead"". He adds: ""I can't protect everyone from all the global challenges we face, [but] the policies announced today will put billions of pounds back into the pockets of hard-working families."" Asked why there wasn't more help for people on welfare, Sunak says the government has already helped by changing the taper rate for universal credit - brought in after the Â£20 uplift was removed - and today the Treasury is providing more money to councils to support them. ""But the best way to help people in welfare over time is to support them to get into work and that is what we are doing,"" he adds.  Green Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay attacks the chancellor for failing to mention climate The Green Party has responded to the chancellor's Spring Statement, saying he has focused on ""the interests of fossil fuel companies and his partyâs
backbenchers, while ignoring the plight of millions on lower incomes"". The party's co-leader Adrian
Ramsay says it is ""negligence
in the extreme to have offered so little to help those struggling through this
cost of living crisis"". And he attacks Rishi Sunak for failing to mention climate once. The party did welcome the VAT cut on energy
efficiency measures, such as solar panels and heat pumps. But Ramsay says the promise of a future tax cut ""shows the chancellor is focused on
winning the next general election, and not helping those on benefits and lower
incomes who are in desperate need right nowâ. Reality Check In his Spring Statement, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said it was âthanks to Brexitâ that he could get rid of VAT on solar panels and heat pumps for the next five years. He said homeowners would no longer need to pay 5% VAT on them. After Brexit, the UK does have more freedom to set its VAT rates, but the EU is also planning to exempt these products from VAT. On 2 March 2022, the EU Parliament approved plans to allow member states to exempt a number of products from VAT, including solar panels and green heating systems, as part of its new environmental policy. The EU changes have not yet come into effect, while Sunakâs will start next month. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The rise in National Insurance contributions was directly
linked to increasing funding for the NHS and paying for Englandâs cap on social care costs. So naturally one question being asked is how the decision
to increase the threshold at which National Insurance is paid affects that? In
the short-term, it doesnât. The health budget in England is
set until 2025 and nothing in todayâs statement suggests the government will
revisit that. The same is true for the care cap â although the overall
budget for the care system has not been set. In the longer term, some are warning this will lead to less
money than expected being available for public services more generally. And the rising cost of living has a wider societal
impact on health - by pushing more people into poverty, which is one of the key
drivers of poor health. This, in turn, will increase demands on health and care, NHS
leaders are warning. The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, has welcomed a further Â£500m for councils, announced by the chancellor in his Spring Statement, to provide targeted welfare support to low-income households. Councillor Shaun Davies, from LGA, said councils would need maximum flexibility and quick details on
  allocations to make sure funding reaches those in need and
  can help to prevent families from reaching crisis point in the first
  place. He said the increase in funding through the Household Support Fund - essentially council grants aimed at helping the most vulnerable pay for food, clothing and bills - was a positive step but could not address underlying cost of living pressures on its own, nor help people make the most of their money and strengthen financial resistance. ""With many households likely to be economically
  vulnerable for some time to come, councils also want to work with government
  on an effective long-term solution to preventing poverty and disadvantage that
  moves away from providing crisis support towards improving life chances,"" he added. Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent By 2027 the highest will be at the highest level since the late 1940s - when Sir Stafford Cripps was chancellor Despite todayâs tax concessions, the fine print of Rishi Sunakâs plans suggest heâs a way off being the lower-tax chancellor he ultimately wants to be. By 2027, 36.3% of the nation's income is set to be siphoned off to the tax man, the biggest tax burden since the late 1940s. The concessions heâs unveiled today only offset a sixth of the tax rises introduced since 2020. Some of the increased tax burden is understandable - hundreds of billions of public money was spent on pandemic support packages which successfully protected the vast majority of livelihoods. But bringing it down will be harder given the pressures on the public purse: By 2027, the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's economic watchdog, reckons public spending will have âsettledâ at 41.1% of national income, which is 2.1% higher than pre-pandemic 2019-20 levels, and the highest sustained level since the late 1970s.  This video can not be played Earlier today shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves accused the chancellor of not understanding the scale of the challenge. ""His choices are making the cost of living crisis worse - not better,"" she told MPs, speaking after Rishi Sunak had delivered his Spring Statement. Watch the video above. Greenpeace UK praises the announcement by the chancellor that the government will cut VAT on energy-saving items, like insulation, heat pumps and solar panels. Policy Director Dr Doug Parr says it is a ""welcome start to  ending that huge
waste of energy, helping keep bills down and cut our gas use"". But he says it can only be the start. ""We
need to see around Â£10bn of support, part raised by a windfall tax on oil and
gas companies, for delivering the help families need to install the clean
technologies that will get us off gas,"" he adds. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent First-time buyers may wonder how they can afford to save for a deposit when their spending power is falling. Predictions from the Office for Budget Responsibility show that the average proportion of income which is saved is going to fall. Last year, owing in part to the pandemic, individuals typically saved more than 10% of their income. Next year it will be 3.1%. However, the silver lining for young buyers is that the runaway house price rises of recent years will slow, according to the OBR. The forecaster says the average UK house price will go up by 7.4% this year, then 1.3% next year, before accelerating again to 1.5%, 2.5% and 3.1% in subsequent years. Unitegeneral secretary Sharon Graham has criticised the chancellor for ""tinkering around the edges"" of the cost-of-living crisis, saying he had done nothing to tackle the corporate elite. ""Workers will still be facing sleepless nights worrying about how to make ends meet, overwhelmed by rocketing prices,"" she said. ""Once again, ordinary working people bear the broadest burden while the super-rich get off scot-free."" Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of theNational Education Union, called on the government to reverse the real terms cuts to teacher pay if they want to protect living standards and building a strong economy. AndTUCgeneral secretary Frances O'Grady said families did not get the urgent help with soaring bills they needed, and said the National Insurance threshold rise would mostly benefit the better-off. ""The small print shows that pay packets are now expected to fall in value by Â£11 a week this year,"" she added. Manuel Cortes,Transport Salaried Staffs' Associationgeneral secretary, said the statement was a missed opportunity. ""This government is fuelling - quite literally - a car-led recovery instead of promoting climate-friendly solutions such as public transport."" More from financial journalist Martin Lewis who says the measures announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak are ""not going to lift that many people out of the mire"". He describes the National Insurance threshold rise as a squirrel rather than the rabbit out of the hat he was hoping for. He tells Radio 5 Live: ""The cost of living crisis is still going to be a substantial net loss in people's real income over the next year and what has happened today will not cover that for people on lower or higher incomes but it will mitigate some of the impact. ""There will still be many people who will be struggling and having to choose between freezing and starving but there will be fewer. ""And there will be clearly be people who are going to have to curtail their lifestyles due to the cost of living... and some of them won't have to curtail it quite as much."" Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The National Insurance threshold change means people earning up to about Â£34,000 a year will be better off. The chancellor has moved the point at which people start paying National Insurance from just over Â£9,500 last year to just over Â£12,500 from July. But once you start paying National Insurance, the rate will be higher than it was last year (13.25% instead of 12%). How does that net out?
Putting both changes together, youâll be paying less National Insurance this year if you earn less than Â£34,000. Nearly 70% of employees earn less than that, so most people will be see a smaller employeeâs National Insurance bill in their payslip this year. Someone earning Â£20,000 will pay about Â£180 less National Insurance this year than last year, while  someone earning Â£50,000 will be paying about Â£200 more. Mel Stride chairs the Treasury Select Committee of MPS The chair of the MPs' Treasury Committee praises some of the ""helpful measures"" brought forward by Rishi Sunak to ""alleviate cost of living pressures faced by low-income households"". But the chancellor will be facing more questions from the MP and his colleagues. In a statement after the chancellor's speech, the Tory MP says: ""The Treasury Committee will be particularly interested in establishing
whether the balance struck between support measures introduced now, and planned
tax cuts later, is the right one. ""We will also wish to assess whether the
amount of fiscal headroom that the Chancellor has maintained is appropriate,
given the many risks present in the OBRâs forecast, and the pressing need to
provide cost of living support now.â Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor There are some interesting measures that have been announced by the chancellor today. But the figure that courses through all of this is that very high inflation. It affects everything - how much borrowing there is, the debt interest payments too - and the prediction of it reaching 9% by the end of the year is pretty extraordinary. Rishi Sunak has kept the National Insurance rise to pay for the NHS and social care - starting next month. But he announced today that in July, after three months, half of that gets given back mainly to lower earners in the form of a higher National Insurance threshold. Then the rest of it goes back via a tax cut, but only if the conditions are met in his tax plan in a couple of years time. Overall, it means he hasn't had to reverse the National Insurance rise he had already announced and he continues to go big on being a ""tax cutting chancellor"". But if you look at the OBR's documentas, he has only cut back about one sixth of all the taxes that have been raised since he came into No 11. You still have corporation tax going up, you still have NI going up in people's pay packets this April, and you still have council tax going up. BBC Politics LiveBBC2's lunchtime political programme The leader of the Liberal Democrats says the Spring Statement has been a ""total swindle"" by Rishi Sunak, ""giving with one hand and taking with another"". Sir Ed Davey tells BBC's Politics Live: ""We are facing a cost of living crisis which is the worst for over 50 years, according to the OBR, [with] inflation already at the highest for 40 years. ""People are drowning with those higher energy bills, those higher food costs, those higher fuel bills. They needed a life boat and the chancellor has utterly failed them."" He said the Lib Dems would have provided a much bigger one-off cut in VAT, costing the Treasury Â£18bn, but giving household Â£600 to ""help reflate the economy"". Sir Ed adds: ""That's the sort of bold measure we needed."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"The final preparation is done. The photographs of the chancellor getting ready have been released. In one, life imitating political art at least, Rishi Sunak appears to be gazing at an interview and picture of himself - one of the previews of his big day. Expectation has been more muted than normal - given the horror of events in Ukraine - but the Spring Statement is still a significant event that matters for all of us. The decisions he announces at the dispatch box will affect the prices we pay, the pound in our pocket. Before the conflict, there was already a squeeze on everyone's wallet coming. Since the outbreak, day by day, the uncertainty around the economy, and the impact of what's unfolding, has only become more acute. Sunak to give Spring Statement amid price pressures What to expect from Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement How could the chancellor's plans affect you? As the chancellor practised a final run through of the speech on Tuesday evening, with aides and pizza, his intention was not to reveal a massive financial package to meet this moment. If the size of his dinner matches the scale of the spending, the opposition will be disappointed - he only had one slice. The big decisions were, in the main, taken several weeks ago. Don't roll the drums for big financial drama at lunchtime. Despite lots of chatter about increasing defence spending, for example, I'm told there wasn't actually a formal request from the Ministry of Defence for any extra funding. Although every day brings new calls for more help with rocketing energy bills, the Treasury has been reluctant to move from the extra support they promised already, which was only announced last month. That's in part because the Treasury is instinctively cautious with cash. But also because price rises are so hard to predict and may go on for many, many months. Is Rishi Sunak a tax-cutter? The caution will also come because it is a matter of political choice. For Mr Sunak, Wednesday's speech is also a continuation of a path he set out in the autumn Budget. He talked then, in what was an echo of Margaret Thatcher, about the limitations of government, saying: ""There's a reason we talk about the importance of family, community, and personal responsibility. ""Not because these are an alternative to the market or the stateâ¦ it's because they are more important than the market or the state. ""The moments that make life worth living aren't created by government, aren't announced by government, aren't granted by government."" It was a message to his party that despite presiding over months of mammoth spending during the pandemic, he was reluctant to splurge. It was a message to his next door neighbour too, that No 11 wouldn't release the purse strings to pay for all of No 10's political desires. And it was a message to the country that the government's money man was serious about trying to get the books under control. This video can not be played The headlines of Rishi Sunak's Budget last October There was a contradiction then, in October, because the man who was standing at the despatch box arguing the case for small government was a tax raising, billions spending, big borrowing chancellor. His justification for his temporary political personality transplant was, of course, the pandemic, an emergency that called for it. He wanted to draw a line under that period, and call the end of that economic emergency. But even before the war in Ukraine, many families and firms faced different financial emergencies of their own. And that situation seems only likely to get worse. Of course, the details of the statement in black and white will be what matters on Wednesday lunchtime, more important than any of the warm up in advance. Every chancellor likes to keep something under wraps, and there could of course yet be a big surprise. Yet there's a risk that Rishi Sunak could be accused of creating another contradiction - a chancellor that is at pains to say he wants to help with the cost of living however he can, but won't act boldly enough to help people when it really hurts.

"Charities estimate that the number of people with disabilities who are severely struggling to pay energy bills could more than double this year. At present, about 900,000 people with disabilities are considered to be in fuel poverty, according to Scope and National Energy Action. If typical domestic bills rise to Â£3,000 in October, as feared, they said that number could rise to 2.1 million. The government has said it is supporting people facing rising costs. Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who delivers his Spring Statement on Wednesday,has pledged to help""where we can make a difference"". Disabled woman 'crying for help' over energy costs People 'facing choice between food and energy' The charities said that people with disabilities often had additional energy needs compared to people without disabilities, as many needed to keep heating on for medical reasons, or use electricity to power vital equipment. ""Disabled people are already facing some extremely difficult choices, and this is only going to get worse in the months ahead unless action is taken now,"" said Mark Hodgkinson, chief executive of Scope, a disability equality charity. Millions of households are facing a 54% rise in the cost of a typical annual gas and electricity bill, to about Â£2,000, when the regulator's new, higher price cap takes effect on 1 April. The war in Ukraine has pushed up wholesale energy costs, leading to worries that the typical household bill could rise to as high as Â£3,000 in October, when the cap will be adjusted again. The government has said it is taking ""decisive action"" in helping people with their bills. This includes a Â£150 council tax rebate for 80% of households, followed by a Â£200 discount on bills in October which will need to be repaid. National Energy Action, which campaigns for warm and dry homes, has called on the chancellor to allow low-income and vulnerable people an exemption from repaying the Â£200 grant. Adam Scorer, the charity's chief executive, said: ""As heat prices spiral, it is the most vulnerable who suffer the most. A warm, safe home is an absolute necessity for people with disabilities. The impact of a cold home on their mental and their physical health can be catastrophic. ""The current level of support is woefully inadequate. Government must provide greater financial support, or some of the most vulnerable in society will count the cost in more than just pounds and pence."" EXPLAINED:Why are energy bills so high?

"The transport secretary has called for the boss of P&O to resign after the sacking of nearly 800 staff without notice. Grant Shapps hascalled Peter Hebblethwaite's actions outrageous, and said that the government would force the company to U-turn. However, Mr Shapps later told the Commons the government was ""not in a position"" to take court action against the company and any action would be down to trade unions and the workers themselves. Mr Hebblethwaite admitted to a committee of MPs last week that he had not consulted his employees in advance, or their representatives, and admitted that this was against the law. ""There's absolutely no doubt that we were required to consult with the unions - we chose not to do that,"" he told MPs. He said that the sacked employees would be compensated ""in full"", with a package worth Â£36.5m - 40 employees would get more than Â£100,000 and nobody would be paid less than Â£15,000. Not consulting on cuts broke law, P&O boss admits Boris Johnson said last week during Prime Minister's Questions that the company had also broken the law by failing to give the government 45 days' notice of its actions. However, lawyers suggested the prime minister was mistaken. Doubt over PM claim that P&O sackings may be illegal Changes to the law made in in 2018 stated that if the ship on which the employees were working was registered in another country, the management had to inform the authorities in the country where it was registered - not the country where it was operating. P&O has ships registered in Cyprus, the Bahamas and Bermuda. In a letter to the government,external, Mr Hebblethwaite said: ""The very clear statutory obligation in this case was... to notify the competent authority of the state where the vessel is registered"" and said that had been done on 17 March. Mr Hebblethwaite re-stated this point in person to MPs on the House of Commons Transport Committee, although he did not explain how the company had complied with it. Cypriot authorities need to be given at least 45 days' notice to make more than 100 redundancies. In Bermuda and the Bahamas, 30 days' notice is required. Lawyers have also questioned whether P&O did in fact give the necessary notice to these authorities. Under UK law, employers planning to make 20 or more staff redundant within any 90-day period, must first consult staff and speak to trade union representatives. If this doesn't happen, employees are entitled to take their employer to a tribunal. Rosemary Connolly, an employment solicitor, says it appears P&O set aside the consultation phase and moved to terminate workers, as the process of consultation ""ordinarily takes quite a lot of time"". ""If consultation is going to be meaningful it needs to be a proper exchange,"" she says. She believes that P&O staff who have been sacked, might be able to argue that their dismissal was unfair and make a claim. Government guidance: Redundancy and benefits,external What are my rights if I am made redundant? Kate Palmer, HR advice director at Peninsula, agrees. ""There has been no meaningful consultation at all. It should be two-way process where the employees have the opportunity to put forward alternatives to that enforced termination and none of that has happened. So is it a fair process? No, based on that alone."" Ms Connolly says a problem in such cases is that any action by the workers is ""very much after the horse has bolted"". Staff would have to wait months on average for an outcome. She points out staff would have no jobs potentially during the claim period and would have to pay legal costs even if they win their case, although unions might help with those. P&O workers in Dover protest against their sacking Staff are also being asked to sign forms that will prevent them taking legal action if they accept compensation from P&O. However, the fact that P&O's owners, DP World, are based in Dubai, should not affect employees making a case for wrongful dismissal, according to Ms Connolly. She says that under UK employment law, workers' rights are based on the ""jurisdiction from which you work"" - in other words, because they work in the UK, they are covered by UK law. If this wasn't the case, she says, companies could just register themselves abroad and employment law could be ignored. P&O says that the decision was taken ""as a last resort and only after full consideration of all other options"" because the company could not have survived otherwise. Mr Hebblethwaite told MPs that the company needed to move to ""a competitive operating model that is recognised throughout the world and our competitors also use"". Union representatives told the committee that Irish Ferries had also previously moved to hiring cheaper foreign staff, but that the unions still had good agreements with Stena and DFDS. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC News that ""Irish Ferries already went down this route"" and warned that the company ""will have to change their operating model"".

"The Treasury shared pictures of Chancellor Rishi Sunak preparing his statement Chancellor Rishi Sunak will unveil his Spring Statement later, against a backdrop of rising energy, fuel and food costs. He is expected to announce measures to help people with the cost of living, including a cut to fuel tax. He has come under increasing pressure to act, with prices rising by 6.2% in the 12 months to February - thefastest for 30 years. Labour wants him to go further and scrap a planned tax hike next month. National Insurance is set to rise by 1.25p in the pound to pay for healthcare - but the party has said the increase is the wrong way to fund investment. Mr Sunak has ruled out scrapping the increase to NI, but there is speculation he could allow people to earn more before they have to start paying it. However, the full details of Mr Sunak's speech will not be known until he takes to the dispatch box at 12:30 GMT. What to expect from Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement How could the chancellor's plans affect you? How much would cutting fuel duty on petrol save you? Is Rishi Sunak a tax-cutter? The Spring Statement, one of two financial statements the chancellor makes every year, does not normally see big tax and spending decisions announced. However, this year Mr Sunak is facing pressure to act on living standards amid soaring energy costs and rising household bills due to increasing inflation. Millions of households are facing sharp rises in energy bills from next month, when the government'sprice cap to contain recent rises is set to go up. Petrol prices have also soared in recent weeks, while inflation is also pushing up the price of household food items. On Monday, Environment Secretary George Eustice said surging oil and gas prices would lead to ""inevitable"" rises in food prices this year, with the increasing price of wheat also feeding through into higher prices for products such as chicken. The chancellor is expected to say the war in Ukraine will make these price pressures worse - but add that a stronger British economy is vital in responding to the ""challenge to our values"" presented by Russian President Vladimir Putin. His statement is also expected to set out government plans ""to create a new culture of enterprise"", including more training and investment. Expectation has been more muted than normal - given the horror of events in Ukraine - but the Spring Statement is still a significant event that matters for all of us. The decisions he announces at the dispatch box will affect the prices we pay; the pound in our pocket. Before the conflict, there was already a squeeze on everyone's wallet coming. Since the outbreak, day by day, the uncertainty around the economy, and the impact of what's unfolding, has only become more acute. Although every day brings new calls for more help with rocketing energy bills, the Treasury has been reluctant to move from the extra support they promised already, which was only announced last month. That's in part because the Treasury is instinctively cautious with cash. But also because price rises are so hard to predict and may go on for many, many months. Read more from Laura here Labour has criticised Mr Sunak ahead of his speech, branding him ""the high-tax chancellor"" and saying there is no evidence to believe his frequent claims that he wants to cut taxes in the long term. The SNP has also called for the National Insurance rise to be scrapped, dubbing Mr Sunak ""the poverty chancellor"" forremoving the Â£20 uplift for universal creditandbreaking his pledge to keep the pension triple lock. Some Conservative MPs have also called for the NI rise to be cancelled, with the official budget watchdog expected to say the UK's deficit - the difference between the government's income and what it spends - is better than last predicted in the autumn. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said this would give Mr Sunak room to help households with costs, but he would not be able to help people on ""average sorts of incomes"" with the increases. A cut to fuel duty has also been a key demand of Tory MPs in recent weeks, with more 50 Tory writing to Mr Sunak last week to make the demand. Tory MP Robert Halfon, who led the charge, said the country was ""heading to a de facto lockdown, where parents can't afford to take their kids to school [and] where workers can't afford to commute by car and have to stay at home"". But the Green Party said cutting fuel duty would not fix the cost of living crisis, and would be the wrong policy at the time of a climate emergency. Co-leader Adrian Ramsay said: ""We absolutely know people need help right now - but cuts to fuel duty aren't targeted to support the poorest and the greatest numbers of people."" Instead, the party wants a windfall tax on fossil fuel companies to pay for the restoration and doubling of the universal credit uplift, and to extend emergency fuel payments. The Conservative Environment Network of Tory MPs is also making its own request, calling on Mr Sunak to cut VAT for energy-saving products and home installation to 5%. The group said the move would cut the cost of installing cavity insulation by Â£142 and loft insulation by Â£120 for the average household, helping to lower energy bills by up to Â£399 and Â£493 at the current energy price cap - and going even further when the rise kicks in. Tory MP Stephen Crabb said: ""Insulating homes is one of the quickest ways to lower people's energy bills and reduce our reliance on imported energy. ""With millions of draughty British homes and soaring energy bills, we should cut this tax on energy efficiency."" Inflation hits new 30-year high in February Is Rishi Sunak a tax-cutter?
