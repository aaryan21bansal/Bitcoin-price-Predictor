"Rolls-Royce has been backed by a consortium of private investors and the UK government to develop small nuclear reactors to generate cleaner energy. The creation of the Rolls-Royce Small Modular Reactor (SMR) business was announced following a Â£195m cash injection from private firms and a Â£210m grant from the government. It is hoped the new company could create up to 40,000 jobs by 2050. However, critics say the focus should be on renewable power, not new nuclear. Currently, about 16% of UK electricity generation comes from nuclear power. Small modular reactors are nuclear fission reactors but are smaller than conventional ones. The investment by Rolls-Royce Group, BNF Resources, Exelon Generation and the government will go towards developing Rolls-Royce's SMR design and take it through regulatory processes to assess whether it is suitable to be deployed in the UK. It will also identify sites which will manufacture the reactors' parts and most of the venture's investment is expected to be focused in the north of the UK, where there is existing nuclear expertise. Rolls-Royce's share price jumped by 4.2% to 147.85p each following the announcement. Rolls-Royce SMR said one of its power stations would occupy about one tenth of the size of a conventional nuclear plant - the equivalent footprint of two football pitches - and power approximately one million homes. The firm said a plant would have the capacity to generate 470MW of power, which it added would be the same produced by more than 150 onshore wind turbines. Warren East, Rolls-Royce chief executive, said the company's SMR technology offered a ""clean energy solution"" which help tackle climate change. Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said SMRs offered opportunities to ""cut costs and build more quickly, ensuring we can bring clean electricity to people's homes and cut our already-dwindling use of volatile fossil fuels even further"". ""This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for the UK to deploy more low carbon energy than ever before and ensure greater energy independence"", he added. SMRs are thought to be less expensive to build than traditional nuclear power plants because of their smaller size. Due to the nature of Rolls-Royce's reactors, it is understood parts could be produced in factories and transported to sites by road, which would reduce construction time and costs. At an expected cost of around Â£2bn each, SMRs would cost less than the Â£20bn each for the larger plant under construction at Hinkley Point and an anticipated, but not yet approved, sister plant at Sizewell in Suffolk. If approved for use in the UK, it is understood Rolls-Royce SMR could build up to 16 reactors across the UK for electricity production. Tom Samson, chief executive Rolls-Royce SMR, said the company had been established to ""deliver a low cost, deployable, scalable and investable programme of new nuclear power plants"". ""Our transformative approach to delivering nuclear power, based on predictable factory-built components, is unique and the nuclear technology is proven,"" he added. What does net zero mean? UK sets out net zero plans for greenhouse gases However, Paul Dorfman, chairman of the Nuclear Consulting Group think tank, told the BBC's Today programme there was danger that the money spent on nuclear power would hit funding for other power sources. ""If nuclear eats all the pies which it is looking to be doingâ¦ we won't have enough money to do the kind of things we need to do which we know practically and technologically we can do now,"" he said. Greenpeace's chief scientist Dr Doug Parr said SMRs were still more expensive than renewable technologies and added there was ""still no solution to dispose of the radioactive waste they leave behind and no consensus on where they should be located"". ""What's worse, there's not even a prototype in prospect anytime soon,"" he added. ""The immediate deadline for action is sharp cuts in emissions by 2030, and small reactors will have no role in that."" Friends of the Earth's head of policy, Mike Childs, said government support should be ""aimed at developing the UK's substantial renewable resources, such as offshore wind, tidal and solar, and boosting measures to help householders cut energy waste"". As part of a ""10-point plan"" to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reach a target of net zero by 2050, the government has said nuclear power provides a ""reliable source of low-carbon electricity"" and that it is""pursuing large-scale nuclear"", while also looking to invest in SMRs.,external Tony Danker, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said the investment for Rolls-Royce was a ""hugely promising milestone for a technology that can not only boost the economy but help deliver a greener and more secure energy system overall"". Meanwhile, Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, added the funding sent a ""huge signal to private investors that the government wants SMRs alongside new large-scale stations to hit net zero"".

"This video can not be played Rafiq's 'courage' prompted other players to speak out about racism A former Yorkshire academy player says he was racially abused by a member of staff as a 16-year-old, in the latest allegation of racism against the club. Irfan Amjad, who was later released, claims a member of staff used a term referencing his Pakistani heritage to criticise his batting style. Yorkshire County Cricket Club said in a statement: ""It is essential that those who have experienced racism, discrimination and abuse are able to come forward to share their experiences. ""We were unaware of this allegation until now but will investigate appropriately."" Amjad's decision to speak to the BBC follows Azeem Rafiq's detailing of his experiences at Yorkshire, which he first discussed publicly in September 2020, and which left him close to taking his own life. A report found former Yorkshire player Rafiq was a victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" but the club saidit would not discipline anyone. Yorkshire's handling of the issues raised by Rafiq was widely criticised - and on 1 November, ESPN reported that the racist term about Rafiq's Pakistani heritage was regularly used towards him, but the investigation concluded it was ""friendly and good-natured banter"". On Friday, chairman Roger Hutton resigned and on Monday, Lord Patel took over, praising Rafiq's ""bravery"" as a whistleblower.

""I was making my way to the dressing room and as I got in, when I started taking my helmet and pads off, the individual came marching through the door and he looked me dead in the eyes."" At this point, the individual used the racist term in reference to ""a typical shot"" played by those of Pakistani heritage. Amjad added: ""And he just left. I was stunned, didn't know what to do and was shocked. I had never been directly racially insulted like that to my face. I didn't know what to do.

"Barack Obama has called on young people to ""stay angry"" in the fight against climate change at the COP26 summit. The former US president urged them to apply political pressure to make a change, but warned they would need to accept compromises along the way. Mr Obama said the world is ""nowhere near where we need to be"" to avoid a future climate catastrophe. He criticised Donald Trump's ""active hostility toward climate science"", but said the US is ready to lead again. Mr Obama also scolded China and Russia's leaders for not physically attending the COP26 summit. REALITY CHECK:Did Obama meet climate targets he set? Speaking in Glasgow, Mr Obama received rapturous applause when he took to the stage and a standing ovation at the end of his speech - but there was pushback from activists. He called out nations for failing to meet the pledges they made inthe 2015 Paris Agreement, when he was in the White House. However, activists were quick to point out those broken by his own administration, includingthe failure of a key promise by developed countriesto deliver $100bn (Â£73bn) a year in climate finance to poorer nations.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Perhaps a little unsure of his location in Scotland, Obama referred to being in the ""Emerald Isles"", seemingly a mistaken reference to Ireland, which is known poetically as the Emerald Isle. He also quoted Shakespeare, who was English. He admitted there is still a lot of hard and messy work to do to reduce the effects of climate change, but said some promising progress had been made in the six years since the signing of the Paris Agreement, which he helped spearhead. Mr Obama dedicated much of his speech to young activists, who he said were ""right to be frustrated"". Addressing young people directly, he said they ""can't ignore politics"" and that while protesting and hashtags raise awareness, they should get involved in politics at some level. ""You don't have to be happy about it, but you can't ignore it. You can't be too pure for [politics]."" Referencing his own daughters' shopping habits, he also called on young people to support businesses that were committed to sustainability, and boycott those that were not. Obama's catchphrase of the night was telling young activists to ""stay angry"". ""To all the young people out there - I want you to stay angry. I want you to stay frustrated,"" he said. ""But channel that anger. Harness that frustration. Keep pushing harder and harder for more and more. Because that's what's required to meet that challenge. Gird yourself for a marathon, not a sprint."" This video can not be played Obama on the Paris agreement: ""We are nowhere near where we need to be yet"" He honoured the dedication of activists such as Greta Thunberg who are ""forming movements across borders"", and urged young people to at least get out and vote for politicians who will stand against climate change. ""Vote like your life depends on it, because it does"", he said. The former president insisted that despite political divisions in the US and the country's absence from global climate efforts for four years during the Trump administration, America was now back on track and committed to change. Mr Obama made a number of comments about his predecessor, Republican Donald Trump, who once called climate change ""an expensive hoax"" and controversially pulled out of the Paris climate accord when he took office. The US rejoined it under Joe Biden. What does Trump actually believe on climate change? Mr Obama reserved some of his strongest criticism for the Republican Party. He accused its members of stalling progress by ""sitting on the sidelines"" and making climate change a partisan issue with ""four years of active hostility toward climate science"". He said Republicans who take climate change seriously are ""a rare breed right now."" This is the first year a delegation of Republicans has attended a UN climate summit. Mr Obama also blamed the pandemic, rise of US nationalism and a lack of cooperation from the Trump administration for a breakdown in international relations that has affected the climate crisis. ANALYSIS:COP26: Time to sober up VOICES:How the world is reacting to COP26 LIFE AT 50C:Life where it's too hot to work, too hot to sleep Taking a swipe at Russia and China, Mr Obama also said it was ""particularly discouraging"" that the leaders of ""two of the world's largest emitters"" had not attended the climate summit in person. While more than 120 leaders turned up at the conference, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, who have both avoided international travel since the start of the pandemic, opted to take part remotely instead. Mr Obama said they were showing a ""dangerous lack of urgency"". The 44th US president closed by telling the crowd that fighting climate change will be hard and messy with ""every victory incomplete"". ""The thing we have going for us is that humanity has done hard things before,"" he said, adding: ""I believe we can do hard things again."" Barack Obama's speech to COP26 was a study in hope and doubt. He touted the work his administration and that of Joe Biden have accomplished in addressing climate change, while acknowledging he wasn't ""real happy"" about what the Trump administration had done in the intervening four years. He lamented the fierce opposition Republicans have mounted toward addressing climate change in the US and the rise of tribalism and nationalism around the world, but pointed to efforts by states, local governments and private citizens to fill the policy void. He heralded the international co-operation evident during the Paris climate negotiations and in Glasgow over the past week, but said much more needs to be done. He even acknowledged that he doesn't have all the answers and at times gets discouraged, but he said the energy and efforts of young people give him faith in the future. It was a delicate balance for a former president who made ""hope and change"" his trademark line. But the rhetoric was reflective of the tenuous nature of current US climate polices, which are dependent on Democratic majorities that could vanish in coming elections even though, Mr Obama said, there is still much work left to do.

"It's the end of week one at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, and world leaders have already made some big commitments. More than 40 countries have promised to phase out coal by 2050, and another 100 leaders have pledged to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. The US and EU, meanwhile, announced that they would partner up to cut methane emissions. BBC reporters across the globe - from Shanghai to Sao Paulo - explain how the summit and the climate pledges are going down in their countries. COP26: So far, so good-ish 2021: A year of wild weather Chinese social media has not been flooded with criticism of the West at COP26, writesStephen McDonellin Beijing. The response in China's state-controlled media to the climate summit has been fairly muted. It's not that ordinary people in China don't know that the conference is taking place, but the coverage of it has definitely been downplayed. Perhaps Xi Jinping choosing not to attend the gathering was a key factor. To report on it might draw attention to the fact that, unlike other major nations, nobody represented China at leader level. Also, China's media is of the Communist Party and for the Communist Party. Coverage of anything involving Mr Xi, who is the General Secretary of the Party, is tightly controlled. Media outlets here would not ignore such a meeting - to which Mr Xi sent a message in lieu of an appearance - unless they had been ordered to. Of course the conference has, at various points, been referred to. Nationalist stirrers - like those featured in the Global Times - have criticised US President Joe Biden, particularly after he singled out his Chinese counterpart for not showing up. But Chinese social media have not been flooded with criticism of the West at COP26 - it's all been fairly subdued. Perhaps, for climate scientists wanting to build a sense of urgency and momentum out of this summit, ignoring what's happening there may be worse than attacking it. It's all about domestic politics, writesLaura Trevelyanin New York President Biden was determined to use COP26 to showcase American leadership on climate on the world stage - but, as MSNBC opinion columnist Hayes Brown noted, first of all, he had to apologise. Since President Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate accord, that ""put us sort of behind the eight ball a little bit,' he acknowledged on the summit's first day. The US has a see-saw approach to global climate agreements depending on which party has the presidency. So Americans know that whatever is agreed in Glasgow could be reversed by a Republican president in 2025. A tractor moves through a coal prep plant outside the city of Welch in rural West Virginia The conservative-leaning Wall St Journal pointed out that President Biden tried to paint Russia and China as ""isolated holdouts"" to a global consensus on reducing emissions but efforts by the US and its allies failed to get Moscow and Beijing to budge. At home it's the position of Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a crucial vote when it comes to getting a $500bn climate plan through Congress, that's getting attention. Mr Manchin is from a coal producing state, West Virginia, and when he said he had lingering concerns about the spending package, headlines declared: ""Biden's climate pledge risks being undermined by holdout senator."" There is no sense of a climate emergency in Russia, writesSteve Rosenbergin Moscow. Go compare. A British newspaper headline this week - Queen's plea to save our 'fragile' planet. Russia's most popular (pro-Kremlin) daily - Should we really be scared of global warming? It concluded we shouldn't, claiming there are ""positive consequences of global warming"" (especially for Russia): lower heating bills, more accessible shipping routes. There's no sense here of a climate emergency. Not that the Kremlin denies there's a problem. It points out that the climate in Russia is warming 2.5 times faster than the world average. It sent a big delegation to Glasgow. No president, though. Vladimir Putin appeared by video screen only. Still, Russia promises to be carbon neutral by 2060. It signed the Glasgow declaration on forests and land use, pledging an end to deforestation by 2030. But it wouldn't sign up to cutting methane emissions 30% by 2030. Russia is a fossil fuel superpower and wants a ""smooth"" (longer) transition to greener energy. ""Everybody wants Russia to do more to achieve carbon neutrality as soon as possible,"" Vasily Yablokov of Greenpeace Russia tells me. ""I'm happy Russia now accepts climate change is happening, but I see no high ambition from our country. It looks like the Russian government's from another planet."" India's 2070 net zero pledge has won Narendra Modi applause in a growing nation balancing economic and environmental needs, writesRajini Vaidyanathanin Delhi. Although India has been a big talking point among policy makers in the weeks leading up to the COP summit, COP hasn't been such a big topic for India's masses. But on Monday, when Prime Minister Modi announced that the country would commit to net zero by 2070, many who weren't paying much attention to goings on in Glasgow finally took note. Mr Modi's address was broadcast on prime time here, and while some around the world are frustrated India is signing up to meet these goals two decades later than the global 2050 target, here the pledges were seen as pragmatic in a growing country which needs to balance both economic and environmental needs. They were also viewed by many as a reminder that the PM won't succumb to pressure when the West has long reaped the benefits of growth while polluting. As Mr Modi reminded the summit, ""India, which is 17% of the world population, is responsible for less than 5% of emissions"" - a line that many here applauded. The First Post news website called the 2070 pledge a ""bold decision... without capitulating to the uncalled for bullying by the West"". And climate experts here say India's four shorter-term goals - to scale up renewables and reduce carbon emissions by 2030 - are also significant. Australia's part in the Cop26 summit is overshadowed by politics writesShaimaa Khalilin Sydney. Part of Scott Morrison's job at Cop26 was to explain to the world how he was going to deliver on net zero by 2050 without phasing out coal. But the prime minister's trip to Glasgow was overshadowed by a row with French President Emmanuel Macron - and not about the climate, about submarines. On Sunday in Glasgow, Mr Macron accused Mr Morrison of lying to him about a $37bn deal with France which collapsed under controversial circumstances. Mr Morrison replied by saying his nation would not accept ""sledging"" or ""slurs"". And so this past week, rather than discussing the pressing climate debate and what Australia had achieved at COP26, most of the commentary here has been about Mr Morrison's character and whether the row will affect his standing domestically. ""Slipperiness is Scott Morrison's defining characteristic,"" wrote journalist Hugh Riminton in the Guardian. ""And it was never more on show than this week as he sold ""the Australian Way"" on climate to a sceptical crowd in Glasgow, while openly being branded a liar by France."" Australia did make a few climate headlines in Glasgow. Along with China, Russia, India and Iran, it snubbed the international pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030, and refused to sign up to phasing out coal-fired power and stop investing in new coal plants at home and abroad. The verdict from Australia's ABC News? A ""terribly messy week"" for the prime minister. The climate conference in Scotland feels a long way from the reality of most Brazilians, writesKaty Watsonin SÃ£o Paulo. Much is made of Brazil's contribution to climate change internationally because of its immense rainforest. But with all that President Jair Bolsonaro says and does - and the fact he didn't even attend COP26 - it feels a bit different over here. Yes, the Amazon is in the same country, but it's a long way from big cities like SÃ£o Paulo and Rio, and probably feels just as distant as a climate conference in Scotland. It's not that Brazilians don't care. ""People do want to participate and they have lots to contribute,"" says Silvia Cervellini, co-founder of Delibera, a Brazilian organisation helping people get involved in politics. But since the pandemic, there's been a rise in poverty and the political and economic crisis is casting a shadow over Brazil. People have more immediate concerns. ""What we need to do is enable people to make the connection with daily life,"" Ms Cervellini says. And that's something that dressmaker Izildete Maria de Sousa Botelho agrees with. The 67-year-old from Minas Gerais state was selected to be part of the Global Citizen Assembly for COP. ""If we are cutting down trees, we need to rethink what we eat,"" she says. ""We outsource the responsibility to authorities and politicians and forget that it's individual actions, it's the lack of ecological awareness that we need to work on that is causing all of this."" Many in Iran believe that it is unfair to expect the country to make any climate commitments while the sanctions remain, writes BBC Persian Service correspondentSiavash Ardalan. Iran is among the top 10 emitters of greenhouse gases and suffers extensively from the effects of global warming. The country has seen one its worst droughts in decades this year,resulting in severe water shortagesand electricity blackouts. US sanctions and unsustainable domestic policies have only exacerbated such problems. One member of Iran's delegation to COP26 has said that if the sanctions were lifted, ""there would be no obstacle for us to reduce our emissions"". However, conservatives affiliated to President Ebrahim Raisi's government have put out statements that range from climate change denial to assertions COP26 is seeking to deprive Iran of its oil and gas. Although the summit has been largely ignored by Iranian media, such critical views have made their way to some pro-government conservative outlets. A few reform-minded newspapers have meanwhile echoed the dire warnings from UN officials and climate scientists while avoiding any critique of the government's low-key approach to COP26. Public opinion is divided. Many believe that it is unfair to expect any commitments from Iran while the sanctions remain in place. Others argue that climate change has only served to downplay government incompetence. COP26 is not front page news in Nigeria, writesNduka Orjinmoin Abuja. Nigeria, Africa's largest oil exporter, has promised zero emissions by 2060. The big media houses have sent reporters to Glasgow but it is not front page news in Nigeria. On Wednesday, President Muhammadu Buhari said no-one in Nigeria needed ""persuading of the need for urgent action on the environment,"" pointing to desertification, floods and erosion in the country as ""enough evidence"". But he wants access to climate finance - some of the $100bn annually available to developing economies - and foreign investment in Nigeria's gas sector to help the country wean itself off its major revenue earner, oil. The president struck the right notes for those in Glasgow but back home people, in homes powered by gasoline generators imported from China, live in a different reality. No-one here has experienced a stable power supply in their lifetime and if it takes burning coal to achieve that, few will reject it for the sake of the climate. Climate activists, especially in the oil-producing Niger Delta region, have long sounded the alarm about the impact of oil drilling and gas flaring but there is little sign of any action from the government and the international oil firms. Even as Saudi Arabia seeks to achieve net zero by 2060, the country is boosting its oil production, writes Middle East Business CorrespondentSameer Hashmi. For a long time, the world's largest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, had resisted calls from Western countries to set a definite target to reduce carbon emissions. Then last month, the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, announced that the country had set a goal of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2060. But, even as the Saudis seek to achieve that objective, they are boosting their oil production capacity to cater for global demand. The country's top officials have repeatedly said tackling climate change is necessary, but that it cannot be done by ""demonising"" hydrocarbons. The energy minister believes the world needs both fossil fuels as well as renewables. Most officials I spoke to there supported the crown prince's goal and his efforts to promote economic diversification by investing in new industries. The response by environmental activists though was more muted.

"Rivelino VerÃ¡ Gabriel said deforestation made life hard for Brazil's indigenous people A Brazilian tribal chief has warned Welsh soya imports could be responsible for ""not only deforestation but indigenous blood"". Rivelino VerÃ¡ Gabriel said soy farming was wrecking the lifestyle of the South American nation's Mbya Guarani people. It comes as the effect on deforestation by goods imported to Wales from high risk areas is exposed in a new report. It has led the Welsh government to promise action on products such as beef, soy and palm oil. Mr Gabriel lives in Brazil's Atlantic Forest and is a coordinator of the Guarani Yvyrupa Commission, which brings together members of the Guarani people. Commenting on the report, he said: ""People who buy soya must know where it comes from, that there's strong traceability. ""They need to know whether this soya they're buying to feed a chicken from Wales, for instance, is coming from deforested areas in indigenous territories."" Wales could be 'first deforestation free nation' Fridge doors could save 1% of UK electricity use Deforestation meant the ability of his people to survive was becoming increasingly hard, he said. Rivers became polluted, traditional herbs could not be found, and hunting was made more difficult. Environment charities calculated an area 40% the size of Wales grew a handful of key commodities for it. It has led to calls for climate change targets to be amended to take account of goods shipped in from abroad. The effect on deforestation by goods imported to Wales has been exposed in a new report Charities WWF Cymru, Size of Wales and RSPB Cymru worked on the study. They looked at cocoa, palm, beef, leather, natural rubber, soy, timber, pulp and paper imports. The report showed nearly a third of land used to grow these for Wales are in countries at high risk of deforestation, and exploitation of workers. Carbon emissions linked to forest clearance to provide soy, cocoa, palm and rubber imports alone were equivalent to nearly a quarter of Wales' transport emissions every year. Wales' carbon zero targets 'down to politics' New schools in Wales must be net zero from 2022 An area five times Newport's size is used to grow soy for Wales. The charities said Wales' people were contributing to deforestation by eating meat fed on such ""high-risk soy"". Meanwhile, each year Wales uses land overseas the size of the Brecon Beacons to satisfy demand for beef. More than a quarter (26%) is in countries at high risk of deforestation and labour exploitation. The report advises the Senedd to encourage farmers to adopt nature and climate-friendly practices which do not rely on imported animal feed. A strategy that drives and rewards traceable farm-to-fork supply chains is also urged. The charities want the Welsh and UK governments to ensure post-Brexit trade deals guarantee high environmental and social standards. An area five times Newport's size is used to grow soy for Wales. Current Welsh targets to cut greenhouse gases and reach net zero only focus on domestic emissions so there is a drive for a report that accounts for those caused by imports. WWF Cymru's Shea Buckland-Jones said Wales was having a ""catastrophic"" effect on the world's forests. ""We know what needs to be done and this report sets out some of the solutions,"" he said. ""Wales must act now by changing how we buy, consume and invest."" Size of Wales' deputy director, Barbara Davies Quy, said the COP26 summit was a chance for Wales to show leadership and take bold action. ""The Welsh government must seize this opportunity to drive positive change in our supply chains and commit to including deforestation free targets in all public sector spending,"" she said. In COP26's first major deal last week, more than 100 leaders promised to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. The UK was among signatories. The charities say action is needed sooner. Welsh government minister Julie James said she was determined to change Welsh government procurement policy Figures suggest almost 20% of the Amazon rainforest has been lost and, if another 5% goes, a tipping point could be triggered where it will not be able to sustain itself as a tropical rainforest. Wales' climate change minister, Julie James, said the report was ""shocking"". ""We absolutely have to do something to diminish and hopefully eliminate our footprint abroad as well as at home."" She was ""absolutely determined"" to change Welsh government procurement policy. ""We will also need to talk to all of our supermarkets and other purchasers across Wales to get everybody on board,"" she said. Ms James said she had met with members of Peru's indigenous Wampis people at the conference. ""They were telling me about the destruction of their native lands, the deforestation, completely unintended by people who don't really understand what they're buying,"" she said. Changing climate change targets, she said, was something the Welsh government was ""determined to do"". Cook Aled Hill said people should question where produce comes from Cardiff burger restaurant Ansh has started taking action. The meat for its burgers comes from their farm, where it uses sustainable methods to rear their animals. ""It's important that people question where produce comes from, where the meat comes from, where the food comes from,"" cook Aled Hill said. ""Because you don't know whether something you buy is causing huge damage overseas.""

"This video can not be played Watch: Video shows hundreds of migrants at Belarus' border with Poland Poland says it has repelled attempts by migrants to enter the country at its eastern border with Belarus, warning that thousands more were on the way. Video footage showed hundreds of people near a barbed-wire border fence, which some tried to force their way through. The Polish government called a crisis meeting on Monday and deployed 12,000 troops to the region. Poland has accused Belarus of pushing the migrants towards the border, describing it as hostile activity. Poland, Lithuania and Latvia say there's been a surge in the number of people trying to enter their countries illegally from Belarus in recent months. Many of them have come from the Middle East and Asia. The European Union has accused Belarus's authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko of facilitating the influx in retaliation against sanctions. Many migrants have been trapped on the border between Poland and Belarus Poland, which has been criticised for pushing back migrants and refugees at its border, has responded to the large number of people arriving there by building a razor-wire fence. The Polish Border Guard also said it was closing its border crossing with Belarus at Kuznica from Tuesday morning. Conditions for migrants on the border are hostile to the point of being deadly, and fears have been raised for their safety in the region's sub-zero winter. As they are summarily expelled from Poland and Belarus refuses to allow them back in, people are finding themselves stranded and freezing in Poland's forests. Several have died of hypothermia. Polish troops and border guards with shields stopped migrants from crossing into the country The BBC's Paul Adams spoke to Barwa Nusreddine Ahmed, the brother of one Iraqi migrant who was at the border with his wife and three children. They arrived in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, last month. With little to eat or drink, the people stuck at the border were suffering, Mr Ahmed said. He said Monday's move to the border post was planned on social media by the migrants themselves, but suggested Belarus was pushing them. ""People know they're being used [by Mr Lukashenko], but they have no future,"" Mr Ahmed said. READ MORE:How Belarus is helping âtouristsâ break into the EU On Monday, the Nato alliance said it was worried about ""escalation"" on the border with Poland and was ready to ""maintain safety and security in the region"". Meanwhile in Lithuania, the government there moved troops to its border with Belarus to prepare for a possible influx of migrants and was considering declaring a state of emergency. Analysis by Paul Adams, diplomatic correspondent This is a significant escalation in a crisis that's been rumbling since the middle of the year. For months, Belarus' EU neighbours have been accusing the Lukashenko regime of ""weaponising"" migration, in revenge for successive waves of EU sanctions on Minsk. Migrants have told us numerous stories of the role played by Belarussian soldiers in helping them to make illegal crossings into Poland and Lithuania. Some cross in small groups, while others have spoken of being transported to the border in military trucks and shown where to go. But the latest pictures from the Polish border are unprecedented, recalling scenes from the Greek-Macedonian border at the height of the 2015-16 migrant crisis. The sheer concentration of numbers at a single crossing point, along with the presence of Belarussian soldiers, apparently doing nothing to stem the flow of migrants to the border, suggest that once again, this is being orchestrated. It's a charge Belarus denies. Tensions intensified on Monday when videos posted on social media showed a column of people, including women and children, walking towards the Polish border in Belarus. Other videos showed large numbers of migrants being escorted by armed men dressed in khaki. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The head of Poland's National Security Council, Pawel Soloch, said he expected ""attacks on our border [to] be renewed by groups of several hundred people"" overnight. Responding to Monday's developments, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called on EU member states to impose new sanctions against the Belarusian regime, which she accused of ""putting people's lives at risk"". Meanwhile, the US urged Mr Lukashenko to ""immediately halt [his] campaign of orchestrating and coercing"" the illegal flow of migrants across his country's border into Europe. The Belarusian border guard agency earlier told state media that more than 2,000 ""refugees"" had amassed in front of Polish barriers. They were heading for the EU ""where they want to apply for protection"", the agency said. The agency accused Poland of using ""unjustified"" means to repel ""people seeking protection"".

"This video can not be played Megan and Whitney Bacon-Evans say there should be an ""equal playing field"" A lesbian couple are launching a landmark judicial review against their NHS Clinical Commissioning Group for its ""discriminatory"" fertility policy. Influencers Megan and Whitney Bacon-Evans say they are required to undergo 12 rounds of costly private treatment before they can get NHS support. Heterosexual couples have to try to conceive for two years before becoming eligible for NHS-funded treatment. CCG Frimley, the subject of the review, says its policies comply with guidance. The social media stars, who were featured on TV show Say Yes To The Dress, and run a lifestyle and travel blog, have been together for 13 years and married for four. They say they were ""shocked and devastated to discover the discrimination that lesbian couples, bisexual women and individuals with wombs face in starting their family"". ""For many years we have been talking about wanting to create our family - we've had our children's names picked out for a decade,"" Megan told the BBC. ""There isn't much information out there so everything was new for us, and as we went along we found out there were a lot of barriers and discrimination. ""With equal marriage coming in, we thought we were equal in the eyes of the law, but not when it comes to starting a family."" Woman denied IVF because partner has son 'We couldnât afford IVF so we found a sperm donor online' The Bacon-Evans have launched the suit with the law firm Leigh Day, which is applying to proceed with the judicial review on Tuesday. ""Our clients believe that Frimley CCG's policy is blatantly discriminatory on grounds of their sexual orientation and puts them at a huge financial disadvantage by treating them less favourably than heterosexual couples in a comparable situation,"" solicitor Anna Dews said. Recommendations as to who can have NHS-funded fertility treatment in England and Wales are set by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)  guidelines. NICE suggests women aged under 40 should be offered three cycles of IVF treatment on the NHS, which otherwise costs between Â£5,000 and Â£10,000 a round, if: they've been trying to get pregnant through regular unprotected sex for two years or have not got pregnant after 12 cycles of artificial insemination, with at least six of those using the intrauterine insemination method (IUI) However, it is up to individual CCGs to set the policy for their local area, and their criteria can vary. The couple say it was so difficult to discover the fertility treatment policy for LGBT couples in their local area that they submitted a Freedom of Information request to find out. They eventually managed to book an appointment with a fertility doctor who told them they must go through six rounds of private treatment, but later found out that the minimum number was 12, which could cost up to Â£26,000. The couple estimate that the true cost of having a child as a female same-sex couple, or as a single woman, is between Â£30,000 and Â£50,000 once the private treatment, cost of sperm and storage are factored in. More than one in four CCGs in England require couples to pay for 10 to 12 cycles of treatment before they become eligible for NHS help, according to the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS). ""Our research has found that female same-sex couples and single women are disproportionately impacted by policies which require that they self-finance costly, and less effective, artificial insemination, in some cases for at least two years, before becoming eligible for funded IVF,"" says Marta Jansa Perez, director of embryology at BPAS Fertility. ""These restrictions amount to a tax on LGBT+ families, and the impact can be truly devastating."" The couple say they hope the precedents set by their case will help thousands of other same-sex couples to have a family. They have launched a crowdfunding appeal to raise Â£10,000 to help cover the cost of the case, and have pledged to donate the money to charity or to others fighting similar legal battles if they win. In 2019, then-Health Secretary Matt Hancock pledged that ""sexual orientation should not be a factor in access to IVF"". But research from the UK fertility regulator found 14% of female same-sex couples had received NHS-funded IVF cycles, compared with 39% of heterosexual patients. Only 6% of single patients had been given NHS-funded treatments. The Stonewall charity is supporting the launch of the Bacon-Evans' case and calling for all prospective parents to have access to six rounds of funded IUI, and then to three rounds of IVF if that is unsuccessful. ""Being lesbian, bisexual or LGBTQ+ is a social rather than medical infertility and everyone - regardless of where they live and who they love - should be able to start a family if they want,"" Stonewall's associate director of policy and research, Eloise Stonborough, said. ""There is a huge variation and inequality in the system for everyone, but LGBTQ couples are disproportionally affected, meaning many are faced with either pursuing costly private treatment or risky personal deals such as going online to find private donors."" A spokesperson for NHS Frimley CCG said: ""The fertility services we provide are based on NICE guidance.

"The UK's biggest fishing shop has been hacked, with its website redirecting keen anglers to an adult website. Angling Direct, which sells fishing gear online and through stores, said it was hit by the attack late on Friday. On top of the website redirect, its Twitter account has been compromised to also reference a porn site and to post contact details for the attacker. The company said it has brought in cyber-security experts to tackle the problem, and alerted authorities. On Angling Direct's own Twitter account, the attacker posted a mocking tweet claiming the company had been sold to adult website Pornhub. ""Your data has already been transferred"" to the adult video empire, it told fishing enthusiasts, apparently trolling them. But Angling Direct said it is not clear if any personal data has been compromised - and that no payment data could be. The attacker also posted an email address where they could be reached, along with an offer to return ""information and access"" to the site. No public demands for ransom were made. Fishing (or phishing) puns aside, this case will send shivers down the spines of company bosses. Yes, this attack carries all the hallmarks of an immature teenage hacker having fun but it is no doubt causing serious problems for the victim. Experts tell me that signs point to employee login credentials having been stolen, allowing the hackers to take over the website and, separately, the Twitter account of the company. The motive is clear - the hackers want to be paid before they hand back control to the firm. But in the meantime the company is losing money from potential sales - not to mention trust and reputational damage, as customers are left embarrassed or worse when accidentally visiting an explicit site. In a statement, the company said: ""We are mindful of our obligations regarding data; it is too soon yet to make any determination around the impact this incident has had on personal data."" ""Importantly, the company does not hold any customer financial data, as our website transactions are handled by third parties."" Angling Direct's several dozen physical shops remain open for in-store purchases, according to a post by one of the locations on Facebook. The firm has also posted messages to the Facebook page of at least one local store, apologising to anyone who was ""directed away from our site and towards inappropriate content"".

On Angling Direct's own Twitter account, the attacker posted a mocking tweet claiming the company had been sold to adult website Pornhub. ""Your data has already been transferred"" to the adult video empire, it told fishing enthusiasts, apparently trolling them. But Angling Direct said it is not clear if any personal data has been compromised - and that no payment data could be. The attacker also posted an email address where they could be reached, along with an offer to return ""information and access"" to the site. No public demands for ransom were made. Fishing (or phishing) puns aside, this case will send shivers down the spines of company bosses. Yes, this attack carries all the hallmarks of an immature teenage hacker having fun but it is no doubt causing serious problems for the victim. Experts tell me that signs point to employee login credentials having been stolen, allowing the hackers to take over the website and, separately, the Twitter account of the company. The motive is clear - the hackers want to be paid before they hand back control to the firm. But in the meantime the company is losing money from potential sales - not to mention trust and reputational damage, as customers are left embarrassed or worse when accidentally visiting an explicit site. In a statement, the company said: ""We are mindful of our obligations regarding data; it is too soon yet to make any determination around the impact this incident has had on personal data."" ""Importantly, the company does not hold any customer financial data, as our website transactions are handled by third parties."" Angling Direct's several dozen physical shops remain open for in-store purchases, according to a post by one of the locations on Facebook. The firm has also posted messages to the Facebook page of at least one local store, apologising to anyone who was ""directed away from our site and towards inappropriate content"".

"This video can not be played Watch: Video shows hundreds of migrants at Belarus' border with Poland Poland says it has repelled attempts by migrants to enter the country at its eastern border with Belarus, warning that thousands more were on the way. Video footage showed hundreds of people near a barbed-wire border fence, which some tried to force their way through. The Polish government called a crisis meeting on Monday and deployed 12,000 troops to the region. Poland has accused Belarus of pushing the migrants towards the border, describing it as hostile activity. Poland, Lithuania and Latvia say there's been a surge in the number of people trying to enter their countries illegally from Belarus in recent months. Many of them have come from the Middle East and Asia. The European Union has accused Belarus's authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko of facilitating the influx in retaliation against sanctions. Many migrants have been trapped on the border between Poland and Belarus Poland, which has been criticised for pushing back migrants and refugees at its border, has responded to the large number of people arriving there by building a razor-wire fence. The Polish Border Guard also said it was closing its border crossing with Belarus at Kuznica from Tuesday morning. Conditions for migrants on the border are hostile to the point of being deadly, and fears have been raised for their safety in the region's sub-zero winter. As they are summarily expelled from Poland and Belarus refuses to allow them back in, people are finding themselves stranded and freezing in Poland's forests. Several have died of hypothermia. Polish troops and border guards with shields stopped migrants from crossing into the country The BBC's Paul Adams spoke to Barwa Nusreddine Ahmed, the brother of one Iraqi migrant who was at the border with his wife and three children. They arrived in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, last month. With little to eat or drink, the people stuck at the border were suffering, Mr Ahmed said. He said Monday's move to the border post was planned on social media by the migrants themselves, but suggested Belarus was pushing them. ""People know they're being used [by Mr Lukashenko], but they have no future,"" Mr Ahmed said. READ MORE:How Belarus is helping âtouristsâ break into the EU On Monday, the Nato alliance said it was worried about ""escalation"" on the border with Poland and was ready to ""maintain safety and security in the region"". Meanwhile in Lithuania, the government there moved troops to its border with Belarus to prepare for a possible influx of migrants and was considering declaring a state of emergency. Analysis by Paul Adams, diplomatic correspondent This is a significant escalation in a crisis that's been rumbling since the middle of the year. For months, Belarus' EU neighbours have been accusing the Lukashenko regime of ""weaponising"" migration, in revenge for successive waves of EU sanctions on Minsk. Migrants have told us numerous stories of the role played by Belarussian soldiers in helping them to make illegal crossings into Poland and Lithuania. Some cross in small groups, while others have spoken of being transported to the border in military trucks and shown where to go. But the latest pictures from the Polish border are unprecedented, recalling scenes from the Greek-Macedonian border at the height of the 2015-16 migrant crisis. The sheer concentration of numbers at a single crossing point, along with the presence of Belarussian soldiers, apparently doing nothing to stem the flow of migrants to the border, suggest that once again, this is being orchestrated. It's a charge Belarus denies. Tensions intensified on Monday when videos posted on social media showed a column of people, including women and children, walking towards the Polish border in Belarus. Other videos showed large numbers of migrants being escorted by armed men dressed in khaki. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Poland's deputy foreign minister, Piotr Wawrzyk, accused Belarus of trying to orchestrate a major incident near Kuznica Bialostocka, a village close to the border, and warned of ""an attempt at a mass border crossing"". In other footage shared on social media, crowds of migrants can be seen attempting to breach a razor wire fence at the border, but being prevented from passing through by Polish border guards.

The head of Poland's National Security Council, Pawel Soloch, said he expected ""attacks on our border [to] be renewed by groups of several hundred people"" overnight. Responding to Monday's developments, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called on EU member states to impose new sanctions against the Belarusian regime, which she accused of ""putting people's lives at risk"". Meanwhile, the US urged Mr Lukashenko to ""immediately halt [his] campaign of orchestrating and coercing"" the illegal flow of migrants across his country's border into Europe. The Belarusian border guard agency earlier told state media that more than 2,000 ""refugees"" had amassed in front of Polish barriers. They were heading for the EU ""where they want to apply for protection"", the agency said. The agency accused Poland of using ""unjustified"" means to repel ""people seeking protection"".

"Former US President Barack Obama tells the COP26 climate conference: ""We are nowhere near where we need to be"" He takes a swipe at his successor, Donald Trump, saying he set the US back in the fight against climate change Obama also criticises China and Russia for a ""lack of urgency"" in tackling the issue The focus in negotiating rooms is meanwhile on what can be done to help countries on the climate frontline The world is already at least 1.1C warmer than the pre-industrial era and scientists say we must limit warming to 1.5C We've been putting your questions to a former top climate negotiator, who is giving us an insight into what happens behind closed doors Edited by James Clarke We will be back again with our live coverage of COP26 tomorrow when the day's focus will be on gender, science and innovation. Today's live page was edited by James Clarke and Hugo Bachega. Our writers were Paul McLaren, Jen Meierhans, Kelly-Leigh Cooper, Georgina Rannard, Doug Faulkner and Becky Morton. Thank you for joining us for the start of the second week of negotiations at COP26 in Glasgow. Analysis shared with the BBC shows there are more delegates associated with the fossil fuel industry attending COP26 than come from any single country. Campaigners led by Global Witnessassessed the participant,externallist and found more than 500 attendees linked to fossil fuel interests. Their attendance at the pivotal climate conference is seen as controversial. Some campaigners - including Greta Thunberg - have criticised the conference so far as a ""greenwashing"" failure. Barack Obama had plenty to say in his COP26 speech earlier as he called on the world to ""step up"" on climate change. This video can not be played COP26:  'We are nowhere near where we need to be yet' - Obama This video can not be played Have you heard of dance energy? Throughout COP26, you will have heard plenty about wind energy and solar energy. But what about dance energy? Glasgow nightclub SWG3 is set to trial technology that captures body heat from dancers to create renewable energy to heat up or to cool down the venue. Long after the party is over, this energy can be stored until it is needed again.
The system, which has been called Bodyheat, is due to be installed by 2022 and will save approximately 70 tonnes of CO2 per year. Reality Check A solar panel installation in southern California In his speech, former US President Obama said more than three million people worked in clean energy-related jobs in the US. ""Thatâs more than the amount of people employed by the entire fossil fuel industry.â According to the latestUS Energy and Employment Report,external, there were just over three million people in clean energy-related jobs by the end of 2020. That's about 10% less than the previous year, largely due to the impact of Covid on employment. About two million of these were in the energy efficiency sector, which includes the production and installation of energy-saving products. Another half a million were in renewable energy, and another 300,000 in the clean vehicle sector. In 2020, employment in the electric vehicle sector grew by almost 8%, as petrol and diesel vehicle sector employment declined by 10%. The fossil fuel industry as a whole - including coal, gas and oil - employed about 800,000 people in 2020. This includes mining and extraction jobs, as well as the manufacturing and trading of these fuels. Jobs in oil, gas and coal extraction have experienced a gradual decline over the past decade, although they have seen a slight uptick in the past couple of years. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter âThe US is back,â former president Barack Obama told the gathered
delegates at COP26. Implicit in that statement was that, for the past
four years of the Trump administration, the US was absent when it came to global
efforts to address climate change. Obamaâs references to Donald Trump during his speech were more regretful
than accusatory â akin to President Joe Bidenâs apology last week for Trump
administration actions. Obama said he wasnât âreal happyâ about the former presidentâs decision
to pull the US out of the Paris Accords. He lamented the current lack of
international co-operation, exacerbated by what he identified as a âlack of
American leadershipâ on a range of multilateral issues. He acknowledged that his efforts, and those of Mr Biden, were made more
difficult by Republican hostility toward efforts to address climate change. He
said he didnât have all the answers, that he sometimes feels discouraged and the future can at times seem bleak. He noted, however, that even under the Trump administration the US made
progress toward its climate goals, due to efforts of states, local governments
and private corporations. And although the US had âa lot of work to do,â it was
prepared to lead once again. Kat Jones is helping to create a warm welcome in Glasgow for COP26 visitors - in her role as project manager for Stop Climate Chaos Scotland. Sheexplains how she's making visitors feel at home: Even without inflated prices, there are lots of people who need to come to COP26 who can't afford to stay in Â£100-a-night hotels - people coming from the countries most affected by climate change, young activists, and smaller NGOs, which don't have much funding. We've set up the Homestay Network so they aren't excluded. As well as offering space in private homes, hosts are helping people find their way around, recommending places to visit and serving them local food. It's not just about finding environmentally-friendly and affordable accommodation for delegates who are struggling - it's also about cultural exchange and friendship. Glasgow is such a welcoming city.  Often, at previous COPs, churches and village halls opened their doors and large groups could just take their sleeping bags along. But, because of Covid, it's much harder to do that. With the Homestay Network you've got one person staying with one family - it's a much safer way of providing accommodation. I had some people from Madagascar staying with me and they left this morning, so I'm going to Queen Street Station today to meet some new guests and take them back to my house. BBC Media Action Todayâs theme at the UN climate conference is adaptation, loss and damage. More now from the BBC's international charity - whichhas been speaking with people on the climate front lineabout how warming temperatures and extreme weather are changing their lives. In the far west of Nepal, Parbati Bhat
has been a community health volunteer for 38 of her 58 years. For the first
time, she is treating local people for malaria as changing weather patterns have brought
mosquitoes higher into the mountains. âMy relatives live in low-lying areas of Nepal, in Mahendranagar and Dhangadhi. They would tell me that they were troubled by mosquitoes and mosquito-borne diseases like malaria, and I would wonder: what are mosquitoes like? What is malaria like?â she told BBC Media Action. âThere are now eight recent malaria cases in our own village. The mosquito population is growing here, and so are malaria cases.â In Dhaka, Nazma Begum is one of the thousands of climate migrants relocating to the Bangladesh capital. She now works in a garment factory after her local villageâs homes were destroyed by land erosion. âThis is not easy work. Itâs very hot, humid, we sweat a lot... and sometimes it gets really awful in the summer. A couple of us even fainted in the last heatwave,â she says. âItâs even worse at home. It is almost unbearable to sleep with five people, as the tin-roofed room seems like an oven after the evening.â âLiving
Climate Changeâ is being screened at COP26 as a way to bring the voices of
marginalised people into the discussions. They can be viewedhere. James CookBBC Scotland senior news correspondent On the marches outside COP26, we've heard plenty of calls
for us to cut back on meat and dairy to save the planet. Jennie Macdiarmid, a professor in sustainable nutrition
and health at Aberdeen University, agrees with the protesters. Farming is rapidly gobbling up the world's dwindling
carbon budget, she says, suggesting that 20 years from now we may only be
eating meat once a week. Not so fast, says Martin Kennedy, president of the
National Farmers Union of Scotland, who argues that agriculture is ""getting hit
with a stick that's not justified"". ""Iâve no beef with vegans,"" he says. ""I just don't think
anybody should be telling anybody else how they should be eating."" You can read more on the debate about our diet here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter John Kerry and Barack Obama are in Glasgow today while Joe Biden spoke there last week For the first time in four years, US officials have been saying the
words environmental activists and climate-conscious world leaders have wanted
to hear. Listening to Joe Biden, on the stage at COP26, emphasise the US
understood that greenhouse gas emissions represented an existential threat to
the world â and his nation was prepared to take action â was certainly a
welcome development for many conference attendees. If there is one thing the past half-decade has underscored for the rest
of the world, however, itâs the fickle nature of US politics. Biden and the
Democrats are in charge today, but they could be swept out of Congress next
year and out of the White House in 2024. Donald Trump â who recently repeated
his claim that global warming is a âhoaxâ â or someone like him could be in
charge, once again withdrawing the US from the Paris Accords and rolling back
the current presidentâs much-touted regulatory reforms. If the US is an inconstant climate-change advocate, how much can it
accomplish at COP26, when many of the pledges and emissions targets have
timeframes that stretch through dozens of US election cycles? Biden, and former President Barack Obama, can offer their apologies
for previous US policies. The US has brokered deals this week on methane
emissions and forest preservation. It has pushed other nations to commit
net-zero-emissions targets in the coming decades, with mixed results. But until
climate change becomes an issue that no long sits atop the cavernous American
political divide, their promises and accomplishments could be swept away in the
next electoral storm. Navin Singh KhadkaEnvironment correspondent, BBC World Service Vulnerable countries at COP26 say rich nations are pushing back against theirattempts to secure compensation for the damage caused by climate change. Poorer countries see it as critical that money for what is known as ""loss and damage"" be part of negotiations this week. Negotiators agreed in Paris in 2015 to address the issue, but there is no agreement on who should pay for it. Rich nations are said to be resisting any commitments as they do not want to accept liability and risk being sued, while developing countries argue it is the rich countries that are responsible for most of today's climate change impacts because they started emitting vast quantities of carbon much earlier than the rest of the world. Negotiators, mainly representing least developed countries and small
island states, say loss and damage - such as villages and farms being buried under landslides or
swept away by floods - are now happening with increasing
frequency and intensity across the globe due to climate change. They argue climate change is affecting some communities with such intensity that they can no longer adapt, but instead need financial support to rebuild, or to move away. Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Weâve always considered the Dutch better prepared than most for climate change, but floods this summer were a startling wake-up call. Swathes of the southern Limburg province were submerged. The flooding in the southern province of Limburg was declared a disaster in July A quarter of the Netherlands lies below sea level. The small northern European country is particularly vulnerable to flooding and could be among the hardest-hit by global warming but it is also one of the largest polluters on the continent. A country renowned for its storm barriers, pumps, dykes and dunes is now being forced to rethink its survival strategy. The Dutch meteorological institute recently warned sea levels along the coast could rise by up to 2m by 2100 if global greenhouse gas emissions werenât reduced and the melting of the Antarctic polar cap accelerates. Meanwhile, the water authorities, tasked with keeping Dutch feet dry, announced: ""Gone are the days we can control water, soil and land as we please."" Drastic choices, it said, were required to contain the consequences of climate change. At the same time as these warnings though, it has emerged that the Dutch are not on course to deliver the EU-wide emissions reductions targets set for 2030 that it pushed for as part of the bloc. Prime Minister of Barbados Mia Mottley said rich countries must pay for climate damage In the past hour Barbadosâs Prime Minister Mia Mottley gave powerful remarks about loss and damage. As a small island state, her country is extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change. âThere is no better measure that the world is failing to understand the climate crisis than its failure to fund the mechanism (an agreement to address climate damage) for loss and damage,â she says. The financial losses to developing countries from climate change are huge. Mottley points out Dominica lost 226% of its GDP (the total value of a countryâs goods and services) in four hours in 2017 when a powerful hurricane hit the Caribbean. Thatâs compared to Germany which lost 0.1% of its GDP in the devastating floods this summer, she says. She points out it is richer countries who produced most of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming, but poor countries who suffer the effects most.    âItâs like me throwing garbage into your yard and telling you to pay to clean it up - even if it means you canât pay your mortgage, you canât buy food. You canât do anything because you have to spend all your money on the garbage I threw into your yard."" Mia Mottley, Prime Minister of Barbados BBC Media Action Todayâs theme at the UN climate conference is adaptation,
loss and damage. The BBCâs international charity has been speakingwith people around the world about how they
are being impacted by prolonged droughts, flooding, extreme heat and
other changing weather patterns. In Kenya, Esther Elaar is pregnant and walks over two hours a day
to the closest source of water and then carries the full 20 litre can
back. The region hasnât seen rain in months, and water points are shallow and
contaminated. âWhen I get back from fetching water, my legs and back ache,â Esther says. âWhen I carry heavy loads, I feel the baby move and that gets me concerned. There is nothing I can do about it because I need the water.â In Nepal, Angyel
Jung Bista says they cannot build mud houses in his Himalayan region of
Mustang any more, because of more frequent rains. The changing rain patterns
are also affecting the 82-year-old's apple crop â once plentiful, it is now plagued with
insects that are decimating the apples. And more frequent landslides are
polluting water sources, causing more diarrhoeal diseases.  Angyel Jung Bista with his wife Chhutu Gurung âAt times I get so frustrated that I want to run a bulldozer through my apple orchard,â he said. âI wonder how miserable the lives of our children will be in the future. I wonder what kinds of diseases the new generation will have to deal with. Iâm staring at a very bleak future.â Peter BettsFormer lead climate negotiator for the UK and the EU Ever wondered what negotiations actually look like behind closed doors at COPs? How late do
they go and how heated can things get? In big, formal settings with 196 countries
represented, it's very hard to negotiate and move forward. When you move to
more informal settings, maybe even over dinner, you can explore what people
really care about - what is a negotiating position and where compromises might
lie. Sometimes it can get a bit heated as people look to create a bit of
theatre. But, on the whole, it's quite respectful as trust and understanding
is built up. It's pretty rare for it to explode into shouting. During the first week of COP26, we told you howa strike by refuse staff and street cleanershad seen rubbish pile up on the streets in Glasgow. Now it appears the dispute could be brought to an end after further talks were held between council and union leaders over the weekend. The workers have been on strike for just over a week in a row over pay and conditions. The GMB union says it hopes a new dealbeing put to members will end the action. Peter BettsFormer lead climate negotiator for the UK and the EU This COP was billed by US climate envoy John Kerry as the ""last best hope for the world to get its act together"". So, has it? We
were never going to solve the climate change issue in a single meeting. We aren't on track to meet the 1.5C target and we were never going to get there in
this meeting. But we have made progress - although, again, just not enough. We
need to move faster. Fundamentally this isn't about process, but about
political will. Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent While
COP26 negotiators wrestle with a long list of knotty issues, their difficulties
have been overshadowed by the box office power of former US President
Barack Obama. In
a powerful address, Obama criticised the absence of the leaders of China and
Russia as showing a âdangerous lack of urgencyâ on the issue of climate change. He
outlined the scale of the challenge ahead, saying the world was ânowhere near
where it needs to be,â and he scolded countries who had made pledges in Paris
but failed to carry them out. The
bulk of his remarks were dedicated to young people, to motivating them to
channel their anger and frustration with the lack of progress into action. Perhaps
a little unsure of his location, Obama referred to the âemerald isles,â and
quoted Shakespeare. As
well as speaking, Obama is also set to hold a number of meetings in Glasgow,
including with members of the so-called ""high ambition coalition""- which includes island states, the EU and the US. This
grouping was key to achieving the Paris agreement six years ago in the French
capital. Getting
this coalition back together could be critical to landing a deal here in
Glasgow. Despite
the warm welcome for the former president, a small group of young activists
was due to stage a demonstration, complaining that the US hadn't delivered its
share of the $100bn dollars long promised to poorer nations. It's
a clear reminder that Glasgow will fail, unless there's significant progress on
the difficult issue of climate cash. Peter BettsFormer lead climate negotiator for the UK and the EU Peter Betts, a former lead climate negotiator for the UK and the EU, has been answering some of your questions about climate change today. We'll return to some of those now the speech from Barack Obama has come to an end. To what extent can the UK secure climate goals from
other countries, asks Frankie, 46, from Oxford. The
UK can't push countries around. We rely on countries' willingness to contribute
to solving global problems - and peer pressure. There are in every country people
who want to act and those who don't. What you have to do is find arguments that
resonate in each countryâs debate. You can also give countries help with, for
example, technical support on renewable energy which will help them attract the
investment needed to implement change. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"Barack Obama has called on young people to ""stay angry"" in the fight against climate change at the COP26 summit. The former US president urged them to apply political pressure to make a change, but warned they would need to accept compromises along the way. Mr Obama said the world is ""nowhere near where we need to be"" to avoid a future climate catastrophe. He criticised Donald Trump's ""active hostility toward climate science"", but said the US is ready to lead again. Mr Obama also scolded China and Russia's leaders for not physically attending the COP26 summit. REALITY CHECK:Did Obama meet climate targets he set? Speaking in Glasgow, Mr Obama received rapturous applause when he took to the stage and a standing ovation at the end of his speech - but there was pushback from activists. He called out nations for failing to meet the pledges they made inthe 2015 Paris Agreement, when he was in the White House. However, activists were quick to point out those broken by his own administration, includingthe failure of a key promise by developed countriesto deliver $100bn (Â£73bn) a year in climate finance to poorer nations.

Perhaps a little unsure of his location in Scotland, Obama referred to being in the ""Emerald Isles"", seemingly a mistaken reference to Ireland, which is known poetically as the Emerald Isle. He also quoted Shakespeare, who was English. He admitted there is still a lot of hard and messy work to do to reduce the effects of climate change, but said some promising progress had been made in the six years since the signing of the Paris Agreement, which he helped spearhead. Mr Obama dedicated much of his speech to young activists, who he said were ""right to be frustrated"". Addressing young people directly, he said they ""can't ignore politics"" and that while protesting and hashtags raise awareness, they should get involved in politics at some level. ""You don't have to be happy about it, but you can't ignore it. You can't be too pure for [politics]."" Referencing his own daughters' shopping habits, he also called on young people to support businesses that were committed to sustainability, and boycott those that were not. Obama's catchphrase of the night was telling young activists to ""stay angry"". ""To all the young people out there - I want you to stay angry. I want you to stay frustrated,"" he said. ""But channel that anger. Harness that frustration. Keep pushing harder and harder for more and more. Because that's what's required to meet that challenge. Gird yourself for a marathon, not a sprint."" This video can not be played Obama on the Paris agreement: ""We are nowhere near where we need to be yet"" He honoured the dedication of activists such as Greta Thunberg who are ""forming movements across borders"", and urged young people to at least get out and vote for politicians who will stand against climate change. ""Vote like your life depends on it, because it does"", he said. The former president insisted that despite political divisions in the US and the country's absence from global climate efforts for four years during the Trump administration, America was now back on track and committed to change. Mr Obama made a number of comments about his predecessor, Republican Donald Trump, who once called climate change ""an expensive hoax"" and controversially pulled out of the Paris climate accord when he took office. The US rejoined it under Joe Biden. What does Trump actually believe on climate change? Mr Obama reserved some of his strongest criticism for the Republican Party. He accused its members of stalling progress by ""sitting on the sidelines"" and making climate change a partisan issue with ""four years of active hostility toward climate science"". He said Republicans who take climate change seriously are ""a rare breed right now."" This is the first year a delegation of Republicans has attended a UN climate summit. Mr Obama also blamed the pandemic, rise of US nationalism and a lack of cooperation from the Trump administration for a breakdown in international relations that has affected the climate crisis. ANALYSIS:COP26: Time to sober up VOICES:How the world is reacting to COP26 LIFE AT 50C:Life where it's too hot to work, too hot to sleep Taking a swipe at Russia and China, Mr Obama also said it was ""particularly discouraging"" that the leaders of ""two of the world's largest emitters"" had not attended the climate summit in person. While more than 120 leaders turned up at the conference, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, who have both avoided international travel since the start of the pandemic, opted to take part remotely instead. Mr Obama said they were showing a ""dangerous lack of urgency"". The 44th US president closed by telling the crowd that fighting climate change will be hard and messy with ""every victory incomplete"". ""The thing we have going for us is that humanity has done hard things before,"" he said, adding: ""I believe we can do hard things again."" Barack Obama's speech to COP26 was a study in hope and doubt. He touted the work his administration and that of Joe Biden have accomplished in addressing climate change, while acknowledging he wasn't ""real happy"" about what the Trump administration had done in the intervening four years. He lamented the fierce opposition Republicans have mounted toward addressing climate change in the US and the rise of tribalism and nationalism around the world, but pointed to efforts by states, local governments and private citizens to fill the policy void. He heralded the international co-operation evident during the Paris climate negotiations and in Glasgow over the past week, but said much more needs to be done. He even acknowledged that he doesn't have all the answers and at times gets discouraged, but he said the energy and efforts of young people give him faith in the future. It was a delicate balance for a former president who made ""hope and change"" his trademark line. But the rhetoric was reflective of the tenuous nature of current US climate polices, which are dependent on Democratic majorities that could vanish in coming elections even though, Mr Obama said, there is still much work left to do.

"This video can not be played Hormone replacement therapy: NI shortage ""distressing"" for women The shortage of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in Northern Ireland is distressing for women and challenging for pharmacies trying to access it, according to a community pharmacist. Loretto McManus advised women to leave plenty of time for ordering their prescriptions. The Health and Social Care Board said there were ""some treatments which are currently experiencing supply issues"". HRT helps many women control their often difficult menopausal symptoms. There is a national shortage of HRT with officials citing several reasons including manufacturing delays, an increase in demand and possibly Brexit. Loretto McManus said the HRT shortage is challenging for pharmacies trying to access it Ms McManus said certain products were out of stock in pharmacies across Northern Ireland and that this was ""distressing"" for women who have become used to particular treatments. ""As a community pharmacist the utmost care of our patients is premium to us,"" she said. ""Trying to source the prescribed product in a timely manner for the patient can be challenging. ""Sometimes that product won't be available and unfortunately this is not in the control of the community pharmacy. It can be a manufacturing problem, so we have to keep our communication channels open with a GP and liaise with them."" Several women have told BBC News NI that they were being offered substitutes or had to source the medication themselves. Kathryn Schreuder said she had to source her treatment as her pharmacy could not. Ms Schreuder is part of a Northern Ireland menopause support group and said a growing number of women were experiencing problems. Kathryn Schreuder is part of a NI Menopause Support group and said a growing number of women are experiencing problems ""We had one lady who had to ring round dozens of pharmacies in Northern Ireland and ended up travelling from Belfast to Crossgar to access one bottle,"" she said. ""For a lot of women, their concern is, if their medication isn't available and they have just maybe spent six months to a year getting the right level of what they need, for that suddenly to be changed because of the limitation of what is available is very distressing."" Byddi Lee is 51 and is also on HRT. At present she has enough to last her a couple of weeks. Ms Lee was contacted by her pharmacist a fortnight ago to alert her to supply issues with her medication. She said her tailored treatment, which took a few attempts to get right, got rid of chronic migraines and joint pain. Ms Lee said this medication was ""essential"" and that she was afraid she might have to try alternatives which might mean a return of her symptoms. The shortage of certain treatments, mainly Estrogel, has been felt since 2019 but has become a lot more acute. More women are being treated for menopausal symptoms in Northern Ireland, increasing demand for supplies. It is a similar picture across the UK. Over the past 12 months, a national campaign by a number of high profile women to try and debunk the myth around the menopause has led to thousands more women seeking help. Speaking up to end the stigma around menopause Employers urged to review menopause procedures Ms McManus said she encouraged women that were being prescribed HRT to think about ordering their prescriptions one or two weeks in advance to allow for any supply issues to be ironed out with GPs. ""Obviously there is an element of distress because if you have a lady who has been stabilised on a particular product and it suddenly becomes unavailable, I mean her immediate reaction is 'oh I can't be without this product, I don't know how my life is going to change now, everything has just been so wonderful since I've been taking this.'"" ""Where am I going to go now? These are all the questions we deal with and we do try and support this lady."" The Health and Social Care Board said there were a small number of HRT medicines which were in short supply. When offering women different medication, prescribers are advised to check the British Menopause Society website for suitable substitutes and equivalent doses. Reports ofshortage of  HRT drugs have been reported across the UK since 2019. In August 2019 The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), the British Menopause Society (BMS) and the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) issued a joint statement on this matter calling on the Department of Health and Social Care to work with manufacturers to understand and limit the impact of these shortages. It was mostly understood the shortage was driven by higher global demand and manufacturing issues. The pandemic has exacerbated it. In February 2020 in response to a written PQ the Department of Health stated: ""We are aware of ongoing supply issues with some hormone replacement therapy (HRT) products due to a range of issues including manufacturing issues, regulatory issues and problems accessing the raw pharmaceutical ingredient. ""This is alongside commercial decisions made by some companies to divest these products.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson on MP's standards: ""We take all this very seriously"" The government will make ""every effort"" to get standards rules for MPs ""right"", Boris Johnson has said following the row over former Tory MP Owen Paterson. Government-backed plans to review the system after Mr Paterson was found to have broken lobbying rules were withdrawn following a fierce backlash. The PM's remarks came ahead of a Commons debate where MPs are discussing how their conduct is investigated. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle warned the debate would be ""painful"". However, he said it was important for Parliament to ""cleanse"" adding: ""What I don't want is another dark week like last week."" The emergency debate, which began at 1600 GMT, was granted after a request by the Liberal Democrats who are calling for an independent inquiry into ""Tory sleaze"". PM's actions over Paterson corrupt - Starmer The investigations into Boris Johnson and the government Mr Paterson has now quit Parliament and stepped back from his consultancy work, for which he was earning Â£100,000 a year on top of his MP's salary. He has denied breaching Commons lobbying rules, and said the process for investigating him was unfair. Ministers continue to face criticism for their botched attempt last week to block Mr Paterson's suspension from Parliament and redraw MPs' conduct rules. In his first public comments since Mr Paterson stepped down, Mr Johnson did not apologise for ordering his MPs to block his suspension, insisting the government had been trying to reform MPs' standards system. ""I think it is very important that we get this right... we are going to hold MPs to account. MPs should not break the rules."" Speaking to reporters, he added he hoped Sir Lindsay would help set up talks between the parties on improving the process. However, making a statement ahead of the debate, Sir Lindsay did not announce his own review. Instead he noted that the Committee on Standards were close to completing their own report into the process and that once it was finished ""there may be some way, working with the committee, to build on its work"". Labour MP Chris Bryant, who chairs the committee, told the Today programme they hoped to publish draft recommendations before Christmas. During the debate Cabinet Office Minister Stephen Barclay expressed ""regret"" for the government's actions, calling last week's vote a ""mistake"". However, despite calls from some MPs, Mr Barclay said the government would not hold a second vote on the suspension of Mr Paterson, arguing that the questions was not applicable given his resignation. This video can not be played Conservative MP Richard Graham questioned on why he voted to pause Owen Paterson's suspension Mr Paterson's resignation came after the government blocked a proposal to suspend him for 30 days and review the whole investigation system, before backtracking after an outcry from opposition parties and some Tories. The sanction was recommended by the Commons Standards Committee following areport by Parliament's standards commissioner,externalKathryn Stone that found he had repeatedly breached Commons rules banning ""paid advocacy"". This rule prevents MPs from lobbying for companies - although critics of the system point out there is no general ban on MPs taking jobs as consultants or advisers from firms hoping to influence the lawmaking process. Do Tory backbenchers show publicly the anger many have felt privately after they were forced against their better judgement to vote on Owen Paterson's case and changes to the rules, before the government abandoned the attempt anyway? Do supporters of Owen Paterson and critics of the parliamentary standards commissioner take the opportunity to criticise her publicly? The prime minister will not be taking part - with Downing Street saying he has a ""long standing commitment"" to visit a hospital. Instead, Cabinet Office Minister Stephen Barclay has been sent out in the opposition-inspired debate. However, there won't be a vote on any change to the rules - so the debate might have few practical consequences. The row has led to some calling for a ban on MPs simultaneously working as consultants. Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether the rules governing MPs' consultancy jobs should be re-examined, International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan replied: ""Personally I think we should look at that. I'm very comfortable with looking at that. ""I have no problem with that at all. Personally I think it would be wise,"" she added. However, she said she did not favour a blanket ban on second jobs, because Parliament would ""lose hugely"" if MPs were prevented from taking roles such as being a doctor or nurse. Paterson row: How did PM score spectacular own goal? What does 'sleaze' mean when politicians use it? And backbench MP and Tory party deputy chairman Justin Tomlinson said there should be ""greater transparency"" and ""stricter rules"" for MPs to restore trust in Parliament. Speaking to BBC Radio Wiltshire, he added: ""I think the majority of MPs have woken up to this, and we will see cross-party consensus on making sure that we strengthen standards."" At the last election, Labourproposed banning,externalMPs from taking paid second jobs, with ""limited exemptions to maintain professional registrations like nursing"". The Committee on Standards on Public Life - an advisory body set up in 1994 after the ""cash-for-questions"" scandal - has also previously recommended a ban on MPs working as consultants and paid political advisers. Owen Paterson watched on in the Commons as MPs debated whether to suspend him Owen Paterson had been a paid consultant for clinical diagnostics company Randox since 2015 and to meat distributor Lynn's Country Foods since 2016, earning a total of Â£100,000 a year on top of his MP's salary. MPs are allowed to have these jobs, but are not allowed to be paid advocates - using their influence in Whitehall for the company's gain. The committee concluded,externalthat Mr Paterson had breached this rule on paid advocacy by: Making three approaches to the Food Standards Agency relating to Randox and the testing of antibiotics in milk Making seven approaches to the Food Standards Agency relating to Lynn's Country Foods Making four approaches to ministers at the Department for International Development relating to Randox and blood testing technology. Mr Paterson was also found to have broken conduct rules by: Failing to declare his interest as a paid consultant to Lynn's Country Foods in four emails to officials at the Food Standards Agency Using his parliamentary office on 16 occasions for business meetings with his clients And in sending two letters relating to his business interests, on House of Commons headed notepaper.

"Poor countries say climate change is affecting communities with such intensity that they can no longer adapt, but instead need financial support Vulnerable countries at COP26 say rich nations are pushing back against their attempts to secure compensation for the damage caused by climate change. Poorer countries see it as critical that money for loss and damage be part of negotiations this week. Negotiators agreed in Paris in 2015 to address the issue, but there is no agreement on who should pay for it. Rich nations are said to be resisting any commitments as they do not want to accept liability and risk being sued.

""During negotiations, we have been repeatedly arguing that loss and damage needs to be mentioned in a separate column in the climate finance reporting papers of developed countries, because such losses and damages are happening all over the world,"" Mr Kaloga said.

"This video can not be played Watch: Video shows hundreds of migrants at Belarus' border with Poland Poland says it has repelled attempts by migrants to enter the country at its eastern border with Belarus, warning that thousands more were on the way. Video footage showed hundreds of people near a barbed-wire border fence, which some tried to force their way through. The Polish government called a crisis meeting on Monday and deployed 12,000 troops to the region. Poland has accused Belarus of pushing the migrants towards the border, describing it as hostile activity. Poland, Lithuania and Latvia say there's been a surge in the number of people trying to enter their countries illegally from Belarus in recent months. Many of them have come from the Middle East and Asia. The European Union has accused Belarus's authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko of facilitating the influx in retaliation against sanctions. Many migrants have been trapped on the border between Poland and Belarus Poland, which has been criticised for pushing back migrants and refugees at its border, has responded to the large number of people arriving there by building a razor-wire fence. The Polish Border Guard also said it was closing its border crossing with Belarus at Kuznica from Tuesday morning. Conditions for migrants on the border are hostile to the point of being deadly, and fears have been raised for their safety in the region's sub-zero winter. As they are summarily expelled from Poland and Belarus refuses to allow them back in, people are finding themselves stranded and freezing in Poland's forests. Several have died of hypothermia. Polish troops and border guards with shields stopped migrants from crossing into the country The BBC's Paul Adams spoke to Barwa Nusreddine Ahmed, the brother of one Iraqi migrant who was at the border with his wife and three children. They arrived in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, last month. With little to eat or drink, the people stuck at the border were suffering, Mr Ahmed said. He said Monday's move to the border post was planned on social media by the migrants themselves, but suggested Belarus was pushing them. ""People know they're being used [by Mr Lukashenko], but they have no future,"" Mr Ahmed said. READ MORE:How Belarus is helping âtouristsâ break into the EU On Monday, the Nato alliance said it was worried about ""escalation"" on the border with Poland and was ready to ""maintain safety and security in the region"". Meanwhile in Lithuania, the government there moved troops to its border with Belarus to prepare for a possible influx of migrants and was considering declaring a state of emergency. Analysis by Paul Adams, diplomatic correspondent This is a significant escalation in a crisis that's been rumbling since the middle of the year. For months, Belarus' EU neighbours have been accusing the Lukashenko regime of ""weaponising"" migration, in revenge for successive waves of EU sanctions on Minsk. Migrants have told us numerous stories of the role played by Belarussian soldiers in helping them to make illegal crossings into Poland and Lithuania. Some cross in small groups, while others have spoken of being transported to the border in military trucks and shown where to go. But the latest pictures from the Polish border are unprecedented, recalling scenes from the Greek-Macedonian border at the height of the 2015-16 migrant crisis. The sheer concentration of numbers at a single crossing point, along with the presence of Belarussian soldiers, apparently doing nothing to stem the flow of migrants to the border, suggest that once again, this is being orchestrated. It's a charge Belarus denies. Tensions intensified on Monday when videos posted on social media showed a column of people, including women and children, walking towards the Polish border in Belarus. Other videos showed large numbers of migrants being escorted by armed men dressed in khaki. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson on MP's standards: ""We take all this very seriously"" The government will make ""every effort"" to get standards rules for MPs ""right"", Boris Johnson has said following the row over former Tory MP Owen Paterson. Government-backed plans to review the system after Mr Paterson was found to have broken lobbying rules were withdrawn following a fierce backlash. The PM's remarks came ahead of a Commons debate where MPs are discussing how their conduct is investigated. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle warned the debate would be ""painful"". However, he said it was important for Parliament to ""cleanse"" adding: ""What I don't want is another dark week like last week."" The emergency debate, which began at 1600 GMT, was granted after a request by the Liberal Democrats who are calling for an independent inquiry into ""Tory sleaze"". PM's actions over Paterson corrupt - Starmer The investigations into Boris Johnson and the government Mr Paterson has now quit Parliament and stepped back from his consultancy work, for which he was earning Â£100,000 a year on top of his MP's salary. He has denied breaching Commons lobbying rules, and said the process for investigating him was unfair. Ministers continue to face criticism for their botched attempt last week to block Mr Paterson's suspension from Parliament and redraw MPs' conduct rules. In his first public comments since Mr Paterson stepped down, Mr Johnson did not apologise for ordering his MPs to block his suspension, insisting the government had been trying to reform MPs' standards system. ""I think it is very important that we get this right... we are going to hold MPs to account. MPs should not break the rules."" Speaking to reporters, he added he hoped Sir Lindsay would help set up talks between the parties on improving the process. However, making a statement ahead of the debate, Sir Lindsay did not announce his own review. Instead he noted that the Committee on Standards were close to completing their own report into the process and that once it was finished ""there may be some way, working with the committee, to build on its work"". Labour MP Chris Bryant, who chairs the committee, told the Today programme they hoped to publish draft recommendations before Christmas. During the debate Cabinet Office Minister Stephen Barclay expressed ""regret"" for the government's actions, calling last week's vote a ""mistake"". However, despite calls from some MPs, Mr Barclay said the government would not hold a second vote on the suspension of Mr Paterson, arguing that the questions was not applicable given his resignation. This video can not be played Conservative MP Richard Graham questioned on why he voted to pause Owen Paterson's suspension Mr Paterson's resignation came after the government blocked a proposal to suspend him for 30 days and review the whole investigation system, before backtracking after an outcry from opposition parties and some Tories. The sanction was recommended by the Commons Standards Committee following areport by Parliament's standards commissioner,externalKathryn Stone that found he had repeatedly breached Commons rules banning ""paid advocacy"". This rule prevents MPs from lobbying for companies - although critics of the system point out there is no general ban on MPs taking jobs as consultants or advisers from firms hoping to influence the lawmaking process. Do Tory backbenchers show publicly the anger many have felt privately after they were forced against their better judgement to vote on Owen Paterson's case and changes to the rules, before the government abandoned the attempt anyway? Do supporters of Owen Paterson and critics of the parliamentary standards commissioner take the opportunity to criticise her publicly? The prime minister will not be taking part - with Downing Street saying he has a ""long standing commitment"" to visit a hospital. Instead, Cabinet Office Minister Stephen Barclay has been sent out in the opposition-inspired debate. However, there won't be a vote on any change to the rules - so the debate might have few practical consequences. The row has led to some calling for a ban on MPs simultaneously working as consultants. Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether the rules governing MPs' consultancy jobs should be re-examined, International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan replied: ""Personally I think we should look at that. I'm very comfortable with looking at that. ""I have no problem with that at all. Personally I think it would be wise,"" she added. However, she said she did not favour a blanket ban on second jobs, because Parliament would ""lose hugely"" if MPs were prevented from taking roles such as being a doctor or nurse. Paterson row: How did PM score spectacular own goal? What does 'sleaze' mean when politicians use it? And backbench MP and Tory party deputy chairman Justin Tomlinson said there should be ""greater transparency"" and ""stricter rules"" for MPs to restore trust in Parliament. Speaking to BBC Radio Wiltshire, he added: ""I think the majority of MPs have woken up to this, and we will see cross-party consensus on making sure that we strengthen standards."" At the last election, Labourproposed banning,externalMPs from taking paid second jobs, with ""limited exemptions to maintain professional registrations like nursing"". The Committee on Standards on Public Life - an advisory body set up in 1994 after the ""cash-for-questions"" scandal - has also previously recommended a ban on MPs working as consultants and paid political advisers. Owen Paterson watched on in the Commons as MPs debated whether to suspend him Owen Paterson had been a paid consultant for clinical diagnostics company Randox since 2015 and to meat distributor Lynn's Country Foods since 2016, earning a total of Â£100,000 a year on top of his MP's salary. MPs are allowed to have these jobs, but are not allowed to be paid advocates - using their influence in Whitehall for the company's gain. The committee concluded,externalthat Mr Paterson had breached this rule on paid advocacy by: Making three approaches to the Food Standards Agency relating to Randox and the testing of antibiotics in milk Making seven approaches to the Food Standards Agency relating to Lynn's Country Foods Making four approaches to ministers at the Department for International Development relating to Randox and blood testing technology. Mr Paterson was also found to have broken conduct rules by: Failing to declare his interest as a paid consultant to Lynn's Country Foods in four emails to officials at the Food Standards Agency Using his parliamentary office on 16 occasions for business meetings with his clients And in sending two letters relating to his business interests, on House of Commons headed notepaper.

Aslef said its members would take action if changes were forced through without negotiation. It said Transport for London (TfL) and the government wanted to plug the funding gap caused by the pandemic by ""slashing staff pensions and tearing up our agreed working conditions"".

"Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says EU proposals to address protocol problems do not go far enough Democratic Unionist party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said little progress appears to have been made in talks between the UK government and EU on the Northern Ireland Protocol. He was speaking after meeting Brexit Minister Lord Frost on Monday. The Northern Ireland Protocol is the Brexit trade deal aimed at avoiding a hard Irish border. Sir Jeffrey said the update from Lord Frost revealed that ""significant gaps"" on the issue are yet to be resolved. ""I have again reiterated that Northern Ireland's place in the UK internal market must be restored and we cannot continue to be subject to laws in Northern Ireland upon which we have no say or input,"" he said. Why Brexit still has a Northern Ireland problem ""Decisions will very soon need to be taken on whether they can in fact be concluded successfully. ""In the absence of agreement, the UK government must follow through on the commitments made in their command paper. ""The protocol continues to damage our economy and the political institutions in Northern Ireland and the status quo is not an option."" The command paper seeks a renegotiation of the protocol rather than merely tweaking its operation. Separately, the leader of the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) Billy Hutchinson has called for ""corrective action"" to restore Northern Ireland's constitutional position within the UK. He said the ""constitutional guarantee"" inthe Good Friday Agreementwas ""not as was promised to the unionist community"" and he called for a ""rebalancing"" of how the 1998 peace deal was being implemented in relation to the Northern Ireland Protocol. The remarks by unionist leaders come after a weekend of high-profile criticism of the UK government's position on the protocol from both within the UK and the EU. The protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, unlike the rest of the UK, and led to new checks on goods arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Supporters argue it has created new opportunities for Northern Ireland businesses but opponents say it undermines the union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and disrupts supply chains. The Northern Ireland Protocol was negotiated between the EU and the UK government in late 2019. But the UK government now wants significant reform of the agreement. Lord Frost, who helped to negotiate the protocol, argues that the arrangement is now harming the peace process in Northern Ireland. Lord Frost has called for fundamental reform of the deal he helped to negotiate two years ago Last month, theEU offered new proposals to resolved the long-running dispute, which it said would cut the number of spot checks on goods by about 80%. It also offered to change to laws to ensure no disruption to moving medicines across the Irish Sea. However, the UK said more fundamental change was required, including removing the European Court of Justice from an oversight role. Article 16 exists to fix difficulties with the Northern Ireland Protocol that are causing serious problems or causing diversion of trade. The UK government says that threshold was reached long ago and so it can be used legitimately. But the EU fears the UK is planning to use Article 16 in an expansive way - to gut the protocol, sweep away the Irish Sea border and open up a potential back door into the single market. The EU may argue that the broader Brexit trade deal only happened because the issue of the Irish border had been sorted out first. Therefore if the UK collapses that border solution the EU may give notice that it intends to collapse the trade deal. Last week Belgium's Deputy Prime Minister Vincent Van Peteghem suggested that is figuring in the EU's thinking andSimon Coveney alluded to it again on Sunday. Read more:What is Article 16 and why does it matter? The DUP leader has previously suggested thathis party may quit its role in Northern Ireland's devolved governmentif its demands over the protocol are not met. At Stormont on Monday, the leader of the SDLP called on Lord Frost and the DUP to ""think very carefully"" about the language used in relation to the protocol. Colum Eastwood said they were ""creating more and more instability on the streets of Northern Ireland"". ""We should take away the threat to these institutions, we should take away the pretence that there's some big battle around the protocol when it's absolutely clear to anybody that the European Union have offered the people of Northern Ireland everything that they asked for,"" he said. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin told Irish national broadcaster RTÃ that ""nothing is certain"" in relation to the UK's threat to trigger Article 16 but he repeated his view thatsuch a move would be ""reckless and irresponsible"",external. At the weekend, former Prime Minister Sir John Major was among those who criticised the UK government's stance on the protocol, and saidtriggering Article 16 would be absurd and ""colossally stupid"". European Commission Vice-PresidentMaros Sefcovic warned it would lead to ""instability and unpredictability"" for Northern Irelandand Irish Foreign MinisterSimon Coveney hinted the EU could terminate its post-Brexit Trade and Cooperation Agreementin response. In a weekend statement, the UK government said it would prefer to ""settle the issues arising from the operation of the Northern Ireland Protocol consensually"". However, it said its responsibility was ""to safeguard peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland, and we will use Article 16 if necessary"". Billy Hutchinson says the Belfast Agreement as currently implemented is not the deal he signed up to in 1998 Meanwhile, Mr Hutchinson of the PUP described the protocol as a ""real and present threat"" to the substance of the union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. In adetailed statement posted to the PUP's website,external, Mr Hutchinson said a recent legal challenge to the protocol had ""exposed the principle of consent to be little more than a deceptive snare"". Mr Hutchinson was part of the loyalist negotiating team for the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. His party's statement said its support for that deal was ""rooted in the purported guarantee provided by the principle of consent"". ""We urged support for the agreement on the basis that the union was safe, so long as a majority of persons living here wished it to be so,"" he said. ""If, as is currently the case, the constitutional guarantee is not as was promised to the unionist community, then there is no basis for unionist support for the Belfast Agreement."" However, Mr Hutchinson told the BBC's Talkback programme the PUP was not withdrawing its support for the deal signed in 1998 but rather campaigning for changes to how that deal was being implemented in relation to the protocol.

"The UK's biggest fishing shop has been hacked, with its website redirecting keen anglers to an adult website. Angling Direct, which sells fishing gear online and through stores, said it was hit by the attack late on Friday. On top of the website redirect, its Twitter account has been compromised to also reference a porn site and to post contact details for the attacker. The company said it has brought in cyber-security experts to tackle the problem, and alerted authorities. On Angling Direct's own Twitter account, the attacker posted a mocking tweet claiming the company had been sold to adult website Pornhub. ""Your data has already been transferred"" to the adult video empire, it told fishing enthusiasts, apparently trolling them. But Angling Direct said it is not clear if any personal data has been compromised - and that no payment data could be. The attacker also posted an email address where they could be reached, along with an offer to return ""information and access"" to the site. No public demands for ransom were made. Fishing (or phishing) puns aside, this case will send shivers down the spines of company bosses. Yes, this attack carries all the hallmarks of an immature teenage hacker having fun but it is no doubt causing serious problems for the victim. Experts tell me that signs point to employee login credentials having been stolen, allowing the hackers to take over the website and, separately, the Twitter account of the company. The motive is clear - the hackers want to be paid before they hand back control to the firm. But in the meantime the company is losing money from potential sales - not to mention trust and reputational damage, as customers are left embarrassed or worse when accidentally visiting an explicit site. In a statement, the company said: ""We are mindful of our obligations regarding data; it is too soon yet to make any determination around the impact this incident has had on personal data."" ""Importantly, the company does not hold any customer financial data, as our website transactions are handled by third parties."" Angling Direct's several dozen physical shops remain open for in-store purchases, according to a post by one of the locations on Facebook. The firm has also posted messages to the Facebook page of at least one local store, apologising to anyone who was ""directed away from our site and towards inappropriate content"".

In a weekend statement, the UK government said it would prefer to ""settle the issues arising from the operation of the Northern Ireland Protocol consensually"". However, it said its responsibility was ""to safeguard peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland, and we will use Article 16 if necessary"". Billy Hutchinson says the Belfast Agreement as currently implemented is not the deal he signed up to in 1998 Meanwhile, Mr Hutchinson of the PUP described the protocol as a ""real and present threat"" to the substance of the union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. In adetailed statement posted to the PUP's website,external, Mr Hutchinson said a recent legal challenge to the protocol had ""exposed the principle of consent to be little more than a deceptive snare"". Mr Hutchinson was part of the loyalist negotiating team for the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. His party's statement said its support for that deal was ""rooted in the purported guarantee provided by the principle of consent"". ""We urged support for the agreement on the basis that the union was safe, so long as a majority of persons living here wished it to be so,"" he said. ""If, as is currently the case, the constitutional guarantee is not as was promised to the unionist community, then there is no basis for unionist support for the Belfast Agreement."" However, Mr Hutchinson told the BBC's Talkback programme the PUP was not withdrawing its support for the deal signed in 1998 but rather campaigning for changes to how that deal was being implemented in relation to the protocol.

"This video can not be played ""We're so happy"": Hear from some of the first UK travellers to fly to the US from London Heathrow UK visitors are now able to travel to the US for the first time in nearly two years. The border reopened at 05:01 GMT and the first flights took off from Heathrow at 08:51. All UK visitors over 18 have to provide proof of vaccination to enter the US. American travellers have been able to travel to the UK since 28 July. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has called this a ""significant moment"" for UK-US travel. Transatlantic flights, he added, are ""at the heart of UK aviation"". In addition to the UK, the travel ban is being lifted for people from Brazil, China, India, Ireland, South Africa, Iran and the Schengen countries - a group of 26 European nations. What are the rules for travelling to the US now? New York gears up for tourists' return Until Monday, only US citizens, residents and a small selection of other exempt groups have been allowed entry to the US from the UK. The new rules apply to all individuals that have received vaccines approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and vaccines Listed for Emergency Use (EUL) by the World Health Organization. The White House's assistant press secretary, Kevin Munoz, confirmed on 15 October that double vaccinated foreign nationals would be able to visit the US from 8 November. Allow Twitter content?

The UK has been on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s highest risk category for Covid, level 4 or ""very high"" since 19 July. TheCDC,externalsaid that vaccines approved by the US FDA and WHO's EUL vaccines will be accepted. Therefore, travellers that have received one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine or two doses of the following vaccines will be allowed to enter the US: Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna AstraZeneca Covaxin Covishield BIBP/Sinopharm Sinovac Travellers must provide proof of vaccination via their vaccine passport. Certificates including the NHS Covid Pass are accepted. As well as being double vaccinated, travellers will have to provide proof of either a negative Covid test result,external- taken no more than three days before travelling - or show that they have recovered from the virus in the previous three months. Children are exempt from the vaccination requirement, but all those aged between two and 17 will have to take a Covid-19 test three to five days after arrival. Fully jabbed American visitors travelling to the UK need to take a test on or before the second day of their arrival. Most of the UK's population has received both doses of the Covid vaccine,but the global picture is quite different. After a difficult 21 months, airlines have increased UK-US flight schedules to meet the higher demand. US to lift travel ban on 8 November To celebrate the end of the travel ban, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic had a synchronised departure at 08:51 GMT from London Heathrow. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, BA chief executive, Sean Doyle said: ""We must now look forward with optimism, get trade and tourism back on track and allow friends and families to connect once again."" According to travel data firm Cirium, 3,688 flights are scheduled to operate between the US and the UK in November. This is an increase in 21% on October. But it remains 49% down on the pre-pandemic levels of November 2019. Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta Air Lines,told BBC World Newsthat ensuring everyone has the correct documentation will make the upcoming months ""a little choppy"". He said that ""there may be some long lines"" at airports and he has asked travellers to ""have some patience"". Mr Bastian said that although the industry does not expect travellers to have problems with their documentation, they are ready for it. According to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, around 3.8 million British nationals visited the US every year prior to the pandemic. One woman who had not seen her parents, brother or sister in nearly two years as they live in California, said the ban had been a ""nightmare"" for her family. Nadine Beasley missed the weddings of both her siblings, which had been scheduled to take place at the same time so she could attend with her husband and nine-year-old daughter. ""Obviously the pandemic scuppered that,"" she told BBC Breakfast. Nadine Beasley (L) missed the weddings of both her brother and sister Unfortunately for Mrs Beasley, her brother's wedding took place in May and her sister's was just over a week before the ban was lifted. She has finally been able to book a flight to December to see them, but said the opening up of travel left her with with mixed feelings, as it felt a bit ""too late for us"". Mrs Beasley said: ""I bawled my eyes out and I think it was a mixture of elation and also frustration and honestly a bit of grief. ""Grieving the loss of knowing I've missed out on massive life events with everybody."" Before travelling, fully jabbed passengers entering the UK no longer have to take a Covid test before travelling. This applies to all individuals that have been vaccinated in the UK, the EU, the US and several other countries - Brazil, India, Pakistan and South Africa are some of thecountries included in the list,external. However, passengers have to prove they have been vaccinated before travelling. In addition to this, they have to take a lateral flow test two days after arrival in the UK.

"Elon Musk is critical of a ""billionaires tax"" being proposed by some Democrats Voters in a Twitter poll have urged Elon Musk to sell 10% of his stake in Tesla in order to pay tax. More than 3.5 million Twitter users voted in the poll, launched by Mr Musk on Saturday, with nearly 58% voting in favour of the share sale. The vote could see him dispose of nearly $21bn (Â£16bn) of stock in the electric carmaker. He has promised to abide by the result, in response to a ""billionaires tax"" proposed by US Democrats. But Mr Musk, one of the world's richest men, has yet to comment publicly on the verdict, or how and when he would sell his stake. Should he go ahead with the sale, it could leave him with a huge tax bill. When disposing of large share holdings, some chief executives use so-called ""blind"" sales programmes, spreading the sale over a long time period to avoid accusations of insider trading. In an earlier tweet on Saturday, Mr Musk said he took no salary or bonuses from any of his companies - meaning he has no earnings on which to pay income tax. But he has made billions of dollars through a compensation package, which gives him power to exercise large amounts of stock options when the company meets performance targets and its shares hit certain prices.

Mr Musk has an option, which expires in August next year, to buy 22.86 million Tesla shares at $6.24 each - a fraction of Tesla's closing share price on Friday of $1,222. Under plans proposed by the Democratic Party in the Senate, billionaires could be taxed on ""unrealised gains"" when the price of their shares goes up - even if they do not sell any of their stock. It is thought the proposed tax on capital gains, whether or not assets have been sold, could hit about 700 billionaires in the US. Critics have pointed out that the value of assets do not always go up. Elon Musk says Tesla has not signed Hertz deal US super-rich 'pay almost no income tax' Tesla surpasses a $1 trillion valuation Mr Musk's recent Twitter poll has raised some eyebrows in the world of finance. ""We are witnessing the Twitter masses deciding the outcome of a $25B coin flip,"" Venture investor Chamath Palihapitiya wrote on Twitter. ""Looking forward to the day when the richest person in the world paying some tax does not depend on a Twitter poll,"" Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman tweeted. This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk? Meet the meme-loving magnate behind SpaceX and Tesla...published in 2021 Mr Musk is one of the most popular business leaders on Twitter, with nearly 63 million followers. He regularly uses the platform to share updates from the companies he owns - including SpaceX and Neuralink. He is also known for sharing memes, adding to his popularity among fans. But some posts have drawn controversy. Earlier this year he tweeted in response to a claim, made by the head of the UN World Food Programme (WFP), that just 2% of Mr Musk's wealth could help to solve world hunger. In October, Mr Musk said he would sell $6bn in Tesla stock and donate it to the WFP, provided it could describe ""exactly how $6bn will solve world hunger"".

"There are more delegates at COP26 associated with the fossil fuel industry than from any single country, analysis shared with the BBC shows. Campaigners led by Global Witnessassessed the participant list,externalpublished by the UN at the start of this meeting. They found that 503 people with links to fossil fuel interests had been accredited for the climate summit. These delegates are said to lobby for oil and gas industries, and campaigners say they should be banned. ""The fossil fuel industry has spent decades denying and delaying real action on the climate crisis, which is why this is such a huge problem,"" says Murray Worthy from Global Witness. ""Their influence is one of the biggest reasons why 25 years of UN climate talks have not led to real cuts in global emissions."" About 40,000 people are attending the COP. Brazil has the biggest official team of negotiators according to UN data, with 479 delegates. COP26: Time to sober up What are top polluters doing to cut emissions? Life where it's too hot to work, too hot to sleep The UK, which is hosting the talk in Glasgow, has 230 registered delegates. So what counts as a fossil fuel lobbyist? Global Witness, Corporate Accountability and others who have carried out the analysis define a fossil fuel lobbyist as someone who is part of a delegation of a trade association or is a member of a group that represents the interests of oil and gas companies. Overall, they identified 503 people employed by or associated with these interests at the summit. They also found that: Fossil fuel lobbyists are members of 27 country delegations, including Canada and Russia The fossil fuel lobby at COP is larger than the combined total of the eight delegations from the countries worst affected by climate change in the past 20 years More than 100 fossil fuel companies are represented at COP, with 30 trade associations and membership organisations also present Fossil fuel lobbyists dwarf the UNFCCC's official indigenous constituency by about two to one One of the biggest groups they identified was theInternational Emissions Trading Association (IETA),externalwith 103 delegates in attendance, including three people from the oil and gas company BP. According to Global Witness, IETA is backed by many major oil companies who promote offsetting and carbon trading as a way of allowing them to continue extracting oil and gas. ""This is an association that has an enormous number of fossil fuel company as its members. Its agenda is driven by fossil fuel companies and serves the interests of fossil fuel companies,"" Mr Worthy said. Tap or click to go through the gallery  ""What we seeing is the putting forward of false solutions that appear to be climate action but actually preserve the status quo, and prevent us from taking the clear, simple actions to keep fossil fuels in the ground that we know are the real solutions to climate crisis."" The IETA says it exists to find the most efficient market-based means of driving down emissions. Members include fossil fuel companies but also a range of other businesses. ""We have law firms, we have project developers, the guys who are putting clean technology on the ground around the world, they're also members of our association as well,"" says Alessandro Vitelli, an IETA spokesman. ""We're not coming to a shuddering halt today and tomorrow, and suddenly there's going to be no emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels."" ""There is a process to transition that's under way, and carbon markets are the best way to make sure that transition takes place."" Campaign groups argue that the World Health Organization didn't get serious about banning tobacco until all the lobbyists for the industry were banned from WHO meetings. They want the same treatment for oil and gas companies at COP. ""The likes of Shell and BP are inside these talks despite openly admitting to upping their production of fossil gas,"" said Pascoe Sabido of the Corporate Europe Observatory, who were also involved in the analysis. ""If we're serious about raising ambition, then fossil fuel lobbyists should be shut out of the talks.""

"Christine McCluskey pictured around a fortnight after the physical assessment which prompted her benefits to be cut Around 100 people denied fast-tracked disability benefits for terminal illness died challenging the decision. Currently, patients can access benefits more quickly if theirclinician says they have six months or less to live.,external In July the governmentpromised to extend that to 12 months.Critics said it did not go far enough. ""Our priority is dealing with people's claims quickly and compassionately,"" the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said. End-of-life charity Marie Curie said it had ""serious concerns about the DWP's ability to recognise when a claimant was approaching the end of life and was in desperate need of support"". Dr Sam Royston, its director of policy and research, said if people died before their appeals were decided it was ""highly likely they were living with a long-term or terminal illness"". ""Many of these people should have received fast-track access to support [originally],"" he added. Patients can currently access fast-tracked benefits at a higher rate by applying under the Special Rules for Terminal Illness (SRTI). They need to submit a form signed by their clinician, saying it isprobable they will die within six months.,external The DWP said of those who applied ""the majority received the highest possible award and were paid within three days of making a claim"". But charities said the system was flawed. The Motor Neurone Disease (MND) Association said the unpredictability of the speed with which a person with MND might deteriorate, meant it was difficult for neurologists to give accurate prognoses. Susie Rabin, head of policy and campaigns at the MND Association, said that made it difficult for people to access benefits through the special rules. Dr Catherine Millington-Sanders, the clinical lead for palliative and end of life care for the Royal College of GPs, added doctors ""still faced uncertainty when determining exactly how long someone has got to live"". ""It makes little sense to have a rigidly set time cap to be a determining factor,"" she said. Payout after mum died following benefit errors Seven out of 10 win benefits challenges in court DWP sees 'sharp rise' in benefit death reviews Affected families and charities said the current process was ""overly complex and stressful"" and it remained unclear when reforms would happen. They have also called for the government to go further and scrap the requirement for people on terminal illness benefits to be reassessed every three years. Helena Reynolds has paid for her funeral up front because she did not want her family to be burdened Helena Reynolds, from Essex, who is terminally ill with intestinal failure, said the current six-month rule was ""pointless"" because ""terminal meant terminal"". ""It's like we've been forgotten. All we're asking for is a little dignity; we shouldn't have to beg for our benefits when we get ill,"" she said. Mrs Reynolds was aged 14 when she was diagnosed with Crohn's disease and had 23 operations on her abdomen before she was awarded Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for life in 1991. When Personal Independence Payment (PIP) replaced DLA in 2019, her benefits were initially cut, but later reinstated on appeal. This year, although her doctor said her condition would ""almost certainlyâ¦prove fatal at some point"", they could not say she had less than six months to live. Instead, she had to re-apply for PIP under the standard route and was given a 10-year PIP award. The longest possible award under special rules would have been for three years. Paul Alexander, policy manager at disability equality charity Scope, said: ""This is a clear example of the system being overly complex, stressful and inconsistent."" ""It doesn't make sense that someone would go from getting a 'lifetime' award, to being refused support from its successor benefit, despite being terminally ill,"" he added. Dr Royston from Marie Curie said few people awarded benefits under special rules lived beyond three years but for the small number who did it was ""inappropriate and insensitive"" they had to make a new application or risk losing support. Christine McCluskey died weighing around 3st (19kg), her daughter Michelle said Christine McCluskey, from Dundee, Scotland, had a history of illnesses including Crohn's Disease, osteoporosis, and suffering a stroke in 2005. She was told her PIP would be stopped and that DWP would try to recoup an overpayment of Employment Support Allowance after a physical assessment, which described her as having a ""slim build"" and being a ""pleasant lady to assess"". She weighed around 5st 6lbs (34.4kg) at the time and was being fed by a drip, her daughter Michelle said. Then she received a terminal lung cancer diagnosis in July 2018. She submitted a form from her doctor to the DWP about her separate terminal diagnosis but a letter came back in September 2018, a month later, to say that information - the form - required her to start a fresh claim. She died the same day aged 61. Michelle believes the application process needs to change so fast-tracked support can be paid automatically to people with a terminal diagnosis. It was ""degrading"" for a person to need to submit a form putting a time frame on their own death, she said. Michelle, who previously shared pictures of her mother with national newspapers to highlight her experience, said: ""You just have to look at her to see she wasn't well and that was before she had cancer."" In February 2019, a tribunal ruled Christine's PIP should not have been cut. The DWP paid the arrears owed. A new benefit called Adult Disability Payment was due to replace PIP in Scotland from spring 2022, which would use a clinician's prognosis of their patient rather than any time limit. Income-based benefits still administered by the DWP, such as Universal Credit, would however still use the DWP's end-of-life definition, which has led to concerns of a developing two-tier system for people applying for benefits in Scotland. Madeleine Moon, former Labour MP for Bridgend, previously sponsored aPrivate Members' Bill,externalin 2018 which proposed to remove the six-month time limit and replace it with a clinical judgment made by an appropriate health professional. Parliamentary time ran out to discuss the bill beyond its first reading in the House of Commons and then Mrs Moon lost her seat. Jessica Morden, Labour MP for Newport East, has now taken up the bill again. Mrs Moon, whose husband Steve died from motor neurone disease in 2015, said: ""The cruelty, if not the inhumanity, of the current system is shocking. This video can not be played Madeleine Moon gave an emotional speech in the House of Commons ""I'm glad the government has accepted the current rules are wrong. ""Most people in the initial shock [of receiving a terminal diagnosis] aren't thinking about benefits, they are thinking what have I got to do to live whatever time I have left. ""You need to plan for the new future and you need to stabilise the family's finances.  What you can't do is spend the time going through the long time to access PIP."" Northern Ireland's communities minister Deirdre Hargey hascommitted to bring forward legislationto widen the eligibility to people with less than a year to live, before the next assembly election is due in May 2022. In July, then-minister for disabled people Justin Tomlinson said Westminster would make the same change for Universal Credit and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) next year and Attendance Allowance, Disability Living Allowance and PIP ""when Parliamentary time allowed"". The DWP reiterated it would make those changes ""so more people could get the vital support they needed"". University of York Professor of Law Charlotte O'Brien, a specialist in welfare law, said it was a different process to change the rules for universal credit and ESA because those rules were in secondary legislation regulations, whereas DLA, PIP and Attendance Allowance were set out in the Welfare Reform Act 2012, so a new Act of Parliament could be required. ""The chances of the government proposing a bill specifically for this are quite slight, as are the chances of them having the time and the Parliamentary bandwidth,"" Prof O'Brien said.

"Artist's impression of a small nuclear power station Reactor designer Rolls-Royce will announce that a consortium of investors will back plans for a new smaller nuclear reactor project. As part of its 10 point green energy plan, the government has already announced it would provide Â£210m in funding if that could be matched by private capital. An announcement that money has been raised could come as soon as Tuesday. Around 21% of Britain's electricity supply is provided by nuclear power. Jeff Bezos-backed fusion plant to be built in UK What does net zero mean? US lab stands on threshold of key fusion goal The plan is thought to include the construction of an initial four Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) based on the technology used in nuclear powered submarines. These reactors will be capable of generating nearly 500 megawatts of power - three times as much as much as most existing nuclear submarine reactors but more than six times less than the 3.2 gigawatts that the large plant under construction at Hinkley Point will deliver. Hinkley is expected to produce enough power to supply 6 million homes. The investment to be announced on Tuesday is intended to fund the project up to the stage where the reactor design receives approval. No decision has yet been made on how the construction cost will be financed. At an expected ultimate cost of around Â£2bn each, they should cost less than a tenth of the Â£20bn each of Hinkley and an anticipated, but not yet approved, sister plant at Sizewell in Suffolk. Hinkley Point nuclear power station Industry sources say they hope that these SMRs would be operational within a decade. Advocates of SMRs say their smaller size means they can be built in a controlled factory setting and installed module by module, reducing risk and cost. These reactors are not expected to be a substitute for another large-scale nuclear plant the government has said it is determined to approve this parliament - but in addition. The planned locations of these SMRs is not expected to be confirmed this week but industry sources suggest that existing nuclear sites are the obvious candidates. What does net zero mean?

"The question of responsibility for the effects of global warming is - slowly - being tested in court. One case in Massachusetts is using consumer laws to take on oil giant ExxonMobil. If the US state wins, it will be the first case in the world to successfully prosecute a fossil fuel company for greenwashing and misleading the public. How much is the fossil fuel industry actually doing to tackle climate change? If you listen to the companies themselves, quite a lot. ExxonMobil, the American oil and gas giant, says it's committed to new energy solutions that don't contribute as much to global warming - such as fuel made from algae. The firm claims it could ""one day power planes, propel ships and fuel trucks and cut their emissions in half"". One of its adverts says: ""Every technology we're working on helps lower our carbon footprint. Because when it comes to addressing climate change, our actions make a difference."" But not everyone's buying it. ""There's this giant disconnect,"" says Naomi Oreskes, a professor at Harvard University, who's been monitoring disinformation tactics used by big businesses for years. ""The reality of their business model is to continue to exploit, develop and sell oil and gas. But their advertising, their communications, make it seem as if they're these great guys committed to sustainability and renewable energy."" ExxonMobil's investment in algae biofuels is a common theme on their YouTube channel It's what ExxonMobil's critics have described as greenwashing - pretending to be greener than you actually are. In other words, a form of alleged deception. And - partly because of that - Exxon and other oil companies are fighting various forms of legal action across the US. The state of Massachusetts is taking on Exxon in court using consumer protection laws alleging the company continues to deceive the state's consumers and investors about the damage caused by its oil and gasoline products. Exxon strongly denies the allegations. The company has tried - and failed - to get the whole case dismissed on the grounds that many of the allegations made in this case fall outside the jurisdiction of Massachusetts courts, and the ads were not made in or specifically directed at residents in the state. But it's partly because of what climate change is doing to the people of Massachusetts that the state decided to take Exxon to court. Among other things,the lawsuit,externalspecifically mentions the threat against fishermen, and their way of life. Bruce Silverbrand is a shell fisherman and oyster farmer who's been working on the waters around Bourne, at the gateway to Cape Cod, all his life. His days are marked by tides, winds and whether the crabs are in mating season. ""No traffic, no bosses,"" he says, ""but I answer to Mother Nature for sure - and right now she does whatever she wants."" Trudging into the water day in, day out, means Bruce feels the effects of climate change every day, including the rise in water levels. ""I get out of the boat to do a lot of my work, the water used to only come up to my waist, now it comes up to the middle of my stomach at a good tide,"" he says. ""I'm already looking at buying a bigger crane."" He is worried - the tides have also changed and the weather is becoming more extreme. His oyster farm has now been shut for two months, costing him up to $20,000 (Â£14,555) after the remnants of Hurricane Ida dumped nine inches of rain around Bourne in early September. It caused ""sewage and runoff to go into the bay and basically foul the water, so you can't take any shellfish out of it"", he explains. ""I've never seen so much rain ever."" Some 21 US states are taking fossil fuel giants - including Chevron, ExxonMobil, BP and Shell - to court for alleged greenwashing and, it is claimed, engaging in a decades-long disinformation campaign about the effects of climate change. The companies deny the claims. It's part of a pattern of legal action against fossil fuel companies, which is also happening elsewhere in the world. How they made us doubt everything What is greenwashing?,external Courts set for rise in compensation cases The US cases partly concern historical documents containing information on what oil companies knew and didn't reveal about climate change decades ago. Exxon says some ""cherry picked"" statements attributed to a small number of employees have been taken out of context. But in Massachusetts and elsewhere, legal action is also focused on what fossil fuel companies are doing right now. ""We want the company to stop engaging in misleading and deceptive practices,"" said the Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, when she first opened the case in 2019. The Massachusetts case could stretch on for years. Yet it is the one that has progressed furthest. And if successful, it could mean potentially the payment of billions of dollars in compensation. ""Of course, we're seeking civil penalties, but this is really about getting the company to come clean with the public. Stop lying about what they are and what they've been doing."" Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey ""You would think that the company's primary business is saving the world,"" says Karen Sokol, a law professor at Loyola University, New Orleans. ""The legal claim is that's a lie. Because your primary business is oil and gas. It is fossil fuels."" Exxon has argued in court documents that no reasonable consumer watching its adverts would think it has stopped investing in fossil fuel products. And when we asked for comment on specific examples of its advertising, the company said legal cases like the one in Massachusetts waste millions of dollars of taxpayers' money and do nothing to advance meaningful actions that reduce the risks of climate change. In a statement, it also said the case against it has no merit. It has accused Attorney General Healey of trying to deny Exxon its constitutional right to free speech, and of using legal means to force her ideology on the company. Exxon says it has invested more than $10bn (Â£7.25bn) over the past 20 years in researching and developing what it describes as ""lower-emission energy solutions"". But the company'slatest annual report shows,externalit invested $10.4bn in 2020 alone in developing new, unexplored oil and gas reserves. And that gets to the heart of the allegation - the company's adverts promoting green solutions doesn't reflect the vast majority of what Exxon actually does. Pressure on the fossil fuel industry was on display last month in the US Congress, when - for the first time ever - leaders of the four largest oil companies in the US appeared under oath before a committee of the House of Representatives to discuss claims of climate disinformation. Exxon's chief executive Darren Woods was among them. He was asked by a sympathetic Republican congressman if he had ever approved a climate disinformation campaign. ""No, I have not,"" he replied. A more hostile Democrat asked whether any company had the right to lie about climate change and then use the constitutional right to free speech as ""a shield against litigation"". ""I don't believe companies should lie,"" Mr Woods replied, ""and I would tell you we do not do that."" But when asked whether Exxon would match the efforts of European counterparts BP and Shell to reduce oil production, he avoided answering directly, merely repeating: ""We're committed to lowering our emissions."" The political and legal battles about climate change look set to intensify, but they aren't making much of a splash with Bruce Silverbrand back on the Massachusetts coast. ""They'll just fight it out forever. I don't think I'll ever see anything out of it,"" he says. ""I've lived my life. I'm 56 years old, and I just wonder what my children are going to be left with? If we don't all get on the same page [about climate change] and do it right now, it's already over."" Listen toThe Denial Files: Big oil in the dockon the World Service.

"Just four countries plus the European Union are responsible for most of the world's emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is the most common greenhouse gas responsible for global warming. All five signed up tothe Paris agreementin 2015 to cut emissions to limit global temperature rises. What steps have they taken since? Says carbon emissions will peak before 2030 Aiming for 25% of energy from non-fossil fuels by 2030 Promises to be carbon neutral before 2060 Carbon neutrality refers to the balancing of overall carbon emissions with measures to absorb it from the atmosphere such as the planting of trees. China is the largest producer of CO2, and its carbon emissions are still rising, largely because of a reliance on coal. Last month, President Xi Jinping announced it wouldstop funding new coal-fired projects overseas. But at home, coal mines have been ordered to ramp up production to meet surging energy demand, although Beijing has promised to cut back on coal use from 2026. China now accounts for more than a third of all global solar power and is the world's biggest producer of wind energy. But it needs to cut demand for coal by more than 80% by 2060 to meet its climate goals, according to the International Energy Agency. Climate Action Tracker,externalsays it's not clear if its net zero plan is for just CO2 or all greenhouse gases. And it rates its policies and actions as ""insufficient,"" and not consistent with the Paris Agreement goal of keeping to a 1.5C increase in global temperatures. China has not joined a pledge made at the climate summit by more than 100 countries to reduce emissions of another greenhouse gas, methane, by 30% by 2030. However, in ajoint action plan with the United States, China has promised to develop a ""National Action Plan"" to address the issue of methane emissions. Will cut CO2 by at least 50% of 2005 level by 2030 Wants half of new vehicles to be electric by 2030 Promises to be carbon neutral by 2050 More than 80% of US energy comes from fossil fuels, although renewable energy sources are on the increase. President Joe Biden's environmental plan looks to expand green energy further, with a $150bn (Â£100bn) clean-electricity programme to reward utility companies switching from fossil fuels. The US has also pledged ""100% carbon pollution-free"" electricity by 2035 - a commitment made in its joint statement with China at the COP26 summit. CO2 emissions have been dropping over the past decade. But Climate Action Tracker says US actions and policies are ""insufficient"", and need ""substantial improvement"" to beconsistent with the Paris Agreement.,external Promises a 55% emissions cut from the 1990 level by 2030 Aiming for 40% of energy from renewables by 2030 Will be carbon neutral by 2050 The top CO2 emitters in the EU are Germany, Italy and Poland. And while it has overall emissions targets, EU states have differing financial and technical capabilities. But all member countries need to agree how they reach the bloc's targets, as the EU negotiates as a single entity when it comes to the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (Cop26). Climate Action Tracker says its policies and actions are ""almost sufficient"" to keep the global temperature rise to less than 2C, noting emissions have been falling since 2018. Aiming for a 45% reduction in 'emissions intensity' by 2030 Promises 50% of electricity capacity from non-fossil fuels by 2030 Pledging to reach net zero by 2070 India's annual CO2 emissions have risen steadily in the past two decades - but it produces the lowest emissions per person among the top five. India has argued the wealthier, more industrialised nations should bear more of the burden, as they have contributed far more to global warming over time. It has a target for cutting ""emissions intensity"" - CO2 per unit of economic growth - saying this is a fairer way to compare with other countries. India has announced a target date for net zero of 2070 - later than other major emitters. It has also promised a significant increase in energy production from non-fossil fuel sources such as wind, solar and hydro power - and by 2019, this had reached 23%. Butabout 70% of India's electricity grid is powered by coal,external. And India has not joined the methane emissions reduction initiative unveiled at COP26. Climate Action Tracker says the country needs to phase out coal power generation before 2040 and boost its target for energy derived from non-fossil fuels. India is also a major methane emitter, but it has not joined the global pledge to cut emissions by 2030. Will cut emissions by 30% from 1990 levels by 2030 Promises to be carbon neutral by 2060 After the collapse of the Soviet Union, in 1991, Russia's economy - and its carbon emissions - shrank anyway. But Russia is still relying on its extensive forests and swamps to absorb carbon. Climate Action Tracker notes that for the COP26 conference,Russia had not updated its targets since the 2015 Paris Agreement.,external Non-fossil fuel sources make up only a small proportion of its total energy mix. It's also a major emitter of methane, but has not joined in the emissions cut pledge made at the climate summit.

"The climate crisis is no longer a future concern. In many parts of the world, it has already begun. Millions of people are living with extreme temperatures, facing a growing threat of flooding or wildfires. Here, five people explain how extreme temperatures have changed their lives. Shakeela Bano often lays out her family's bedding on the roof of their one-storey house in India. Some nights it's too hot to sleep indoors. The roof can be too hot to walk on. ""It's very difficult,"" she says. ""We have many sleepless nights."" Shakeela lives with her husband, daughter and three grandchildren in a windowless room in Ahmedabad. They have only a single ceiling fan to keep them cool. Climate change means many cities in India are now hitting 50C. Densely populated, built-up areas are particularly affected by something known as the urban heat island effect. Materials like concrete trap and radiate heat, pushing temperatures higher. And there's no respite at night, when it can actually get hotter. In homes like Shakeela's, temperatures now reach 46C. She gets dizzy in the heat. Her grandchildren suffer from rashes, heat exhaustion and diarrhoea. Traditional methods for staying cool, like drinking buttermilk and lemon water, no longer work. Instead they've borrowed money to paint the roof of their home white. White surfaces reflect more sunlight and a coat of white paint to the roof can bring down temperatures inside by 3-4 degrees. For Shakeela, the difference is huge; the room is cooler and the children sleep better. ""He would not sleep through the afternoon,"" she says, pointing to her sleeping grandson. ""Now he can drift off peacefully."" This video can not be played Watch the full video ""I come from a place of heat,"" Sidi Fadoua says. But the heat in northern Mauritania, in west Africa, it is now too hot for many people to live and work. The heat here is not normal heat, he says. ""It's like fire."" Sidi, 44, lives in a small village close the edge of the Sahara. He works as a salt miner in the nearby flats. The work is tough, and it's become harder as the region heats up due to climate change. ""We can't endure such temperatures,"" he says. ""We are not machines."" To avoid temperatures upwards of 45C in the summer, Sidi has begun to work at night. Job prospects are scarce. Those who once made a living raising livestock can no longer do it - there aren't any plants for the sheep and goats to graze. So like an increasing number of his neighbours, Sidi has plans to migrate to the coastal city of Nouadhibou, where the ocean breeze keeps the city cooler. Locals can hitch a ride there on one of the world's longest trains, taking iron ore from nearby mines to the coast. ""People are moving from here,"" Sidi explains. ""They cannot stand the heat anymore."" The 20-hour ride is dangerous. Locals can sit on top of the carriages where they are exposed to heat and sunlight during the day, before temperatures plummet to near freezing at night. In Nouadhibou, he hopes to find work in the fishing industry. The breeze may bring respite, but with increasing numbers escaping the desert heat, work opportunities are harder to find. Sidi remains hopeful. This video can not be played Watch the full video Patrick Michell, chief of the Kanaka Bar First Nation, first began noticing worrying changes in the forest near his reserve in British Columbia, Canada, more than three decades ago. There was less water in the rivers, and mushrooms had stopped growing. This summer his fears came true. A heatwave was sweeping across North America. On June 29, his home town of Lytton smashed records, reaching 49.6C. The next day, his wife sent him a photo of a thermometer reading 53C. An hour later, his town was on fire. His daughter, Serena, eight months pregnant, scrambled to pack her children and pets into the car: ""We left with the clothes on our backs. The flames were three storeys high and right beside us."" Patrick raced back to see if he could save the house. He'd grown up dealing with wildfires. But like the climate, the fires had changed too. ""These aren't wildfires anymore, they're infernos,"" he says. ""How do you put an inferno out?"" Despite the family's circumstances, Patrick sees what's happened as an opportunity: ""We can rebuild Lytton for the environment that's coming in the next 100 years. It's daunting, but in my heart there's that optimism."" ""When I was a kid the weather was not like this,"" says Joy, who lives in the Niger Delta, in Nigeria. The region is one of the most polluted regions on Earth, and hotter days and nights are increasing. Joy provides for her family by using heat from gas flares to dry tapioca and sell it at a local market. ""I have short hair,"" Joy explains, ""because if I grow my hair long, it could burn my head if the flare shifts direction or explodes."" But the flares are part of the problem. Oil companies use them to burn off gas that is released from the ground when they drill for oil. The flares, which rise 6m (20ft) high, are a significant source of global CO2 emissions, which contribute to climate change. Climate change has had a devastating impact here, turning fertile lands into deserts in the north, while flash flooding has hit the south. People do not remember such extreme weather growing up. ""Most people here aren't well-informed enough to explain why the climate is changing rapidly,"" Joy says. ""But we're suspicious of the non-stop flares."" She wants the government to ban gas flaring, even though she relies on it to provide for her family. Almost none of the oil wealth has been reinvested in Nigeria, where 98 million people live in poverty. This includes Joy and her family. For five days of work they make Â£4 in profit. She is not optimistic about the future. ""I think that life [on Earth] is now coming to an end.""

A retired civil servant in Kuwait, she was concerned by the increasingly severe summer temperatures and worsening dust storms. ""I spoke to some officials. They all said it was impossible to plant anything in the sand,"" she says. ""They said the land was sandy and the temperature was too high. I wanted to do something that would astonish everyone."" Om lives in the Middle East, which is warming faster than much of the world. Kuwait is careering towards unbearable temperatures - it is regularly hotter than 50C. Some predictions suggest average temperatures will rise by 4C by 2050. Yet Kuwait's economy is dominated by fossil fuel exports. The two patches Om planted are modest but they serve a purpose. ""Trees fend off dust, eliminate pollution, clean the air, and lower temperatures,"" she says. Hedgehogs and spiny-tailed lizards now visit the site. ""There's fresh water and shade. It's a beautiful thing."" Some Kuwaitis are now calling for a large-scale green belt to be planted by the government. Their shared hope is that Kuwait is ready to make a stand against the climate crisis. Om says they must protect the land and not let it dry out. ""This heat is not normal,"" Om concludes.

Thank you for joining us for the start of the second week of negotiations at COP26 in Glasgow. Analysis shared with the BBC shows there are more delegates associated with the fossil fuel industry attending COP26 than come from any single country. Campaigners led by Global Witnessassessed the participant,externallist and found more than 500 attendees linked to fossil fuel interests. Their attendance at the pivotal climate conference is seen as controversial. Some campaigners - including Greta Thunberg - have criticised the conference so far as a ""greenwashing"" failure. Barack Obama had plenty to say in his COP26 speech earlier as he called on the world to ""step up"" on climate change.

Throughout COP26, you will have heard plenty about wind energy and solar energy. But what about dance energy? Glasgow nightclub SWG3 is set to trial technology that captures body heat from dancers to create renewable energy to heat up or to cool down the venue. Long after the party is over, this energy can be stored until it is needed again.
The system, which has been called Bodyheat, is due to be installed by 2022 and will save approximately 70 tonnes of CO2 per year. Reality Check A solar panel installation in southern California In his speech, former US President Obama said more than three million people worked in clean energy-related jobs in the US. ""Thatâs more than the amount of people employed by the entire fossil fuel industry.â According to the latestUS Energy and Employment Report,external, there were just over three million people in clean energy-related jobs by the end of 2020. That's about 10% less than the previous year, largely due to the impact of Covid on employment. About two million of these were in the energy efficiency sector, which includes the production and installation of energy-saving products. Another half a million were in renewable energy, and another 300,000 in the clean vehicle sector. In 2020, employment in the electric vehicle sector grew by almost 8%, as petrol and diesel vehicle sector employment declined by 10%. The fossil fuel industry as a whole - including coal, gas and oil - employed about 800,000 people in 2020. This includes mining and extraction jobs, as well as the manufacturing and trading of these fuels. Jobs in oil, gas and coal extraction have experienced a gradual decline over the past decade, although they have seen a slight uptick in the past couple of years. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter âThe US is back,â former president Barack Obama told the gathered
delegates at COP26. Implicit in that statement was that, for the past
four years of the Trump administration, the US was absent when it came to global
efforts to address climate change. Obamaâs references to Donald Trump during his speech were more regretful
than accusatory â akin to President Joe Bidenâs apology last week for Trump
administration actions. Obama said he wasnât âreal happyâ about the former presidentâs decision
to pull the US out of the Paris Accords. He lamented the current lack of
international co-operation, exacerbated by what he identified as a âlack of
American leadershipâ on a range of multilateral issues. He acknowledged that his efforts, and those of Mr Biden, were made more
difficult by Republican hostility toward efforts to address climate change. He
said he didnât have all the answers, that he sometimes feels discouraged and the future can at times seem bleak. He noted, however, that even under the Trump administration the US made
progress toward its climate goals, due to efforts of states, local governments
and private corporations. And although the US had âa lot of work to do,â it was
prepared to lead once again. Kat Jones is helping to create a warm welcome in Glasgow for COP26 visitors - in her role as project manager for Stop Climate Chaos Scotland. Sheexplains how she's making visitors feel at home: Even without inflated prices, there are lots of people who need to come to COP26 who can't afford to stay in Â£100-a-night hotels - people coming from the countries most affected by climate change, young activists, and smaller NGOs, which don't have much funding. We've set up the Homestay Network so they aren't excluded. As well as offering space in private homes, hosts are helping people find their way around, recommending places to visit and serving them local food. It's not just about finding environmentally-friendly and affordable accommodation for delegates who are struggling - it's also about cultural exchange and friendship. Glasgow is such a welcoming city.  Often, at previous COPs, churches and village halls opened their doors and large groups could just take their sleeping bags along. But, because of Covid, it's much harder to do that. With the Homestay Network you've got one person staying with one family - it's a much safer way of providing accommodation. I had some people from Madagascar staying with me and they left this morning, so I'm going to Queen Street Station today to meet some new guests and take them back to my house. BBC Media Action Todayâs theme at the UN climate conference is adaptation, loss and damage. More now from the BBC's international charity - whichhas been speaking with people on the climate front lineabout how warming temperatures and extreme weather are changing their lives. In the far west of Nepal, Parbati Bhat
has been a community health volunteer for 38 of her 58 years. For the first
time, she is treating local people for malaria as changing weather patterns have brought
mosquitoes higher into the mountains. âMy relatives live in low-lying areas of Nepal, in Mahendranagar and Dhangadhi. They would tell me that they were troubled by mosquitoes and mosquito-borne diseases like malaria, and I would wonder: what are mosquitoes like? What is malaria like?â she told BBC Media Action. âThere are now eight recent malaria cases in our own village. The mosquito population is growing here, and so are malaria cases.â In Dhaka, Nazma Begum is one of the thousands of climate migrants relocating to the Bangladesh capital. She now works in a garment factory after her local villageâs homes were destroyed by land erosion. âThis is not easy work. Itâs very hot, humid, we sweat a lot... and sometimes it gets really awful in the summer. A couple of us even fainted in the last heatwave,â she says. âItâs even worse at home. It is almost unbearable to sleep with five people, as the tin-roofed room seems like an oven after the evening.â âLiving

marginalised people into the discussions. They can be viewedhere. James CookBBC Scotland senior news correspondent On the marches outside COP26, we've heard plenty of calls
for us to cut back on meat and dairy to save the planet. Jennie Macdiarmid, a professor in sustainable nutrition
and health at Aberdeen University, agrees with the protesters. Farming is rapidly gobbling up the world's dwindling
carbon budget, she says, suggesting that 20 years from now we may only be
eating meat once a week. Not so fast, says Martin Kennedy, president of the
National Farmers Union of Scotland, who argues that agriculture is ""getting hit

anybody should be telling anybody else how they should be eating."" You can read more on the debate about our diet here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter John Kerry and Barack Obama are in Glasgow today while Joe Biden spoke there last week For the first time in four years, US officials have been saying the
words environmental activists and climate-conscious world leaders have wanted
to hear. Listening to Joe Biden, on the stage at COP26, emphasise the US
understood that greenhouse gas emissions represented an existential threat to
the world â and his nation was prepared to take action â was certainly a
welcome development for many conference attendees. If there is one thing the past half-decade has underscored for the rest
of the world, however, itâs the fickle nature of US politics. Biden and the
Democrats are in charge today, but they could be swept out of Congress next
year and out of the White House in 2024. Donald Trump â who recently repeated
his claim that global warming is a âhoaxâ â or someone like him could be in
charge, once again withdrawing the US from the Paris Accords and rolling back
the current presidentâs much-touted regulatory reforms. If the US is an inconstant climate-change advocate, how much can it
accomplish at COP26, when many of the pledges and emissions targets have
timeframes that stretch through dozens of US election cycles? Biden, and former President Barack Obama, can offer their apologies
for previous US policies. The US has brokered deals this week on methane
emissions and forest preservation. It has pushed other nations to commit
net-zero-emissions targets in the coming decades, with mixed results. But until
climate change becomes an issue that no long sits atop the cavernous American
political divide, their promises and accomplishments could be swept away in the
next electoral storm. Navin Singh KhadkaEnvironment correspondent, BBC World Service Vulnerable countries at COP26 say rich nations are pushing back against theirattempts to secure compensation for the damage caused by climate change. Poorer countries see it as critical that money for what is known as ""loss and damage"" be part of negotiations this week. Negotiators agreed in Paris in 2015 to address the issue, but there is no agreement on who should pay for it. Rich nations are said to be resisting any commitments as they do not want to accept liability and risk being sued, while developing countries argue it is the rich countries that are responsible for most of today's climate change impacts because they started emitting vast quantities of carbon much earlier than the rest of the world. Negotiators, mainly representing least developed countries and small
island states, say loss and damage - such as villages and farms being buried under landslides or
swept away by floods - are now happening with increasing
frequency and intensity across the globe due to climate change. They argue climate change is affecting some communities with such intensity that they can no longer adapt, but instead need financial support to rebuild, or to move away. Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Weâve always considered the Dutch better prepared than most for climate change, but floods this summer were a startling wake-up call. Swathes of the southern Limburg province were submerged. The flooding in the southern province of Limburg was declared a disaster in July A quarter of the Netherlands lies below sea level. The small northern European country is particularly vulnerable to flooding and could be among the hardest-hit by global warming but it is also one of the largest polluters on the continent. A country renowned for its storm barriers, pumps, dykes and dunes is now being forced to rethink its survival strategy. The Dutch meteorological institute recently warned sea levels along the coast could rise by up to 2m by 2100 if global greenhouse gas emissions werenât reduced and the melting of the Antarctic polar cap accelerates. Meanwhile, the water authorities, tasked with keeping Dutch feet dry, announced: ""Gone are the days we can control water, soil and land as we please."" Drastic choices, it said, were required to contain the consequences of climate change. At the same time as these warnings though, it has emerged that the Dutch are not on course to deliver the EU-wide emissions reductions targets set for 2030 that it pushed for as part of the bloc. Prime Minister of Barbados Mia Mottley said rich countries must pay for climate damage In the past hour Barbadosâs Prime Minister Mia Mottley gave powerful remarks about loss and damage. As a small island state, her country is extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change. âThere is no better measure that the world is failing to understand the climate crisis than its failure to fund the mechanism (an agreement to address climate damage) for loss and damage,â she says. The financial losses to developing countries from climate change are huge. Mottley points out Dominica lost 226% of its GDP (the total value of a countryâs goods and services) in four hours in 2017 when a powerful hurricane hit the Caribbean. Thatâs compared to Germany which lost 0.1% of its GDP in the devastating floods this summer, she says. She points out it is richer countries who produced most of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming, but poor countries who suffer the effects most.    âItâs like me throwing garbage into your yard and telling you to pay to clean it up - even if it means you canât pay your mortgage, you canât buy food. You canât do anything because you have to spend all your money on the garbage I threw into your yard."" Mia Mottley, Prime Minister of Barbados BBC Media Action Todayâs theme at the UN climate conference is adaptation,
loss and damage. The BBCâs international charity has been speakingwith people around the world about how they
are being impacted by prolonged droughts, flooding, extreme heat and
other changing weather patterns. In Kenya, Esther Elaar is pregnant and walks over two hours a day
to the closest source of water and then carries the full 20 litre can
back. The region hasnât seen rain in months, and water points are shallow and
contaminated. âWhen I get back from fetching water, my legs and back ache,â Esther says. âWhen I carry heavy loads, I feel the baby move and that gets me concerned. There is nothing I can do about it because I need the water.â In Nepal, Angyel
Jung Bista says they cannot build mud houses in his Himalayan region of
Mustang any more, because of more frequent rains. The changing rain patterns
are also affecting the 82-year-old's apple crop â once plentiful, it is now plagued with
insects that are decimating the apples. And more frequent landslides are
polluting water sources, causing more diarrhoeal diseases.  Angyel Jung Bista with his wife Chhutu Gurung âAt times I get so frustrated that I want to run a bulldozer through my apple orchard,â he said. âI wonder how miserable the lives of our children will be in the future. I wonder what kinds of diseases the new generation will have to deal with. Iâm staring at a very bleak future.â Peter BettsFormer lead climate negotiator for the UK and the EU Ever wondered what negotiations actually look like behind closed doors at COPs? How late do
they go and how heated can things get? In big, formal settings with 196 countries
represented, it's very hard to negotiate and move forward. When you move to
more informal settings, maybe even over dinner, you can explore what people
really care about - what is a negotiating position and where compromises might
lie. Sometimes it can get a bit heated as people look to create a bit of
theatre. But, on the whole, it's quite respectful as trust and understanding
is built up. It's pretty rare for it to explode into shouting. During the first week of COP26, we told you howa strike by refuse staff and street cleanershad seen rubbish pile up on the streets in Glasgow. Now it appears the dispute could be brought to an end after further talks were held between council and union leaders over the weekend. The workers have been on strike for just over a week in a row over pay and conditions. The GMB union says it hopes a new dealbeing put to members will end the action. Peter BettsFormer lead climate negotiator for the UK and the EU This COP was billed by US climate envoy John Kerry as the ""last best hope for the world to get its act together"". So, has it? We
were never going to solve the climate change issue in a single meeting. We aren't on track to meet the 1.5C target and we were never going to get there in
this meeting. But we have made progress - although, again, just not enough. We
need to move faster. Fundamentally this isn't about process, but about
political will. Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent While
COP26 negotiators wrestle with a long list of knotty issues, their difficulties
have been overshadowed by the box office power of former US President
Barack Obama. In
a powerful address, Obama criticised the absence of the leaders of China and
Russia as showing a âdangerous lack of urgencyâ on the issue of climate change. He
outlined the scale of the challenge ahead, saying the world was ânowhere near
where it needs to be,â and he scolded countries who had made pledges in Paris
but failed to carry them out. The
bulk of his remarks were dedicated to young people, to motivating them to
channel their anger and frustration with the lack of progress into action. Perhaps
a little unsure of his location, Obama referred to the âemerald isles,â and
quoted Shakespeare. As
well as speaking, Obama is also set to hold a number of meetings in Glasgow,
including with members of the so-called ""high ambition coalition""- which includes island states, the EU and the US. This
grouping was key to achieving the Paris agreement six years ago in the French
capital. Getting
this coalition back together could be critical to landing a deal here in
Glasgow. Despite
the warm welcome for the former president, a small group of young activists
was due to stage a demonstration, complaining that the US hadn't delivered its
share of the $100bn dollars long promised to poorer nations. It's
a clear reminder that Glasgow will fail, unless there's significant progress on
the difficult issue of climate cash. Peter BettsFormer lead climate negotiator for the UK and the EU Peter Betts, a former lead climate negotiator for the UK and the EU, has been answering some of your questions about climate change today. We'll return to some of those now the speech from Barack Obama has come to an end. To what extent can the UK secure climate goals from
other countries, asks Frankie, 46, from Oxford. The
UK can't push countries around. We rely on countries' willingness to contribute
to solving global problems - and peer pressure. There are in every country people
who want to act and those who don't. What you have to do is find arguments that
resonate in each countryâs debate. You can also give countries help with, for
example, technical support on renewable energy which will help them attract the
investment needed to implement change. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,9.0593515e-09
"Former US President Barack Obama tells the COP26 climate conference: ""We are nowhere near where we need to be"" He takes a swipe at his successor, Donald Trump, saying he set the US back in the fight against climate change Obama also criticises China and Russia for a ""lack of urgency"" in tackling the issue The focus in negotiating rooms is meanwhile on what can be done to help countries on the climate frontline The world is already at least 1.1C warmer than the pre-industrial era and scientists say we must limit warming to 1.5C We've been putting your questions to a former top climate negotiator, who is giving us an insight into what happens behind closed doors Edited by James Clarke We will be back again with our live coverage of COP26 tomorrow when the day's focus will be on gender, science and innovation. Today's live page was edited by James Clarke and Hugo Bachega. Our writers were Paul McLaren, Jen Meierhans, Kelly-Leigh Cooper, Georgina Rannard, Doug Faulkner and Becky Morton. Thank you for joining us for the start of the second week of negotiations at COP26 in Glasgow. Analysis shared with the BBC shows there are more delegates associated with the fossil fuel industry attending COP26 than come from any single country. Campaigners led by Global Witnessassessed the participant,externallist and found more than 500 attendees linked to fossil fuel interests. Their attendance at the pivotal climate conference is seen as controversial. Some campaigners - including Greta Thunberg - have criticised the conference so far as a ""greenwashing"" failure. Barack Obama had plenty to say in his COP26 speech earlier as he called on the world to ""step up"" on climate change. This video can not be played COP26:  'We are nowhere near where we need to be yet' - Obama This video can not be played Have you heard of dance energy? Throughout COP26, you will have heard plenty about wind energy and solar energy. But what about dance energy? Glasgow nightclub SWG3 is set to trial technology that captures body heat from dancers to create renewable energy to heat up or to cool down the venue. Long after the party is over, this energy can be stored until it is needed again.
The system, which has been called Bodyheat, is due to be installed by 2022 and will save approximately 70 tonnes of CO2 per year. Reality Check A solar panel installation in southern California In his speech, former US President Obama said more than three million people worked in clean energy-related jobs in the US. ""Thatâs more than the amount of people employed by the entire fossil fuel industry.â According to the latestUS Energy and Employment Report,external, there were just over three million people in clean energy-related jobs by the end of 2020. That's about 10% less than the previous year, largely due to the impact of Covid on employment. About two million of these were in the energy efficiency sector, which includes the production and installation of energy-saving products. Another half a million were in renewable energy, and another 300,000 in the clean vehicle sector. In 2020, employment in the electric vehicle sector grew by almost 8%, as petrol and diesel vehicle sector employment declined by 10%. The fossil fuel industry as a whole - including coal, gas and oil - employed about 800,000 people in 2020. This includes mining and extraction jobs, as well as the manufacturing and trading of these fuels. Jobs in oil, gas and coal extraction have experienced a gradual decline over the past decade, although they have seen a slight uptick in the past couple of years. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter âThe US is back,â former president Barack Obama told the gathered
delegates at COP26. Implicit in that statement was that, for the past
four years of the Trump administration, the US was absent when it came to global
efforts to address climate change. Obamaâs references to Donald Trump during his speech were more regretful
than accusatory â akin to President Joe Bidenâs apology last week for Trump
administration actions. Obama said he wasnât âreal happyâ about the former presidentâs decision
to pull the US out of the Paris Accords. He lamented the current lack of
international co-operation, exacerbated by what he identified as a âlack of
American leadershipâ on a range of multilateral issues. He acknowledged that his efforts, and those of Mr Biden, were made more
difficult by Republican hostility toward efforts to address climate change. He
said he didnât have all the answers, that he sometimes feels discouraged and the future can at times seem bleak. He noted, however, that even under the Trump administration the US made
progress toward its climate goals, due to efforts of states, local governments
and private corporations. And although the US had âa lot of work to do,â it was
prepared to lead once again. Kat Jones is helping to create a warm welcome in Glasgow for COP26 visitors - in her role as project manager for Stop Climate Chaos Scotland. Sheexplains how she's making visitors feel at home: Even without inflated prices, there are lots of people who need to come to COP26 who can't afford to stay in Â£100-a-night hotels - people coming from the countries most affected by climate change, young activists, and smaller NGOs, which don't have much funding. We've set up the Homestay Network so they aren't excluded. As well as offering space in private homes, hosts are helping people find their way around, recommending places to visit and serving them local food. It's not just about finding environmentally-friendly and affordable accommodation for delegates who are struggling - it's also about cultural exchange and friendship. Glasgow is such a welcoming city.  Often, at previous COPs, churches and village halls opened their doors and large groups could just take their sleeping bags along. But, because of Covid, it's much harder to do that. With the Homestay Network you've got one person staying with one family - it's a much safer way of providing accommodation. I had some people from Madagascar staying with me and they left this morning, so I'm going to Queen Street Station today to meet some new guests and take them back to my house. BBC Media Action Todayâs theme at the UN climate conference is adaptation, loss and damage. More now from the BBC's international charity - whichhas been speaking with people on the climate front lineabout how warming temperatures and extreme weather are changing their lives. In the far west of Nepal, Parbati Bhat
has been a community health volunteer for 38 of her 58 years. For the first
time, she is treating local people for malaria as changing weather patterns have brought
mosquitoes higher into the mountains. âMy relatives live in low-lying areas of Nepal, in Mahendranagar and Dhangadhi. They would tell me that they were troubled by mosquitoes and mosquito-borne diseases like malaria, and I would wonder: what are mosquitoes like? What is malaria like?â she told BBC Media Action. âThere are now eight recent malaria cases in our own village. The mosquito population is growing here, and so are malaria cases.â In Dhaka, Nazma Begum is one of the thousands of climate migrants relocating to the Bangladesh capital. She now works in a garment factory after her local villageâs homes were destroyed by land erosion. âThis is not easy work. Itâs very hot, humid, we sweat a lot... and sometimes it gets really awful in the summer. A couple of us even fainted in the last heatwave,â she says. âItâs even worse at home. It is almost unbearable to sleep with five people, as the tin-roofed room seems like an oven after the evening.â âLiving
Climate Changeâ is being screened at COP26 as a way to bring the voices of
marginalised people into the discussions. They can be viewedhere. James CookBBC Scotland senior news correspondent On the marches outside COP26, we've heard plenty of calls
for us to cut back on meat and dairy to save the planet. Jennie Macdiarmid, a professor in sustainable nutrition
and health at Aberdeen University, agrees with the protesters. Farming is rapidly gobbling up the world's dwindling
carbon budget, she says, suggesting that 20 years from now we may only be
eating meat once a week. Not so fast, says Martin Kennedy, president of the
National Farmers Union of Scotland, who argues that agriculture is ""getting hit
with a stick that's not justified"". ""Iâve no beef with vegans,"" he says. ""I just don't think
anybody should be telling anybody else how they should be eating."" You can read more on the debate about our diet here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter John Kerry and Barack Obama are in Glasgow today while Joe Biden spoke there last week For the first time in four years, US officials have been saying the
words environmental activists and climate-conscious world leaders have wanted
to hear. Listening to Joe Biden, on the stage at COP26, emphasise the US
understood that greenhouse gas emissions represented an existential threat to
the world â and his nation was prepared to take action â was certainly a
welcome development for many conference attendees. If there is one thing the past half-decade has underscored for the rest
of the world, however, itâs the fickle nature of US politics. Biden and the
Democrats are in charge today, but they could be swept out of Congress next
year and out of the White House in 2024. Donald Trump â who recently repeated
his claim that global warming is a âhoaxâ â or someone like him could be in
charge, once again withdrawing the US from the Paris Accords and rolling back
the current presidentâs much-touted regulatory reforms. If the US is an inconstant climate-change advocate, how much can it
accomplish at COP26, when many of the pledges and emissions targets have

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson on MP's standards: ""We take all this very seriously"" The government will make ""every effort"" to get standards rules for MPs ""right"", Boris Johnson has said following the row over former Tory MP Owen Paterson. Government-backed plans to review the system after Mr Paterson was found to have broken lobbying rules were withdrawn following a fierce backlash. The PM's remarks came ahead of a Commons debate where MPs are discussing how their conduct is investigated. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle warned the debate would be ""painful"". However, he said it was important for Parliament to ""cleanse"" adding: ""What I don't want is another dark week like last week."" The emergency debate, which began at 1600 GMT, was granted after a request by the Liberal Democrats who are calling for an independent inquiry into ""Tory sleaze"". PM's actions over Paterson corrupt - Starmer The investigations into Boris Johnson and the government Mr Paterson has now quit Parliament and stepped back from his consultancy work, for which he was earning Â£100,000 a year on top of his MP's salary. He has denied breaching Commons lobbying rules, and said the process for investigating him was unfair. Ministers continue to face criticism for their botched attempt last week to block Mr Paterson's suspension from Parliament and redraw MPs' conduct rules. In his first public comments since Mr Paterson stepped down, Mr Johnson did not apologise for ordering his MPs to block his suspension, insisting the government had been trying to reform MPs' standards system. ""I think it is very important that we get this right... we are going to hold MPs to account. MPs should not break the rules."" Speaking to reporters, he added he hoped Sir Lindsay would help set up talks between the parties on improving the process. However, making a statement ahead of the debate, Sir Lindsay did not announce his own review. Instead he noted that the Committee on Standards were close to completing their own report into the process and that once it was finished ""there may be some way, working with the committee, to build on its work"". Labour MP Chris Bryant, who chairs the committee, told the Today programme they hoped to publish draft recommendations before Christmas. During the debate Cabinet Office Minister Stephen Barclay expressed ""regret"" for the government's actions, calling last week's vote a ""mistake"". However, despite calls from some MPs, Mr Barclay said the government would not hold a second vote on the suspension of Mr Paterson, arguing that the questions was not applicable given his resignation. This video can not be played Conservative MP Richard Graham questioned on why he voted to pause Owen Paterson's suspension Mr Paterson's resignation came after the government blocked a proposal to suspend him for 30 days and review the whole investigation system, before backtracking after an outcry from opposition parties and some Tories. The sanction was recommended by the Commons Standards Committee following areport by Parliament's standards commissioner,externalKathryn Stone that found he had repeatedly breached Commons rules banning ""paid advocacy"". This rule prevents MPs from lobbying for companies - although critics of the system point out there is no general ban on MPs taking jobs as consultants or advisers from firms hoping to influence the lawmaking process. Do Tory backbenchers show publicly the anger many have felt privately after they were forced against their better judgement to vote on Owen Paterson's case and changes to the rules, before the government abandoned the attempt anyway? Do supporters of Owen Paterson and critics of the parliamentary standards commissioner take the opportunity to criticise her publicly? The prime minister will not be taking part - with Downing Street saying he has a ""long standing commitment"" to visit a hospital. Instead, Cabinet Office Minister Stephen Barclay has been sent out in the opposition-inspired debate. However, there won't be a vote on any change to the rules - so the debate might have few practical consequences. The row has led to some calling for a ban on MPs simultaneously working as consultants. Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether the rules governing MPs' consultancy jobs should be re-examined, International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan replied: ""Personally I think we should look at that. I'm very comfortable with looking at that. ""I have no problem with that at all. Personally I think it would be wise,"" she added. However, she said she did not favour a blanket ban on second jobs, because Parliament would ""lose hugely"" if MPs were prevented from taking roles such as being a doctor or nurse. Paterson row: How did PM score spectacular own goal? What does 'sleaze' mean when politicians use it? And backbench MP and Tory party deputy chairman Justin Tomlinson said there should be ""greater transparency"" and ""stricter rules"" for MPs to restore trust in Parliament.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson on MP's standards: ""We take all this very seriously"" The government will make ""every effort"" to get standards rules for MPs ""right"", Boris Johnson has said following the row over former Tory MP Owen Paterson. Government-backed plans to review the system after Mr Paterson was found to have broken lobbying rules were withdrawn following a fierce backlash. The PM's remarks came ahead of a Commons debate where MPs are discussing how their conduct is investigated. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle warned the debate would be ""painful"". However, he said it was important for Parliament to ""cleanse"" adding: ""What I don't want is another dark week like last week."" The emergency debate, which began at 1600 GMT, was granted after a request by the Liberal Democrats who are calling for an independent inquiry into ""Tory sleaze"". PM's actions over Paterson corrupt - Starmer The investigations into Boris Johnson and the government Mr Paterson has now quit Parliament and stepped back from his consultancy work, for which he was earning Â£100,000 a year on top of his MP's salary. He has denied breaching Commons lobbying rules, and said the process for investigating him was unfair. Ministers continue to face criticism for their botched attempt last week to block Mr Paterson's suspension from Parliament and redraw MPs' conduct rules. In his first public comments since Mr Paterson stepped down, Mr Johnson did not apologise for ordering his MPs to block his suspension, insisting the government had been trying to reform MPs' standards system. ""I think it is very important that we get this right... we are going to hold MPs to account. MPs should not break the rules."" Speaking to reporters, he added he hoped Sir Lindsay would help set up talks between the parties on improving the process. However, making a statement ahead of the debate, Sir Lindsay did not announce his own review. Instead he noted that the Committee on Standards were close to completing their own report into the process and that once it was finished ""there may be some way, working with the committee, to build on its work"". Labour MP Chris Bryant, who chairs the committee, told the Today programme they hoped to publish draft recommendations before Christmas. During the debate Cabinet Office Minister Stephen Barclay expressed ""regret"" for the government's actions, calling last week's vote a ""mistake"". However, despite calls from some MPs, Mr Barclay said the government would not hold a second vote on the suspension of Mr Paterson, arguing that the questions was not applicable given his resignation. This video can not be played Conservative MP Richard Graham questioned on why he voted to pause Owen Paterson's suspension Mr Paterson's resignation came after the government blocked a proposal to suspend him for 30 days and review the whole investigation system, before backtracking after an outcry from opposition parties and some Tories. The sanction was recommended by the Commons Standards Committee following areport by Parliament's standards commissioner,externalKathryn Stone that found he had repeatedly breached Commons rules banning ""paid advocacy"". This rule prevents MPs from lobbying for companies - although critics of the system point out there is no general ban on MPs taking jobs as consultants or advisers from firms hoping to influence the lawmaking process. Do Tory backbenchers show publicly the anger many have felt privately after they were forced against their better judgement to vote on Owen Paterson's case and changes to the rules, before the government abandoned the attempt anyway? Do supporters of Owen Paterson and critics of the parliamentary standards commissioner take the opportunity to criticise her publicly? The prime minister will not be taking part - with Downing Street saying he has a ""long standing commitment"" to visit a hospital. Instead, Cabinet Office Minister Stephen Barclay has been sent out in the opposition-inspired debate. However, there won't be a vote on any change to the rules - so the debate might have few practical consequences. The row has led to some calling for a ban on MPs simultaneously working as consultants. Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether the rules governing MPs' consultancy jobs should be re-examined, International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan replied: ""Personally I think we should look at that. I'm very comfortable with looking at that. ""I have no problem with that at all. Personally I think it would be wise,"" she added. However, she said she did not favour a blanket ban on second jobs, because Parliament would ""lose hugely"" if MPs were prevented from taking roles such as being a doctor or nurse. Paterson row: How did PM score spectacular own goal? What does 'sleaze' mean when politicians use it? And backbench MP and Tory party deputy chairman Justin Tomlinson said there should be ""greater transparency"" and ""stricter rules"" for MPs to restore trust in Parliament.

"This video can not be played ""We're so happy"": Hear from some of the first UK travellers to fly to the US from London Heathrow UK visitors are now able to travel to the US for the first time in nearly two years. The border reopened at 05:01 GMT and the first flights took off from Heathrow at 08:51. All UK visitors over 18 have to provide proof of vaccination to enter the US. American travellers have been able to travel to the UK since 28 July. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has called this a ""significant moment"" for UK-US travel. Transatlantic flights, he added, are ""at the heart of UK aviation"". In addition to the UK, the travel ban is being lifted for people from Brazil, China, India, Ireland, South Africa, Iran and the Schengen countries - a group of 26 European nations. What are the rules for travelling to the US now? New York gears up for tourists' return Until Monday, only US citizens, residents and a small selection of other exempt groups have been allowed entry to the US from the UK. The new rules apply to all individuals that have received vaccines approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and vaccines Listed for Emergency Use (EUL) by the World Health Organization. The White House's assistant press secretary, Kevin Munoz, confirmed on 15 October that double vaccinated foreign nationals would be able to visit the US from 8 November. Allow Twitter content?

The UK has been on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s highest risk category for Covid, level 4 or ""very high"" since 19 July. TheCDC,externalsaid that vaccines approved by the US FDA and WHO's EUL vaccines will be accepted. Therefore, travellers that have received one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine or two doses of the following vaccines will be allowed to enter the US: Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna AstraZeneca Covaxin Covishield BIBP/Sinopharm Sinovac Travellers must provide proof of vaccination via their vaccine passport. Certificates including the NHS Covid Pass are accepted. As well as being double vaccinated, travellers will have to provide proof of either a negative Covid test result,external- taken no more than three days before travelling - or show that they have recovered from the virus in the previous three months. Children are exempt from the vaccination requirement, but all those aged between two and 17 will have to take a Covid-19 test three to five days after arrival. Fully jabbed American visitors travelling to the UK need to take a test on or before the second day of their arrival. Most of the UK's population has received both doses of the Covid vaccine,but the global picture is quite different. After a difficult 21 months, airlines have increased UK-US flight schedules to meet the higher demand. US to lift travel ban on 8 November To celebrate the end of the travel ban, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic had a synchronised departure at 08:51 GMT from London Heathrow. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, BA chief executive, Sean Doyle said: ""We must now look forward with optimism, get trade and tourism back on track and allow friends and families to connect once again."" According to travel data firm Cirium, 3,688 flights are scheduled to operate between the US and the UK in November. This is an increase in 21% on October. But it remains 49% down on the pre-pandemic levels of November 2019. Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta Air Lines,told BBC World Newsthat ensuring everyone has the correct documentation will make the upcoming months ""a little choppy"". He said that ""there may be some long lines"" at airports and he has asked travellers to ""have some patience"". Mr Bastian said that although the industry does not expect travellers to have problems with their documentation, they are ready for it. According to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, around 3.8 million British nationals visited the US every year prior to the pandemic. One woman who had not seen her parents, brother or sister in nearly two years as they live in California, said the ban had been a ""nightmare"" for her family. Nadine Beasley missed the weddings of both her siblings, which had been scheduled to take place at the same time so she could attend with her husband and nine-year-old daughter. ""Obviously the pandemic scuppered that,"" she told BBC Breakfast. Nadine Beasley (L) missed the weddings of both her brother and sister Unfortunately for Mrs Beasley, her brother's wedding took place in May and her sister's was just over a week before the ban was lifted. She has finally been able to book a flight to December to see them, but said the opening up of travel left her with with mixed feelings, as it felt a bit ""too late for us"". Mrs Beasley said: ""I bawled my eyes out and I think it was a mixture of elation and also frustration and honestly a bit of grief. ""Grieving the loss of knowing I've missed out on massive life events with everybody."" Before travelling, fully jabbed passengers entering the UK no longer have to take a Covid test before travelling. This applies to all individuals that have been vaccinated in the UK, the EU, the US and several other countries - Brazil, India, Pakistan and South Africa are some of thecountries included in the list,external. However, passengers have to prove they have been vaccinated before travelling. In addition to this, they have to take a lateral flow test two days after arrival in the UK.

"Former US President Barack Obama tells the COP26 climate conference: ""We are nowhere near where we need to be"" He takes a swipe at his successor, Donald Trump, saying he set the US back in the fight against climate change Obama also criticises China and Russia for a ""lack of urgency"" in tackling the issue The focus in negotiating rooms is meanwhile on what can be done to help countries on the climate frontline The world is already at least 1.1C warmer than the pre-industrial era and scientists say we must limit warming to 1.5C We've been putting your questions to a former top climate negotiator, who is giving us an insight into what happens behind closed doors Edited by James Clarke We will be back again with our live coverage of COP26 tomorrow when the day's focus will be on gender, science and innovation. Today's live page was edited by James Clarke and Hugo Bachega. Our writers were Paul McLaren, Jen Meierhans, Kelly-Leigh Cooper, Georgina Rannard, Doug Faulkner and Becky Morton. Thank you for joining us for the start of the second week of negotiations at COP26 in Glasgow. Analysis shared with the BBC shows there are more delegates associated with the fossil fuel industry attending COP26 than come from any single country. Campaigners led by Global Witnessassessed the participant,externallist and found more than 500 attendees linked to fossil fuel interests. Their attendance at the pivotal climate conference is seen as controversial. Some campaigners - including Greta Thunberg - have criticised the conference so far as a ""greenwashing"" failure. Barack Obama had plenty to say in his COP26 speech earlier as he called on the world to ""step up"" on climate change. This video can not be played COP26:  'We are nowhere near where we need to be yet' - Obama This video can not be played Have you heard of dance energy? Throughout COP26, you will have heard plenty about wind energy and solar energy. But what about dance energy? Glasgow nightclub SWG3 is set to trial technology that captures body heat from dancers to create renewable energy to heat up or to cool down the venue. Long after the party is over, this energy can be stored until it is needed again.
The system, which has been called Bodyheat, is due to be installed by 2022 and will save approximately 70 tonnes of CO2 per year. Reality Check A solar panel installation in southern California In his speech, former US President Obama said more than three million people worked in clean energy-related jobs in the US. ""Thatâs more than the amount of people employed by the entire fossil fuel industry.â According to the latestUS Energy and Employment Report,external, there were just over three million people in clean energy-related jobs by the end of 2020. That's about 10% less than the previous year, largely due to the impact of Covid on employment. About two million of these were in the energy efficiency sector, which includes the production and installation of energy-saving products. Another half a million were in renewable energy, and another 300,000 in the clean vehicle sector. In 2020, employment in the electric vehicle sector grew by almost 8%, as petrol and diesel vehicle sector employment declined by 10%. The fossil fuel industry as a whole - including coal, gas and oil - employed about 800,000 people in 2020. This includes mining and extraction jobs, as well as the manufacturing and trading of these fuels. Jobs in oil, gas and coal extraction have experienced a gradual decline over the past decade, although they have seen a slight uptick in the past couple of years. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter âThe US is back,â former president Barack Obama told the gathered
delegates at COP26. Implicit in that statement was that, for the past
four years of the Trump administration, the US was absent when it came to global
efforts to address climate change. Obamaâs references to Donald Trump during his speech were more regretful
than accusatory â akin to President Joe Bidenâs apology last week for Trump
administration actions. Obama said he wasnât âreal happyâ about the former presidentâs decision
to pull the US out of the Paris Accords. He lamented the current lack of
international co-operation, exacerbated by what he identified as a âlack of
American leadershipâ on a range of multilateral issues. He acknowledged that his efforts, and those of Mr Biden, were made more
difficult by Republican hostility toward efforts to address climate change. He
said he didnât have all the answers, that he sometimes feels discouraged and the future can at times seem bleak. He noted, however, that even under the Trump administration the US made
progress toward its climate goals, due to efforts of states, local governments
and private corporations. And although the US had âa lot of work to do,â it was
prepared to lead once again. Kat Jones is helping to create a warm welcome in Glasgow for COP26 visitors - in her role as project manager for Stop Climate Chaos Scotland. Sheexplains how she's making visitors feel at home: Even without inflated prices, there are lots of people who need to come to COP26 who can't afford to stay in Â£100-a-night hotels - people coming from the countries most affected by climate change, young activists, and smaller NGOs, which don't have much funding. We've set up the Homestay Network so they aren't excluded. As well as offering space in private homes, hosts are helping people find their way around, recommending places to visit and serving them local food. It's not just about finding environmentally-friendly and affordable accommodation for delegates who are struggling - it's also about cultural exchange and friendship. Glasgow is such a welcoming city.  Often, at previous COPs, churches and village halls opened their doors and large groups could just take their sleeping bags along. But, because of Covid, it's much harder to do that. With the Homestay Network you've got one person staying with one family - it's a much safer way of providing accommodation. I had some people from Madagascar staying with me and they left this morning, so I'm going to Queen Street Station today to meet some new guests and take them back to my house. BBC Media Action Todayâs theme at the UN climate conference is adaptation, loss and damage. More now from the BBC's international charity - whichhas been speaking with people on the climate front lineabout how warming temperatures and extreme weather are changing their lives. In the far west of Nepal, Parbati Bhat
has been a community health volunteer for 38 of her 58 years. For the first
time, she is treating local people for malaria as changing weather patterns have brought
mosquitoes higher into the mountains. âMy relatives live in low-lying areas of Nepal, in Mahendranagar and Dhangadhi. They would tell me that they were troubled by mosquitoes and mosquito-borne diseases like malaria, and I would wonder: what are mosquitoes like? What is malaria like?â she told BBC Media Action. âThere are now eight recent malaria cases in our own village. The mosquito population is growing here, and so are malaria cases.â In Dhaka, Nazma Begum is one of the thousands of climate migrants relocating to the Bangladesh capital. She now works in a garment factory after her local villageâs homes were destroyed by land erosion. âThis is not easy work. Itâs very hot, humid, we sweat a lot... and sometimes it gets really awful in the summer. A couple of us even fainted in the last heatwave,â she says. âItâs even worse at home. It is almost unbearable to sleep with five people, as the tin-roofed room seems like an oven after the evening.â âLiving
Climate Changeâ is being screened at COP26 as a way to bring the voices of
marginalised people into the discussions. They can be viewedhere. James CookBBC Scotland senior news correspondent On the marches outside COP26, we've heard plenty of calls
for us to cut back on meat and dairy to save the planet. Jennie Macdiarmid, a professor in sustainable nutrition
and health at Aberdeen University, agrees with the protesters. Farming is rapidly gobbling up the world's dwindling
carbon budget, she says, suggesting that 20 years from now we may only be
eating meat once a week. Not so fast, says Martin Kennedy, president of the
National Farmers Union of Scotland, who argues that agriculture is ""getting hit
with a stick that's not justified"". ""Iâve no beef with vegans,"" he says. ""I just don't think
anybody should be telling anybody else how they should be eating."" You can read more on the debate about our diet here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter John Kerry and Barack Obama are in Glasgow today while Joe Biden spoke there last week For the first time in four years, US officials have been saying the
words environmental activists and climate-conscious world leaders have wanted
to hear. Listening to Joe Biden, on the stage at COP26, emphasise the US
understood that greenhouse gas emissions represented an existential threat to
the world â and his nation was prepared to take action â was certainly a
welcome development for many conference attendees. If there is one thing the past half-decade has underscored for the rest
of the world, however, itâs the fickle nature of US politics. Biden and the
Democrats are in charge today, but they could be swept out of Congress next
year and out of the White House in 2024. Donald Trump â who recently repeated
his claim that global warming is a âhoaxâ â or someone like him could be in
charge, once again withdrawing the US from the Paris Accords and rolling back
the current presidentâs much-touted regulatory reforms. If the US is an inconstant climate-change advocate, how much can it
accomplish at COP26, when many of the pledges and emissions targets have
timeframes that stretch through dozens of US election cycles? Biden, and former President Barack Obama, can offer their apologies
for previous US policies. The US has brokered deals this week on methane
emissions and forest preservation. It has pushed other nations to commit
net-zero-emissions targets in the coming decades, with mixed results. But until
climate change becomes an issue that no long sits atop the cavernous American
political divide, their promises and accomplishments could be swept away in the
next electoral storm. Navin Singh KhadkaEnvironment correspondent, BBC World Service Vulnerable countries at COP26 say rich nations are pushing back against theirattempts to secure compensation for the damage caused by climate change. Poorer countries see it as critical that money for what is known as ""loss and damage"" be part of negotiations this week. Negotiators agreed in Paris in 2015 to address the issue, but there is no agreement on who should pay for it. Rich nations are said to be resisting any commitments as they do not want to accept liability and risk being sued, while developing countries argue it is the rich countries that are responsible for most of today's climate change impacts because they started emitting vast quantities of carbon much earlier than the rest of the world. Negotiators, mainly representing least developed countries and small
island states, say loss and damage - such as villages and farms being buried under landslides or
swept away by floods - are now happening with increasing
frequency and intensity across the globe due to climate change. They argue climate change is affecting some communities with such intensity that they can no longer adapt, but instead need financial support to rebuild, or to move away. Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Weâve always considered the Dutch better prepared than most for climate change, but floods this summer were a startling wake-up call. Swathes of the southern Limburg province were submerged. The flooding in the southern province of Limburg was declared a disaster in July A quarter of the Netherlands lies below sea level. The small northern European country is particularly vulnerable to flooding and could be among the hardest-hit by global warming but it is also one of the largest polluters on the continent. A country renowned for its storm barriers, pumps, dykes and dunes is now being forced to rethink its survival strategy. The Dutch meteorological institute recently warned sea levels along the coast could rise by up to 2m by 2100 if global greenhouse gas emissions werenât reduced and the melting of the Antarctic polar cap accelerates. Meanwhile, the water authorities, tasked with keeping Dutch feet dry, announced: ""Gone are the days we can control water, soil and land as we please."" Drastic choices, it said, were required to contain the consequences of climate change. At the same time as these warnings though, it has emerged that the Dutch are not on course to deliver the EU-wide emissions reductions targets set for 2030 that it pushed for as part of the bloc. Prime Minister of Barbados Mia Mottley said rich countries must pay for climate damage In the past hour Barbadosâs Prime Minister Mia Mottley gave powerful remarks about loss and damage. As a small island state, her country is extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change. âThere is no better measure that the world is failing to understand the climate crisis than its failure to fund the mechanism (an agreement to address climate damage) for loss and damage,â she says. The financial losses to developing countries from climate change are huge. Mottley points out Dominica lost 226% of its GDP (the total value of a countryâs goods and services) in four hours in 2017 when a powerful hurricane hit the Caribbean. Thatâs compared to Germany which lost 0.1% of its GDP in the devastating floods this summer, she says. She points out it is richer countries who produced most of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming, but poor countries who suffer the effects most.    âItâs like me throwing garbage into your yard and telling you to pay to clean it up - even if it means you canât pay your mortgage, you canât buy food. You canât do anything because you have to spend all your money on the garbage I threw into your yard."" Mia Mottley, Prime Minister of Barbados BBC Media Action Todayâs theme at the UN climate conference is adaptation,
loss and damage. The BBCâs international charity has been speakingwith people around the world about how they
are being impacted by prolonged droughts, flooding, extreme heat and
other changing weather patterns. In Kenya, Esther Elaar is pregnant and walks over two hours a day
to the closest source of water and then carries the full 20 litre can
back. The region hasnât seen rain in months, and water points are shallow and
contaminated. âWhen I get back from fetching water, my legs and back ache,â Esther says. âWhen I carry heavy loads, I feel the baby move and that gets me concerned. There is nothing I can do about it because I need the water.â In Nepal, Angyel
Jung Bista says they cannot build mud houses in his Himalayan region of
Mustang any more, because of more frequent rains. The changing rain patterns
are also affecting the 82-year-old's apple crop â once plentiful, it is now plagued with
insects that are decimating the apples. And more frequent landslides are
polluting water sources, causing more diarrhoeal diseases.  Angyel Jung Bista with his wife Chhutu Gurung âAt times I get so frustrated that I want to run a bulldozer through my apple orchard,â he said. âI wonder how miserable the lives of our children will be in the future. I wonder what kinds of diseases the new generation will have to deal with. Iâm staring at a very bleak future.â Peter BettsFormer lead climate negotiator for the UK and the EU Ever wondered what negotiations actually look like behind closed doors at COPs? How late do
they go and how heated can things get? In big, formal settings with 196 countries
represented, it's very hard to negotiate and move forward. When you move to
more informal settings, maybe even over dinner, you can explore what people
really care about - what is a negotiating position and where compromises might
lie. Sometimes it can get a bit heated as people look to create a bit of
theatre. But, on the whole, it's quite respectful as trust and understanding
is built up. It's pretty rare for it to explode into shouting. During the first week of COP26, we told you howa strike by refuse staff and street cleanershad seen rubbish pile up on the streets in Glasgow. Now it appears the dispute could be brought to an end after further talks were held between council and union leaders over the weekend. The workers have been on strike for just over a week in a row over pay and conditions. The GMB union says it hopes a new dealbeing put to members will end the action. Peter BettsFormer lead climate negotiator for the UK and the EU This COP was billed by US climate envoy John Kerry as the ""last best hope for the world to get its act together"". So, has it? We
were never going to solve the climate change issue in a single meeting. We aren't on track to meet the 1.5C target and we were never going to get there in
this meeting. But we have made progress - although, again, just not enough. We
need to move faster. Fundamentally this isn't about process, but about
political will. Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent While
COP26 negotiators wrestle with a long list of knotty issues, their difficulties
have been overshadowed by the box office power of former US President
Barack Obama. In
a powerful address, Obama criticised the absence of the leaders of China and
Russia as showing a âdangerous lack of urgencyâ on the issue of climate change. He
outlined the scale of the challenge ahead, saying the world was ânowhere near
where it needs to be,â and he scolded countries who had made pledges in Paris
but failed to carry them out. The
bulk of his remarks were dedicated to young people, to motivating them to
channel their anger and frustration with the lack of progress into action. Perhaps
a little unsure of his location, Obama referred to the âemerald isles,â and
quoted Shakespeare. As
well as speaking, Obama is also set to hold a number of meetings in Glasgow,
including with members of the so-called ""high ambition coalition""- which includes island states, the EU and the US. This
grouping was key to achieving the Paris agreement six years ago in the French
capital. Getting
this coalition back together could be critical to landing a deal here in
Glasgow. Despite
the warm welcome for the former president, a small group of young activists
was due to stage a demonstration, complaining that the US hadn't delivered its
share of the $100bn dollars long promised to poorer nations. It's
a clear reminder that Glasgow will fail, unless there's significant progress on
the difficult issue of climate cash. Peter BettsFormer lead climate negotiator for the UK and the EU Peter Betts, a former lead climate negotiator for the UK and the EU, has been answering some of your questions about climate change today. We'll return to some of those now the speech from Barack Obama has come to an end. To what extent can the UK secure climate goals from
other countries, asks Frankie, 46, from Oxford. The
UK can't push countries around. We rely on countries' willingness to contribute
to solving global problems - and peer pressure. There are in every country people
who want to act and those who don't. What you have to do is find arguments that
resonate in each countryâs debate. You can also give countries help with, for
example, technical support on renewable energy which will help them attract the
investment needed to implement change. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9999999
"The bulk of the money will go to help Asian and Pacific countries vulnerable to climate change like Bangladesh, but it is not known exactly who will benefit The UK is pledging Â£290m to help poorer countries cope with the impact of climate change, as the COP26 climate change summit enters its second week. Government ministers from around the world are in Glasgow for more talks. They will discuss how to support poorer countries and if reparations for damage from natural disasters should be paid. Poorer nations havecalled for $100bn of financial help, arguing they are already suffering and will be worst affected by climate change. Developing countries have historically contributed a very small proportion of the damaging emissions driving climate change - while currently the wealthiest 1% of the global population account for more than double the combined emissions of the poorest 50%. The majority of the money from the UK will go to help Asian and Pacific nations plan and invest in climate action, improve conservation and promote low-carbon development, the government said. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office described the Â£290m as ""new funding"" from the foreign aid budget. The government said last month that cuts to the UK's foreign aid spending, to 0.5% of national income,will stay in placeuntil at least 2024-25. Senior government climate change advisers previously warned the cuts showed the UKwas ""neither committed to nor serious about""helping countries vulnerable to climate change ahead of COP26. What do the poorest countries want from climate summit? Why hasn't climate pledge to poor countries been met? The UN summit will continue until Sunday, with much of the focus of the talks over how to limit global warming to the target of 1.5C. Monday will see negotiators discuss how best to mitigate the impact of a warming planet, particularly for poorer countries. Developing countries are asking for $100bn (around Â£73bn at current exchange rates) annually to help reduce emissions and adapt to climate change and reaching net-zero targets on emissions well before 2050. A pledge for $100bn from wealthier nations was made as long ago as 2009, but the plans to have it in place by 2020 have not been realised and current targets aim to reach it by 2023 - an offer which has beendescribed as ""extremely disappointing"". International trade minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan said the world ""must act now"" to prevent more people being pushed into poverty by climate change. The government said its Â£290m in new funding to tackle the impact of climate change will be split between: Â£274m to assist Asian and the Pacific nations to plan and invest in climate action, improve conservation and ensure low-carbon development Â£15m to a fund designed to support developing countries focus their response where they most need it Â£1 million to support delivery of faster and more effective global humanitarian action, including in response to climate-related disasters But there is also the question of whether rich nations should pay reparations to vulnerable countries for damage already caused by climate change. Wealthy nations have never acknowledged legal liability for the impact of their emissions - because the bill could run into trillions. So far, Scotland is the only country promising to donate to a compensation fund for countries whose economies have been damaged by climate change with a Â£1m pledge. Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh, said Scotland's pledge is the first time any developed nation has tacitly admitted responsibility for contributing to global warming - and he believed it will not be the last. The Glasgow COP isn't really one conference - in effect it's two processes in parallel. One is a series of daily events organised by the British presidency of the COP. This innovation has already conjured welcome initiatives on forests, finance, methane and technology. This week it'll unveil pledges on transport, cities and science. They'll be significant if they're carried through. Meanwhile in parallel the tangled talks of the formal UN process labour on. There are disagreements over the rules governing climate deals, whether rich countries will offer more cash to poorer countries already suffering from dangerous heating - and whether given the urgency of climate disruption, nations should raise their carbon-cutting ambitions in two years instead of five. There's also a question of reparations for nations harmed by emissions they didn't cause. So far the only contribution to the fund is Â£1m from Scotland. It'll be a tough week. Charity Christian Aid said some of the world's poorest countries could suffer an average 64% hit to their economy by the end of the century under current climate policies. Mohamed Adow, director of Kenyan climate and energy think tank Power Shift Africa, described the ""scale of the economic disaster"" as ""deeply unjust"". ""The fact rich countries have consistently blocked efforts to set up a loss and damage fund to deal with this injustice is shameful"", he added. Why the COP26 climate summit is important Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you? Four ways to reduce your emissions What are top polluters doing to cut emissions? The first week of the climate talks have led to a variety of pledges, including a major dealto end and reverse deforestation by 2030, andto cut methane emissions. President of COP26, Alok Sharma, said the pledges made ""must be delivered on and accounted for"" by all nations.

Today's live page was edited by James Clarke and Hugo Bachega. Our writers were Paul McLaren, Jen Meierhans, Kelly-Leigh Cooper, Georgina Rannard, Doug Faulkner and Becky Morton. Thank you for joining us for the start of the second week of negotiations at COP26 in Glasgow. Analysis shared with the BBC shows there are more delegates associated with the fossil fuel industry attending COP26 than come from any single country. Campaigners led by Global Witnessassessed the participant,externallist and found more than 500 attendees linked to fossil fuel interests. Their attendance at the pivotal climate conference is seen as controversial. Some campaigners - including Greta Thunberg - have criticised the conference so far as a ""greenwashing"" failure. Barack Obama had plenty to say in his COP26 speech earlier as he called on the world to ""step up"" on climate change. This video can not be played COP26:  'We are nowhere near where we need to be yet' - Obama This video can not be played Have you heard of dance energy? Throughout COP26, you will have heard plenty about wind energy and solar energy. But what about dance energy? Glasgow nightclub SWG3 is set to trial technology that captures body heat from dancers to create renewable energy to heat up or to cool down the venue. Long after the party is over, this energy can be stored until it is needed again.
The system, which has been called Bodyheat, is due to be installed by 2022 and will save approximately 70 tonnes of CO2 per year. Reality Check A solar panel installation in southern California In his speech, former US President Obama said more than three million people worked in clean energy-related jobs in the US. ""Thatâs more than the amount of people employed by the entire fossil fuel industry.â According to the latestUS Energy and Employment Report,external, there were just over three million people in clean energy-related jobs by the end of 2020. That's about 10% less than the previous year, largely due to the impact of Covid on employment. About two million of these were in the energy efficiency sector, which includes the production and installation of energy-saving products. Another half a million were in renewable energy, and another 300,000 in the clean vehicle sector. In 2020, employment in the electric vehicle sector grew by almost 8%, as petrol and diesel vehicle sector employment declined by 10%. The fossil fuel industry as a whole - including coal, gas and oil - employed about 800,000 people in 2020. This includes mining and extraction jobs, as well as the manufacturing and trading of these fuels. Jobs in oil, gas and coal extraction have experienced a gradual decline over the past decade, although they have seen a slight uptick in the past couple of years. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter âThe US is back,â former president Barack Obama told the gathered
delegates at COP26. Implicit in that statement was that, for the past
four years of the Trump administration, the US was absent when it came to global
efforts to address climate change. Obamaâs references to Donald Trump during his speech were more regretful
than accusatory â akin to President Joe Bidenâs apology last week for Trump
administration actions. Obama said he wasnât âreal happyâ about the former presidentâs decision
to pull the US out of the Paris Accords. He lamented the current lack of
international co-operation, exacerbated by what he identified as a âlack of
American leadershipâ on a range of multilateral issues. He acknowledged that his efforts, and those of Mr Biden, were made more
difficult by Republican hostility toward efforts to address climate change. He
said he didnât have all the answers, that he sometimes feels discouraged and the future can at times seem bleak. He noted, however, that even under the Trump administration the US made
progress toward its climate goals, due to efforts of states, local governments
and private corporations. And although the US had âa lot of work to do,â it was
prepared to lead once again. Kat Jones is helping to create a warm welcome in Glasgow for COP26 visitors - in her role as project manager for Stop Climate Chaos Scotland. Sheexplains how she's making visitors feel at home: Even without inflated prices, there are lots of people who need to come to COP26 who can't afford to stay in Â£100-a-night hotels - people coming from the countries most affected by climate change, young activists, and smaller NGOs, which don't have much funding. We've set up the Homestay Network so they aren't excluded. As well as offering space in private homes, hosts are helping people find their way around, recommending places to visit and serving them local food. It's not just about finding environmentally-friendly and affordable accommodation for delegates who are struggling - it's also about cultural exchange and friendship. Glasgow is such a welcoming city.  Often, at previous COPs, churches and village halls opened their doors and large groups could just take their sleeping bags along. But, because of Covid, it's much harder to do that. With the Homestay Network you've got one person staying with one family - it's a much safer way of providing accommodation. I had some people from Madagascar staying with me and they left this morning, so I'm going to Queen Street Station today to meet some new guests and take them back to my house. BBC Media Action Todayâs theme at the UN climate conference is adaptation, loss and damage.

In the far west of Nepal, Parbati Bhat
has been a community health volunteer for 38 of her 58 years. For the first
time, she is treating local people for malaria as changing weather patterns have brought
mosquitoes higher into the mountains. âMy relatives live in low-lying areas of Nepal, in Mahendranagar and Dhangadhi. They would tell me that they were troubled by mosquitoes and mosquito-borne diseases like malaria, and I would wonder: what are mosquitoes like? What is malaria like?â she told BBC Media Action. âThere are now eight recent malaria cases in our own village. The mosquito population is growing here, and so are malaria cases.â In Dhaka, Nazma Begum is one of the thousands of climate migrants relocating to the Bangladesh capital. She now works in a garment factory after her local villageâs homes were destroyed by land erosion. âThis is not easy work. Itâs very hot, humid, we sweat a lot... and sometimes it gets really awful in the summer. A couple of us even fainted in the last heatwave,â she says. âItâs even worse at home.

for us to cut back on meat and dairy to save the planet. Jennie Macdiarmid, a professor in sustainable nutrition
and health at Aberdeen University, agrees with the protesters. Farming is rapidly gobbling up the world's dwindling
carbon budget, she says, suggesting that 20 years from now we may only be
eating meat once a week. Not so fast, says Martin Kennedy, president of the
National Farmers Union of Scotland, who argues that agriculture is ""getting hit
with a stick that's not justified"". ""Iâve no beef with vegans,"" he says. ""I just don't think
anybody should be telling anybody else how they should be eating."" You can read more on the debate about our diet here.

were never going to solve the climate change issue in a single meeting. We aren't on track to meet the 1.5C target and we were never going to get there in
this meeting. But we have made progress - although, again, just not enough. We
need to move faster. Fundamentally this isn't about process, but about
political will. Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent While
COP26 negotiators wrestle with a long list of knotty issues, their difficulties
have been overshadowed by the box office power of former US President
Barack Obama. In
a powerful address, Obama criticised the absence of the leaders of China and
Russia as showing a âdangerous lack of urgencyâ on the issue of climate change. He
outlined the scale of the challenge ahead, saying the world was ânowhere near
where it needs to be,â and he scolded countries who had made pledges in Paris
but failed to carry them out. The
bulk of his remarks were dedicated to young people, to motivating them to
channel their anger and frustration with the lack of progress into action. Perhaps
a little unsure of his location, Obama referred to the âemerald isles,â and
quoted Shakespeare. As
well as speaking, Obama is also set to hold a number of meetings in Glasgow,
including with members of the so-called ""high ambition coalition""- which includes island states, the EU and the US. This
grouping was key to achieving the Paris agreement six years ago in the French
capital. Getting
this coalition back together could be critical to landing a deal here in
Glasgow. Despite
the warm welcome for the former president, a small group of young activists
was due to stage a demonstration, complaining that the US hadn't delivered its
share of the $100bn dollars long promised to poorer nations. It's
a clear reminder that Glasgow will fail, unless there's significant progress on
the difficult issue of climate cash. Peter BettsFormer lead climate negotiator for the UK and the EU Peter Betts, a former lead climate negotiator for the UK and the EU, has been answering some of your questions about climate change today. We'll return to some of those now the speech from Barack Obama has come to an end. To what extent can the UK secure climate goals from
other countries, asks Frankie, 46, from Oxford. The
UK can't push countries around. We rely on countries' willingness to contribute
to solving global problems - and peer pressure. There are in every country people
who want to act and those who don't. What you have to do is find arguments that
resonate in each countryâs debate. You can also give countries help with, for
example, technical support on renewable energy which will help them attract the
investment needed to implement change. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9999926
"The bulk of the money will go to help Asian and Pacific countries vulnerable to climate change like Bangladesh, but it is not known exactly who will benefit The UK is pledging Â£290m to help poorer countries cope with the impact of climate change, as the COP26 climate change summit enters its second week. Government ministers from around the world are in Glasgow for more talks. They will discuss how to support poorer countries and if reparations for damage from natural disasters should be paid. Poorer nations havecalled for $100bn of financial help, arguing they are already suffering and will be worst affected by climate change. Developing countries have historically contributed a very small proportion of the damaging emissions driving climate change - while currently the wealthiest 1% of the global population account for more than double the combined emissions of the poorest 50%. The majority of the money from the UK will go to help Asian and Pacific nations plan and invest in climate action, improve conservation and promote low-carbon development, the government said. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office described the Â£290m as ""new funding"" from the foreign aid budget. The government said last month that cuts to the UK's foreign aid spending, to 0.5% of national income,will stay in placeuntil at least 2024-25. Senior government climate change advisers previously warned the cuts showed the UKwas ""neither committed to nor serious about""helping countries vulnerable to climate change ahead of COP26. What do the poorest countries want from climate summit? Why hasn't climate pledge to poor countries been met? The UN summit will continue until Sunday, with much of the focus of the talks over how to limit global warming to the target of 1.5C. Monday will see negotiators discuss how best to mitigate the impact of a warming planet, particularly for poorer countries. Developing countries are asking for $100bn (around Â£73bn at current exchange rates) annually to help reduce emissions and adapt to climate change and reaching net-zero targets on emissions well before 2050. A pledge for $100bn from wealthier nations was made as long ago as 2009, but the plans to have it in place by 2020 have not been realised and current targets aim to reach it by 2023 - an offer which has beendescribed as ""extremely disappointing"". International trade minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan said the world ""must act now"" to prevent more people being pushed into poverty by climate change. The government said its Â£290m in new funding to tackle the impact of climate change will be split between: Â£274m to assist Asian and the Pacific nations to plan and invest in climate action, improve conservation and ensure low-carbon development Â£15m to a fund designed to support developing countries focus their response where they most need it Â£1 million to support delivery of faster and more effective global humanitarian action, including in response to climate-related disasters But there is also the question of whether rich nations should pay reparations to vulnerable countries for damage already caused by climate change. Wealthy nations have never acknowledged legal liability for the impact of their emissions - because the bill could run into trillions. So far, Scotland is the only country promising to donate to a compensation fund for countries whose economies have been damaged by climate change with a Â£1m pledge. Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh, said Scotland's pledge is the first time any developed nation has tacitly admitted responsibility for contributing to global warming - and he believed it will not be the last. The Glasgow COP isn't really one conference - in effect it's two processes in parallel. One is a series of daily events organised by the British presidency of the COP. This innovation has already conjured welcome initiatives on forests, finance, methane and technology. This week it'll unveil pledges on transport, cities and science. They'll be significant if they're carried through. Meanwhile in parallel the tangled talks of the formal UN process labour on. There are disagreements over the rules governing climate deals, whether rich countries will offer more cash to poorer countries already suffering from dangerous heating - and whether given the urgency of climate disruption, nations should raise their carbon-cutting ambitions in two years instead of five. There's also a question of reparations for nations harmed by emissions they didn't cause. So far the only contribution to the fund is Â£1m from Scotland. It'll be a tough week. Charity Christian Aid said some of the world's poorest countries could suffer an average 64% hit to their economy by the end of the century under current climate policies. Mohamed Adow, director of Kenyan climate and energy think tank Power Shift Africa, described the ""scale of the economic disaster"" as ""deeply unjust"". ""The fact rich countries have consistently blocked efforts to set up a loss and damage fund to deal with this injustice is shameful"", he added. Why the COP26 climate summit is important Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you? Four ways to reduce your emissions What are top polluters doing to cut emissions? The first week of the climate talks have led to a variety of pledges, including a major dealto end and reverse deforestation by 2030, andto cut methane emissions. President of COP26, Alok Sharma, said the pledges made ""must be delivered on and accounted for"" by all nations. Former US President Barack Obama is expected to speak in Glasgow later about the progress made in the five years since the Paris Agreement took effect.

"Christine McCluskey pictured around a fortnight after the physical assessment which prompted her benefits to be cut Around 100 people denied fast-tracked disability benefits for terminal illness died challenging the decision. Currently, patients can access benefits more quickly if theirclinician says they have six months or less to live.,external In July the governmentpromised to extend that to 12 months.Critics said it did not go far enough. ""Our priority is dealing with people's claims quickly and compassionately,"" the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said. End-of-life charity Marie Curie said it had ""serious concerns about the DWP's ability to recognise when a claimant was approaching the end of life and was in desperate need of support"". Dr Sam Royston, its director of policy and research, said if people died before their appeals were decided it was ""highly likely they were living with a long-term or terminal illness"". ""Many of these people should have received fast-track access to support [originally],"" he added. Patients can currently access fast-tracked benefits at a higher rate by applying under the Special Rules for Terminal Illness (SRTI). They need to submit a form signed by their clinician, saying it isprobable they will die within six months.,external The DWP said of those who applied ""the majority received the highest possible award and were paid within three days of making a claim"". But charities said the system was flawed. The Motor Neurone Disease (MND) Association said the unpredictability of the speed with which a person with MND might deteriorate, meant it was difficult for neurologists to give accurate prognoses. Susie Rabin, head of policy and campaigns at the MND Association, said that made it difficult for people to access benefits through the special rules. Dr Catherine Millington-Sanders, the clinical lead for palliative and end of life care for the Royal College of GPs, added doctors ""still faced uncertainty when determining exactly how long someone has got to live"". ""It makes little sense to have a rigidly set time cap to be a determining factor,"" she said. Payout after mum died following benefit errors Seven out of 10 win benefits challenges in court DWP sees 'sharp rise' in benefit death reviews Affected families and charities said the current process was ""overly complex and stressful"" and it remained unclear when reforms would happen. They have also called for the government to go further and scrap the requirement for people on terminal illness benefits to be reassessed every three years. Helena Reynolds has paid for her funeral up front because she did not want her family to be burdened Helena Reynolds, from Essex, who is terminally ill with intestinal failure, said the current six-month rule was ""pointless"" because ""terminal meant terminal"". ""It's like we've been forgotten. All we're asking for is a little dignity; we shouldn't have to beg for our benefits when we get ill,"" she said. Mrs Reynolds was aged 14 when she was diagnosed with Crohn's disease and had 23 operations on her abdomen before she was awarded Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for life in 1991. When Personal Independence Payment (PIP) replaced DLA in 2019, her benefits were initially cut, but later reinstated on appeal. This year, although her doctor said her condition would ""almost certainlyâ¦prove fatal at some point"", they could not say she had less than six months to live. Instead, she had to re-apply for PIP under the standard route and was given a 10-year PIP award. The longest possible award under special rules would have been for three years. Paul Alexander, policy manager at disability equality charity Scope, said: ""This is a clear example of the system being overly complex, stressful and inconsistent."" ""It doesn't make sense that someone would go from getting a 'lifetime' award, to being refused support from its successor benefit, despite being terminally ill,"" he added. Dr Royston from Marie Curie said few people awarded benefits under special rules lived beyond three years but for the small number who did it was ""inappropriate and insensitive"" they had to make a new application or risk losing support. Christine McCluskey died weighing around 3st (19kg), her daughter Michelle said Christine McCluskey, from Dundee, Scotland, had a history of illnesses including Crohn's Disease, osteoporosis, and suffering a stroke in 2005. She was told her PIP would be stopped and that DWP would try to recoup an overpayment of Employment Support Allowance after a physical assessment, which described her as having a ""slim build"" and being a ""pleasant lady to assess"". She weighed around 5st 6lbs (34.4kg) at the time and was being fed by a drip, her daughter Michelle said. Then she received a terminal lung cancer diagnosis in July 2018. She submitted a form from her doctor to the DWP about her separate terminal diagnosis but a letter came back in September 2018, a month later, to say that information - the form - required her to start a fresh claim. She died the same day aged 61. Michelle believes the application process needs to change so fast-tracked support can be paid automatically to people with a terminal diagnosis. It was ""degrading"" for a person to need to submit a form putting a time frame on their own death, she said. Michelle, who previously shared pictures of her mother with national newspapers to highlight her experience, said: ""You just have to look at her to see she wasn't well and that was before she had cancer."" In February 2019, a tribunal ruled Christine's PIP should not have been cut. The DWP paid the arrears owed. A new benefit called Adult Disability Payment was due to replace PIP in Scotland from spring 2022, which would use a clinician's prognosis of their patient rather than any time limit. Income-based benefits still administered by the DWP, such as Universal Credit, would however still use the DWP's end-of-life definition, which has led to concerns of a developing two-tier system for people applying for benefits in Scotland. Madeleine Moon, former Labour MP for Bridgend, previously sponsored aPrivate Members' Bill,externalin 2018 which proposed to remove the six-month time limit and replace it with a clinical judgment made by an appropriate health professional. Parliamentary time ran out to discuss the bill beyond its first reading in the House of Commons and then Mrs Moon lost her seat. Jessica Morden, Labour MP for Newport East, has now taken up the bill again. Mrs Moon, whose husband Steve died from motor neurone disease in 2015, said: ""The cruelty, if not the inhumanity, of the current system is shocking. This video can not be played Madeleine Moon gave an emotional speech in the House of Commons ""I'm glad the government has accepted the current rules are wrong. ""Most people in the initial shock [of receiving a terminal diagnosis] aren't thinking about benefits, they are thinking what have I got to do to live whatever time I have left. ""You need to plan for the new future and you need to stabilise the family's finances.  What you can't do is spend the time going through the long time to access PIP."" Northern Ireland's communities minister Deirdre Hargey hascommitted to bring forward legislationto widen the eligibility to people with less than a year to live, before the next assembly election is due in May 2022. In July, then-minister for disabled people Justin Tomlinson said Westminster would make the same change for Universal Credit and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) next year and Attendance Allowance, Disability Living Allowance and PIP ""when Parliamentary time allowed"". The DWP reiterated it would make those changes ""so more people could get the vital support they needed"". University of York Professor of Law Charlotte O'Brien, a specialist in welfare law, said it was a different process to change the rules for universal credit and ESA because those rules were in secondary legislation regulations, whereas DLA, PIP and Attendance Allowance were set out in the Welfare Reform Act 2012, so a new Act of Parliament could be required. ""The chances of the government proposing a bill specifically for this are quite slight, as are the chances of them having the time and the Parliamentary bandwidth,"" Prof O'Brien said.

"Developing countries are the most vulnerable to the damage caused by climate change, such as floods, droughts and wildfires. Addressing the needs of less wealthy and smaller countries is vital forthe COP26 climate negotiations in Glasgow,where leaders are being asked to agree on new commitments to tackle climate change. The least developed countries haveset out their priorities,externalfor negotiations. They want richer and developed countries to: fulfil a pledge to provide $100bn (roughly equivalent to Â£73bn at current exchange rates) each year in finance to help reduce emissions and adapt to climate change agree to net-zero targets on greenhouse gases well before 2050, with specific targets for major emitters such as the US, Australia and countries in the EU acknowledge the loss and damage they have experienced, such as the effects of rising sea levels or frequent flooding finalise rules on how countries will implement previous agreements There is deep frustration among the leaders of developing nations that the richest in the world have not met their previous commitments. Kenya's president Uhuru Kenyatta said: ""Before making new pledges, start by fulfilling the existing ones."" This video can not be played What is Climate Justice? Developing countries have historically contributed a very small proportion of the damaging emissions that drive climate change - and currently the richest 1% of the global population account for more thantwice the combined emissions of the poorest 50%.,external These poorer countries are also more vulnerable to the effects of extreme weather because they are generally more dependent on the natural environment for food and jobs, and have less money to spend on mitigation. Over the last 50 years, more than two out of three deaths caused by extreme weather â including droughts, wildfire and floods âoccurred in the 47 least developed countries.,external Countries such as Bangladesh have been on the front line of the effects of global warming In 2009, richer countries committed to finding $100bn a year by 2020 from public and private sources, to address the needs of developing countries. The money is to help pay for measures to reduce dangerous emissions and protect from the effects of extreme weather, such as better flood defence systems and investment in renewable energy sources. However, total commitments had only reached $80bn by 2019, and the $100bn target is nowunlikely to be met before 2023. Securing an agreement on how to meet the commitments to developing countries - and potentially go further - is crucial if the world is going to achieve its aim to keep global temperature rises below 1.5C. Arriving in Glasgow for the summit,Malawi's president Lazarus Chakwera said: ""It's not a charity act. So pay up or perish with us."" UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has put reaching $100bn as one of his four priorities for the negotiations in Glasgow. He said that richer nations had ""reaped the benefits of untrammelled pollution for generations, often at the expense of developing countries"", and that they havea ""duty"" to support developing nations with technology, expertise and money.,external Why hasn't climate pledge to poor countries been met? ""We are negotiating for our survival,"" says Tagaloa Cooper, of the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme - an organisation made of up members from Pacific island countries and territories. Rising sea levels make some of these island nations the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, but Ms Cooper says a lack of resources means they don't have the ""luxury"" of sending large delegations. ""Some of our most vulnerable will struggle to have a voice, and be heard, in these negotiations."" More than 120 world leaders are expected to descend on Glasgow for climate negotiations Navigating Covid-safe travel to the Glasgow conference has been an obstacle for many delegations, particularly the Pacific islands, where infection rates have remained low during the pandemic. Only four Pacific island heads of state arereported to be travelling to the summit,,externalwith others being represented by smaller teams and ambassadors. Negotiators staying behind and participating remotely may be disadvantaged by unreliable internet access and time differences. Samoa, for instance, is 13 hours ahead of the UK. Developing countries usually have less of a voice on the international stage, so it helps to form groups or blocks to amplify their cause. TheLeast Developed Countries group,externalis a 46-nation bloc that includes Senegal, Bangladesh and Yemen and represents one billion people. These countries can create stronger negotiating positions when ""priorities and interests are aligned"", says Sonam Wangdi, the current chairman, from Bhutan. ""This crisis isn't being treated like a crisis. That has to change here in Glasgow,"" he says. Bhutan has committed to keeping at least 60% of the country under forest cover If there is to be a final agreement, all 197 UN member states that are signed up to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change have to sign. That means the final agreement must be acceptable to both richer and developing countries. World leaders failed to securea legally binding agreement in Copenhagen in 2009,,externalpartly because a handful of developing countries including Sudan and Tuvalu opposed the final agreement.

"A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit. It aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough. The agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade: Emissions It was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - agreenhouse gas which causes climate change. This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a ""climate catastrophe"". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. Coal For the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions. However, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal after a late intervention by China and India. PM: Climate deal sounds death knell for coal power Evasive words and coal compromise, but deal shows progress Developing countries The agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy. There's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (Â£72bn) a year by 2020 was missed. While some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the ""start of a breakthrough"", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. Why hasn't climate pledge to poor countries been met? Fossil fuel subsidies World leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas. However, no firm dates have been set. How much is still spent supporting oil, coal and gas? A flurry of other announcements were made: The world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China,pledged to cooperate more over the next decadein areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy. China has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. Cautious welcome for US-China climate agreement Why China's climate policy matters to us all Leaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests -promised to stop deforestationby 2030. This is seen as vital, as trees absorb vast amounts of CO2. Similar initiativeshaven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed. Ascheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030was agreed by more than 100 countries. Methane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. The big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later. Financial organisations controlling $130tnagreed to back ""clean"" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries. The initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets. However, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. Most commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed. Only a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. COP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015Paris Agreement. Six years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming ""well below"" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C. COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties"", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. The goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reachnet zeroby mid-century. Next year's COP27 summit is in Egypt. Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you?

"Simon Coveney says triggering Article 16 would damage EU-UK relationships The UK's trade deal with the EU could collapse in a row over Northern Ireland, says a senior Irish minister. The UK is thought to be preparing to suspend parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney hinted the EU could terminate the Trade and Cooperation Agreement in response. He said: ""One is contingent on the other so that if one is being set aside there is a danger that the other will also be set aside by the EU."" Northern Ireland is covered by a special Brexit deal known as the Protocol. It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, which prevents a hard border with Ireland and allows free-flowing trade with the EU. But it also creates a trade border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which is causing difficulties for some businesses. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Article 16 of the Protocol allows parts of the deal to be suspended if it is causing serious problems - the UK says that threshold has been reached. The EUhas proposed operational changesto the Protocol but the UK is demanding more far-reaching changes. Mr Coveney said that if the UK did suspend parts of the Northern Ireland deal it would be ""deliberately forcing a breakdown in relationships and negotiation between the two sides"". He linked that to the wider UK-EU deal, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA). Either side can give 12 months notice that they intend to terminate the TCA. Article 16 exists to fix difficulties with the Northern Ireland Protocol that are causing serious problems or causing diversion of trade. The UK government says that threshold was reached long ago and so it can be used legitimately. But the EU fears the UK is planning to use Article 16 in an expansive way - to gut the protocol, sweep away the Irish Sea border and open up a potential back door into the single market. The EU may argue that the broader Brexit trade deal only happened because the issue of the Irish border had been sorted out first. Therefore if the UK collapses that border solution the EU may give notice that it intends to collapse the trade deal.

"Simon Coveney says triggering Article 16 would damage EU-UK relationships The UK's trade deal with the EU could collapse in a row over Northern Ireland, says a senior Irish minister. The UK is thought to be preparing to suspend parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney hinted the EU could terminate the Trade and Cooperation Agreement in response. He said: ""One is contingent on the other so that if one is being set aside there is a danger that the other will also be set aside by the EU."" Northern Ireland is covered by a special Brexit deal known as the Protocol. It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, which prevents a hard border with Ireland and allows free-flowing trade with the EU. But it also creates a trade border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which is causing difficulties for some businesses. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Article 16 of the Protocol allows parts of the deal to be suspended if it is causing serious problems - the UK says that threshold has been reached. The EUhas proposed operational changesto the Protocol but the UK is demanding more far-reaching changes. Mr Coveney said that if the UK did suspend parts of the Northern Ireland deal it would be ""deliberately forcing a breakdown in relationships and negotiation between the two sides"". He linked that to the wider UK-EU deal, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA). Either side can give 12 months notice that they intend to terminate the TCA. Article 16 exists to fix difficulties with the Northern Ireland Protocol that are causing serious problems or causing diversion of trade. The UK government says that threshold was reached long ago and so it can be used legitimately. But the EU fears the UK is planning to use Article 16 in an expansive way - to gut the protocol, sweep away the Irish Sea border and open up a potential back door into the single market. The EU may argue that the broader Brexit trade deal only happened because the issue of the Irish border had been sorted out first. Therefore if the UK collapses that border solution the EU may give notice that it intends to collapse the trade deal.

"Christine McCluskey pictured around a fortnight after the physical assessment which prompted her benefits to be cut Around 100 people denied fast-tracked disability benefits for terminal illness died challenging the decision. Currently, patients can access benefits more quickly if theirclinician says they have six months or less to live.,external In July the governmentpromised to extend that to 12 months.Critics said it did not go far enough. ""Our priority is dealing with people's claims quickly and compassionately,"" the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said. End-of-life charity Marie Curie said it had ""serious concerns about the DWP's ability to recognise when a claimant was approaching the end of life and was in desperate need of support"". Dr Sam Royston, its director of policy and research, said if people died before their appeals were decided it was ""highly likely they were living with a long-term or terminal illness"". ""Many of these people should have received fast-track access to support [originally],"" he added. Patients can currently access fast-tracked benefits at a higher rate by applying under the Special Rules for Terminal Illness (SRTI). They need to submit a form signed by their clinician, saying it isprobable they will die within six months.,external The DWP said of those who applied ""the majority received the highest possible award and were paid within three days of making a claim"". But charities said the system was flawed. The Motor Neurone Disease (MND) Association said the unpredictability of the speed with which a person with MND might deteriorate, meant it was difficult for neurologists to give accurate prognoses. Susie Rabin, head of policy and campaigns at the MND Association, said that made it difficult for people to access benefits through the special rules. Dr Catherine Millington-Sanders, the clinical lead for palliative and end of life care for the Royal College of GPs, added doctors ""still faced uncertainty when determining exactly how long someone has got to live"". ""It makes little sense to have a rigidly set time cap to be a determining factor,"" she said. Payout after mum died following benefit errors Seven out of 10 win benefits challenges in court DWP sees 'sharp rise' in benefit death reviews Affected families and charities said the current process was ""overly complex and stressful"" and it remained unclear when reforms would happen. They have also called for the government to go further and scrap the requirement for people on terminal illness benefits to be reassessed every three years. Helena Reynolds has paid for her funeral up front because she did not want her family to be burdened Helena Reynolds, from Essex, who is terminally ill with intestinal failure, said the current six-month rule was ""pointless"" because ""terminal meant terminal"". ""It's like we've been forgotten. All we're asking for is a little dignity; we shouldn't have to beg for our benefits when we get ill,"" she said. Mrs Reynolds was aged 14 when she was diagnosed with Crohn's disease and had 23 operations on her abdomen before she was awarded Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for life in 1991. When Personal Independence Payment (PIP) replaced DLA in 2019, her benefits were initially cut, but later reinstated on appeal. This year, although her doctor said her condition would ""almost certainlyâ¦prove fatal at some point"", they could not say she had less than six months to live. Instead, she had to re-apply for PIP under the standard route and was given a 10-year PIP award. The longest possible award under special rules would have been for three years. Paul Alexander, policy manager at disability equality charity Scope, said: ""This is a clear example of the system being overly complex, stressful and inconsistent."" ""It doesn't make sense that someone would go from getting a 'lifetime' award, to being refused support from its successor benefit, despite being terminally ill,"" he added. Dr Royston from Marie Curie said few people awarded benefits under special rules lived beyond three years but for the small number who did it was ""inappropriate and insensitive"" they had to make a new application or risk losing support. Christine McCluskey died weighing around 3st (19kg), her daughter Michelle said Christine McCluskey, from Dundee, Scotland, had a history of illnesses including Crohn's Disease, osteoporosis, and suffering a stroke in 2005. She was told her PIP would be stopped and that DWP would try to recoup an overpayment of Employment Support Allowance after a physical assessment, which described her as having a ""slim build"" and being a ""pleasant lady to assess"". She weighed around 5st 6lbs (34.4kg) at the time and was being fed by a drip, her daughter Michelle said. Then she received a terminal lung cancer diagnosis in July 2018. She submitted a form from her doctor to the DWP about her separate terminal diagnosis but a letter came back in September 2018, a month later, to say that information - the form - required her to start a fresh claim. She died the same day aged 61. Michelle believes the application process needs to change so fast-tracked support can be paid automatically to people with a terminal diagnosis. It was ""degrading"" for a person to need to submit a form putting a time frame on their own death, she said. Michelle, who previously shared pictures of her mother with national newspapers to highlight her experience, said: ""You just have to look at her to see she wasn't well and that was before she had cancer."" In February 2019, a tribunal ruled Christine's PIP should not have been cut. The DWP paid the arrears owed. A new benefit called Adult Disability Payment was due to replace PIP in Scotland from spring 2022, which would use a clinician's prognosis of their patient rather than any time limit. Income-based benefits still administered by the DWP, such as Universal Credit, would however still use the DWP's end-of-life definition, which has led to concerns of a developing two-tier system for people applying for benefits in Scotland. Madeleine Moon, former Labour MP for Bridgend, previously sponsored aPrivate Members' Bill,externalin 2018 which proposed to remove the six-month time limit and replace it with a clinical judgment made by an appropriate health professional. Parliamentary time ran out to discuss the bill beyond its first reading in the House of Commons and then Mrs Moon lost her seat. Jessica Morden, Labour MP for Newport East, has now taken up the bill again. Mrs Moon, whose husband Steve died from motor neurone disease in 2015, said: ""The cruelty, if not the inhumanity, of the current system is shocking. This video can not be played Madeleine Moon gave an emotional speech in the House of Commons ""I'm glad the government has accepted the current rules are wrong. ""Most people in the initial shock [of receiving a terminal diagnosis] aren't thinking about benefits, they are thinking what have I got to do to live whatever time I have left. ""You need to plan for the new future and you need to stabilise the family's finances.  What you can't do is spend the time going through the long time to access PIP."" Northern Ireland's communities minister Deirdre Hargey hascommitted to bring forward legislationto widen the eligibility to people with less than a year to live, before the next assembly election is due in May 2022. In July, then-minister for disabled people Justin Tomlinson said Westminster would make the same change for Universal Credit and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) next year and Attendance Allowance, Disability Living Allowance and PIP ""when Parliamentary time allowed"". The DWP reiterated it would make those changes ""so more people could get the vital support they needed"". University of York Professor of Law Charlotte O'Brien, a specialist in welfare law, said it was a different process to change the rules for universal credit and ESA because those rules were in secondary legislation regulations, whereas DLA, PIP and Attendance Allowance were set out in the Welfare Reform Act 2012, so a new Act of Parliament could be required. ""The chances of the government proposing a bill specifically for this are quite slight, as are the chances of them having the time and the Parliamentary bandwidth,"" Prof O'Brien said.

"Developing countries are the most vulnerable to the damage caused by climate change, such as floods, droughts and wildfires. Addressing the needs of less wealthy and smaller countries is vital forthe COP26 climate negotiations in Glasgow,where leaders are being asked to agree on new commitments to tackle climate change. The least developed countries haveset out their priorities,externalfor negotiations. They want richer and developed countries to: fulfil a pledge to provide $100bn (roughly equivalent to Â£73bn at current exchange rates) each year in finance to help reduce emissions and adapt to climate change agree to net-zero targets on greenhouse gases well before 2050, with specific targets for major emitters such as the US, Australia and countries in the EU acknowledge the loss and damage they have experienced, such as the effects of rising sea levels or frequent flooding finalise rules on how countries will implement previous agreements There is deep frustration among the leaders of developing nations that the richest in the world have not met their previous commitments. Kenya's president Uhuru Kenyatta said: ""Before making new pledges, start by fulfilling the existing ones."" This video can not be played What is Climate Justice? Developing countries have historically contributed a very small proportion of the damaging emissions that drive climate change - and currently the richest 1% of the global population account for more thantwice the combined emissions of the poorest 50%.,external These poorer countries are also more vulnerable to the effects of extreme weather because they are generally more dependent on the natural environment for food and jobs, and have less money to spend on mitigation. Over the last 50 years, more than two out of three deaths caused by extreme weather â including droughts, wildfire and floods âoccurred in the 47 least developed countries.,external Countries such as Bangladesh have been on the front line of the effects of global warming In 2009, richer countries committed to finding $100bn a year by 2020 from public and private sources, to address the needs of developing countries. The money is to help pay for measures to reduce dangerous emissions and protect from the effects of extreme weather, such as better flood defence systems and investment in renewable energy sources. However, total commitments had only reached $80bn by 2019, and the $100bn target is nowunlikely to be met before 2023. Securing an agreement on how to meet the commitments to developing countries - and potentially go further - is crucial if the world is going to achieve its aim to keep global temperature rises below 1.5C. Arriving in Glasgow for the summit,Malawi's president Lazarus Chakwera said: ""It's not a charity act. So pay up or perish with us."" UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has put reaching $100bn as one of his four priorities for the negotiations in Glasgow. He said that richer nations had ""reaped the benefits of untrammelled pollution for generations, often at the expense of developing countries"", and that they havea ""duty"" to support developing nations with technology, expertise and money.,external Why hasn't climate pledge to poor countries been met? ""We are negotiating for our survival,"" says Tagaloa Cooper, of the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme - an organisation made of up members from Pacific island countries and territories. Rising sea levels make some of these island nations the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, but Ms Cooper says a lack of resources means they don't have the ""luxury"" of sending large delegations. ""Some of our most vulnerable will struggle to have a voice, and be heard, in these negotiations."" More than 120 world leaders are expected to descend on Glasgow for climate negotiations Navigating Covid-safe travel to the Glasgow conference has been an obstacle for many delegations, particularly the Pacific islands, where infection rates have remained low during the pandemic. Only four Pacific island heads of state arereported to be travelling to the summit,,externalwith others being represented by smaller teams and ambassadors. Negotiators staying behind and participating remotely may be disadvantaged by unreliable internet access and time differences. Samoa, for instance, is 13 hours ahead of the UK. Developing countries usually have less of a voice on the international stage, so it helps to form groups or blocks to amplify their cause. TheLeast Developed Countries group,externalis a 46-nation bloc that includes Senegal, Bangladesh and Yemen and represents one billion people. These countries can create stronger negotiating positions when ""priorities and interests are aligned"", says Sonam Wangdi, the current chairman, from Bhutan. ""This crisis isn't being treated like a crisis. That has to change here in Glasgow,"" he says. Bhutan has committed to keeping at least 60% of the country under forest cover If there is to be a final agreement, all 197 UN member states that are signed up to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change have to sign. That means the final agreement must be acceptable to both richer and developing countries. World leaders failed to securea legally binding agreement in Copenhagen in 2009,,externalpartly because a handful of developing countries including Sudan and Tuvalu opposed the final agreement.

"A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit. It aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough. The agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade: Emissions It was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - agreenhouse gas which causes climate change. This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a ""climate catastrophe"". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. Coal For the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions. However, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal after a late intervention by China and India. PM: Climate deal sounds death knell for coal power Evasive words and coal compromise, but deal shows progress Developing countries The agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy. There's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (Â£72bn) a year by 2020 was missed. While some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the ""start of a breakthrough"", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. Why hasn't climate pledge to poor countries been met? Fossil fuel subsidies World leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas. However, no firm dates have been set. How much is still spent supporting oil, coal and gas? A flurry of other announcements were made: The world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China,pledged to cooperate more over the next decadein areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy. China has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. Cautious welcome for US-China climate agreement Why China's climate policy matters to us all Leaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests -promised to stop deforestationby 2030. This is seen as vital, as trees absorb vast amounts of CO2. Similar initiativeshaven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed. Ascheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030was agreed by more than 100 countries. Methane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. The big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later. Financial organisations controlling $130tnagreed to back ""clean"" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries. The initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets. However, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. Most commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed. Only a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. COP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015Paris Agreement. Six years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming ""well below"" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C. COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties"", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. The goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reachnet zeroby mid-century. Next year's COP27 summit is in Egypt. Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you?

"So how much progress has really been made in the opening days of COP26 and what are the main challenges that lie ahead? To paraphrase COP26 president Alok Sharma, this is the moment when the rubber is finally meeting the road. After a first week dominated by a blizzard of announcements of new initiatives in the real world, the conference is now moving into the critical, behind doors phase of the negotiations. The main focus will still be on devising a plan to bend the temperature curve below 1.5C. What's been decided at COP26 so far? Why is 'net zero' so important? What are the big polluters doing to cut emissions? There has been quite a bit of speculation that the first week announcements made by countries and the new pledges onmethaneandcoalhave already moved the needle on the rise in global temperatures that's likely this century. According to the head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, the new commitments mean that the mercury rise may be held to 1.8C. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Right now it's more a vision, or imagination. And it's not matched by action."" A series of protests have been taking place during the summit As one participant explained it, the first week of COP26 was all sugar rush, the second will be about sobering up and getting down to business. Next week will see ministers fly in from around the world to tackle the tricky issues that negotiators themselves can't resolve. These will encompass a range of technical issues relating to the Paris agreement that have been outstanding for a number of years, including the rules on how carbon markets work, on the need for transparent reporting, and for common time frames on emission cutting plans. Some progress has been reported, but there are still wide gaps between the parties across these questions. As deadlines loom, negotiators are getting nervous. ""It is tense right now, people are having to take tough decisions, as they should,"" said Archie Young, the UK's lead negotiator in the talks. ""I think it is really important that we recognise the hard work that goes into the importance of some of that technical work."" There will also be detailed and tough discussions around finance, around the question of adaptation, and loss and damage. There is likely to be a real standoff over the question of how cash for climate change is spent. Delegates at COP26 include representatives from indigenous communities affected by climate change Despite repeated calls from developing countries for a larger share of the finance to be used to help them to adapt to higher temperatures, the focus according to observers is still on using the money to help them cut emissions. The cold reality is that investors are more willing to put their money into renewable energy projects where a profit can be made than they are to spend it on sea walls or other adaptive measures that do not guarantee a return. ""Rich countries publicly claim they care about adaptation but inside the talks most of the money goes on emission reductions and they undermine efforts to prioritise the adaptation needs of vulnerable nations,"" said Mohamed Adow, from the Power Shift Africa organisation, an observer at these talks. The failure of the richer nations to fulfil their promise of $100bn by 2020 has undoubtedly damaged trust, there is work underway to put in place a new, more substantial payment from 2025. While the new figure is unlikely to be agreed here, the prospect of a very significant increase could go some way towards ensuring that finance doesn't derail these talks completely. For the UK though the really big question is how to construct a final document that will be agreed collectively by the conference that will keep the 1.5C temperature threshold within reach. UK negotiators are taking soundings on what's termed a ""cover decision"", a package of measures that will try to close the gap between what the world's commitments add up to and the 1.5C bar. The key element of that package will be an attempt to get countries to update and improve their carbon cutting plans more regularly than every five years as is presently the case. The most vulnerable want an annual update. There's also a push for countries to come back with new plans in two years time. There is likely to be strong opposition from larger, developing economies. But there is a belief that steps will be agreed. The summit is moving into the critical, behind doors phase of the negotiations ""You clearly want some processes agreed here that give us hope that countries are going to come back and sharpen their pencils and put more ambition on the table,"" said Alden Meyer, a long time participant in climate talks from the E3G think tank. ""I think if we get the atmospherics, right and the UK uses the ministers well, by the end of next week, we can get substantial movement."" ""It will offer some hope that over the next couple of years, we can start to really close that gap.""

"Christine McCluskey pictured around a fortnight after the physical assessment which prompted her benefits to be cut Around 100 people denied fast-tracked disability benefits for terminal illness died challenging the decision. Currently, patients can access benefits more quickly if theirclinician says they have six months or less to live.,external In July the governmentpromised to extend that to 12 months.Critics said it did not go far enough. ""Our priority is dealing with people's claims quickly and compassionately,"" the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said. End-of-life charity Marie Curie said it had ""serious concerns about the DWP's ability to recognise when a claimant was approaching the end of life and was in desperate need of support"". Dr Sam Royston, its director of policy and research, said if people died before their appeals were decided it was ""highly likely they were living with a long-term or terminal illness"". ""Many of these people should have received fast-track access to support [originally],"" he added. Patients can currently access fast-tracked benefits at a higher rate by applying under the Special Rules for Terminal Illness (SRTI). They need to submit a form signed by their clinician, saying it isprobable they will die within six months.,external The DWP said of those who applied ""the majority received the highest possible award and were paid within three days of making a claim"". But charities said the system was flawed. The Motor Neurone Disease (MND) Association said the unpredictability of the speed with which a person with MND might deteriorate, meant it was difficult for neurologists to give accurate prognoses. Susie Rabin, head of policy and campaigns at the MND Association, said that made it difficult for people to access benefits through the special rules. Dr Catherine Millington-Sanders, the clinical lead for palliative and end of life care for the Royal College of GPs, added doctors ""still faced uncertainty when determining exactly how long someone has got to live"". ""It makes little sense to have a rigidly set time cap to be a determining factor,"" she said. Payout after mum died following benefit errors Seven out of 10 win benefits challenges in court DWP sees 'sharp rise' in benefit death reviews Affected families and charities said the current process was ""overly complex and stressful"" and it remained unclear when reforms would happen. They have also called for the government to go further and scrap the requirement for people on terminal illness benefits to be reassessed every three years. Helena Reynolds has paid for her funeral up front because she did not want her family to be burdened Helena Reynolds, from Essex, who is terminally ill with intestinal failure, said the current six-month rule was ""pointless"" because ""terminal meant terminal"". ""It's like we've been forgotten. All we're asking for is a little dignity; we shouldn't have to beg for our benefits when we get ill,"" she said. Mrs Reynolds was aged 14 when she was diagnosed with Crohn's disease and had 23 operations on her abdomen before she was awarded Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for life in 1991. When Personal Independence Payment (PIP) replaced DLA in 2019, her benefits were initially cut, but later reinstated on appeal. This year, although her doctor said her condition would ""almost certainlyâ¦prove fatal at some point"", they could not say she had less than six months to live. Instead, she had to re-apply for PIP under the standard route and was given a 10-year PIP award. The longest possible award under special rules would have been for three years. Paul Alexander, policy manager at disability equality charity Scope, said: ""This is a clear example of the system being overly complex, stressful and inconsistent."" ""It doesn't make sense that someone would go from getting a 'lifetime' award, to being refused support from its successor benefit, despite being terminally ill,"" he added. Dr Royston from Marie Curie said few people awarded benefits under special rules lived beyond three years but for the small number who did it was ""inappropriate and insensitive"" they had to make a new application or risk losing support. Christine McCluskey died weighing around 3st (19kg), her daughter Michelle said Christine McCluskey, from Dundee, Scotland, had a history of illnesses including Crohn's Disease, osteoporosis, and suffering a stroke in 2005. She was told her PIP would be stopped and that DWP would try to recoup an overpayment of Employment Support Allowance after a physical assessment, which described her as having a ""slim build"" and being a ""pleasant lady to assess"". She weighed around 5st 6lbs (34.4kg) at the time and was being fed by a drip, her daughter Michelle said. Then she received a terminal lung cancer diagnosis in July 2018. She submitted a form from her doctor to the DWP about her separate terminal diagnosis but a letter came back in September 2018, a month later, to say that information - the form - required her to start a fresh claim. She died the same day aged 61. Michelle believes the application process needs to change so fast-tracked support can be paid automatically to people with a terminal diagnosis. It was ""degrading"" for a person to need to submit a form putting a time frame on their own death, she said. Michelle, who previously shared pictures of her mother with national newspapers to highlight her experience, said: ""You just have to look at her to see she wasn't well and that was before she had cancer."" In February 2019, a tribunal ruled Christine's PIP should not have been cut. The DWP paid the arrears owed. A new benefit called Adult Disability Payment was due to replace PIP in Scotland from spring 2022, which would use a clinician's prognosis of their patient rather than any time limit. Income-based benefits still administered by the DWP, such as Universal Credit, would however still use the DWP's end-of-life definition, which has led to concerns of a developing two-tier system for people applying for benefits in Scotland. Madeleine Moon, former Labour MP for Bridgend, previously sponsored aPrivate Members' Bill,externalin 2018 which proposed to remove the six-month time limit and replace it with a clinical judgment made by an appropriate health professional. Parliamentary time ran out to discuss the bill beyond its first reading in the House of Commons and then Mrs Moon lost her seat. Jessica Morden, Labour MP for Newport East, has now taken up the bill again. Mrs Moon, whose husband Steve died from motor neurone disease in 2015, said: ""The cruelty, if not the inhumanity, of the current system is shocking. This video can not be played Madeleine Moon gave an emotional speech in the House of Commons ""I'm glad the government has accepted the current rules are wrong. ""Most people in the initial shock [of receiving a terminal diagnosis] aren't thinking about benefits, they are thinking what have I got to do to live whatever time I have left. ""You need to plan for the new future and you need to stabilise the family's finances.  What you can't do is spend the time going through the long time to access PIP."" Northern Ireland's communities minister Deirdre Hargey hascommitted to bring forward legislationto widen the eligibility to people with less than a year to live, before the next assembly election is due in May 2022. In July, then-minister for disabled people Justin Tomlinson said Westminster would make the same change for Universal Credit and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) next year and Attendance Allowance, Disability Living Allowance and PIP ""when Parliamentary time allowed"". The DWP reiterated it would make those changes ""so more people could get the vital support they needed"". University of York Professor of Law Charlotte O'Brien, a specialist in welfare law, said it was a different process to change the rules for universal credit and ESA because those rules were in secondary legislation regulations, whereas DLA, PIP and Attendance Allowance were set out in the Welfare Reform Act 2012, so a new Act of Parliament could be required. ""The chances of the government proposing a bill specifically for this are quite slight, as are the chances of them having the time and the Parliamentary bandwidth,"" Prof O'Brien said.
