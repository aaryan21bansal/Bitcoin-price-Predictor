"Iryna Abramov stands outside her destroyed home in Bucha, where her husband was killed. 'I wish they had killed me too,' she said. Volodymyr Abramov was trying desperately to put out the fire in his home, in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, calling out for his son-in-law to help. Russian troops had smashed through the front gates of Volodymyr's home, opened fire at the house, and dragged Volodymyr, 72, his daughter Iryna, 48, and her husband Oleg, 40, out into the yard. The soldiers took Oleg out beyond the gate on to the pavement, Volodymyr said, and threw a grenade in through the front door of the house that exploded with a deafening bang and set the house on fire. Volodymyr grabbed a small fire extinguisher and tried in vain to extinguish the flames. ""Where is Oleg? Oleg will help!"" he shouted to his daughter. But the reply came from one of the Russian soldiers, he said. ""Oleg will not help you any more."" They found Oleg on the pavement outside the gate, and it was clear from the way he was lying that he had been forced to kneel and shot in the head at point blank range, Iryna said. He was a welder who lived a quiet life on the corner of Yablonska Street in Bucha, who was taken out of his home and killed. Volodymyr Abramov stands in the house once shared by his daughter and son-in-law. ""I felt empty when they killed Oleg,"" he said. ""I only wanted to die."" The killing is one of scores - if not hundreds - being uncovered in Bucha after Russian troops withdrew from the Kyiv suburb recently. The mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said on Monday that at least 300 civilians had been killed. There is no official tally yet. Russia has denied any involvement in the atrocities. But its burned-out tanks litter the city. On the grounds of a church, there is an open mass grave with the dead still inside, some in black body bags, some loose in the sand. On the roads, there are bullet-riddled civilian cars - at least one with a body still inside. Houses are caved in by shelling, their driveways ploughed over by tanks. Residents have described Russian soldiers shooting civilians outside their homes with no provocation, and satellite imagery shows that bodies were lying in the streets while the Russians were still in control. The Russian soldiers who killed Oleg Abramov ""did not ask him anything"", his wife Iryna said. ""They didn't ask anything or say anything, they just killed him,"" she said. ""They only told him to take off his shirt, kneel down, and they shot him."" Volodymyr Abramov points to the spot on the pavement outside their house where he says his son-in-law was forced to kneel and shot in the head She wept on Tuesday as she stood on the spot where he was killed, where a dark patch of blood was still visible on the street. When she ran out and found his disfigured body, the four Russian soldiers who dragged him out were standing casually drinking water, she said. She screamed at them to shoot her, and one raised his gun, then lowered it, then raised it again, and lowered it, until Volodymyr dragged her back inside the gate. ""Those soldiers told us we had three minutes to leave and they forced us to run in our slippers,"" Volodymyr said. ""Bucha was like an apocalypse - dead bodies everywhere, the streets full of smoke."" Volodymyr and Iryna had no choice but to leave Oleg's body lying on the street and it lay there for nearly a month while they sheltered at a relative's house nearby. When it was safe to return, Volodymyr tried to bury his son-in-law on a rough patch of earth by the pavement, and the half-dug hole was still visible there on Tuesday. But exhausted by the effort, and afraid of Russian soldiers, Volodymyr carried Oleg back inside the yard and laid him there. Later, Ukrainian soldiers loaded the body into a van, Volodymyr said, and took it away. ""I have no idea how we are going to find it now,"" he said. A mass grave on the grounds of a church in Bucha, where bodies were discovered when the Russians retreated Ukrainian authorities have now cleared the bodies off the streets of Bucha but there are fears more will be found in the basements and yards of private homes. Officials have only just begun the process of cataloguing the horrors. And so great is the damage in Bucha, it is hard to imagine the scale of the reconstruction needed to restore it to the attractive suburb it once was. Along one road through the town on Tuesday, where burned-out tanks were piled up and almost every house was destroyed, 84-year-old Hryhoriy Zamohylnyi was sweeping the street, as if oblivious to the total destruction around him. Somehow, his home was intact - the only building left undamaged along the whole stretch of road. ""I saw the war with the Germans and now this war with the Russians,"" said Zamohylnyi, a former engineer, born and raised in Bucha. ""What you see here is animal cruelty,"" he said. Addressing the UN security council on Tuesday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, accused the Russians of committing the worst crimes since World War Two, and called for those responsible to be tried as the Nazis were in Nuremberg. ""The Russian military searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our country,"" he said. ""They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies."" The ruins of the Abramovs' home in Bucha Ukraine has begun a war crimes investigation into Russia's actions in Bucha and nearby Irpin. It says 410 bodies have been found across the two suburbs so far. There are fears now that more atrocities will be found as the Russians retreat further and more suburbs are opened up - more bodies in the streets, more mass graves. Volodymyr and Iryna Abramov are only looking for one body, and their fear is that they will never find it. ""He was just a peaceful man, a family man, a welder, who struggled with a spine fracture and was disabled all his life,"" Volodymyr said. ""Just before he died, while I was in the yard, I saw him briefly through the open gate, on his knees, and he said his final words. He asked them why.""

"The burden of tax falling on workers and employers has increased as a hotly-debated rise in National Insurance payments takes effect. Employees, businesses and the self-employed will pay an extra 1.25p in the pound. The government says it will spend it on health and social care. Opposition MPs said it exacerbated cost of living pressures, but mitigation will be introduced in July. Experts are urging people to check their status as a new tax year starts. Earnings levels at which people start to pay income tax have been frozen, increasing the chances of employees being dragged into a new band - with a higher rate of tax - if they receive a pay rise. Employees pay National Insurance on their wages, employers pay extra contributions for staff, and the self-employed pay it on their profits. In September, the government announced the rise in contributions from 6 April, in part to help ease the burden on the NHS. It means that, instead of paying National Insurance contributions of 12% on earnings up to Â£50,270 and 2% on anything above that, employees will now pay 13.25% and 3.25% respectively. The self-employed will see equivalent rates go up from 9% and 2% to 10.25% and 3.25%. Businesses face perfect storm as tax rise kicks in What will April's tax changes cost me? Five reasons why prices and bills are going up Javid defends NI tax hike for NHS funding Those of state pension age do not pay the tax at present, and nor do those on very low incomes. After the announcement last year, the plans were met with disapproval from opposition parties and some backbench Conservative MPs who criticised the timing, as many people face sharp rises in energy bills and prices in general. Chancellor Rishi Sunak responded in his Spring Statement with plans to allow workers and the self-employed to earn more before they start making National Insurance payments. This will take effect in July. The National Insurance rise will - ministers like to say - provide a much needed boost to health and social care. They claim it will pay for the care cap and boost NHS capacity to help tackle the backlog in England - it is up to the rest of the UK to decide how they spend the proceeds. But the truth is it will only contribute to that. Rising inflation, staff shortages and ageing equipment and buildings, means the health and care system is going to suck up the Â£39bn raised over the next three years by the hike and then some more. It is also worth bearing in mind the government had already committed to rises for the NHS up until 2024 under a funding settlement agreed by the May government. This had brought the increases to something close to the 4% health has historically got - although the rising inflation that is being seen will whittle that away from now on. And that came after a decade of the budget rising by little more than 1% - an unprecedented squeeze for the health service. The National Insurance rise is not quite all it seems. From now, employees will payNational Insurance contributions,externalon earnings above Â£9,880 a year. From July, it will be paid on earnings above Â£12,570 a year. Taken together, the measures mean that, over the next 12 months, anyone earning less than about Â£34,000 a year will pay less in National Insurance than they did the previous year, while those earning more will see their payments rise. Had the chancellor stuck with his original plan, then all but the very lowest income workers would have paid more in National Insurance. Many employers will still pay more, and business groups have warned that this may be passed on in higher prices. They also said it would add to the pressures already faced by firms following the withdrawal of Covid support measures. Among those concerned about the bill is Hanna Gentry, an assistant general manager at George's Bistro in Cleckheaton. Hanna Gentry says the bar will need to bring in more business ""Personally for me if I look at my wage I think it's not too much, but as a business when you have to pay that on everybody's wages, it adds up really, really quickly,"" she said. ""We are going to try and bring in more custom, that's the only way we can do it - in terms of events, new menus, to try and draw customers in."" Meanwhile James Hipkins, managing director of Emery's Timber and Builders Merchants in Stoke and Telford, told the BBC's Today programme the rise was ""another little extra bit"" to add to the rising cost of materials, fuel and energy. ""My greater concern is, is it the beginning of a perfect storm? By that I just mean all the little snips going up, is it going to start to stifle industry?"" However, Mr Hipkins said society had a ""moral obligation and responsibility to this"" to fund social care services, which he added have been ""overlooked"" for too long. ""We all know it needs sorting out, we all know it needs to be paid for but none of us are particularly keen on paying for it,"" he added. ""At this stage is it seems a bit wishy washy and woolly as it's coming in. I would feel a lot more confident and a lot more happy when I see it as an actual separate levy and it can be identified for where it's supposed to be going."" The government said it had raisedEmployment Allowance,externalfrom Â£4,000 to Â£5,000, so smaller firms could claim up to Â£5,000 off their National Insurance bills. Ministers said it meant 670,000 firms would not pay the tax at all. Overall, the increases in National Insurance for employers and higher-income workers will raise an extra Â£10.9bn in a year for the government, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Prime Minister Boris Johnson described it as ""necessary, fair and responsible"", adding that it would ""provide the health and care system with the long term funding it needs as we recover from the pandemic"". Next year, the extra tax will be rebranded as the Health and Social Care Levy. Health Minister Sajid Javid said the levy was necessary because it would be ""morally wrong"" to let ""our children pay for our healthcare and our adult social care"". The Labour Leader Keir Starmer has condemned the NI rise saying that the UK now has the highest rate of taxation in 70 years. Calling it the ""wrong tax at the wrong time"" he said: ""In the middle of worst cost of living crisis for decades today the government chooses to increase taxes on working people."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the NI rise ""puts all the burden on working people"". An increase in thetax on dividends,externalis also coming into effect, to add to the funds channelled by the government into the NHS and social care. It has also gone up by 1.25p in the pound. Many private investors hold shares in an Individual Savings Account (Isa) which protects them from tax. However, some business owners pay themselves in dividends and so will face a tax rise. Early last year Mr Sunak said the thresholds at which income tax is paid would be frozen at April 2021 levels for five years (although Scotland has different levels). That means pay rises will push more people into higher tax bands. If a pay rise takes somebody from below Â£12,570 a year to above, then they will start paying income tax at 20% on the amount above Â£12,570. A shift in salary from below Â£50,270 to above means paying the higher rate of 40% on the amount above Â£50,270. The next threshold is at Â£150,000, when the additional tax rate of 45% kicks in. Adrian Lowery, personal finance spokesman at investing platform Bestinvest, urged people to check their tax code, which is issued by HM Revenue and Customs and can be found on a pay slip. ""A tax code of 1257L is currently used for most people who have one job or pension. If yours is different, make sure you understand why, so you're not paying too much tax,"" he said. At last month's Spring Statement, Mr Sunak pledged to reduce the basic rate of income tax by 1p in the pound before the end of the Parliament in 2024. For this new tax year, the personal allowance ofcapital gains tax,externalhas also been frozen at Â£12,300, so this much profit can be realised from assets in a year before tax is paid. The threshold forinheritance tax,external- a levy on estates when somebody dies - has also been frozen again at Â£325,000, as it has since 2009. Will the National Insurance cut leave me better off?

"Rishi Sunak said it was wrong for people to criticise his wife Akshata Murty Chancellor Rishi Sunak is facing calls to ""come clean"" on his family's financial affairs after it emerged his wife benefits from a tax-saving scheme. Akshata Murty has non-dom status, meaning she does not have to pay UK tax on income earned abroad. Ms Murty earns money from shares in an Indian software giant founded by her billionaire father. Her spokeswoman said she paid all tax due in the UK - but Labour called for ""complete transparency"". Under the rules, people can be granted non-dom status if they live in the UK but intend to return to their home country. Ms Murty is an Indian citizen and has retained family ties to India. The BBC understands she has said she would eventually like to return there. If she lived in the UK for 15 years she would automatically lose her non-dom status, under the rules, but she has declined to say when it came into effect. Firm part-owned by Sunak's wife closing Russia office I know how Will Smith felt at Oscars, says Sunak National Insurance rise starts to hit pay packets Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Sunak had ""very serious questions to answer"" about his family's finances. ""If it now transpires that his wife has used schemes to reduce her tax, while he's been increasing taxes on working people, that's breathtaking hypocrisy,"" said Sir Keir. It ""just goes to show just how out of touch this chancellor is"" at a time when taxes are increasing for millions of workers, he added. Labour has written to the chancellor demanding to know if he has benefited from Ms Murty's tax status. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said: ""Sunak now needs to come clean about which country his family pays tax in abroad and if it is a tax haven."" The Lib Dems have urged Mr Sunak to ban the partners of ministers from claiming non-dom status, calling it a ""loophole"". But Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng defended Mr Sunak, saying it was ""completely unfair"" to scrutinise the tax affairs of Ms Murty, ""who is not a politician"". He also rejected opposition claims that she was ""sheltering"" from UK taxes. He told BBC Breakfast: ""I think she's been very clear, she's been very transparent, the chancellor's been very transparent, and this non-dom status has been part of the UK tax system for more than 200 years."" When asked about the criticism of Mr Sunak over his wife's tax affairs, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""I think it's very important in politics to keep people's families out of it."". Last week, Mr Sunak told the BBC it was ""very upsetting"" to see his wife being criticised in the media, as she was not an elected politician. A non-dom is a UK resident who declares their permanent home, or domicile, outside of the UK. A domicile is usually the country his or her father considered his permanent home when they were born, or it may be the place overseas where somebody has moved to with no intention of returning. For proof to the tax authority, non-doms have to provide evidence about their background, lifestyle and future intentions, such as where they own property or intend to be buried. Non-domiciled tax status was introduced in 1799 to protect colonial investments during the time of the British Empire. Those who have it must still pay UK tax on UK earnings but do not need to pay UK tax on foreign income. They can give up their non-dom status at any time by stating on your tax return that you intend to live in the UK and wish to be considered British for tax purposes. Ms Murty has chosen to be domiciled in India via her father, the billionaire Narayana Murty, which means she doesn't need to pay taxes in the UK on dividends she receives from her stake in her dad's company, thought to be worth hundreds of millions of pounds. Non-dom status has been a frequent source of political controversy. Wealthy Conservative politicians, such as former party chairman Lord Ashcroft and environment minister Lord Goldsmith, have faced criticism over claiming it, although Lord Goldsmith has now given up his non-dom status. Ms Murty confirmed her non-dom status afterit was reported by the Independent website,externalon Wednesday. ""Akshata Murty is a citizen of India, the country of her birth and parents' home,"" her spokeswoman said. ""India does not allow its citizens to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously. So, according to British law, Ms Murty is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes. ""She has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income."" But tax experts have questioned her statement, suggesting that non-dom status is a ""choice"" that people can give up. ""Domicile has nothing to do with a person's nationality,"" said Professor Richard Murphy, co-founder of left-wing campaign group the Tax Justice Network. He added: ""Just because a person has Indian citizenship will never automatically grant them non-dom status in the UK."" This video can not be played Rishi Sunak and Will Smith both saw their wives mocked, but the chancellor says: ""At least I didn't get up and slap anybody."" Ms Murty was born in India in 1980 and holds an Indian passport. In 2009, she married Mr Sunak, who became the MP for Richmond, North Yorkshire, in 2015. The couple, who have two daughters, have a flat in Downing Street, and own a number of properties in the UK  including a Â£1.5m home in his constituency, and a property in Santa Monica, California. Ms Murty's father founded the IT services company Infosys which has grown to be one of India's biggest firms. She owns a little under 1% of its shares, worth more than Â£500m. She also has interests in several companies in the UK. Last monththe Telegraph reported,externalMs Murty would have received Â£11.6m in dividends from Infosys in the past tax year. Her non-dom status means she would not have had to pay UK tax on those dividends, which is currently charged at a rate of 39.35%. Indian tax authorities say dividend income is taxable at the rate of 20% for non-residents unless they qualify for any deductions. But the dividend rate can come down to 10% for people who are eligible to benefit from the UK's tax treaty with India. Asked if Ms Murty paid tax on her Infosys dividend payments in India, her representative said ""international tax"" was paid on her ""international income"". It is not clear, however, whether she pays tax on her dividend income in India or another jurisdiction. In its letter to Mr Sunak, Labour asked if his wife pays all foreign tax in India or in a tax haven such as the Cayman Islands. Mr Sunak made the Cabinet Office aware of his wife's tax status as part of his declaration of interests when he first became a government minister in 2018.

"A Home Office minister has said he ""has not seen any feuding"" between government departments over how to deal with Ukrainian refugees. Lord Harrington insisted ""raised voices"" in meetings were the result of a desire shared by all ministers to ""do the same thing"" and help people. He also revealed that 29,000 visas had been issued to Ukrainians, with around 65,000 applications received so far. But Labour said the government had to ""step up to the plate"". Several newspapers have reported that Home Secretary Priti Patel and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss have argued over how to clear a backlog of Ukrainian refugees' applications, amid reports that only ""hundreds"" of people have so far made it to the UK. UK offers Â£350 a month to Ukrainian refugee hosts UK can and will do more for refugees - minister How the sex trade preys on Ukraine's refugees 100,000 sign up to UK's refugee site in first day The BBC understands that HM Revenue and Customs and Department for Work and Pensions staff are now helping with the processing of Ukrainian refugees. A Home Office source said a ""cross-government effort"" was under way. Lord Harrington, making his maiden speech since becoming a minister, said during a Lords debate: ""I've not seen this feuding between departments that's reported."" He told peers he had attended meetings with Home Secretary Priti Patel and Housing and Communities Secretary Michael Gove, among others, adding: ""I've seen raised voices because we are all trying to do the same thing, but not [because we are angry] with each other... ""What happens behind closed doors, I couldn't possibly know... I've not experienced [feuding] myself."" This video can not be played Ukraine refugees: Visa process is 'beyond lengthy' Lord Harrington said the immediate vetting of refugees should, at most, include passport checks, verifying whether people are on criminal watch lists, checking whether children travelling with adults are actually theirs, and checking whether sponsors have criminal records - the last two designed to prevent people trafficking. ""That's really it,"" he added, saying that ""it's taken too long to do it"" so far. The government is operating two schemes to help Ukrainians displaced by Russia's invasion to come to the UK - involving living with family members already in the country or sponsorship by other hosts. For Labour, shadow Home Office minister Lord Coaker said: ""There's a bureaucratic mess here and a bureaucratic quagmire and it needs to be sorted out. ""The British people want better from their government... They want their government to step up to the plate.""

"Viatcheslav Kantor, pictured with President Putin, has funded a new wing at the Edward VII hospital A major financial donor of the private hospital used by the Queen, King Edward VII's hospital, has been put on the UK list of sanctioned Russian oligarchs. Viatcheslav Kantor, whose name is still above the door of the central London hospital, faces sanctions over Ukraine. The hospital recently opened the Kantor Medical Centre, funded by Dr Kantor, and so far is keeping its name. The King Edward VII's is where the Queen has gone for medical care, including a night's stay last autumn. The hospital describes itself as an ""independent charitable hospital with a proud history of royal patronage, discreetly located within London's Harley Street medical district"". Prince Philip and other members of the Royal Family have also been treated there. Dr Kantor has been described by the UK government as the ""largest shareholder of fertilizer company Acron with vital strategic significance for the Russian government"". Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: ""We are showing the Russian elite that they cannot wash their hands of the atrocities committed on Putin's orders."" Dr Kantor had been ""life governor"" of the hospital but has stepped down from this role and from the board of trustees. The private hospital has treated members of the Royal Family The oligarch's significant donations to the hospital have funded the Kantor Medical Centre, opened this year, which has seven floors of treatment and diagnostic services. It includes new facilities for MRI and CT scans, ultrasound, X-rays and consulting rooms and will have rooms for minor procedures. Outspoken royals show their colours over Ukraine More sanctions on Russia from the US and UK Dr Kantor, funder of the Kantor Charitable Foundation, has been a donor to many charities and arts projects in the UK. The foundation's online photo gallery shows him with Russian President Vladimir Putin, among other international figures. At the outbreak of the war in Ukraine the hospital had defended the acceptance of donations from the UK-registered charity funded by Dr Kantor. ""We share the deep concern felt by people across the world at the invasion of Ukraine,"" said a statement from the hospital. Those on the sanctions list are subject to asset freezes, meaning anyone in the UK or any UK company is prevented from dealing with any funds or property that is owned by them. Dr Kantor is among eight oligarchs who were added to the UK's sanctions list as part of its latest package of measures in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The others included fertiliser firm founder Andrey Guryev,  truck manufacturing firm director Sergey Kogogin, diamond producer Sergey Sergeyevich Ivanov, natural gas firm boss Leonid Mikhelson, Gazprombank chief executive Andrey Akimov, oil producer Gazpromneft chief executive Aleksander Dyukov, and Boris Borisovich Rotenberg - the son of the co-owner of Russia's largest gas pipeline producer SGM. Other sanctions include asset freezes on Russia's largest bank, Sberbank, and Credit Bank of Moscow, as well as plans to end imports of Russian coal and oil by the end of the year.

"Up to eight more nuclear reactors could be approved on existing sites as part of the UK's new energy strategy. The strategy, which aims to boost UK energy independence and tackle rising prices, also includes plans to increase wind, hydrogen and solar production. But experts have called for a bigger focus on energy efficiency and improving home insulation. Consumers are facing soaring energy bills after the Russian invasion of Ukraine pushed gas prices even higher. Under the government's new plans,external, up to 95% of the UK's electricity could come from low-carbon sources by 2030. It outlines, for example, the hope of producing up to 50 gigawatts (GW) of energy through offshore wind farms, which the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis) said would be more than enough to power every home in the UK. The government's energy strategy has been much-delayed, with one of the big points of contention reported to have been the construction of onshore wind turbines. Nuclear- The government plans to reduce the UK's reliance on oil and gas by building as many as eight new nuclear reactors, including two at Sizewell in Suffolk. A new body will oversee the delivery of the new plants. Wind- The government aims to reform planning laws to speed up approvals for new offshore wind farms. For onshore wind farms it wants to develop partnerships with ""supportive communities"" who want to host turbines in exchange for guaranteed cheaper energy bills. Hydrogen- Targets for hydrogen production are being doubled to help provide cleaner energy for industry as well as for power, transport and potentially heating. Solar- The government will consider reforming rules for installing solar panels on homes and commercial buildings to help increase the current solar capacity by up to five times by 2035. Oil and gas- A new licensing round for North Sea projects is being launched in the summer on the basis that producing gas in the UK has a lower carbon footprint than doing so abroad. Heat pumps- There will be a Â£30m ""heat pump investment accelerator competition"" to make British heat pumps which reduce demand for gas. Environmentalists and many energy experts have reacted with disbelief and anger at some of the measures in the strategy. They cannot believe the government has offered no new policies on saving energy by insulating buildings. They say energy efficiency would immediately lower bills and emissions, and is the cheapest way to improve energy security. A Downing Street source said the strategy was now being seen as an energysupplystrategy. Campaigners are also furious that ministers have committed to seeking more oil and gas in the North Sea, even though humans have already found enough fossil fuels to wreck the climate. There is a strong welcome, though, for the promise of more energy from wind offshore with speedier planning consent. The same boost has not been offered to onshore wind. The decision to boost nuclear has drawn a mixed reaction. Some environmentalists say it's too dear and too dangerous. They ridicule the idea from some politicians that every city could have its own mini reactor. But other climate campaigners believe nuclear must be part of the energy mix. The new strategy says the government wants to ""lead the world once again"" in nuclear power, reversing what it describes as ""decades of underinvestment"". The government announced that a new body called Great British Nuclear will be launched to bolster the UK's nuclear capacity, with the hope that by 2050 up to 24 GW of electricity will come from that source - 25% of the projected electricity demand. The focus on nuclear could deliver up to eight new reactors to be built on existing sites. The government hopes to have a new reactor approved each year until 2030 with the aim to have them up and running by 2050. It also confirmed advanced plans to approve two new reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk during this parliament. Wylfa in Anglesey and Oldbury in South Gloucestershire have also been named as candidates to host either large-scale plants, smaller modular nuclear reactors, or possibly both. The Great British Nuclear body will identify other appropriate sites. Tom Greatrex, boss of the Nuclear Industry Association, said the plans marked a ""vital step forward"" for the UK to meet its climate goals, and could create thousands of jobs. ""The ambition and determination to do much more and quicker is very welcome,"" he said. What's in the UK's new energy strategy? Will the UK's energy strategy work? How much nuclear power does the UK use? How high could my energy bills go? The government said it would reform planning rules to cut approval times for new offshore wind farms, with the ambition that by 2030 more than half of the UK's renewable capacity will be wind. For onshore wind, the strategy commits to consulting on developing partnerships with ""a limited number of supportive communities"" who want to host wind turbines in exchange for guaranteed lower energy bills. However, the strategy says there will be no ""wholesale changes"" to current planning regulations for onshore wind. Although it is one of the cheapest forms of energy, new onshore wind projects have been declining since 2015 when the government ended subsidies and introduced stricter planning rules in response to some complaints that wind turbines were an eyesore and noisy. Defending the decision not to prioritise onshore wind, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK already had about 30GW of onshore wind capacity. Speaking at the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, he said onshore wind farms were ""controversial"" because of their visual impact and new sites ""will have a very high bar to clear"". The prime minister visited the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset on Thursday Mr Johnson said the strategy was about ""tackling the mistakes of the past and making sure that we are set well for the future"". Citing policies including a Â£6bn energy efficiency fund and support for heat pumps, he said the government was ""already doing a huge amount to help people with the immediate cost of living and of course we are going to do more"". But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised the strategy as ""too little"" and ""too late"" to help people with rising costs. ""All we've got today is a cobbled-together list of things that could and should have been done over the last 10 to 12 years and it doesn't even tackle really important things like insulating homes, which could save Â£400 on everybody's bill,"" he said. Green Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said it ""did not serve the needs of people or the climate"". Mr Ramsay suggested that if the government was ""concerned about energy bills and taking real climate action, it would be going even further on onshore wind"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the plans as ""utterly hopeless"", while the SNP's Stephen Flynn called it a ""missed opportunity"". No plans for new nuclear reactors in Scotland UK nuclear boost plan gives Anglesey plant hope Former Ofgem boss Dermot Nolan said: ""Most of these decisions will take a long time to have an impact and in the short run we will continue to be dependent on fossil fuels."" He said the lack of focus on energy efficiency, on insulation, on improving the quality of people's homes ""is an opportunity missed"". Dr Simon Cran-McGreehin, head of analysis at the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit said:  ""This is an immediate problem that needs solutions now, and this doesn't do anything on prices."" ""It tries to do some things on energy supply, but they're all medium to long-term measures. So it does seem to fail the exam question,"" he added. Will the UK's energy strategy work?

"Ed Sheeran says the culture of copyright claims is ""really damaging to the songwriting industry"" Ed Sheeran has warned that pop stars should not be allowed to be ""easy targets"" for copyright claims after winning his court battle with the writers of a song they claimed he had plagiarised. A High Court judge ruled that the singer had not copied part of his hit, Shape of You, from Oh Why, by Sami Chokri. That prompted Sheeranto declare on Instagram,external: ""I hope that this ruling means in the future baseless claims like this can be avoided. ""This really does have to end."" The case was not the first time Sheeran has faced a copyright claim, and many other stars have also been involved in high-profile disputes in recent years. Ed Sheeran wins Shape of You copyright case Last month,Katy Perry won a case on appealafter a rapper said she had plagiarised an eight-note riff for her 2013 hit Dark Horse. Dua Lipa has recently been sued twice over her song Levitating, the biggest-selling single in the US last year. Those claims have come from the writers behind Latin disco band Dr Buzzard's Original Savannah Band and Florida reggae group Artikal Sound System. Also last month, Sam Smith and Normani were sued over their 2019 duet Dancing With A Stranger, while Taylor Swift is facing a trial over her 2014 anthem Shake It Off. Taylor Swift faces trial over Shake It Off lyrics Nicki Minaj pays $450,000 for Tracy Chapman sample Lana Del Rey and Radiohead 'settle dispute' As the music industry saying goes, where there's a hit, there's a writ. The field of music copyright ""has become like the Wild West"", says forensic musicologist Peter Oxendale, who worked with Sheeran in this latest case. He says cases have proliferated since 2015, when Blurred Lines creatorsRobin Thicke and Pharrell Williams were found guiltyin the US of copying the ""feel"" of Marvin Gaye's Got To Give It Up, rather than directly plagiarising musical phrases or lyrics. ""In that case, [there] wasn't even two notes in common, and yet it found in favour of the wrong side,"" Oxendale told BBC Radio 4's The World At One. Part of the melody in Shape of You did bear some similarity to a segment of Oh Why - but Sheeran successfully argued in the High Court that it was a coincidence and he had not heard the other song before. This video can not be played Watch Ed Sheeran's Shape of You and Sami Chokri's Oh Why Sheeran took legal action after Switch - real name Sami Chokri - and fellow songwriter Ross O'Donoghue asked to be added to the songwriting credits for Shape of You, which is the most streamed song ever on Spotify. However, the judge ruled that Sheeran would be justified in thinking their request ""was a tactic designed to extract a settlement"" - in other words, money and/or a credit without going to court. Sheeran said: ""I feel like claims like this are way too common now and have become a culture where a claim is made with the idea that a settlement will be cheaper than taking it to court, even if there's no basis for the claim. ""It's really damaging to the songwriting industry. There's only so many notes and very few chords used in pop music. Coincidence is bound to happen if 60,000 songs are being released every day on Spotify. That's 22 million songs a year, and there's only 12 notes that are available."" Allow Instagram content?

Sheeran's plea for an end to ""baseless claims"" will find sympathetic ears among other musicians. ""It should never have got as far as it did,"" Grammy-winning composerDavid Arnold wrote,externalof the Sheeran case. ""Hopefully this result brings about a change in the avalanche of frivolous speculative copyright infringement cases."" But Wednesday's ruling won't bring copyright cases to an end. It won't even bring cases against Ed Sheeran to an end. He's facing another trial in the USafter being sued for $100m (Â£76m) by the owner of a share of the songwriting rights to Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On, who claims Sheeran copied it for his 2014 chart-topper Thinking Out Loud. He has also settled cases out of court in the past. In 2018, he paid $5.4m (Â£4.1m) to songwriters Thomas Leonard and Martin Harringtonafter being accused of copying their trackAmazing (which was released by X Factor winner Matt Cardle in 2012) for Sheeran's 2015 song, Photograph. In the latest trial, the star said he had been ""bruised"" by that experience. Even though he felt he had done nothing wrong, he said he had agreed to pay out on the advice of his lawyers because it would have been a ""nuisance"" and ""more trouble than it was worth"" to fight. The writers of TLC's No Scrubs have a credit on Shape of You After the Shape of You ruling, Oxendale said: ""I'm full of admiration for Ed Sheeran in this case because he could easily have taken the easy way out, which is just to give them a nuisance payment to go away. ""But he didn't. He chose to fight it and fighting cases in the High Court is traumatic for anyone. It's difficult. It's really expensive. It's time-consuming."" Sheeran had already giventhe writers of TLC's 1999 hit No Scrubsa credit on Shape of You several years ago after similarities were pointed out. In recent years, more stars have given the composers of potentially problematic tracks credits before a dispute gets anywhere near a court. Taylor Swift famously credited 1990s British pop duo Right Said Fredon her 2017 single Look What You Made Me Do because it follows the same rhythmic pattern as I'm Too Sexy. Last year, Olivia Rodrigo added two members of Paramore to the writing credits of Good 4 U, and the number of writers on Uptown Funk, by Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars, ballooned from six to 11 when The Gap Band noticed similarities to their song Oops Upside Your Head. Part of Chokri and O'Donoghue's complaint was that Sheeran treats unknown songwriters worse than famous ones when it comes to giving credits - which he denied. But the case rested on the fact that he insisted he had never heard their song, so could not have copied it either consciously or subconsciously - which would have been more difficult to argue if Oh Why had been a hit. Sheeran gave evidence at the High Court trial last month Copyright lawyer Kate Swaine says: ""If I was advising somebody who's been accused of copyright infringement, the first thing I would ask them is, 'Is there a possibility that you could have, unconsciously or consciously, been influenced, inspired or taken an element of this?' ""If somebody turns around and says, 'I do know that track really well. I have heard it. It's not out of the question,' they may feel that, rather than getting into the cost and disruption of a court action, it is easier to make a concession and therefore give some credit on the royalties. ""Here, what comes across from Sheeran's evidence is he was absolutely adamant that he had not heard this track."" She sees little chance of the number of copyright claims subsiding. But she says that despite the Blurred Lines ruling, ""the law seems to be doing a reasonably decent job"" of assessing when there is sufficient evidence of copyright infringement, and when there is not.

"Emily Bridges previously set a national junior men's record over 25 miles and was selected to join British Cycling's senior academy in 2019 UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he does not believe transgender women should compete in female sporting events - a view he conceded may be ""controversial"". The issue of transgender athletes - centred around the balance of inclusion, sporting fairness and safety in women's sport - has recently focused on the case of transgender cyclist Emily Bridges. Bridges was recentlyruled ineligibleto compete in her first elite women's race by cycling's world governing body. Johnson was speaking on a range of issues, including the government's approach to theban on so-called conversion therapy,before adding: ""I don't think biological males should be competing in female sporting events. Maybe that's a controversial thing to say, but it just seems to me to be sensible. ""I also happen to think that women should have spaces - whether it's in hospitals, prison or changing rooms - which are dedicated to women. That's as far as my thinking has developed on this issue. ""If that puts me in conflict with some others, then we have got to work it all out. It doesn't mean I'm not immensely sympathetic to people who want to change gender, to transition and it's vital we give people the maximum love and support in making those decisions. ""These are complex issues and they can't be solved with one swift, easy piece of legislation. It takes a lot of thought to get this right."" In response to Johnson's comments, LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall said: ""Trans people deserve the same opportunities as everyone else to enjoy the benefits of sport and blanket exclusions on trans people participating are fundamentally unfair. ""This is a complex and fast-evolving issue and much of the science doesn't yet exist in this area. ""Inclusion policies need to be considered on a sport by sport basis and it's vital to avoid using inflammatory rhetoric, which often causes trans people to stop playing the sports they love."" Stonewall said that although elite sport ""often dominates these discussions"", transgender people are also ""underrepresented in community sport"" where they ""often feel excluded"". The organisation added: ""Sport has the unique power to bring us together and it's important trans people have the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of sport without facing exclusion or abuse."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'I don't think biological males should compete in female sporting events' Johnson's comments came asa letter signed,externalby a group of elite female cyclists - including retired Olympians, scientists and researchers - called on cycling's world governing body, the UCI, to ""rescind"" its rules around transgender participation and testosterone levels and implement eligibility criteria for women ""based on female biological characteristics"". The letter - referring to the Bridges situation - said there was ""deep regret"" at the ""crisis situation"", claiming female athletes in the UK ""have shown you they were willing to boycott"" in order for the UCI and British Cycling ""to hear their concerns about fairness in their sport"". The letter included the signature of Sara Symington, head of Olympic and Paralympic programmes at British Cycling. It states: The group says current transgender rules should be ""rescinded"" unless the UCI can provide ""robust scientific evidence that the rules guarantee fairness for female athletes"" Lower testosterone levels ""cannot sufficiently mitigate all male sport advantage"" Current rules are ""asymmetric"" and ""discriminatory"" and UCI needs to ""better involve"" the ""independent voice of elite female athletes"" In response, British Cycling said: ""We understand that this is an important issue for our staff and riders, which is why we have worked hard to provide forums for them to openly share their views on our policy and transgender inclusion more widely. ""These discussions are an important part of our commitment to learn and understand more about how the sport sector can achieve fairness in a way that maintains the dignity and respect of all athletes."" In the aftermath of being prevented from competing in her first female race as a transgender woman, Bridgesreleased a statementsaying she felt ""harassed and demonised"" and had ""little clarity"" on her eligibility. ""I am an athlete and I just want to race competitively again. I hope they will reconsider their decision in line with the regulations,"" she said. ""I've been relentlessly harassed and demonised by those who have a specific agenda to push. ""They attack anything that isn't the norm. This is without care for the wellbeing of individuals or marginalised groups."" Bridges says her privacy has also been ""totally violated"" and she has received ""targeted abuse"" on social media. According toCycling Weekly,,externalBridges has been participating in a study at Loughborough University to track her own power data with reduced testosterone levels - and says they show a 13-16% drop in her power outputs across different durations. Bridges also says she has received a mixed response on speaking publicly about her transition, but added that many female cyclists have sent messages of support. Emily Bridges says she has provided medical evidence of her consistently lower testosterone levels over 12 months to meet existing eligibility criteria to compete in women's races Bridges, 21, had been set to race at Britain's National Omnium Championships in Derby last weekend, which were won by Sophie Lewis. Shecame out as transgender,externalin October 2020 and began hormone therapy in 2021 as part of her gender dysphoria treatment. She had been allowed to enter women's events by British Cycling because of her consistently lowered levels of testosterone. British Cycling's transgender regulations require riders to have had testosterone levels below five nanomoles per litre for a 12-month period prior to competition. However, the UCI has not yet completed its own process around Bridges' eligibility to race in international competitions - meaning she could not participate. The UCI rules on transgender inclusion also state it must ""protect health and safety"" and ""guarantee fair and meaningful competition that displays and rewards the fundamental values and meaning of the sport"". BBC Sport understandssenior figures in cycling believethese discretions are relevant in Bridges' case. In May 2021 - while still transitioning and racing in male events - she finished 43rd out of 45 riders in the elite men's criterium at the Loughborough Cycling Festival and in September she was second to last in the Welsh National Championship road race, a 12km lap behind the winner. Last month, Bridges won a men's points race at the British Universities Championships in Glasgow - her final men's race. Following the UCI decision on Bridges, British Cycling said it ""fully recognises her disappointment"" but called for ""a coalition"" across a number of sports - involving governing bodies, athletes, the transgender and non-binary athlete community and the government - to work together to ""find a better answer"" in a way which ""maintains the dignity and respect of all athletes"". British Cycling said: ""We also understand that, in elite sports, the concept of fairness is essential. ""Transgender and non-binary inclusion is bigger than one race and one athlete - it is a challenge for all elite sports."" On the eve of the UCI's decision on Bridges' eligibility, UCI president David Lappartient told BBC Sport he was ""worried"" transgender athletes could affect the fairness of competition in cycling, and said current rules based on testosterone levels were ""probably not enough"". Lappartient said world cycling's governing body ""fully recognises the rights of transgender athletes to do sport"". He added: ""When I speak with some professors in medicine, some specialists, they say 'yes your body probably has a memory already of what you are and so there is maybe some advantages'. Is it a bridge of fair competition? ""The question of fair competition is really a question we must put on the table and is it right to take part - when you do transition - at the highest level? Or do we have also to see if this affects the fairness of competition. ""I can also really understand some ladies saying: 'OK, but we don't accept this'. And today I also [have] the union of the women's riders completely against this and challenging the UCI on this. ""So we are in between and we were challenged on all parts."" This video can not be played We fully recognise the rights of transgender cyclists - UCI president The most recentInternational Olympic Committeeguidance - updated in November 2021 after the Tokyo Olympics -said there should be no assumptionthat a transgender athlete automatically has an unfair advantage in female events. It recommended that individual sports under the Olympic umbrella - such as athletics, weightlifting, gymnastics and swimming - make their own rules surrounding transgender athletes. World Athleticshas set five nanomoles per litre as its benchmark, with cycling set at below five nanomoles. World Rugbyhas banned trans women from playing at elite level, while the Rugby Football Union's domestic policy in England does allow trans women to play, under certain testosterone-based conditions. However, the IOC guidelines havebeen criticisedby somemedical experts, 38 of whom signed a statement questioning the changes made to its policy around testosterone suppressants in transgender women. The sporting body said relying on testosterone levels alone in female events was no longer deemed sufficient grounds to determine whether or not a competitor has an unfair advantage. But some medical professionals said the guidance was drafted mainly from a human rights perspective with little consideration of medical and scientific issues. There has also been new guidance around transgender inclusion in non-elite sport, created in 2021.It was publishedafter an 18-month consultation and review of the existing research and was developed bySport England, Sport Scotland, Sport Northern Ireland, Sport Wales and UK Sport. It said that ""for many sports, the inclusion of transgender people, fairness and safety cannot co-exist in a single competitive model"". The report concluded that ""testosterone suppression is unlikely to guarantee fairness between transgender women and natal females in gender-affected sports"". And it added that there are ""retained differences in strength, stamina and physique between the average woman compared with the average transgender woman or non-binary person registered male at birth"". It challenged sport bodies to ""think in innovative and creative ways to ensure nobody is left out"", and stipulates individual sports may need to choose between inclusion or ""competitive fairness"" - and safety if relevant. The guidance suggests for those sports where safety or fairness could be compromised, the individual sports could create an ""open"" or ""universal"" category separate to male and female ones.

"Oil prices are about 70% higher than they were a year ago The bosses of some of the world's biggest energy firms vowed to increase production this year as they defended themselves from accusations of profiteering from the war in Ukraine. Chiefs at ExxonMobil, Chevron and others said in Washington that they had little power over oil prices, which have soared after Russia's invasion. Prices remain more than 15% higher than they were at the end of January. The increase has raised energy costs for households around the world. In the US, where mid-term elections will be held in November, it has also become a major political issue, weighing on President Biden's support. The US and other members of the International Energy Agency (IEA) have repeatedly tapped reserves to alleviate the crisis. Just last week, the US pledged to release 180 million barrels of oil over the next six months, while the IEA announced on Wednesday that other members would release a further 60 million barrels from storage. But energy executives at the congressional hearing warned that there was ""no quick fix"" to the problem. Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? How other countries are dealing with the energy crisis They said their investments, many already in the works, will raise output this year, but warned that staffing and supply issues stemming from the pandemic meant it is taking longer to start new production. ""What can be done to ensure vital energy products remain available and affordable?"" asked Darren Woods, chief executive of ExxonMobil. ""While there is no quick fix, the answer in the near-term, until there are more widely available and affordable alternatives, is straightforward. We need to increase the supply of oil and natural gas."" Energy prices were already increasing before Russia's invasion, as firms struggled to respond to disruption from the pandemic, which prompted a dramatic collapse in demand in 2020, followed by a faster-than-expected rebound. Following Russia's invasion, Western allies hit the country with severe sanctions, disrupting oil markets and raising concerns about their supplies. The country is the world's second-largest exporter of crude oil, accounting for about 10% of global output. Oil prices are up roughly 70% from a year ago, accelerating in recent months. Doreen Aniakor has picked up extra work due to rising costs New Yorker Doreen Aniakor says the dramatic rise in petrol prices means her car now costs $100 (Â£76.50) to fill. In response, she has stopped filling her tank in one go and started cutting off the engine at red lights to save fuel. The 36-year-old, who works as a dental assistant and for hospitals, also recently picked up a fourth part-time job. She now delivers groceries for Instacart in an effort to cover the extra costs. ""In this day and age, you just do what you got to do,"" she said, ""I have to figure out sometimes how to eat... It's ridiculous."" At the hearing, Democrats said oil firms were ""lining their own pockets"" as petrol prices have not fallen as rapidly as oil, noting the rise in profits since 2022. ""At a time of record profits, Big Oil is refusing to increase production to provide the American people some much needed relief at the gas pump,"" said Rep. Frank Pallone, a Democrat from New Jersey. Democrats pressed energy firms to halt stock buybacks and said the energy crisis should spur a faster turn to greener energy sources. Republicans blamed policies backed by President Joe Biden for the higher costs, accusing him of an ""assault"" on the US energy industry with actions such as halting oil and gas leases on public lands.

"P&O Ferries hopes to get two ships back in action, subject to inspection by the coastguard. P&O Ferries has said it is preparing to get its Pride of Kent and Spirit of Britain ships back in action on the Dover-Calais route ""by next week"". The ferries will need to pass inspections by the Maritime Coastguard Agency (MCA) before services can resume. There has not yet been any confirmation that the inspections, which can take days, have been booked in. Holiday-makers and lorry drivers have faced queues near Dover in recent days. Bad weather and the disruption to P&O services had caused long queues of traffic as the Easter holidays started for some. P&O Ferries had confirmed yesterday that all of its Dover-Calais routes would remain suspended this weekend, and that another ferry operator, DFDS, would not be able to take P&O customers. The company expects the Pride of Kent and the Spirit of Britain will be sailing next week. A P&O Ferries spokesperson said: ""From this weekend, P&O Ferries are getting ready to resume services across a number of vital routes. ""P&O has been working closely with regulators to ensure our ships are safe to sail. P&O is looking forward to welcoming back vital services and we expect to have two of our vessels ready to sail on the Dover-Calais route by next week, subject to regulatory signoff,"" they added. They also apologised to customers whose journeys had been cancelled or disrupted. Following the no-notice sacking of 786 seafarers by P&O Ferries, passengers hoping to cross the channel have been left with fewer travel options. The company said on Wednesday it was providing refunds to all passengers booked to travel with them who cannot get on alternative services. Two P&O Ferries boats have been detained so far after failing to pass inspections by the MCA - including the Pride of Kent. Safety concerns have been raised over the replacement of employees with less experienced agency workers paid less than the UK minimum wage. The Pride of Kent was detained for a mix of reasons including failures on documentation, crew training and emergency equipment not working properly. This video can not be played ""How do you sleep at night?"" - MSP Monica Lennon questions P&O Ferries boss P&O Ferries hit out at the time, saying in a statement that inspections of its ships had reached ""an unprecedent level of rigour"" after interventions by ministers. Another P&O Ferries vessel, the European Causeway - which runs between Larne and Cairnryan - failed an MCA Port State Control inspection in March. It is among the services P&O is getting ready to resume, along with the Pride of Hull, which runs services between Hull and Rotterdam. In total, eight P&O Ferries need to be inspected so that the MCA is satisfied they are safe to carry passengers and freight. The government recently announced a package of measures aimed at forcing P&O Ferries to ""fundamentally rethink"" its decision, which drew outrage from politicians, trade unions and the public. They included plans to create new laws giving ports the power to block ferries from docking in the UK if they do not pay their crew the national minimum wage. Ferry industry groups, however, hit out at the transport secretary's plans, with the UK Major Ports Group saying they should not have to ""be the police for the labour practices of ferry companies"". P&O's chief executive, Peter Hebblethwaite, has insisted that a U-turn on the redundancies would cause the company's total collapse, leading to a loss of an additional 2,200 jobs. The company also faces criminal and civil investigations into the circumstances around the redundancies.

"This video can not be played Why the divorce law changes matter The most far-reaching change in divorce laws in decades has come into force - ending the need for separating couples to blame one of themselves. The launch of no-fault divorces for England and Wales comes after years of campaigning by family lawyers. They argue the removal of blame from divorce will help more people rebuild their lives and protect children. A form of no-fault divorce exists in Scotland - but blame rules will remain in force in Northern Ireland. Under the old rules in England and Wales, anyone who wanted to split swiftly had to accuse their partner in a divorce petition of desertion, adultery or unreasonable behaviour. If not, they had to spend two years apart if both partners agreed, or five, if one of the couple objected to the split. Most family law experts have long said the system exacerbated problems for a separating couple - making it harder for them to agree over finances, assets and the future of their children. It also trapped people in loveless and sometimes abusive marriages as the dissenting partner controlled the one who wanted to leave. One partner, or both acting together, can file for divorce, without having to give a reason or apportion blame. A statement that their marriage is over will, in most cases, be all the proof the court needs. There is a 20-week period between starting proceedings and applying for a conditional order, and a further six-week period before divorce is granted. The same no-fault rule applies to the dissolution of civil partnerships. Judges will still step in to resolve disputes over children, maintenance or the just division of wealth. But those cases aside, legal experts say that the reforms will help a huge number of the 100,000 couples who divorce every year - people like Olivia Jack from north London. Olivia Jack: Didn't want blame to harm children When Ms Jack concluded in 2018 her marriage was over, she was shocked when a divorce lawyer explained she would have to blame her husband if she wanted out quickly. ""I felt very uncomfortable right from the beginning,"" she says. ""Someone had to be the bad guy. So, once I found out about the need to apportion blame, that put the brakes on. ""It felt that it was not going to be useful to the divorce process, especially when young children were involved."" The couple decided to wait out the two years - and they used the time to work with a divorce coach to agree how best to look after their children and divide their assets. At the end of the two-year period, they legally parted - the closest they could come to a quick no-fault divorce. Olivia says she and her ex-husband would have used the new law had it been available, because they wanted to part without becoming enemies for life. And it's a view shared by the divorce law profession. Divorce lawyer Karen Dovaston: Lawyers have lobbied for the change for years Karen Dovaston of the Law Society's family law committee has lobbied for years for no-fault divorces. ""This new law will be more humane,"" she says. ""It also recognises the dignity of people wanting to be divorced, and it gives them some autonomy. ""I'm hoping that that sets the tone and the culture and it will roll over into resolving financial and children matters - that's where you really want to have a civilised settlement and a resolution."" 103,592 couples divorced in England and Wales in 2020 Approximately a third of marriages end in divorce, based on all unions between 1964 and 2019 Divorce rates have been declining for 10 years Kate Daly set up Amicable, the divorce service Olivia and her ex used, after her own expensive and acrimonious experience of the law. ""When a divorcing couple are being wrenched apart emotionally and financially, their most precious commodity is co-operation,"" she says. ""The last thing they want or need is to drip-feed the poison of blame into the divorce process. Blame inflames bitterness and recrimination."" Other countries with no-fault divorce laws: Sweden (Since 1973) Australia (1975) Germany (1976) Canada (1986) Spain (2005) Malta (2011) Over 30 years, the proposals were repeatedly considered by governments - and in 2018 the Supreme Court asked Parliament to reconsider the law. It said it had been forced to block Tini Owens, a woman from Worcestershire, from splitting from her husband because of legal questions over proving who was at fault. That led to a new Divorce Act in 2020 - but ministers delayed its implementation to allow testing of a new digital portal to make splitting less painful still. Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said the government had responded to the need for change. ""We're taking the blame game out of divorce,"" said Mr Raab. ""This is a compassionate, also common-sense measure to bring divorce into the 21st Century. ""The 20-week cooling off period is much shorter than if you have to prove fault - so in terms of the length and the anguish and the delays, this is a big step forward."" Olivia Jack is among those who says that the new system will be worth it. She and her ex have a good working relationship - taking decisions about their children - and sharing the family dog and a car. She hopes the new law will help many more couples find peace because, as she says, in many cases, there's no blame - just a need to move on.

"A Home Office minister has said he ""has not seen any feuding"" between government departments over how to deal with Ukrainian refugees. Lord Harrington insisted ""raised voices"" in meetings were the result of a desire shared by all ministers to ""do the same thing"" and help people. He also revealed that 29,000 visas had been issued to Ukrainians, with around 65,000 applications received so far. But Labour said the government had to ""step up to the plate"". Several newspapers have reported that Home Secretary Priti Patel and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss have argued over how to clear a backlog of Ukrainian refugees' applications, amid reports that only ""hundreds"" of people have so far made it to the UK. UK offers Â£350 a month to Ukrainian refugee hosts UK can and will do more for refugees - minister How the sex trade preys on Ukraine's refugees 100,000 sign up to UK's refugee site in first day The BBC understands that HM Revenue and Customs and Department for Work and Pensions staff are now helping with the processing of Ukrainian refugees. A Home Office source said a ""cross-government effort"" was under way. Lord Harrington, making his maiden speech since becoming a minister, said during a Lords debate: ""I've not seen this feuding between departments that's reported."" He told peers he had attended meetings with Home Secretary Priti Patel and Housing and Communities Secretary Michael Gove, among others, adding: ""I've seen raised voices because we are all trying to do the same thing, but not [because we are angry] with each other... ""What happens behind closed doors, I couldn't possibly know... I've not experienced [feuding] myself."" This video can not be played Ukraine refugees: Visa process is 'beyond lengthy' Lord Harrington said the immediate vetting of refugees should, at most, include passport checks, verifying whether people are on criminal watch lists, checking whether children travelling with adults are actually theirs, and checking whether sponsors have criminal records - the last two designed to prevent people trafficking. ""That's really it,"" he added, saying that ""it's taken too long to do it"" so far. The government is operating two schemes to help Ukrainians displaced by Russia's invasion to come to the UK - involving living with family members already in the country or sponsorship by other hosts. For Labour, shadow Home Office minister Lord Coaker said: ""There's a bureaucratic mess here and a bureaucratic quagmire and it needs to be sorted out. ""The British people want better from their government... They want their government to step up to the plate.""

"Ed Sheeran and his co-writers said the case had caused ""immense"" stress Ed Sheeran has won a High Court copyright battle over his 2017 hit Shape of You. A judge ruled on Wednesday that the singer-songwriter had not plagiarised the 2015 song Oh Why by Sami Chokri. Chokri, a grime artist who performs under the name Sami Switch, had claimed the ""Oh I"" hook in Sheeran's track was ""strikingly similar"" to an ""Oh why"" refrain in his own track. After the ruling, Sheeran said such ""baseless"" claims ""are way too common"". Ed Sheeran hits out at 'baseless' copyright claims In a video on social media, he said there was now a culture ""where a claim is made with the idea that a settlement will be cheaper than taking it to court, even if there's no basis for the claim"". He added: ""It's really damaging to the songwriting industry. There's only so many notes and very few chords used in pop music. ""Coincidence is bound to happen if 60,000 songs are being released every day on Spotify. That's 22 million songs a year and there's only 12 notes that are available."" This video can not be played Watch Ed Sheeran's Shape of You and Sami Chokri's Oh Why Shape of You was the UK's best-selling song of 2017 in the UK and is Spotify's most-streamed ever. Judge Antony Zacaroli ruled that Sheeran had ""neither deliberately nor subconsciously copied"" Chokri's song. He acknowledged there were ""similarities between the one-bar phrase"" in Shape of You and Oh Why, but said ""such similarities are only a starting point for a possible infringement"" of copyright. After studying the musical elements, he said there were ""differences between the relevant parts"" of the songs, which ""provide compelling evidence that the 'Oh I' phrase"" in Sheeran's song ""originated from sources other than Oh Why"".

He added that there was only a ""speculative foundation"" for the defence's case that Sheeran had heard Chokri's song before writing Shape of You. ""I find, as a matter of fact, that he had not heard it,"" he said. Sheeran wrote his chart-topping track with two collaborators, Snow Patrol's John McDaid and producer Steven McCutcheon, who all denied having previously heard Oh Why. The case dates back to 2018, when the trio asked the High Court to declare they had not infringed the copyright of Chokri and his co-writer Ross O'Donoghue. That led to an 11-day trial in London last month. This ruling will come as a huge relief to Ed Sheeran, who took the unusual step of pre-emptively suing Sami Chokri and Ross O'Donoghue in 2018 in an attempt to clear his name. He was stung by the accusation that he'd deliberately copied another writer's work without giving them credit. On the witness stand, the star was often terse and abrupt as he explained how, in several other instances, he shared royalties with writers who inspired him. Even on Shape of You, he protested, some of the profits went to the writers of TLC's No Scrubs. He later sang Nina Simone's Feeling Good and Blackstreet's No Diggity on the stand in an attempt to prove the melody he was accused of stealing was commonplace in pop music. Chokri was more emotional. He said he felt ""robbed"" by an artist he respected, and that he wished the trial had never come to court. However, he remained adamant that Sheeran had heard and copied his song. In the end, the judge disagreed. In order for copyright infringement to be proved, Chokri needed to prove that Sheeran had listened to his song - otherwise the similarities would just be coincidence. But Mr Justice Zacaroli said Chokri's team had failed to establish that Oh Why had ever graced Sheeran's speakers. As a star who has faced his fair share of copyright claims, Sheeran will presumably hope this verdict makes future litigants think twice. The Shape of You songwriters took legal action in 2018 after the track's royalties were frozen when Chokri and O'Donoghue asked the Performing Rights Society (PRS) to add them to the hit's credits as co-writers. Shape of You earns Sheeran, McDaid and McCutcheon about Â£5m a year, the court heard, despite almost 10% of the payments having being frozen due to the dispute. In his ruling, Mr Justice Zacaroli said Sheeran and his collaborators were justified in thinking the request from Chokri and O'Donoghue to be named as co-writers ""was a tactic designed to extract a settlement"". After the initial legal action, Chokri and O'Donoghue launched a counter-claim alleging copyright infringement. Sami Chokri described the High Court case as ""the worst few weeks of my life"" In a joint statement after the judgement, Sheeran, McDaid and McCutcheon said their mental health and creativity had suffered as a result of the case, as well as their wallets. ""There was a lot of talk throughout this case about cost,"" they said. ""But there is more than just a financial cost. There is a cost on creativity. When we are tangled up in law suits, we are not making music or playing shows. ""There is a cost on our mental health. The stress this causes on all sides is immense. It affects so many aspects of our everyday lives and the lives of our families and friends. We are not corporations. We are not entities. We are human beings."" Giving evidence last month, Sheeran denied that he ""borrows"" ideas from unknown songwriters without acknowledgement, insisting he was always ""completely fair"" in crediting people who contribute to his work. Andrew Sutcliffe QC, representing Chokri and O'Donoghue, labelled Sheeran a ""magpie"", claiming he ""habitually copies"" other artists and that it was ""extremely likely"" he had previously heard Oh Why. In closing arguments last month, Mr Sutcliffe said there was an ""indisputable similarity between the works"". But Sheeran's lawyer said the case against him was ""so strained as to be logically unintelligible"". Forensic musicologists were called by both sides to argue the case,giving contrasting views. One said the songs were ""distinctly different"" but the other argued they contained ""significant similarities"". Ian Mill QC, representing Sheeran, saidthe case had been ""deeply traumatising""for the star and his collaborators, while Chokri described the High Court case as ""the worst few weeks of my life"".

"Ed Sheeran says the culture of copyright claims is ""really damaging to the songwriting industry"" Ed Sheeran has warned that pop stars should not be allowed to be ""easy targets"" for copyright claims after winning his court battle with the writers of a song they claimed he had plagiarised. A High Court judge ruled that the singer had not copied part of his hit, Shape of You, from Oh Why, by Sami Chokri. That prompted Sheeranto declare on Instagram,external: ""I hope that this ruling means in the future baseless claims like this can be avoided. ""This really does have to end."" The case was not the first time Sheeran has faced a copyright claim, and many other stars have also been involved in high-profile disputes in recent years. Ed Sheeran wins Shape of You copyright case Last month,Katy Perry won a case on appealafter a rapper said she had plagiarised an eight-note riff for her 2013 hit Dark Horse. Dua Lipa has recently been sued twice over her song Levitating, the biggest-selling single in the US last year. Those claims have come from the writers behind Latin disco band Dr Buzzard's Original Savannah Band and Florida reggae group Artikal Sound System. Also last month, Sam Smith and Normani were sued over their 2019 duet Dancing With A Stranger, while Taylor Swift is facing a trial over her 2014 anthem Shake It Off. Taylor Swift faces trial over Shake It Off lyrics Nicki Minaj pays $450,000 for Tracy Chapman sample Lana Del Rey and Radiohead 'settle dispute' As the music industry saying goes, where there's a hit, there's a writ. The field of music copyright ""has become like the Wild West"", says forensic musicologist Peter Oxendale, who worked with Sheeran in this latest case. He says cases have proliferated since 2015, when Blurred Lines creatorsRobin Thicke and Pharrell Williams were found guiltyin the US of copying the ""feel"" of Marvin Gaye's Got To Give It Up, rather than directly plagiarising musical phrases or lyrics. ""In that case, [there] wasn't even two notes in common, and yet it found in favour of the wrong side,"" Oxendale told BBC Radio 4's The World At One. Part of the melody in Shape of You did bear some similarity to a segment of Oh Why - but Sheeran successfully argued in the High Court that it was a coincidence and he had not heard the other song before. This video can not be played Watch Ed Sheeran's Shape of You and Sami Chokri's Oh Why Sheeran took legal action after Switch - real name Sami Chokri - and fellow songwriter Ross O'Donoghue asked to be added to the songwriting credits for Shape of You, which is the most streamed song ever on Spotify. However, the judge ruled that Sheeran would be justified in thinking their request ""was a tactic designed to extract a settlement"" - in other words, money and/or a credit without going to court. Sheeran said: ""I feel like claims like this are way too common now and have become a culture where a claim is made with the idea that a settlement will be cheaper than taking it to court, even if there's no basis for the claim. ""It's really damaging to the songwriting industry. There's only so many notes and very few chords used in pop music.

Sheeran's plea for an end to ""baseless claims"" will find sympathetic ears among other musicians. ""It should never have got as far as it did,"" Grammy-winning composerDavid Arnold wrote,externalof the Sheeran case. ""Hopefully this result brings about a change in the avalanche of frivolous speculative copyright infringement cases."" But Wednesday's ruling won't bring copyright cases to an end. It won't even bring cases against Ed Sheeran to an end. He's facing another trial in the USafter being sued for $100m (Â£76m) by the owner of a share of the songwriting rights to Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On, who claims Sheeran copied it for his 2014 chart-topper Thinking Out Loud. He has also settled cases out of court in the past. In 2018, he paid $5.4m (Â£4.1m) to songwriters Thomas Leonard and Martin Harringtonafter being accused of copying their trackAmazing (which was released by X Factor winner Matt Cardle in 2012) for Sheeran's 2015 song, Photograph. In the latest trial, the star said he had been ""bruised"" by that experience. Even though he felt he had done nothing wrong, he said he had agreed to pay out on the advice of his lawyers because it would have been a ""nuisance"" and ""more trouble than it was worth"" to fight. The writers of TLC's No Scrubs have a credit on Shape of You After the Shape of You ruling, Oxendale said: ""I'm full of admiration for Ed Sheeran in this case because he could easily have taken the easy way out, which is just to give them a nuisance payment to go away. ""But he didn't. He chose to fight it and fighting cases in the High Court is traumatic for anyone. It's difficult. It's really expensive. It's time-consuming."" Sheeran had already giventhe writers of TLC's 1999 hit No Scrubsa credit on Shape of You several years ago after similarities were pointed out. In recent years, more stars have given the composers of potentially problematic tracks credits before a dispute gets anywhere near a court. Taylor Swift famously credited 1990s British pop duo Right Said Fredon her 2017 single Look What You Made Me Do because it follows the same rhythmic pattern as I'm Too Sexy. Last year, Olivia Rodrigo added two members of Paramore to the writing credits of Good 4 U, and the number of writers on Uptown Funk, by Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars, ballooned from six to 11 when The Gap Band noticed similarities to their song Oops Upside Your Head. Part of Chokri and O'Donoghue's complaint was that Sheeran treats unknown songwriters worse than famous ones when it comes to giving credits - which he denied. But the case rested on the fact that he insisted he had never heard their song, so could not have copied it either consciously or subconsciously - which would have been more difficult to argue if Oh Why had been a hit. Sheeran gave evidence at the High Court trial last month Copyright lawyer Kate Swaine says: ""If I was advising somebody who's been accused of copyright infringement, the first thing I would ask them is, 'Is there a possibility that you could have, unconsciously or consciously, been influenced, inspired or taken an element of this?' ""If somebody turns around and says, 'I do know that track really well. I have heard it. It's not out of the question,' they may feel that, rather than getting into the cost and disruption of a court action, it is easier to make a concession and therefore give some credit on the royalties. ""Here, what comes across from Sheeran's evidence is he was absolutely adamant that he had not heard this track."" She sees little chance of the number of copyright claims subsiding. But she says that despite the Blurred Lines ruling, ""the law seems to be doing a reasonably decent job"" of assessing when there is sufficient evidence of copyright infringement, and when there is not.

"Craig and Gina Dewdney were told their naturally conceived identical triplets were incredibly rare The parents of ""one-in-200 million"" identical triplet boys are reflecting on the ""best but hardest job"" as they celebrate their sons' first birthday. Gina Dewdney and her husband Craig were shocked when doctors at Liverpool Women's Hospital told them their naturally-conceived babies were such a rare occurrence. When born the boys spent six weeks in hospital before going home. Now Jimmy, Jensen and Jaxson are celebrating their milestone birthday. Mrs Dewdney, from Frodsham in Cheshire, said: ""They've gone through so much already in their tiny little lives so it's going to be a big celebration for them and for us as well. ""Being a mum is the best job I've ever had. It's the hardest job by far but I absolutely love it now, even through the lack of sleep and the hospital visits. ""It's tough but I'm loving it, I really am."" The boys spent six weeks on a neonatal intensive care unit before being allowed home Mrs Dewdney, 34, said she had an ""inkling"" she was having twins at first - which was later confirmed with a scan - before the couple spotted a third head on the screen. ""Twenty minutes into the scan Craig said 'is that a third head?' and there was silence,"" she said. ""The consultant said in 25 years of scanning they'd never seen triplets, and they were all sharing one placenta which is super, super rare."" Mr Dewdney, 35, said: ""I was just like 'how does that work holding them?' And I was thinking that's a lot of nappies."" The couple said they had now established a carefully planned routine. ""If they are even 20 minutes out of sync from one another, you'll settle one down and then the other one will wake up and then that one could potentially wake up the baby that you've just put to sleep,"" Mr Dewdney said. ""Feeding time is interesting. I have to tidy away while Gina is feeding them or if Gina is spoon-feeding two of them I'll go in with the other. It's just learning how to work together with them"". The couple share their daily routines with almost 20,000 followers The couple have set up theCheshire Triplets,externalInstagram page to share their daily routines with almost 20,000 followers. ""I'm getting loads of interest from people from all around the world who are having triplets or twins,"" Mrs Dewdney said. ""They just want to know life hacks, how to do things, how I manage with three so its been a really positive thing that's come out of this.""

"Putin's daughter Katerina Tikhonova works in academia and business The US has imposed sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle, including his daughters. The list also includes the family of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov,externaland major banks. The measures follow new revelations of atrocities by Russian troops in Ukraine, including images of bodies of civilians scattered on the streets of Bucha, near the capital Kyiv. Russia says, without evidence, the images are staged by Kyiv officials. Even though satellite images have shown the civilians were killed when Russians were in control of Bucha, Mr Putin on Wednesday described the event as a ""crude and cynical provocation by the Kyiv regime"". Referring to the Bucha murders, US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday: ""There's nothing less happening than major war crimes."" ""Responsible nations have to come together to hold these perpetrators accountable,"" Mr Biden added. The US said that Mr Putin's daughters, Katerina Vladimirovna Tikhonova and Maria Vladimirovna Vorontsova, were being put under sanctions ""for being the adult children of Putin, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked"". Who are Putin's daughters? What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? The announcement described Ms Tikhonova as ""a tech executive whose work supports the GoR [Russian government] and defense industry"". Her sister, Ms Vorontsova, it went on, ""leads state-funded programs that have received billions of dollars from the Kremlin toward genetics research and are personally overseen by Putin"". Asked why the US was targeting Mr Putin's daughters, a senior Biden administration official said the US thought they could be in control of some of their father's assets. ""We have reason to believe that Putin, and many of his cronies, and the oligarchs, hide their wealth, hide their assets, with family members that place their assets and their wealth in the US financial system, and also many other parts of the world,"" the official said. ""We believe that many of Putin's assets are hidden with family members, and that's why we're targeting them.""

The European Union is also debating cutting off Russian coal imports as concern over alleged war crimes increases. Before the new raft of sanctions was announced in Washington, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he could not ""tolerate any indecisiveness"". Speaking to the Irish parliament on Wednesday, he said there was still a need to convince some in Europe who believe ""war and war crimes are not as horrific as financial losses"" to back tougher sanctions. He added that ""Russian oil cannot feed the Russian military machine"", with Ukraine's foreign minister arguing on Twitter that an embargo on gas and oil was needed to truly impact Russia's ability to finance the war. Volodymyr Zelensky urged more action when speaking to Irish lawmakers on Wednesday Josep Borrell, the EU's chief diplomat, separately acknowledged on Wednesday that the one billion euros ($1.09bn; Â£833m) Europe spent on Russian energy every day put into sharp perspective the billion euros given to Ukraine in military assistance since the start of the invasion.

And Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said she intends to close EU ports to Russian vessels and ban Russian and Belarusian road transport operators from the region. Ms Von der Leyen accused Russia of ""waging a cruel and ruthless war"" against Ukrainian civilians and said the EU must ""sustain utmost pressure on Putin and the Russian government at this critical point"".

Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Gennady Kuzmin, Russia's deputy Permanent Representative, speaks to the United Nations General Assembly Russiaâs suspension from the UN Human Rights Council is unprecedented. Never before has the General Assembly taken such action against a permanent member of the UN Security Council. The reports emerging from Ukraine have caused horror; an elected member of the human rights council (there are 47) is supposed to protect and promote human rights. The images from Bucha suggest Russian troops have been doing the opposite. That is why 93 UN member states backed the US-led move to suspend Russia. But there are 193 UN members, so less than half voted in favour: 58 abstained, 24 voted against, a further 18 were out of the room having what UN diplomats wryly call a ""strategic coffee break"". Western nations view Russiaâs suspension as essential if the UN is to fulfil its mandate on human rights, but others see it as deeply divisive. Some of the countries which abstained, among them South Africa, objected to taking this decision before the councilâs own inquiry into war crimes in Ukraine has even begun its work, let alone issued its report. And what about other elected council members, like China? Will it be suspended if UN human rights commissioner Michelle Bacheletâs long-awaited report into the treatment of the Uighur population reveals major violations? Today's vote is a huge blow for Russia, but itâs also an ominous reminder that the UN is finding it harder and harder to do its job. Yogita LimayeBBC News, Yahidne Mykola tied himself to a wall so he could sleep standing up. On the white, damp wall of the Yahidne school basement is a crude calendar, drawn in red crayon. It marks a period of unimaginable trauma - from 5 March to 2 April - for the people of this village. Yahidne, 140km (80 miles) north-west of Kyiv, which is close to the borders with Belarus and Russia, was occupied by Russian soldiers for nearly a month. They took men, women and children from their homes at gunpoint and held them in the basement of the local school for four weeks - around 130 people cramped into a room roughly 65 sq m (700 sq ft) in size. Sixty-year-old Mykola Klymchuk was one of them. He offered to show us the basement. ""This was my half a metre of space. I was sleeping standing up,"" he said. His voice choked up and he started crying. ""I tied myself to the railing here with my scarf so I wouldn't fall over. I spent 25 nights like this."" Mykola said you couldn't move for fear of stepping on people. About 40 or 50 children were among those held captive. The youngest was just two months old. ""During my time here, 12 people died,"" Mykola said. Most were elderly people. It's unclear what they died of, but Mykola believes some suffocated to death. When people died, the bodies couldn't immediately be removed. This meant that people, including children, lived amidst corpses for hours, and sometimes days, until they could be taken outside. Read the report in full: Ukraine war: Sharing space with the dead - horror outside Chernihiv The war has entered a ""new and different phase"", UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said, after today's meeting of Nato allies. Ms Truss said there was now ""a more concentrated Russian offensive"" in Ukraine, and Nato had agreed to supply new and heavier equipment to fight it. Speaking after the meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, Ms Truss said: ""Putin has changed his tactics but not his intent. He wants a hold over the whole of Ukraine."" She earlier said the UK would be ""stepping up"" its supply of weapons but has not yet detailed what this would include. You can read abouther comments hereand we look at whatNato is and how it's helping Ukrainehere. Alice EvansBBC News Land warfare analyst Nick Reynolds, who works for the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank, has been filling us in on what the next few weeks of the war in Ukraine might look like, as Russia shifts its focus to the area in the south and east known as the Donbas. Was Ukraine's foreign minister accuratewhen he saidthe fighting in the Donbas could be reminiscent of World War Two? âYes I think thatâs accurate,"" Reynolds said. ""With all the forces freed up
from the north of Ukraineâ¦ weâre going to see a clash of arms on European soil
that hasnât been seen for generations."" Could Ukraine actually take back territory? There are a lot of unknown factors here, Reynolds says. Many Ukrainians will be buoyed up by the withdrawal of Russian forces in the north, but in the south and east âthe map has
still been slowly turning redâ, he says, and that's even before any reinforcements have arrived from the north. So Russia certainly still has some forwards momentum in the south and east, he says. How much difference could Western arms make? The weapons Western countries have so far sent to Ukraine have been game-changing but Nato has handed over a ""significant amount of its stocks - and that supply was finite"", Reynolds says. Western arms will be ""absolutely essential"" in the coming weeks but it's hard to know how they can get them to where they need to go, he adds. Ramping up industrial production of sophisticated weapons such as Javelins, NLAWs and Stingers is not easy, he says, as they have complex supply chains, He believes Western governments are struggling to keep up with demand. Switchblade dronescould âstart to change things on the ground within a short
timeframeâ â but thereâs âvery little elseâ that could do so, he adds. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent Ukrainian soldiers sit on a military vehicule in Severodonetsk, Donbas region. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba isnât the only one warning of horrendous battles to come. Western military officials expect Russia to throw everything into an offensive in the Donbas, in an effort to secure something that Moscow can describe as a victory. The question is how long itâll take before the Russians are ready and whether Ukraine will be able to withstand the pressure when it comes. Hence the sense of urgency, with Kuleba warning on Thursday that additional military support must come in days, not weeks, saying that the three items on his agenda were ""weapons, weapons, and weapons"". He and Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg are deliberately coy about what equipment is being sent. They donât want the Russians to know exactly what is being supplied, something that would help Moscow organise its attack. But the UK Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, says thereâs support within Nato for sending ânew and heavier equipmentâ, and the MoD announced earlier that Ukrainian officials were in the UK earlier this week looking at âprotected mobility vehicles,â which could include the heavily armoured Mastiff patrol vehicle. With the Czech government sending Soviet-era T-72 tanks and the US announcing another $100m worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles, the flow of weapons is continuing, and the pace is picking up. If you are just joining us, or need a recap, here's what's happened so far today. In international diplomacy:  In Ukraine: Gennady Kuzmin, Russia Deputy Permanent Representative, speaks at the United Nations General Assembly. Moscow has said that the decision to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council on Thursday was ""illegal"" and ""politically motivated"". The vote at the United Nations General Assembly saw 93 member states vote to suspend Russia (58 abstained and 24 voted against). Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told Sky News Russia was sorry about the decision and would continue to defend its interests ""using every possible legal means"". It was only the second ever suspension of a country from the Human Rights Council. The first was Libya in 2011. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin People walk through debris on a street in Bucha, following the withdrawal of Russian forces Russian soldiers can be heard talking about the murder of Ukrainian civilians in military radio traffic intercepted by Germany's foreign intelligence (BND), according to several separate media reports. The BND has audio material that appears to match the locations of bodies found in Bucha, the reports from German media say. In one, Russians appear to talk about interrogating people and then shooting them. In another, a soldier talks about shooting someone on a bike - which apparently matches a well-known photo showing a dead cyclist. The intelligence was shared with German parliamentarians during a briefing on Wednesday. However, a German security source told Reuters news agency that the findings on Bucha related to satellite images. âThe radio transmissions cannot be clearly assigned to Bucha."" A German
government spokesman confirmed Berlin has evidence that Russian troops
committed the atrocities. The reported intelligence also
appears to show evidence that Wagner mercenaries are also fighting for Russia
in Ukraine - backing upclaims made by British intelligenceearlier this week. The group has been active over the past eight years in Ukraine, Syria and African countries, and has repeatedly been accused of war crimes and human rights abuses. Russia has suffered ""significant losses of troops"", President Vladimir Putin's spokesman has said. Dmitry Peskov was asked on Sky News whether the war had been a ""humiliation"", given that Russia had retreated from the capital, lost thousands of troops and that President Volodymyr Zelensky was still in power. He said this was a ""wrong understanding"" of what was going on. But asked again if Russia has lost thousands of troops, he said: ""Yes, we have significant losses of troops and it's a huge tragedy for us."" He then added that the withdrawal from the Kyiv region and the northern city of Chernihiv was an ""act of goodwill"" to ""lift tension"" during peace talks. In the interview, Peskov repeated Russia's reasons for what it describes as a ""special military operation"", saying Ukraine had become ""anti-Russian"" and Russia was ""really nervous"" as Nato had ""started to move towards our boundaries"". Russia has previously said that 1,351 soldiers have been killed. The full death toll is not known, but a Nato official has been quoted in the US media as saying between 7,000 and 15,000, and there are similar US estimates. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has been speaking
to reporters after todayâs meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Belgium. âThere is a greater determination than ever to stand with
Ukraine,â he said, and to inflict âeven greater costsâ on Russia for its
invasion. He also said for every Bucha - a city in which Russia has been accused of committing war crimes - there were likely to be more places in which atrocities were happening. Blinken also welcomed the earlier vote to suspend Russia
from the UN Human Rights Council, saying: âToday, a wrong was righted.â Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has responded to the news that Russia has been suspended from the UN's Human Rights Council. Kulebasaid,external: ""War criminals have no place in UN bodies aimed at protecting human rights. Grateful to all member states which supported the relevant UNGA resolution and chose the right side of history."" More now on that vote moments ago to suspend Russia from the UNâs
Human Rights Council during a session in New York. Ninety-three countries voted
in favour of the move, 24 against, and there were 58 abstentions. Among the countries who supported the suspension were the
US, EU nations, the UK, and of course Ukraine itself. China, Syria, and Belarus were among those who voted against the motion. And India, Egypt, and South Africa were among the nations
which abstained. You can see the full list here,external.  The General Assembly of the United Nations has just voted to suspend Russia from its Human Rights Council during a session in New York. It follows allegations of war crimes by Kremlin troops in Ukraine. Before votes were cast, Ukraineâs ambassador to the UN Sergiy Kyslytsya accused Russia of âhorrificâ abuses â raising the issue of alleged civilian killings in the city of Bucha. Russiaâs own representative Gennady Kuzmin condemned the vote, and other nations including North Korea and Syria rallied behind him. Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba speaking at the Nato meeting Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberghas statedthat allies are âready to do moreâ to provide military equipment and support to Ukraine. But Ukraineâs Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, also speaking at a press conference earlier at Nato HQ in Brussels, said that help was needed in âdays not weeksâ if it was to avoid coming too late. Articulating the severity of the situation, Kuleba compared the unfolding fighting in the Donbas region to the Second World War. â[It] will remind you of the Second World War, with large operations... the involvement of thousands of tanks, armoured vehicles, planes, artillery.â He said this would ânot be a local operationâ based on current observations of Russian preparations. ""Russia has its plan, we have ours - and the outcome of this battle will be decided on the battlefield,"" he added. The Donbas is Ukraine's old coal and steel-producing area. The term refers to two big eastern regions, Luhansk and Donetsk. Russian-backed separatists declared ""republics"" in parts of the regions in 2014 and Russian forces have captured more territory since Vladimir Putin's invasion began in late February. Russian forces executed civilians in various locations in the Kyiv region, according to new testimonypublished by Amnesty International.,external The human rights organisation interviewed more than 20 people from towns and villages near the capital, some were witnesses to, or had direct knowledge of, the violence committed, it says. ""In recent weeks, we have gathered evidence that Russian forces have committed extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings, which must be investigated as likely war crimes,"" says Amnesty International Secretary General AgnÃ¨s Callamard. ""Testimonies shows that unarmed civilians in Ukraine are being killed in their homes and streets in acts of unspeakable cruelty and shocking brutality."" In one account given, a woman in a village east of Kyiv told Amnesty two Russian soldiers entered her house on 9 March, killed her husband, then repeatedly raped her at gunpoint while her young son hid in a boiler room nearby. With Russian forces retreating from the north of Ukraine, disturbing
stories of life under occupation have been emerging. The BBC's Jeremy Bowen has
been told of Russian troops using villagers as human shields against Ukrainian
counter-attacks. Russia has repeatedly denied that its forces have committed
atrocities, and sought to point the finger of blame elsewhere. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9990959

EU officials say sanctions on Russian imports of coal and oil are definitely being considered European member states are also expected to impose a ""full transaction ban"" on four Russian banks and ban a range of other Russian and Belarusian imports, including wood, cement, seafood and liquor, worth â¬5.5 billion ($6bn; Â£4.59bn). And Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said she intends to close EU ports to Russian vessels and ban Russian and Belarusian road transport operators from the region. Ms Von der Leyen accused Russia of ""waging a cruel and ruthless war"" against Ukrainian civilians and said the EU must ""sustain utmost pressure on Putin and the Russian government at this critical point"". But Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis on Tuesday evening criticized the EU's proposed sanctions package, calling it a ""feeble response"" which is ""an invitation for more atrocities."" ""Coal, four banksâ¦a ban on ports and borders (with exceptions) is not really an adequate sanctions package to the massacres that are being uncovered,"" Mr Landsbergis wrote on Twitter.

"The government's reversal of the 1.25p in the pound rise in National Insurance (NI) has come into effect. It means many people will keep more of their pay. NI went up by 1.25p in the pound in April and went back to its previous level on 6 November. For employees under pension age who earn less than Â£12,570 a year, the move will make no difference - because they don't pay NI. Above that income level, the amount saved increases as earnings do. So higher earners stand to benefit more than people on lower incomes - although higher earners will still contribute more tax overall. The majority of businesses will also see a reduction in their NI bills. Each business will save an average of Â£9,600 each in 2023-24,according to the government,external. National Insurance rise to be reversed in November NI is a tax paid by employees, employers and the self-employed: employees pay NI on their wages as well as income tax employers pay extra NI contributions for staff the self-employed pay NI on their profits NI contributes to the cost of benefits and the state pension. However, the government can borrow from the NI fund to help pay for other projects. NI raises a lot of money: Â£158bn last yearaccording to HMRC,external. Whether you receive the full state pensiondepends on your NI record,external. Why do we pay National Insurance? Since 6 April, workers and employers have been paying an extra 1.25p in the pound. The increase was part of the government's plan to fund the NHS and social care. It took the rate of NI to 13.25%. That meant the government went back on its 2019 election manifesto promise not to raise the tax. The NI increase was due to be replaced by a new Health and Social Care Levy - at a rate of 1.25% - in April 2023. But the government has now scrapped these plans, putting the NI rate back to 12%. That rate is paid by employees earning between Â£12,570 a year and just over Â£50,000 a year. Above that level, the rate has gone back down from 3.25% to 2.0%. The 1.25 percentage point increase in NI was supposed to raise Â£12bn a year. The government said the extra money would initially go towards easing pressure on the NHS. Some would then be moved into the social care system. This mainly helps older people and people with high care needs, with tasks such as washing, dressing, eating and taking medication. The government has said that funding for health and social care services will be maintained at the same level as if the levy was in place. The funding for health and social care will now come from general taxation. A proportion of the NI increase was supposed to fund the social care system. The social care system is under pressure because of an ageing population and the effects of the pandemic. At the same time, it has also been hit by staff shortages and falling government spending. The government wants to ensure that people in England pay no more than Â£86,000 in care costs from October 2023 (not including accommodation and food). People with assets - such as a home, savings or investments - worth less than Â£20,000 will not have to pay for care out of those assets, but may still have to contribute from their income. Those with assets worth between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 may have their care costs subsidised. What could care changes cost you and your family? Social care: Nine challenges facing the system NI is a UK-wide tax. Although the government decided to increase it in order to fund health and social care in England, the tax increase was also expected to raise extra money that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland could have chosen to spend on those services.

"Residents of Bucha said Russian soldiers killed civilians outside their homes without provocation Attacks on civilians by Russian forces in the Ukrainian town of Bucha do not ""look far short of genocide"", Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. The UK has announced further sanctions against eight oligarchs and Russian banks, including the country's largest, Sberbank, and Credit Bank of Moscow. Dozens of people have been found dead in the town - including some in a mass grave - after Russia's withdrawal. Moscow denied involvement and described reports as fake news. The Foreign Office announced its latest sanctions following the reports of attacks on civilians, and these include ending all imports of Russian coal and oil by the end of the year as well as action against strategic industries. The latest sanctions come in step with those imposed by the US, which has alsoimposed sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin's two daughters. Ahead of the new sanctions being announced, Mr Johnson said: ""I'm afraid when you look at what's happening in Bucha, the revelations that we are seeing from what Putin has done in Ukraine doesn't look far short of genocide to me. ""It is no wonder people are responding in the way that they are. I have no doubt that the international community, Britain very much in the front rank, will be moving again in lockstep to impose more sanctions and more penalties on Vladimir Putin's regime."" Could Putin be prosecuted for war crimes? What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? An execution-style killing on a street in Bucha Bucha satellite image contradicts Russian claims What is genocide? As part of its sanctions response, the UK has pledged to stop importing Russian oil by the end of the year, while the EU is reducing its imports of Russian gas by two-thirds. Mr Johnson praised the ""enormous strides"" the EU is taken to reduce dependence on Russian gas. At a working dinner in Brussels on Wednesday evening Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is expected to tell Nato colleagues the ""age of engagement with Russia is over"". She is expected to say there is ""no time for false comfort"" and that Russia is not retreating but regrouping to push harder in the east of Ukraine. Ms Truss is expected to urge allies to arm Ukraine quickly and decisively, and to rethink its support for countries ""caught in the web of Russian influence"", such as Georgia and Moldova. As part of sanctions imposed on Russia all new outward investment to the country has been banned, while imports of Russian iron and steel products will be banned. Among those added to the sanctions list is Viatcheslav Kantor, the largest shareholder of fertilizer company Acron,whose donations funded a new unit at a London hospital used by the royal family,external. The Edward VII Hospital accepted a donation from the Kantor Charitable Foundation to fund the Kantor Medical Centre. Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) talks to billionaire, businessman and owner of Acron Group Viatcheslav Kantor (L) while visiting the Acron plant in 2016 The other oligarchs added to the sanctions list include: Andrey Guryev - known close associate of Vladimir Putin and founder of fertiliser firm PhosAgro Sergey Kogogin, director of Kamaz, which manufactures trucks including for the military Sergey Sergeyevich Ivanov, president of the world's largest diamond producer Alrosa Leonid Mikhelson,  founder, and chief executive of Russian natural gas producer Novatek Andrey Akimov, chief executive of Russia's third largest bank Gazprombank Aleksander Dyukov, chief executive of Russia's third largest and majority state-owned oil producer GazpromNeft Boris Borisovich Rotenberg, son of the co-owner of Russia's largest gas pipeline producer SGM. Ms Truss said the latest wave of sanctions would decimate Mr Putin's ""war machine"" and show the Russian elite could not wash their hands of the atrocities committed on his orders. Sanctions are penalties imposed by countries intended to stop aggression, or punish breaches of international law, and often involve financial curbs. Those taken by the UK so far include freezing assets, excluding Russian banks from the UK financial system, banning some exports to Russia, restricting visas for wealthy investors and banning flights. By the end of the year, the UK has said it will also phase out Russian oil imports. Along with the EU and US, it has frozen the assets of more than 1,000 individuals and companies, including politicians andwealthy business leaders thought to be close to the Kremlin. Asset freezes prevent anyone in the UK or any UK company from dealing with any funds or resources that are owned or held by the designated person, and prevent resources being provided to or for the benefit of that person. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer had called for ""even tougher sanctions"" following the ""horrific, harrowing images"" of civilian deaths in Bucha. He said we have to give Ukraine ""every support we can"" and said the international community must be clear ""that these war crimes will end up with those responsible being hunted down"". The deliberate targeting of civilians, as has been alleged by residents of Bucha, is a war crime under the Geneva Convention. But for a massacre to be considered genocide, the law also requires proof of the intent to destroy a particular national, ethnic, racial or religious group - whether entirely or in part. The Genocide Convention, introduced after the Nazi Holocaust during World War Two, requires the 152 nations who are signatories to ""prevent and to punish"" genocide where it occurs.

"British Airways has cancelled four flights at Heathrow Airport today due to Covid-related  absences, on top of 74 services previously withdrawn. The airline had already signalled it intention to cancel most of the flights following a decision to reduce its schedule until the end of May. But recent high levels of staff absence due to Covid have meant further flights being called off ahead of Easter. EasyJet cancelled about 30 flights at Gatwick Airport on Wednesday. Thousands of holidaymakers have seen their Easter getaways - the first holiday since the end of Covid travel restrictions - delayed or cancelled because airlines and airports do not have enough staff to meet the recovery in demand. BA withdrew six flights at the last minute on Tuesday as a result of Covid absences. On Monday, it cancelled scheduled 62 flights but 12 of them were grounded at the last minute. Covid-related absences have compounded staff shortages at airports and airlines, and the industry is struggling to recruit staff after thousands of jobs were lost and many workers left the during the pandemic. EasyJet has said its staff absences were double their normal levels due to Covid. The airline said the main routes affected by cancellations were to Amsterdam, Krakow, Bologna and Berlin. What's the guidance if I have Covid now? Why are so many people catching Covid again? Staff shortages have led to passengers having to face long delays at security and check-in at some airports, with travellers complaining of ""chaos"". Problems at Manchester Airport led to Karen Smart, the airport's managing director, announcing on Tuesday that she would stand down. It came after Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said police and fire and rescue service staff could be drafted in to help tackle the chaos. Former Monarch Airlines boss Tim Jeans, who is now director of Cornwall Airport Newquay, told the BBC's Today programme levels of disruption had varied across the country. ""The problems at Manchester and to a lesser extent at Heathrow are stand out problems because other airports like Birmingham, Gatwick, Newcastle and Glasgow they've not seen the type of problems Manchester and Heathrow have,"" he said. ""The issue really has been you have to plan to recruit to train, in a very difficult labour market, many many many months in advance and it would appear that Manchester for whatever issues they have had, simply didn't do that."" Mr Jeans said it takes on average at least 12 weeks to recruit and train new security staff and predicted it would be ""the middle of June before we see a significant easing of these issues"".

"Putin's daughter Katerina Tikhonova works in academia and business The US has imposed sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle, including his daughters. The list also includes the family of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov,externaland major banks. The measures follow new revelations of atrocities by Russian troops in Ukraine, including images of bodies of civilians scattered on the streets of Bucha, near the capital Kyiv. Russia says, without evidence, the images are staged by Kyiv officials. Even though satellite images have shown the civilians were killed when Russians were in control of Bucha, Mr Putin on Wednesday described the event as a ""crude and cynical provocation by the Kyiv regime"". Referring to the Bucha murders, US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday: ""There's nothing less happening than major war crimes."" ""Responsible nations have to come together to hold these perpetrators accountable,"" Mr Biden added. The US said that Mr Putin's daughters, Katerina Vladimirovna Tikhonova and Maria Vladimirovna Vorontsova, were being put under sanctions ""for being the adult children of Putin, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked"". Who are Putin's daughters? What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? The announcement described Ms Tikhonova as ""a tech executive whose work supports the GoR [Russian government] and defense industry"". Her sister, Ms Vorontsova, it went on, ""leads state-funded programs that have received billions of dollars from the Kremlin toward genetics research and are personally overseen by Putin"". Asked why the US was targeting Mr Putin's daughters, a senior Biden administration official said the US thought they could be in control of some of their father's assets. ""We have reason to believe that Putin, and many of his cronies, and the oligarchs, hide their wealth, hide their assets, with family members that place their assets and their wealth in the US financial system, and also many other parts of the world,"" the official said. ""We believe that many of Putin's assets are hidden with family members, and that's why we're targeting them."" The US sanctions announced by the White House include: economic measures to ban new investment in Russia severe financial sanctions on Russia's largest private bank, Alfa Bank, and its largest financial institution, Sberbank sanctions on critical major state-owned enterprises sanctions on Russian government officials and their family members Meanwhile the UK has announcedfurther sanctions against eight oligarchs and Russian banks, including the country's largest, Sberbank, and Credit Bank of Moscow. The European Union is also debating cutting off Russian coal imports as concern over alleged war crimes increases. Before the new raft of sanctions was announced in Washington, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he could not ""tolerate any indecisiveness"". Speaking to the Irish parliament on Wednesday, he said there was still a need to convince some in Europe who believe ""war and war crimes are not as horrific as financial losses"" to back tougher sanctions. He added that ""Russian oil cannot feed the Russian military machine"", with Ukraine's foreign minister arguing on Twitter that an embargo on gas and oil was needed to truly impact Russia's ability to finance the war. Volodymyr Zelensky urged more action when speaking to Irish lawmakers on Wednesday Josep Borrell, the EU's chief diplomat, separately acknowledged on Wednesday that the one billion euros ($1.09bn; Â£833m) Europe spent on Russian energy every day put into sharp perspective the billion euros given to Ukraine in military assistance since the start of the invasion.

"The burden of tax falling on workers and employers has increased as a hotly-debated rise in National Insurance payments takes effect. Employees, businesses and the self-employed will pay an extra 1.25p in the pound. The government says it will spend it on health and social care. Opposition MPs said it exacerbated cost of living pressures, but mitigation will be introduced in July. Experts are urging people to check their status as a new tax year starts. Earnings levels at which people start to pay income tax have been frozen, increasing the chances of employees being dragged into a new band - with a higher rate of tax - if they receive a pay rise. Employees pay National Insurance on their wages, employers pay extra contributions for staff, and the self-employed pay it on their profits. In September, the government announced the rise in contributions from 6 April, in part to help ease the burden on the NHS. It means that, instead of paying National Insurance contributions of 12% on earnings up to Â£50,270 and 2% on anything above that, employees will now pay 13.25% and 3.25% respectively. The self-employed will see equivalent rates go up from 9% and 2% to 10.25% and 3.25%. Businesses face perfect storm as tax rise kicks in What will April's tax changes cost me? Five reasons why prices and bills are going up Javid defends NI tax hike for NHS funding Those of state pension age do not pay the tax at present, and nor do those on very low incomes. After the announcement last year, the plans were met with disapproval from opposition parties and some backbench Conservative MPs who criticised the timing, as many people face sharp rises in energy bills and prices in general. Chancellor Rishi Sunak responded in his Spring Statement with plans to allow workers and the self-employed to earn more before they start making National Insurance payments. This will take effect in July. The National Insurance rise will - ministers like to say - provide a much needed boost to health and social care. They claim it will pay for the care cap and boost NHS capacity to help tackle the backlog in England - it is up to the rest of the UK to decide how they spend the proceeds. But the truth is it will only contribute to that. Rising inflation, staff shortages and ageing equipment and buildings, means the health and care system is going to suck up the Â£39bn raised over the next three years by the hike and then some more. It is also worth bearing in mind the government had already committed to rises for the NHS up until 2024 under a funding settlement agreed by the May government. This had brought the increases to something close to the 4% health has historically got - although the rising inflation that is being seen will whittle that away from now on. And that came after a decade of the budget rising by little more than 1% - an unprecedented squeeze for the health service. The National Insurance rise is not quite all it seems. From now, employees will payNational Insurance contributions,externalon earnings above Â£9,880 a year. From July, it will be paid on earnings above Â£12,570 a year. Taken together, the measures mean that, over the next 12 months, anyone earning less than about Â£34,000 a year will pay less in National Insurance than they did the previous year, while those earning more will see their payments rise. Had the chancellor stuck with his original plan, then all but the very lowest income workers would have paid more in National Insurance. Many employers will still pay more, and business groups have warned that this may be passed on in higher prices. They also said it would add to the pressures already faced by firms following the withdrawal of Covid support measures. Among those concerned about the bill is Hanna Gentry, an assistant general manager at George's Bistro in Cleckheaton. Hanna Gentry says the bar will need to bring in more business ""Personally for me if I look at my wage I think it's not too much, but as a business when you have to pay that on everybody's wages, it adds up really, really quickly,"" she said. ""We are going to try and bring in more custom, that's the only way we can do it - in terms of events, new menus, to try and draw customers in."" Meanwhile James Hipkins, managing director of Emery's Timber and Builders Merchants in Stoke and Telford, told the BBC's Today programme the rise was ""another little extra bit"" to add to the rising cost of materials, fuel and energy. ""My greater concern is, is it the beginning of a perfect storm? By that I just mean all the little snips going up, is it going to start to stifle industry?"" However, Mr Hipkins said society had a ""moral obligation and responsibility to this"" to fund social care services, which he added have been ""overlooked"" for too long. ""We all know it needs sorting out, we all know it needs to be paid for but none of us are particularly keen on paying for it,"" he added. ""At this stage is it seems a bit wishy washy and woolly as it's coming in. I would feel a lot more confident and a lot more happy when I see it as an actual separate levy and it can be identified for where it's supposed to be going."" The government said it had raisedEmployment Allowance,externalfrom Â£4,000 to Â£5,000, so smaller firms could claim up to Â£5,000 off their National Insurance bills. Ministers said it meant 670,000 firms would not pay the tax at all. Overall, the increases in National Insurance for employers and higher-income workers will raise an extra Â£10.9bn in a year for the government, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Prime Minister Boris Johnson described it as ""necessary, fair and responsible"", adding that it would ""provide the health and care system with the long term funding it needs as we recover from the pandemic"". Next year, the extra tax will be rebranded as the Health and Social Care Levy. Health Minister Sajid Javid said the levy was necessary because it would be ""morally wrong"" to let ""our children pay for our healthcare and our adult social care"". The Labour Leader Keir Starmer has condemned the NI rise saying that the UK now has the highest rate of taxation in 70 years. Calling it the ""wrong tax at the wrong time"" he said: ""In the middle of worst cost of living crisis for decades today the government chooses to increase taxes on working people."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the NI rise ""puts all the burden on working people"". An increase in thetax on dividends,externalis also coming into effect, to add to the funds channelled by the government into the NHS and social care. It has also gone up by 1.25p in the pound. Many private investors hold shares in an Individual Savings Account (Isa) which protects them from tax. However, some business owners pay themselves in dividends and so will face a tax rise. Early last year Mr Sunak said the thresholds at which income tax is paid would be frozen at April 2021 levels for five years (although Scotland has different levels). That means pay rises will push more people into higher tax bands. If a pay rise takes somebody from below Â£12,570 a year to above, then they will start paying income tax at 20% on the amount above Â£12,570. A shift in salary from below Â£50,270 to above means paying the higher rate of 40% on the amount above Â£50,270. The next threshold is at Â£150,000, when the additional tax rate of 45% kicks in. Adrian Lowery, personal finance spokesman at investing platform Bestinvest, urged people to check their tax code, which is issued by HM Revenue and Customs and can be found on a pay slip. ""A tax code of 1257L is currently used for most people who have one job or pension. If yours is different, make sure you understand why, so you're not paying too much tax,"" he said. At last month's Spring Statement, Mr Sunak pledged to reduce the basic rate of income tax by 1p in the pound before the end of the Parliament in 2024. For this new tax year, the personal allowance ofcapital gains tax,externalhas also been frozen at Â£12,300, so this much profit can be realised from assets in a year before tax is paid. The threshold forinheritance tax,external- a levy on estates when somebody dies - has also been frozen again at Â£325,000, as it has since 2009. Will the National Insurance cut leave me better off?

"Iryna Abramov stands outside her destroyed home in Bucha, where her husband was killed. 'I wish they had killed me too,' she said. Volodymyr Abramov was trying desperately to put out the fire in his home, in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, calling out for his son-in-law to help. Russian troops had smashed through the front gates of Volodymyr's home, opened fire at the house, and dragged Volodymyr, 72, his daughter Iryna, 48, and her husband Oleg, 40, out into the yard. The soldiers took Oleg out beyond the gate on to the pavement, Volodymyr said, and threw a grenade in through the front door of the house that exploded with a deafening bang and set the house on fire. Volodymyr grabbed a small fire extinguisher and tried in vain to extinguish the flames. ""Where is Oleg? Oleg will help!"" he shouted to his daughter. But the reply came from one of the Russian soldiers, he said. ""Oleg will not help you any more."" They found Oleg on the pavement outside the gate, and it was clear from the way he was lying that he had been forced to kneel and shot in the head at point blank range, Iryna said. He was a welder who lived a quiet life on the corner of Yablonska Street in Bucha, who was taken out of his home and killed. Volodymyr Abramov stands in the house once shared by his daughter and son-in-law. ""I felt empty when they killed Oleg,"" he said. ""I only wanted to die."" The killing is one of scores - if not hundreds - being uncovered in Bucha after Russian troops withdrew from the Kyiv suburb recently. The mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said on Monday that at least 300 civilians had been killed. There is no official tally yet. Russia has denied any involvement in the atrocities. But its burned-out tanks litter the city. On the grounds of a church, there is an open mass grave with the dead still inside, some in black body bags, some loose in the sand. On the roads, there are bullet-riddled civilian cars - at least one with a body still inside. Houses are caved in by shelling, their driveways ploughed over by tanks. Residents have described Russian soldiers shooting civilians outside their homes with no provocation, and satellite imagery shows that bodies were lying in the streets while the Russians were still in control. The Russian soldiers who killed Oleg Abramov ""did not ask him anything"", his wife Iryna said. ""They didn't ask anything or say anything, they just killed him,"" she said. ""They only told him to take off his shirt, kneel down, and they shot him."" Volodymyr Abramov points to the spot on the pavement outside their house where he says his son-in-law was forced to kneel and shot in the head She wept on Tuesday as she stood on the spot where he was killed, where a dark patch of blood was still visible on the street. When she ran out and found his disfigured body, the four Russian soldiers who dragged him out were standing casually drinking water, she said. She screamed at them to shoot her, and one raised his gun, then lowered it, then raised it again, and lowered it, until Volodymyr dragged her back inside the gate. ""Those soldiers told us we had three minutes to leave and they forced us to run in our slippers,"" Volodymyr said. ""Bucha was like an apocalypse - dead bodies everywhere, the streets full of smoke."" Volodymyr and Iryna had no choice but to leave Oleg's body lying on the street and it lay there for nearly a month while they sheltered at a relative's house nearby. When it was safe to return, Volodymyr tried to bury his son-in-law on a rough patch of earth by the pavement, and the half-dug hole was still visible there on Tuesday. But exhausted by the effort, and afraid of Russian soldiers, Volodymyr carried Oleg back inside the yard and laid him there. Later, Ukrainian soldiers loaded the body into a van, Volodymyr said, and took it away. ""I have no idea how we are going to find it now,"" he said. A mass grave on the grounds of a church in Bucha, where bodies were discovered when the Russians retreated Ukrainian authorities have now cleared the bodies off the streets of Bucha but there are fears more will be found in the basements and yards of private homes. Officials have only just begun the process of cataloguing the horrors. And so great is the damage in Bucha, it is hard to imagine the scale of the reconstruction needed to restore it to the attractive suburb it once was. Along one road through the town on Tuesday, where burned-out tanks were piled up and almost every house was destroyed, 84-year-old Hryhoriy Zamohylnyi was sweeping the street, as if oblivious to the total destruction around him. Somehow, his home was intact - the only building left undamaged along the whole stretch of road. ""I saw the war with the Germans and now this war with the Russians,"" said Zamohylnyi, a former engineer, born and raised in Bucha. ""What you see here is animal cruelty,"" he said. Addressing the UN security council on Tuesday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, accused the Russians of committing the worst crimes since World War Two, and called for those responsible to be tried as the Nazis were in Nuremberg. ""The Russian military searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our country,"" he said. ""They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies."" The ruins of the Abramovs' home in Bucha Ukraine has begun a war crimes investigation into Russia's actions in Bucha and nearby Irpin. It says 410 bodies have been found across the two suburbs so far. There are fears now that more atrocities will be found as the Russians retreat further and more suburbs are opened up - more bodies in the streets, more mass graves. Volodymyr and Iryna Abramov are only looking for one body, and their fear is that they will never find it. ""He was just a peaceful man, a family man, a welder, who struggled with a spine fracture and was disabled all his life,"" Volodymyr said. ""Just before he died, while I was in the yard, I saw him briefly through the open gate, on his knees, and he said his final words. He asked them why.""

"Everyone across the UK is facing the sharpest rise in their cost of living for decades. Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement is primarily an update on the current state, and future expectations, of the nation's finances. But he also announced some big, new policies that will affect our personal budgets in the coming months and years. Bringing together expected changes in earnings, reforms to taxes, and the recently announced energy measures, a middle earner on Â£27,500 per year can expect to be about Â£360 worse off this year than they were last, according to economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Many of the necessities we buy - notably food, fuel and energy - have been rising in price. On Wednesday, official figures revealed that the cost of a whole host of goods and services, from furniture to toys, have also been increasing sharply. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) saidprices rose by 6.2% in the 12 months to February- the fastest for 30 years. The chancellor's Spring Statement confirmed that consumers should be braced for things getting more expensive at a faster rate later in the year. Official forecasts, from the Office for Budget Responsibility, suggest inflation (which charts the rising cost of living) will average 7.4% this year, peaking at around 9% at the end of the year. The big question for anyone with a job is whether their pay will rise in line with prices. We already knew that the minimum pay rate for those aged 23 and above - the National Living Wage - will go up by 6.6%, as the hourly rate increases from Â£8.91 to Â£9.50. Inflation-matching wage rises in themselves could create a problem for the economy as a whole, by creating an inflationary spiral. It remains highly unlikely that employers will put up wages by that much when facing their own cost pressures, particularly their firm's energy bills. In September, the government announced that employees will pay 1.25p more in the pound from their pay packet in National Insurance contributions from this April. In a significant move, he has now said that the earnings threshold at which people start to pay National Insurance will rise. What will National Insurance changes cost me? At present, most workers start paying National Insurance contributions when their income hits Â£9,568. They pay 12% of earnings between Â£9,568 and Â£50,270, then 2% on any earnings above Â£50,270. Now the chancellor has said, from July, National Insurance will be paid on income over Â£12,570 a year - the same level as income tax starts being paid. In practice, the two measures will mean that anyone earning less than about Â£35,000 a year will pay less National Insurance during the year. That is about 70% of all workers. Those who earn more will see a tax rise, albeit smaller than they would have expected. For an employee earning Â£20,000 a year, it means an annual National Insurance cut of Â£180 in 2022-23, instead of an Â£89 rise expected before the announcement, according to accountancy firm Deloitte For a Â£40,000 earner, it means a rise of Â£70, instead of a previously expected Â£339 rise For a Â£60,000 earner, it means a Â£320 rise, instead of a previously expected Â£589 rise Self-employed people, who pay at a different rate, will see slightly less of a benefit from the chancellor's decision. Over time, this threshold is frozen, which will steadily mean more low-earners will have to pay. Early last year Mr Sunak said the thresholds at which income tax is paid would be frozen at April 2021 levels for five years (although Scotland has different levels). That means pay rises will push more people into higher tax bands. At the end of his speech, he pledged to reduce the basic rate of income tax by 1p in the pound before the end of the Parliament in 2024. Millions of households are facing a Â£693 (54%) rise in the cost of a typical annual gas and electricity bill, to about Â£2,000, when the regulator's new, higher price cap takes effect on 1 April. The latest analysis from Cornwall Insight suggests there will be a further Â£541 a year (27%) rise in October, before falling back. The OBR has predicted a Â£850 rise in October. Mr Sunak said he had already taken ""decisive action"", in helping people with their bills. This includes a Â£150 council tax rebate for 80% of households, followed by a Â£200 discount on bills in October which will need to be repaid, and an expansion to a support scheme for vulnerable people. In a longer-term move, he said that VAT would be cut from 5% to 0% on energy efficiency products such as solar panels, insulation and heat pumps. Prices to fill up the car with fuel were rising before the war in Ukraine - and the fallout from Russia's invasion has made things worse. The average price of petrol has risen by more than 40p per litre since last year's Spring Statement. The chancellor announceda 5p a litre reduction in fuel dutyfor the next year, which takes some of the sting out of rising prices, The RAC motoring organisation said that move would knock Â£3.30 off the cost of filling a typical 55 litre family car. Benefits and the state pension are rising by 3.1% in April, well below the rising cost of living. This prompted many charities to call on the chancellor to go further. Mr Sunak did not agree, saying nothing new about benefit and pension levels. However, if inflation does reach the levels predicted by the OBR. then benefits and the state pension could see a significant rise in April 2023 - as the increases are usually linked to the inflation rate in the preceding autumn. Local councils will be given another Â£500m in the Household Support Fund, which supports vulnerable people with payments and grants such as vouchers to help pay their bills.

Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Gennady Kuzmin, Russia's deputy Permanent Representative, speaks to the United Nations General Assembly Russiaâs suspension from the UN Human Rights Council is unprecedented. Never before has the General Assembly taken such action against a permanent member of the UN Security Council. The reports emerging from Ukraine have caused horror; an elected member of the human rights council (there are 47) is supposed to protect and promote human rights. The images from Bucha suggest Russian troops have been doing the opposite. That is why 93 UN member states backed the US-led move to suspend Russia. But there are 193 UN members, so less than half voted in favour: 58 abstained, 24 voted against, a further 18 were out of the room having what UN diplomats wryly call a ""strategic coffee break"". Western nations view Russiaâs suspension as essential if the UN is to fulfil its mandate on human rights, but others see it as deeply divisive. Some of the countries which abstained, among them South Africa, objected to taking this decision before the councilâs own inquiry into war crimes in Ukraine has even begun its work, let alone issued its report. And what about other elected council members, like China? Will it be suspended if UN human rights commissioner Michelle Bacheletâs long-awaited report into the treatment of the Uighur population reveals major violations? Today's vote is a huge blow for Russia, but itâs also an ominous reminder that the UN is finding it harder and harder to do its job. Yogita LimayeBBC News, Yahidne Mykola tied himself to a wall so he could sleep standing up. On the white, damp wall of the Yahidne school basement is a crude calendar, drawn in red crayon. It marks a period of unimaginable trauma - from 5 March to 2 April - for the people of this village. Yahidne, 140km (80 miles) north-west of Kyiv, which is close to the borders with Belarus and Russia, was occupied by Russian soldiers for nearly a month. They took men, women and children from their homes at gunpoint and held them in the basement of the local school for four weeks - around 130 people cramped into a room roughly 65 sq m (700 sq ft) in size. Sixty-year-old Mykola Klymchuk was one of them. He offered to show us the basement. ""This was my half a metre of space. I was sleeping standing up,"" he said. His voice choked up and he started crying. ""I tied myself to the railing here with my scarf so I wouldn't fall over. I spent 25 nights like this."" Mykola said you couldn't move for fear of stepping on people. About 40 or 50 children were among those held captive. The youngest was just two months old. ""During my time here, 12 people died,"" Mykola said. Most were elderly people. It's unclear what they died of, but Mykola believes some suffocated to death. When people died, the bodies couldn't immediately be removed. This meant that people, including children, lived amidst corpses for hours, and sometimes days, until they could be taken outside. Read the report in full: Ukraine war: Sharing space with the dead - horror outside Chernihiv The war has entered a ""new and different phase"", UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said, after today's meeting of Nato allies. Ms Truss said there was now ""a more concentrated Russian offensive"" in Ukraine, and Nato had agreed to supply new and heavier equipment to fight it. Speaking after the meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, Ms Truss said: ""Putin has changed his tactics but not his intent. He wants a hold over the whole of Ukraine."" She earlier said the UK would be ""stepping up"" its supply of weapons but has not yet detailed what this would include. You can read abouther comments hereand we look at whatNato is and how it's helping Ukrainehere. Alice EvansBBC News Land warfare analyst Nick Reynolds, who works for the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank, has been filling us in on what the next few weeks of the war in Ukraine might look like, as Russia shifts its focus to the area in the south and east known as the Donbas. Was Ukraine's foreign minister accuratewhen he saidthe fighting in the Donbas could be reminiscent of World War Two? âYes I think thatâs accurate,"" Reynolds said. ""With all the forces freed up
from the north of Ukraineâ¦ weâre going to see a clash of arms on European soil
that hasnât been seen for generations."" Could Ukraine actually take back territory? There are a lot of unknown factors here, Reynolds says. Many Ukrainians will be buoyed up by the withdrawal of Russian forces in the north, but in the south and east âthe map has
still been slowly turning redâ, he says, and that's even before any reinforcements have arrived from the north. So Russia certainly still has some forwards momentum in the south and east, he says. How much difference could Western arms make? The weapons Western countries have so far sent to Ukraine have been game-changing but Nato has handed over a ""significant amount of its stocks - and that supply was finite"", Reynolds says. Western arms will be ""absolutely essential"" in the coming weeks but it's hard to know how they can get them to where they need to go, he adds. Ramping up industrial production of sophisticated weapons such as Javelins, NLAWs and Stingers is not easy, he says, as they have complex supply chains, He believes Western governments are struggling to keep up with demand. Switchblade dronescould âstart to change things on the ground within a short
timeframeâ â but thereâs âvery little elseâ that could do so, he adds. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent Ukrainian soldiers sit on a military vehicule in Severodonetsk, Donbas region. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba isnât the only one warning of horrendous battles to come. Western military officials expect Russia to throw everything into an offensive in the Donbas, in an effort to secure something that Moscow can describe as a victory. The question is how long itâll take before the Russians are ready and whether Ukraine will be able to withstand the pressure when it comes. Hence the sense of urgency, with Kuleba warning on Thursday that additional military support must come in days, not weeks, saying that the three items on his agenda were ""weapons, weapons, and weapons"". He and Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg are deliberately coy about what equipment is being sent. They donât want the Russians to know exactly what is being supplied, something that would help Moscow organise its attack. But the UK Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, says thereâs support within Nato for sending ânew and heavier equipmentâ, and the MoD announced earlier that Ukrainian officials were in the UK earlier this week looking at âprotected mobility vehicles,â which could include the heavily armoured Mastiff patrol vehicle. With the Czech government sending Soviet-era T-72 tanks and the US announcing another $100m worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles, the flow of weapons is continuing, and the pace is picking up. If you are just joining us, or need a recap, here's what's happened so far today. In international diplomacy:  In Ukraine: Gennady Kuzmin, Russia Deputy Permanent Representative, speaks at the United Nations General Assembly. Moscow has said that the decision to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council on Thursday was ""illegal"" and ""politically motivated"". The vote at the United Nations General Assembly saw 93 member states vote to suspend Russia (58 abstained and 24 voted against). Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told Sky News Russia was sorry about the decision and would continue to defend its interests ""using every possible legal means"". It was only the second ever suspension of a country from the Human Rights Council. The first was Libya in 2011. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin People walk through debris on a street in Bucha, following the withdrawal of Russian forces Russian soldiers can be heard talking about the murder of Ukrainian civilians in military radio traffic intercepted by Germany's foreign intelligence (BND), according to several separate media reports. The BND has audio material that appears to match the locations of bodies found in Bucha, the reports from German media say. In one, Russians appear to talk about interrogating people and then shooting them. In another, a soldier talks about shooting someone on a bike - which apparently matches a well-known photo showing a dead cyclist. The intelligence was shared with German parliamentarians during a briefing on Wednesday. However, a German security source told Reuters news agency that the findings on Bucha related to satellite images. âThe radio transmissions cannot be clearly assigned to Bucha."" A German
government spokesman confirmed Berlin has evidence that Russian troops
committed the atrocities. The reported intelligence also
appears to show evidence that Wagner mercenaries are also fighting for Russia
in Ukraine - backing upclaims made by British intelligenceearlier this week. The group has been active over the past eight years in Ukraine, Syria and African countries, and has repeatedly been accused of war crimes and human rights abuses. Russia has suffered ""significant losses of troops"", President Vladimir Putin's spokesman has said. Dmitry Peskov was asked on Sky News whether the war had been a ""humiliation"", given that Russia had retreated from the capital, lost thousands of troops and that President Volodymyr Zelensky was still in power. He said this was a ""wrong understanding"" of what was going on. But asked again if Russia has lost thousands of troops, he said: ""Yes, we have significant losses of troops and it's a huge tragedy for us."" He then added that the withdrawal from the Kyiv region and the northern city of Chernihiv was an ""act of goodwill"" to ""lift tension"" during peace talks. In the interview, Peskov repeated Russia's reasons for what it describes as a ""special military operation"", saying Ukraine had become ""anti-Russian"" and Russia was ""really nervous"" as Nato had ""started to move towards our boundaries"".

It follows allegations of war crimes by Kremlin troops in Ukraine. Before votes were cast, Ukraineâs ambassador to the UN Sergiy Kyslytsya accused Russia of âhorrificâ abuses â raising the issue of alleged civilian killings in the city of Bucha. Russiaâs own representative Gennady Kuzmin condemned the vote, and other nations including North Korea and Syria rallied behind him. Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba speaking at the Nato meeting Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberghas statedthat allies are âready to do moreâ to provide military equipment and support to Ukraine. But Ukraineâs Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, also speaking at a press conference earlier at Nato HQ in Brussels, said that help was needed in âdays not weeksâ if it was to avoid coming too late. Articulating the severity of the situation, Kuleba compared the unfolding fighting in the Donbas region to the Second World War. â[It] will remind you of the Second World War, with large operations... the involvement of thousands of tanks, armoured vehicles, planes, artillery.â He said this would ânot be a local operationâ based on current observations of Russian preparations.

Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Gennady Kuzmin, Russia's deputy Permanent Representative, speaks to the United Nations General Assembly Russiaâs suspension from the UN Human Rights Council is unprecedented. Never before has the General Assembly taken such action against a permanent member of the UN Security Council. The reports emerging from Ukraine have caused horror; an elected member of the human rights council (there are 47) is supposed to protect and promote human rights. The images from Bucha suggest Russian troops have been doing the opposite. That is why 93 UN member states backed the US-led move to suspend Russia. But there are 193 UN members, so less than half voted in favour: 58 abstained, 24 voted against, a further 18 were out of the room having what UN diplomats wryly call a ""strategic coffee break"". Western nations view Russiaâs suspension as essential if the UN is to fulfil its mandate on human rights, but others see it as deeply divisive. Some of the countries which abstained, among them South Africa, objected to taking this decision before the councilâs own inquiry into war crimes in Ukraine has even begun its work, let alone issued its report. And what about other elected council members, like China? Will it be suspended if UN human rights commissioner Michelle Bacheletâs long-awaited report into the treatment of the Uighur population reveals major violations? Today's vote is a huge blow for Russia, but itâs also an ominous reminder that the UN is finding it harder and harder to do its job. Yogita LimayeBBC News, Yahidne Mykola tied himself to a wall so he could sleep standing up. On the white, damp wall of the Yahidne school basement is a crude calendar, drawn in red crayon. It marks a period of unimaginable trauma - from 5 March to 2 April - for the people of this village. Yahidne, 140km (80 miles) north-west of Kyiv, which is close to the borders with Belarus and Russia, was occupied by Russian soldiers for nearly a month. They took men, women and children from their homes at gunpoint and held them in the basement of the local school for four weeks - around 130 people cramped into a room roughly 65 sq m (700 sq ft) in size. Sixty-year-old Mykola Klymchuk was one of them. He offered to show us the basement. ""This was my half a metre of space. I was sleeping standing up,"" he said. His voice choked up and he started crying. ""I tied myself to the railing here with my scarf so I wouldn't fall over. I spent 25 nights like this."" Mykola said you couldn't move for fear of stepping on people. About 40 or 50 children were among those held captive. The youngest was just two months old. ""During my time here, 12 people died,"" Mykola said. Most were elderly people. It's unclear what they died of, but Mykola believes some suffocated to death. When people died, the bodies couldn't immediately be removed. This meant that people, including children, lived amidst corpses for hours, and sometimes days, until they could be taken outside. Read the report in full: Ukraine war: Sharing space with the dead - horror outside Chernihiv The war has entered a ""new and different phase"", UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said, after today's meeting of Nato allies. Ms Truss said there was now ""a more concentrated Russian offensive"" in Ukraine, and Nato had agreed to supply new and heavier equipment to fight it. Speaking after the meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, Ms Truss said: ""Putin has changed his tactics but not his intent. He wants a hold over the whole of Ukraine."" She earlier said the UK would be ""stepping up"" its supply of weapons but has not yet detailed what this would include. You can read abouther comments hereand we look at whatNato is and how it's helping Ukrainehere. Alice EvansBBC News Land warfare analyst Nick Reynolds, who works for the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank, has been filling us in on what the next few weeks of the war in Ukraine might look like, as Russia shifts its focus to the area in the south and east known as the Donbas. Was Ukraine's foreign minister accuratewhen he saidthe fighting in the Donbas could be reminiscent of World War Two? âYes I think thatâs accurate,"" Reynolds said. ""With all the forces freed up
from the north of Ukraineâ¦ weâre going to see a clash of arms on European soil
that hasnât been seen for generations."" Could Ukraine actually take back territory? There are a lot of unknown factors here, Reynolds says. Many Ukrainians will be buoyed up by the withdrawal of Russian forces in the north, but in the south and east âthe map has
still been slowly turning redâ, he says, and that's even before any reinforcements have arrived from the north. So Russia certainly still has some forwards momentum in the south and east, he says. How much difference could Western arms make? The weapons Western countries have so far sent to Ukraine have been game-changing but Nato has handed over a ""significant amount of its stocks - and that supply was finite"", Reynolds says. Western arms will be ""absolutely essential"" in the coming weeks but it's hard to know how they can get them to where they need to go, he adds. Ramping up industrial production of sophisticated weapons such as Javelins, NLAWs and Stingers is not easy, he says, as they have complex supply chains, He believes Western governments are struggling to keep up with demand. Switchblade dronescould âstart to change things on the ground within a short
timeframeâ â but thereâs âvery little elseâ that could do so, he adds. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent Ukrainian soldiers sit on a military vehicule in Severodonetsk, Donbas region. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba isnât the only one warning of horrendous battles to come. Western military officials expect Russia to throw everything into an offensive in the Donbas, in an effort to secure something that Moscow can describe as a victory. The question is how long itâll take before the Russians are ready and whether Ukraine will be able to withstand the pressure when it comes. Hence the sense of urgency, with Kuleba warning on Thursday that additional military support must come in days, not weeks, saying that the three items on his agenda were ""weapons, weapons, and weapons"". He and Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg are deliberately coy about what equipment is being sent. They donât want the Russians to know exactly what is being supplied, something that would help Moscow organise its attack. But the UK Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, says thereâs support within Nato for sending ânew and heavier equipmentâ, and the MoD announced earlier that Ukrainian officials were in the UK earlier this week looking at âprotected mobility vehicles,â which could include the heavily armoured Mastiff patrol vehicle. With the Czech government sending Soviet-era T-72 tanks and the US announcing another $100m worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles, the flow of weapons is continuing, and the pace is picking up. If you are just joining us, or need a recap, here's what's happened so far today. In international diplomacy:  In Ukraine: Gennady Kuzmin, Russia Deputy Permanent Representative, speaks at the United Nations General Assembly. Moscow has said that the decision to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council on Thursday was ""illegal"" and ""politically motivated"". The vote at the United Nations General Assembly saw 93 member states vote to suspend Russia (58 abstained and 24 voted against). Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told Sky News Russia was sorry about the decision and would continue to defend its interests ""using every possible legal means"". It was only the second ever suspension of a country from the Human Rights Council. The first was Libya in 2011. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin People walk through debris on a street in Bucha, following the withdrawal of Russian forces Russian soldiers can be heard talking about the murder of Ukrainian civilians in military radio traffic intercepted by Germany's foreign intelligence (BND), according to several separate media reports. The BND has audio material that appears to match the locations of bodies found in Bucha, the reports from German media say. In one, Russians appear to talk about interrogating people and then shooting them. In another, a soldier talks about shooting someone on a bike - which apparently matches a well-known photo showing a dead cyclist. The intelligence was shared with German parliamentarians during a briefing on Wednesday. However, a German security source told Reuters news agency that the findings on Bucha related to satellite images. âThe radio transmissions cannot be clearly assigned to Bucha."" A German
government spokesman confirmed Berlin has evidence that Russian troops
committed the atrocities. The reported intelligence also
appears to show evidence that Wagner mercenaries are also fighting for Russia
in Ukraine - backing upclaims made by British intelligenceearlier this week. The group has been active over the past eight years in Ukraine, Syria and African countries, and has repeatedly been accused of war crimes and human rights abuses. Russia has suffered ""significant losses of troops"", President Vladimir Putin's spokesman has said. Dmitry Peskov was asked on Sky News whether the war had been a ""humiliation"", given that Russia had retreated from the capital, lost thousands of troops and that President Volodymyr Zelensky was still in power. He said this was a ""wrong understanding"" of what was going on. But asked again if Russia has lost thousands of troops, he said: ""Yes, we have significant losses of troops and it's a huge tragedy for us."" He then added that the withdrawal from the Kyiv region and the northern city of Chernihiv was an ""act of goodwill"" to ""lift tension"" during peace talks. In the interview, Peskov repeated Russia's reasons for what it describes as a ""special military operation"", saying Ukraine had become ""anti-Russian"" and Russia was ""really nervous"" as Nato had ""started to move towards our boundaries"".

"This video can not be played Why the divorce law changes matter The most far-reaching change in divorce laws in decades has come into force - ending the need for separating couples to blame one of themselves. The launch of no-fault divorces for England and Wales comes after years of campaigning by family lawyers. They argue the removal of blame from divorce will help more people rebuild their lives and protect children. A form of no-fault divorce exists in Scotland - but blame rules will remain in force in Northern Ireland. Under the old rules in England and Wales, anyone who wanted to split swiftly had to accuse their partner in a divorce petition of desertion, adultery or unreasonable behaviour. If not, they had to spend two years apart if both partners agreed, or five, if one of the couple objected to the split. Most family law experts have long said the system exacerbated problems for a separating couple - making it harder for them to agree over finances, assets and the future of their children. It also trapped people in loveless and sometimes abusive marriages as the dissenting partner controlled the one who wanted to leave. One partner, or both acting together, can file for divorce, without having to give a reason or apportion blame. A statement that their marriage is over will, in most cases, be all the proof the court needs. There is a 20-week period between starting proceedings and applying for a conditional order, and a further six-week period before divorce is granted. The same no-fault rule applies to the dissolution of civil partnerships. Judges will still step in to resolve disputes over children, maintenance or the just division of wealth. But those cases aside, legal experts say that the reforms will help a huge number of the 100,000 couples who divorce every year - people like Olivia Jack from north London. Olivia Jack: Didn't want blame to harm children When Ms Jack concluded in 2018 her marriage was over, she was shocked when a divorce lawyer explained she would have to blame her husband if she wanted out quickly. ""I felt very uncomfortable right from the beginning,"" she says. ""Someone had to be the bad guy. So, once I found out about the need to apportion blame, that put the brakes on. ""It felt that it was not going to be useful to the divorce process, especially when young children were involved."" The couple decided to wait out the two years - and they used the time to work with a divorce coach to agree how best to look after their children and divide their assets. At the end of the two-year period, they legally parted - the closest they could come to a quick no-fault divorce. Olivia says she and her ex-husband would have used the new law had it been available, because they wanted to part without becoming enemies for life. And it's a view shared by the divorce law profession. Divorce lawyer Karen Dovaston: Lawyers have lobbied for the change for years Karen Dovaston of the Law Society's family law committee has lobbied for years for no-fault divorces. ""This new law will be more humane,"" she says. ""It also recognises the dignity of people wanting to be divorced, and it gives them some autonomy. ""I'm hoping that that sets the tone and the culture and it will roll over into resolving financial and children matters - that's where you really want to have a civilised settlement and a resolution."" 103,592 couples divorced in England and Wales in 2020 Approximately a third of marriages end in divorce, based on all unions between 1964 and 2019 Divorce rates have been declining for 10 years Kate Daly set up Amicable, the divorce service Olivia and her ex used, after her own expensive and acrimonious experience of the law. ""When a divorcing couple are being wrenched apart emotionally and financially, their most precious commodity is co-operation,"" she says. ""The last thing they want or need is to drip-feed the poison of blame into the divorce process. Blame inflames bitterness and recrimination."" Other countries with no-fault divorce laws: Sweden (Since 1973) Australia (1975) Germany (1976) Canada (1986) Spain (2005) Malta (2011) Over 30 years, the proposals were repeatedly considered by governments - and in 2018 the Supreme Court asked Parliament to reconsider the law. It said it had been forced to block Tini Owens, a woman from Worcestershire, from splitting from her husband because of legal questions over proving who was at fault. That led to a new Divorce Act in 2020 - but ministers delayed its implementation to allow testing of a new digital portal to make splitting less painful still. Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said the government had responded to the need for change. ""We're taking the blame game out of divorce,"" said Mr Raab. ""This is a compassionate, also common-sense measure to bring divorce into the 21st Century. ""The 20-week cooling off period is much shorter than if you have to prove fault - so in terms of the length and the anguish and the delays, this is a big step forward."" Olivia Jack is among those who says that the new system will be worth it. She and her ex have a good working relationship - taking decisions about their children - and sharing the family dog and a car. She hopes the new law will help many more couples find peace because, as she says, in many cases, there's no blame - just a need to move on.

"Iryna Abramov stands outside her destroyed home in Bucha, where her husband was killed. 'I wish they had killed me too,' she said. Volodymyr Abramov was trying desperately to put out the fire in his home, in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, calling out for his son-in-law to help. Russian troops had smashed through the front gates of Volodymyr's home, opened fire at the house, and dragged Volodymyr, 72, his daughter Iryna, 48, and her husband Oleg, 40, out into the yard. The soldiers took Oleg out beyond the gate on to the pavement, Volodymyr said, and threw a grenade in through the front door of the house that exploded with a deafening bang and set the house on fire. Volodymyr grabbed a small fire extinguisher and tried in vain to extinguish the flames. ""Where is Oleg? Oleg will help!"" he shouted to his daughter. But the reply came from one of the Russian soldiers, he said. ""Oleg will not help you any more."" They found Oleg on the pavement outside the gate, and it was clear from the way he was lying that he had been forced to kneel and shot in the head at point blank range, Iryna said. He was a welder who lived a quiet life on the corner of Yablonska Street in Bucha, who was taken out of his home and killed. Volodymyr Abramov stands in the house once shared by his daughter and son-in-law. ""I felt empty when they killed Oleg,"" he said. ""I only wanted to die."" The killing is one of scores - if not hundreds - being uncovered in Bucha after Russian troops withdrew from the Kyiv suburb recently. The mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said on Monday that at least 300 civilians had been killed. There is no official tally yet. Russia has denied any involvement in the atrocities. But its burned-out tanks litter the city. On the grounds of a church, there is an open mass grave with the dead still inside, some in black body bags, some loose in the sand. On the roads, there are bullet-riddled civilian cars - at least one with a body still inside. Houses are caved in by shelling, their driveways ploughed over by tanks. Residents have described Russian soldiers shooting civilians outside their homes with no provocation, and satellite imagery shows that bodies were lying in the streets while the Russians were still in control. The Russian soldiers who killed Oleg Abramov ""did not ask him anything"", his wife Iryna said. ""They didn't ask anything or say anything, they just killed him,"" she said. ""They only told him to take off his shirt, kneel down, and they shot him."" Volodymyr Abramov points to the spot on the pavement outside their house where he says his son-in-law was forced to kneel and shot in the head She wept on Tuesday as she stood on the spot where he was killed, where a dark patch of blood was still visible on the street. When she ran out and found his disfigured body, the four Russian soldiers who dragged him out were standing casually drinking water, she said. She screamed at them to shoot her, and one raised his gun, then lowered it, then raised it again, and lowered it, until Volodymyr dragged her back inside the gate. ""Those soldiers told us we had three minutes to leave and they forced us to run in our slippers,"" Volodymyr said. ""Bucha was like an apocalypse - dead bodies everywhere, the streets full of smoke."" Volodymyr and Iryna had no choice but to leave Oleg's body lying on the street and it lay there for nearly a month while they sheltered at a relative's house nearby. When it was safe to return, Volodymyr tried to bury his son-in-law on a rough patch of earth by the pavement, and the half-dug hole was still visible there on Tuesday. But exhausted by the effort, and afraid of Russian soldiers, Volodymyr carried Oleg back inside the yard and laid him there. Later, Ukrainian soldiers loaded the body into a van, Volodymyr said, and took it away. ""I have no idea how we are going to find it now,"" he said. A mass grave on the grounds of a church in Bucha, where bodies were discovered when the Russians retreated Ukrainian authorities have now cleared the bodies off the streets of Bucha but there are fears more will be found in the basements and yards of private homes. Officials have only just begun the process of cataloguing the horrors. And so great is the damage in Bucha, it is hard to imagine the scale of the reconstruction needed to restore it to the attractive suburb it once was. Along one road through the town on Tuesday, where burned-out tanks were piled up and almost every house was destroyed, 84-year-old Hryhoriy Zamohylnyi was sweeping the street, as if oblivious to the total destruction around him. Somehow, his home was intact - the only building left undamaged along the whole stretch of road. ""I saw the war with the Germans and now this war with the Russians,"" said Zamohylnyi, a former engineer, born and raised in Bucha. ""What you see here is animal cruelty,"" he said. Addressing the UN security council on Tuesday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, accused the Russians of committing the worst crimes since World War Two, and called for those responsible to be tried as the Nazis were in Nuremberg. ""The Russian military searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our country,"" he said. ""They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies."" The ruins of the Abramovs' home in Bucha Ukraine has begun a war crimes investigation into Russia's actions in Bucha and nearby Irpin. It says 410 bodies have been found across the two suburbs so far. There are fears now that more atrocities will be found as the Russians retreat further and more suburbs are opened up - more bodies in the streets, more mass graves. Volodymyr and Iryna Abramov are only looking for one body, and their fear is that they will never find it. ""He was just a peaceful man, a family man, a welder, who struggled with a spine fracture and was disabled all his life,"" Volodymyr said. ""Just before he died, while I was in the yard, I saw him briefly through the open gate, on his knees, and he said his final words. He asked them why.""

"Diners in England will see calories on menus when they eat out from today. Restaurants, cafes and takeaways with more than 250 staff must print how many calories are in meals on their menus, websites, and on delivery platforms. The new rule is part of government plans to tackle obesity by helping people to make healthier choices. Some restaurants fear it will increase their costs, while an eating disorder charity says it could contribute to harmful thoughts and behaviours. Under the new rules, large food and drink businesses in England with 250 or more employees must display the calorie information of non-prepacked food and soft drinks. Some High Street chains already publish information about the calorie content of their food on their menus,such as Wetherspoons pubs and The Real Greek restaurants.McDonald's has been doing it for more than a decade. Mark Selby, co-founder of Mexican-style street food restaurant Wahaca, told the BBC the chain was ""completely up for being clear and transparent"" to customers on food and drink information. But he said the focus on counting calories was a problem. ""It tells part of the story but I think it slightly misses out some quite important fundamentals around food - be it nutrition, fibre, all those things - which potentially we feel might be more relevant or certainly need to be considered,"" he said. Mark Selby said he doesn't think calories on menus will ""sway the dial"" at his restaurants Mr Selby said he believed people visited Wahaca as ""a treat"" and wouldn't look at the menu from a calorie point of view. He also said creating a system to ensure chefs were accurately using the right amounts of the 250 ingredients they use across the restaurants every day had ""obviously had an impact"" on the business and increased costs. The company said it used the change to also add the carbon footprint of meals to measure the climate impact of each dish. Masterchef winner Sven-Hanson Britttweeted,externalthe change was a ""terrible thing to happen to the hospitality industry"". He warned the regulation ""could end creativity, spontaneity and lead to boring tick-box cooking"". ""Kids will grow up in restaurants, hotels and cafes only looking at that little number below a dish. Choices will be made based on a number alone. The love of flavour, ingredients, history, cooking craft or nutrition will be lost and masked by a newly perceived focus,"" he said. Kate Nicholls, boss of the industry group UK Hospitality, said the new rules came at the ""worst possible time for thousands of businesses struggling to survive"". ""We've long called for a delay to the implementation of calorie labelling, and we'd like to see a grace period post-April to allow businesses breathing space in which to implement the new rules without the risk of unnecessary enforcement action from day one,"" she said. ""It's completely unfair to expect businesses devastated by Covid to all of a sudden introduce complicated and costly new labelling when they've much more pressing matters to attend to - recouping their losses of the past 24-months for a start."" For Charlotte Roberts, from Macclesfield, the change won't make any difference to her food choices. ""I come to the restaurant because I go there knowing what I want to eat,"" the 19-year-old said. ""I go there knowing that it's going to be a big meal. I just eat what I want to eat."" James Howlett, from London, said the change wouldn't affect his menu choices. The 18-year-old said: ""I didn't notice that they didn't have it down anyway. ""It's whatever I feel like on the day. If I want a pizza I'll take a pizza, if I want a burger I'll take a burger."" However, Patrick Callaghan, 57, from Monmouth, said the move would make a difference to which dish he picked. ""I think people care what they eat and particularly after the lockdown, people are conscious of being more active and taking an interest in the calories that they take into the body,"" he told the BBC. Kate Callaghan, 56, agreed, adding people should ""accept our own responsibility for what we eat"". Making calories on menus mandatory can contribute to harmful eating disorder thoughts and behaviours worsening, according to Beat, the UK's eating disorder charity. Tom Quinn, the charity's director of external affairs, said there was evidence that calorie information causes anxiety and distress for people affected by eating disorders. ""It can increase a fixation on restricting calories for those with anorexia or bulimia, or increase feelings of guilt for those with binge eating disorder,"" he said. ""There is also very limited evidence that the legislation will lead to changed eating habits among the general population."" Beat told the BBC 1.25 million people in the UK have an eating disorder and said it had ""continually asked"" the government to consider the impact on people affected by eating disorders and to consult ""eating disorder clinicians and experts by experience at every stage of the process"". The Department of Health and Social Care said obesity was one of the biggest health issues the country faced and that food labelling played an important role in helping people make healthier choices. A spokeswoman added people were used to seeing nutritional information on products sold in supermarkets. The government said its policy has been informed by research and it had consulted ""extensively"" with mental health charities and experts.

"India has ""unequivocally condemned"" killings in Ukraine's Bucha and supported calls for an independent investigation into the ""deeply disturbing reports"". Images of mass graves and bodies of civilians reportedly executed in the Kyiv suburb have shocked the world. India's condemnation at the UN meeting is the strongest statement it has made since Russia invaded Ukraine. Delhi has so far abstained from UN votes condemning Russia's actions. In a statement on Tuesday at the UN Security Council meeting, India's permanent representative to the United Nations TS Tirumurti said the country ""remained deeply concerned at the worsening situation and reiterates its call for immediate cessation of violence and end to hostilities"". ""The situation in Ukraine has not shown any significant improvement since the Council last discussed the issue. The security situation has only deteriorated, as well as its humanitarian consequences,"" Mr Tirumurti said. ""We hope the international community will continue to respond positively to the humanitarian needs. We support calls urging for guarantees of safe passage to deliver essential humanitarian and medical supplies."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

India has a long history of pursuing a non-aligned foreign policy butis under pressure from Western countries over its diplomatic balancing act. Delhi and Moscow also share a decades-old relationship, and Russia is also India's biggest defence supplier. Indiarecently also placed contracts for nearly six million barrels of Russian crudeafter prices slumped in the wake of Western sanctions on Russia. But the Indian government says this is ""literally a drop, in a larger bucket"" of its oil imports globally. Russia praises India for stance on Ukraine Ukraine: India 'feeling the heat' over neutrality Last week, Delhi was criticised by the US and Australia for considering a Russian offer that was seen as circumventing the sanctions. The civilian killings in Bucha were uncovered after Russian troops withdrew from the town. The mayor, Anatoli Fedoruk, said on Monday that at least 300 civilians had been killed, but there is no official tally yet. 'Delhi-Moscow ties to be tested' By Vikas Pandey, BBC News, Delhi India's support for an independent inquiry into civilian killings in Bucha is hardly surprising. It stopped short of blaming or naming Russia for the violence in Bucha, which was in line with its policy of neutrality over Ukraine. The West has so far appeared to be accommodating of India's stand, which largely stems from its reliance on Russian defence equipment and its historical ties with Moscow. But as allegations of atrocities in Ukraine mount, so will the pressure on Delhi to take a clearer stand. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin on Tuesday said that Washington wanted Delhi to scale down its defence dependence on Russia. If his statement is a sign of things to come, India's policy of pushing for diplomacy over Ukraine will be seriously tested.

"John Lansdown is seeking damages of Â£76m and wants to set up a trust to protect seafarers' rights A former P&O Ferries chef is suing the company and its chief executive, claiming unfair dismissal, racial discrimination and harassment. John Lansdown is the only seafarer to take legal action after 800 staff were sacked without notice last month. In his tribunal claim he accuses P&O of treating him unfavourably as he is British and eligible for minimum wage. P&O Ferries said job cuts were ""categorically not based on race or the nationality of the staff involved"". The company ""needed fundamental change to make it viable - we knew this decision was the only way to save the business"", P&O said in a statement. Mr Lansdown is seeking financial compensation as well as exemplary damages of up to Â£76m to ""deter"" P&O Ferries or its parent company DP World from acting the same way in future. He would use the money to create a new trust to campaign for improved wages and terms and conditions for seafarers and to outlaw ""fire and hire"" practices in the industry and more widely in the UK, according to his claim. Mr Lansdown, 39, told the BBC he wanted to get ""justice"" for all his former colleagues who felt they had ""no choice"" but to settle their cases. ""This is not just about me,"" he said. ""799 of my seafaring family have lost their livelihoods, their way of life, their homes for half the year and it's about the bigger picture."" P&O confirmed to the BBC that ""all but one"" employee had accepted a settlement and therefore forfeited their right to any legal action as a result. John next to the Old Pride of Kent, the first ship he joined aged 16 Mr Lansdown said he joined P&O Ferries as a 16-year-old trainee and was working as a sous chef on The Pride of Canterbury when he was sacked three weeks ago. He was working on the ship and had to leave his belongings behind when he was notified ""out of the blue, and without any prior consultation"" about his instant dismissal, he said. In his legal papers, seen by the BBC, he claimed private security staff, carrying handcuffs and wearing balaclavas, were hired to remove workers who refused to disembark ferries. ""I was devastated by the brutal summary dismissal after many years of loyal and diligent service,"" his claim states. ""The manner of the dismissal was harassing."" In a statement to the BBC, P&O said: ""No staff involved in the redundancies wore balaclavas nor were they directed to use handcuffs or force. ""Staff remained professional, sympathetic and calm in a challenging situation for everyone, trying to ensure the safety of all the people on board the ships. There was no harassment,"" it said. John and his mum after winning a P&O cake competition Mr Lansdown alleges the redundancy was a ""sham"" and unlawful because there was no fair selection process, no diminished need for his job, and P&O Ferries' parent company, DP World, is very profitable, the document adds. Mr Lansdown's British nationality was also a significant influence on the decision to sack staff and replace them with non-British crew paid below the minimum wage of up to Â£5.50 per hour, it further claims. P&O Ferries boss Peter Hebblethwaite previously admitted to MPs thata decision to sack 800 workers without notice or union consultation had broken the lawbut said he would make the decision again if he had to. At the time, he said of his decision that no union would have accepted the plan and it was easier to compensate workers ""in full"" instead. In his legal claim, Mr Lansdown accused the company of ""violating his dignity and creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating environment"". He told the BBC: ""At the end of the day, it was the essence of Brexit what happened to us. This could give a green light to other companies to do the same."" Mr Lansdown's lawyer, Lawrence Davies of Equal Justice solicitors, said: ""This is the most important battle for British workers' rights post-Brexit; the battle to prevent British jobs being lost on British waters to cheap foreign labour."" He added: ""It is a fight we must win."" P&O Ferries has previously said that all 800 staff made redundant would be offered Â£36.5m in total - with around 40 receiving more than Â£100,000 each. TheInsolvency Service has launched criminal and civil investigationsinto the controversial mass redundancies.

"Iryna Abramov stands outside her destroyed home in Bucha, where her husband was killed. 'I wish they had killed me too,' she said. Volodymyr Abramov was trying desperately to put out the fire in his home, in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, calling out for his son-in-law to help. Russian troops had smashed through the front gates of Volodymyr's home, opened fire at the house, and dragged Volodymyr, 72, his daughter Iryna, 48, and her husband Oleg, 40, out into the yard. The soldiers took Oleg out beyond the gate on to the pavement, Volodymyr said, and threw a grenade in through the front door of the house that exploded with a deafening bang and set the house on fire. Volodymyr grabbed a small fire extinguisher and tried in vain to extinguish the flames. ""Where is Oleg? Oleg will help!"" he shouted to his daughter. But the reply came from one of the Russian soldiers, he said. ""Oleg will not help you any more."" They found Oleg on the pavement outside the gate, and it was clear from the way he was lying that he had been forced to kneel and shot in the head at point blank range, Iryna said. He was a welder who lived a quiet life on the corner of Yablonska Street in Bucha, who was taken out of his home and killed. Volodymyr Abramov stands in the house once shared by his daughter and son-in-law. ""I felt empty when they killed Oleg,"" he said. ""I only wanted to die."" The killing is one of scores - if not hundreds - being uncovered in Bucha after Russian troops withdrew from the Kyiv suburb recently. The mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said on Monday that at least 300 civilians had been killed. There is no official tally yet. Russia has denied any involvement in the atrocities. But its burned-out tanks litter the city. On the grounds of a church, there is an open mass grave with the dead still inside, some in black body bags, some loose in the sand. On the roads, there are bullet-riddled civilian cars - at least one with a body still inside. Houses are caved in by shelling, their driveways ploughed over by tanks. Residents have described Russian soldiers shooting civilians outside their homes with no provocation, and satellite imagery shows that bodies were lying in the streets while the Russians were still in control. The Russian soldiers who killed Oleg Abramov ""did not ask him anything"", his wife Iryna said. ""They didn't ask anything or say anything, they just killed him,"" she said. ""They only told him to take off his shirt, kneel down, and they shot him."" Volodymyr Abramov points to the spot on the pavement outside their house where he says his son-in-law was forced to kneel and shot in the head She wept on Tuesday as she stood on the spot where he was killed, where a dark patch of blood was still visible on the street. When she ran out and found his disfigured body, the four Russian soldiers who dragged him out were standing casually drinking water, she said. She screamed at them to shoot her, and one raised his gun, then lowered it, then raised it again, and lowered it, until Volodymyr dragged her back inside the gate. ""Those soldiers told us we had three minutes to leave and they forced us to run in our slippers,"" Volodymyr said. ""Bucha was like an apocalypse - dead bodies everywhere, the streets full of smoke."" Volodymyr and Iryna had no choice but to leave Oleg's body lying on the street and it lay there for nearly a month while they sheltered at a relative's house nearby. When it was safe to return, Volodymyr tried to bury his son-in-law on a rough patch of earth by the pavement, and the half-dug hole was still visible there on Tuesday. But exhausted by the effort, and afraid of Russian soldiers, Volodymyr carried Oleg back inside the yard and laid him there. Later, Ukrainian soldiers loaded the body into a van, Volodymyr said, and took it away. ""I have no idea how we are going to find it now,"" he said. A mass grave on the grounds of a church in Bucha, where bodies were discovered when the Russians retreated Ukrainian authorities have now cleared the bodies off the streets of Bucha but there are fears more will be found in the basements and yards of private homes. Officials have only just begun the process of cataloguing the horrors. And so great is the damage in Bucha, it is hard to imagine the scale of the reconstruction needed to restore it to the attractive suburb it once was. Along one road through the town on Tuesday, where burned-out tanks were piled up and almost every house was destroyed, 84-year-old Hryhoriy Zamohylnyi was sweeping the street, as if oblivious to the total destruction around him. Somehow, his home was intact - the only building left undamaged along the whole stretch of road. ""I saw the war with the Germans and now this war with the Russians,"" said Zamohylnyi, a former engineer, born and raised in Bucha. ""What you see here is animal cruelty,"" he said. Addressing the UN security council on Tuesday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, accused the Russians of committing the worst crimes since World War Two, and called for those responsible to be tried as the Nazis were in Nuremberg. ""The Russian military searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our country,"" he said. ""They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies."" The ruins of the Abramovs' home in Bucha Ukraine has begun a war crimes investigation into Russia's actions in Bucha and nearby Irpin. It says 410 bodies have been found across the two suburbs so far. There are fears now that more atrocities will be found as the Russians retreat further and more suburbs are opened up - more bodies in the streets, more mass graves. Volodymyr and Iryna Abramov are only looking for one body, and their fear is that they will never find it. ""He was just a peaceful man, a family man, a welder, who struggled with a spine fracture and was disabled all his life,"" Volodymyr said. ""Just before he died, while I was in the yard, I saw him briefly through the open gate, on his knees, and he said his final words. He asked them why.""

"Yuriy and his father, Ruslan, were trying to get humanitarian aid when a Russian soldier stopped them At around 11:00 on 17 March, Yuriy and his father, Ruslan, were cycling to Bucha's administration building where aid was being handed out. Electricity, gas and water had been cut, and essentials were in short supply in the town, one of the first to be occupied by Russian forces as they advanced on Ukraine's capital Kyiv. Yuriy and his father hoped to pick up some medicine and food. Yuriy said a Russian soldier stopped him and his father on Tarasivska St. They immediately raised their hands. Speaking to the BBC by phone alongside his mother, Alla, the 14-year-old gave his account of what happened next. ""We told them that we weren't carrying any weapons and that we didn't pose any danger,"" he said. ""Then my father turned his head my way, and that's when he got shotâ¦ He was shot twice in the chest, right where the heart is. Then he fell."" At that point, the teenager said, the soldier shot him in his left hand and he fell too. While he was on the ground, he said, he was shot again, this time in the arm. ""I was lying on my stomach, I couldn't see anything that was happening around me,"" Yuriy said. The soldier, he said, shot again, aiming at his head. ""[But] the bullet went through my hood."" Yuriy said the soldier shot again, this time at his father's head. But Ruslan was already dead. ""I had a small panic attack, lying there with my wounded arm underneath me. I saw that my hand was bleeding,"" he said. It was only after a while, when the soldier went behind a tank, that Yuriy got up and ran, he said. Yuriy shows wounds that, he says, were caused by a Russian soldier in Bucha The BBC has not independently verified the details of Yuriy's account, but it comes as evidence grows of atrocities committed by Russian forces while they were in control of Bucha and other towns north of Kyiv. In Bucha alone, bodies of dead men were found lying in the street, many with extensive wounds. Some had been shot through the temple, as if executed. Others had their hands or legs tied behind their backs. Some had clearly been run over by tanks. Many of the bodies were seen along a stretch of Yablonska St, just 2km (one mile) from the street where Ruslan is said to have been killed. Yuriy's mother Alla told the BBC how she had gone to see her husband after the teenager returned home and told her what had happened. She thought Yuriy could be wrong, and that Ruslan was wounded, in need of medical help. ""My son begged me not to,"" Alla said. ""He said they would kill me too."" When she tried to walk down the street, she said, her neighbours stopped her. ""[They] told me not to go further, saying the Russians were killing everyone in the territories under their control."" The next morning, Alla got her mother to help. Wearing white scarves, they went to the site of the shooting. Her mother talked to Russian soldiers and they managed to get through. They finally collected Ruslan's body, and brought it home. A photograph of the partially covered body, taken by Alla and shared with the BBC, appears to confirm Yuriy's testimony. It shows a gunshot wound to the left side of the chest, near the heart. Ruslan, a lawyer, was 49 when he was killed. He was ""active in the community,"" Alla said. ""He couldn't just sit in the shelter and wait. So, he was volunteering and helping people."" They buried him in the garden of the family home. Yuriy said the soldier who killed him was clearly Russian. His uniform was dark green, he said, typical of the Russian army. ""I saw that on his flak jacket it was written 'Russia' in Russian,"" he said. ""We were no danger to the military, we were civilians, wearing white scarves to show that,"" Yuriy said.

"Yuriy and his father, Ruslan, were trying to get humanitarian aid when a Russian soldier stopped them At around 11:00 on 17 March, Yuriy and his father, Ruslan, were cycling to Bucha's administration building where aid was being handed out. Electricity, gas and water had been cut, and essentials were in short supply in the town, one of the first to be occupied by Russian forces as they advanced on Ukraine's capital Kyiv. Yuriy and his father hoped to pick up some medicine and food. Yuriy said a Russian soldier stopped him and his father on Tarasivska St. They immediately raised their hands. Speaking to the BBC by phone alongside his mother, Alla, the 14-year-old gave his account of what happened next. ""We told them that we weren't carrying any weapons and that we didn't pose any danger,"" he said. ""Then my father turned his head my way, and that's when he got shotâ¦ He was shot twice in the chest, right where the heart is. Then he fell."" At that point, the teenager said, the soldier shot him in his left hand and he fell too. While he was on the ground, he said, he was shot again, this time in the arm. ""I was lying on my stomach, I couldn't see anything that was happening around me,"" Yuriy said. The soldier, he said, shot again, aiming at his head. ""[But] the bullet went through my hood."" Yuriy said the soldier shot again, this time at his father's head. But Ruslan was already dead. ""I had a small panic attack, lying there with my wounded arm underneath me. I saw that my hand was bleeding,"" he said. It was only after a while, when the soldier went behind a tank, that Yuriy got up and ran, he said.

"British Airways has cancelled four flights at Heathrow Airport today due to Covid-related  absences, on top of 74 services previously withdrawn. The airline had already signalled it intention to cancel most of the flights following a decision to reduce its schedule until the end of May. But recent high levels of staff absence due to Covid have meant further flights being called off ahead of Easter. EasyJet cancelled about 30 flights at Gatwick Airport on Wednesday. Thousands of holidaymakers have seen their Easter getaways - the first holiday since the end of Covid travel restrictions - delayed or cancelled because airlines and airports do not have enough staff to meet the recovery in demand. BA withdrew six flights at the last minute on Tuesday as a result of Covid absences. On Monday, it cancelled scheduled 62 flights but 12 of them were grounded at the last minute. Covid-related absences have compounded staff shortages at airports and airlines, and the industry is struggling to recruit staff after thousands of jobs were lost and many workers left the during the pandemic. EasyJet has said its staff absences were double their normal levels due to Covid. The airline said the main routes affected by cancellations were to Amsterdam, Krakow, Bologna and Berlin. What's the guidance if I have Covid now? Why are so many people catching Covid again? Staff shortages have led to passengers having to face long delays at security and check-in at some airports, with travellers complaining of ""chaos"". Problems at Manchester Airport led to Karen Smart, the airport's managing director, announcing on Tuesday that she would stand down. It came after Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said police and fire and rescue service staff could be drafted in to help tackle the chaos. Former Monarch Airlines boss Tim Jeans, who is now director of Cornwall Airport Newquay, told the BBC's Today programme levels of disruption had varied across the country. ""The problems at Manchester and to a lesser extent at Heathrow are stand out problems because other airports like Birmingham, Gatwick, Newcastle and Glasgow they've not seen the type of problems Manchester and Heathrow have,"" he said. ""The issue really has been you have to plan to recruit to train, in a very difficult labour market, many many many months in advance and it would appear that Manchester for whatever issues they have had, simply didn't do that."" Mr Jeans said it takes on average at least 12 weeks to recruit and train new security staff and predicted it would be ""the middle of June before we see a significant easing of these issues"".

The destruction to the town of Borodyanka is ""much more horrific"" than what has already been uncovered in nearby Bucha, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky has said in his newest Facebook address to the nation late on Thursday. ""They have started sorting through the ruins in Borodyanka,"" Zelensky said in his remarks from Kyiv. ""It's much more horrific there. There are even more victims of Russian occupiers."" Both towns are suburbs of Kyiv and saw fierce fighting in the battle for the capital.

Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Gennady Kuzmin, Russia's deputy Permanent Representative, speaks to the United Nations General Assembly Russiaâs suspension from the UN Human Rights Council is unprecedented. Never before has the General Assembly taken such action against a permanent member of the UN Security Council. The reports emerging from Ukraine have caused horror; an elected member of the human rights council (there are 47) is supposed to protect and promote human rights. The images from Bucha suggest Russian troops have been doing the opposite. That is why 93 UN member states backed the US-led move to suspend Russia. But there are 193 UN members, so less than half voted in favour: 58 abstained, 24 voted against, a further 18 were out of the room having what UN diplomats wryly call a ""strategic coffee break"". Western nations view Russiaâs suspension as essential if the UN is to fulfil its mandate on human rights, but others see it as deeply divisive. Some of the countries which abstained, among them South Africa, objected to taking this decision before the councilâs own inquiry into war crimes in Ukraine has even begun its work, let alone issued its report. And what about other elected council members, like China? Will it be suspended if UN human rights commissioner Michelle Bacheletâs long-awaited report into the treatment of the Uighur population reveals major violations? Today's vote is a huge blow for Russia, but itâs also an ominous reminder that the UN is finding it harder and harder to do its job. Yogita LimayeBBC News, Yahidne Mykola tied himself to a wall so he could sleep standing up. On the white, damp wall of the Yahidne school basement is a crude calendar, drawn in red crayon. It marks a period of unimaginable trauma - from 5 March to 2 April - for the people of this village. Yahidne, 140km (80 miles) north-west of Kyiv, which is close to the borders with Belarus and Russia, was occupied by Russian soldiers for nearly a month. They took men, women and children from their homes at gunpoint and held them in the basement of the local school for four weeks - around 130 people cramped into a room roughly 65 sq m (700 sq ft) in size. Sixty-year-old Mykola Klymchuk was one of them. He offered to show us the basement. ""This was my half a metre of space. I was sleeping standing up,"" he said. His voice choked up and he started crying. ""I tied myself to the railing here with my scarf so I wouldn't fall over. I spent 25 nights like this."" Mykola said you couldn't move for fear of stepping on people. About 40 or 50 children were among those held captive. The youngest was just two months old. ""During my time here, 12 people died,"" Mykola said. Most were elderly people. It's unclear what they died of, but Mykola believes some suffocated to death. When people died, the bodies couldn't immediately be removed. This meant that people, including children, lived amidst corpses for hours, and sometimes days, until they could be taken outside. Read the report in full: Ukraine war: Sharing space with the dead - horror outside Chernihiv The war has entered a ""new and different phase"", UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said, after today's meeting of Nato allies. Ms Truss said there was now ""a more concentrated Russian offensive"" in Ukraine, and Nato had agreed to supply new and heavier equipment to fight it. Speaking after the meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, Ms Truss said: ""Putin has changed his tactics but not his intent. He wants a hold over the whole of Ukraine."" She earlier said the UK would be ""stepping up"" its supply of weapons but has not yet detailed what this would include. You can read abouther comments hereand we look at whatNato is and how it's helping Ukrainehere. Alice EvansBBC News Land warfare analyst Nick Reynolds, who works for the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank, has been filling us in on what the next few weeks of the war in Ukraine might look like, as Russia shifts its focus to the area in the south and east known as the Donbas. Was Ukraine's foreign minister accuratewhen he saidthe fighting in the Donbas could be reminiscent of World War Two? âYes I think thatâs accurate,"" Reynolds said. ""With all the forces freed up
from the north of Ukraineâ¦ weâre going to see a clash of arms on European soil
that hasnât been seen for generations."" Could Ukraine actually take back territory? There are a lot of unknown factors here, Reynolds says. Many Ukrainians will be buoyed up by the withdrawal of Russian forces in the north, but in the south and east âthe map has
still been slowly turning redâ, he says, and that's even before any reinforcements have arrived from the north. So Russia certainly still has some forwards momentum in the south and east, he says. How much difference could Western arms make? The weapons Western countries have so far sent to Ukraine have been game-changing but Nato has handed over a ""significant amount of its stocks - and that supply was finite"", Reynolds says. Western arms will be ""absolutely essential"" in the coming weeks but it's hard to know how they can get them to where they need to go, he adds. Ramping up industrial production of sophisticated weapons such as Javelins, NLAWs and Stingers is not easy, he says, as they have complex supply chains, He believes Western governments are struggling to keep up with demand. Switchblade dronescould âstart to change things on the ground within a short
timeframeâ â but thereâs âvery little elseâ that could do so, he adds. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent Ukrainian soldiers sit on a military vehicule in Severodonetsk, Donbas region. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba isnât the only one warning of horrendous battles to come. Western military officials expect Russia to throw everything into an offensive in the Donbas, in an effort to secure something that Moscow can describe as a victory. The question is how long itâll take before the Russians are ready and whether Ukraine will be able to withstand the pressure when it comes. Hence the sense of urgency, with Kuleba warning on Thursday that additional military support must come in days, not weeks, saying that the three items on his agenda were ""weapons, weapons, and weapons"". He and Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg are deliberately coy about what equipment is being sent. They donât want the Russians to know exactly what is being supplied, something that would help Moscow organise its attack. But the UK Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, says thereâs support within Nato for sending ânew and heavier equipmentâ, and the MoD announced earlier that Ukrainian officials were in the UK earlier this week looking at âprotected mobility vehicles,â which could include the heavily armoured Mastiff patrol vehicle. With the Czech government sending Soviet-era T-72 tanks and the US announcing another $100m worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles, the flow of weapons is continuing, and the pace is picking up. If you are just joining us, or need a recap, here's what's happened so far today. In international diplomacy:  In Ukraine: Gennady Kuzmin, Russia Deputy Permanent Representative, speaks at the United Nations General Assembly. Moscow has said that the decision to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council on Thursday was ""illegal"" and ""politically motivated"". The vote at the United Nations General Assembly saw 93 member states vote to suspend Russia (58 abstained and 24 voted against). Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told Sky News Russia was sorry about the decision and would continue to defend its interests ""using every possible legal means"". It was only the second ever suspension of a country from the Human Rights Council. The first was Libya in 2011. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin People walk through debris on a street in Bucha, following the withdrawal of Russian forces Russian soldiers can be heard talking about the murder of Ukrainian civilians in military radio traffic intercepted by Germany's foreign intelligence (BND), according to several separate media reports. The BND has audio material that appears to match the locations of bodies found in Bucha, the reports from German media say. In one, Russians appear to talk about interrogating people and then shooting them. In another, a soldier talks about shooting someone on a bike - which apparently matches a well-known photo showing a dead cyclist. The intelligence was shared with German parliamentarians during a briefing on Wednesday. However, a German security source told Reuters news agency that the findings on Bucha related to satellite images. âThe radio transmissions cannot be clearly assigned to Bucha."" A German
government spokesman confirmed Berlin has evidence that Russian troops
committed the atrocities. The reported intelligence also
appears to show evidence that Wagner mercenaries are also fighting for Russia
in Ukraine - backing upclaims made by British intelligenceearlier this week. The group has been active over the past eight years in Ukraine, Syria and African countries, and has repeatedly been accused of war crimes and human rights abuses. Russia has suffered ""significant losses of troops"", President Vladimir Putin's spokesman has said. Dmitry Peskov was asked on Sky News whether the war had been a ""humiliation"", given that Russia had retreated from the capital, lost thousands of troops and that President Volodymyr Zelensky was still in power. He said this was a ""wrong understanding"" of what was going on. But asked again if Russia has lost thousands of troops, he said: ""Yes, we have significant losses of troops and it's a huge tragedy for us."" He then added that the withdrawal from the Kyiv region and the northern city of Chernihiv was an ""act of goodwill"" to ""lift tension"" during peace talks. In the interview, Peskov repeated Russia's reasons for what it describes as a ""special military operation"", saying Ukraine had become ""anti-Russian"" and Russia was ""really nervous"" as Nato had ""started to move towards our boundaries"". Russia has previously said that 1,351 soldiers have been killed. The full death toll is not known, but a Nato official has been quoted in the US media as saying between 7,000 and 15,000, and there are similar US estimates. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has been speaking
to reporters after todayâs meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Belgium. âThere is a greater determination than ever to stand with
Ukraine,â he said, and to inflict âeven greater costsâ on Russia for its
invasion. He also said for every Bucha - a city in which Russia has been accused of committing war crimes - there were likely to be more places in which atrocities were happening. Blinken also welcomed the earlier vote to suspend Russia
from the UN Human Rights Council, saying: âToday, a wrong was righted.â Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has responded to the news that Russia has been suspended from the UN's Human Rights Council. Kulebasaid,external: ""War criminals have no place in UN bodies aimed at protecting human rights. Grateful to all member states which supported the relevant UNGA resolution and chose the right side of history."" More now on that vote moments ago to suspend Russia from the UNâs
Human Rights Council during a session in New York. Ninety-three countries voted
in favour of the move, 24 against, and there were 58 abstentions. Among the countries who supported the suspension were the
US, EU nations, the UK, and of course Ukraine itself. China, Syria, and Belarus were among those who voted against the motion. And India, Egypt, and South Africa were among the nations
which abstained. You can see the full list here,external.  The General Assembly of the United Nations has just voted to suspend Russia from its Human Rights Council during a session in New York. It follows allegations of war crimes by Kremlin troops in Ukraine. Before votes were cast, Ukraineâs ambassador to the UN Sergiy Kyslytsya accused Russia of âhorrificâ abuses â raising the issue of alleged civilian killings in the city of Bucha. Russiaâs own representative Gennady Kuzmin condemned the vote, and other nations including North Korea and Syria rallied behind him. Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba speaking at the Nato meeting Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberghas statedthat allies are âready to do moreâ to provide military equipment and support to Ukraine. But Ukraineâs Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, also speaking at a press conference earlier at Nato HQ in Brussels, said that help was needed in âdays not weeksâ if it was to avoid coming too late. Articulating the severity of the situation, Kuleba compared the unfolding fighting in the Donbas region to the Second World War. â[It] will remind you of the Second World War, with large operations... the involvement of thousands of tanks, armoured vehicles, planes, artillery.â He said this would ânot be a local operationâ based on current observations of Russian preparations. ""Russia has its plan, we have ours - and the outcome of this battle will be decided on the battlefield,"" he added. The Donbas is Ukraine's old coal and steel-producing area. The term refers to two big eastern regions, Luhansk and Donetsk. Russian-backed separatists declared ""republics"" in parts of the regions in 2014 and Russian forces have captured more territory since Vladimir Putin's invasion began in late February. Russian forces executed civilians in various locations in the Kyiv region, according to new testimonypublished by Amnesty International.,external The human rights organisation interviewed more than 20 people from towns and villages near the capital, some were witnesses to, or had direct knowledge of, the violence committed, it says. ""In recent weeks, we have gathered evidence that Russian forces have committed extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings, which must be investigated as likely war crimes,"" says Amnesty International Secretary General AgnÃ¨s Callamard. ""Testimonies shows that unarmed civilians in Ukraine are being killed in their homes and streets in acts of unspeakable cruelty and shocking brutality."" In one account given, a woman in a village east of Kyiv told Amnesty two Russian soldiers entered her house on 9 March, killed her husband, then repeatedly raped her at gunpoint while her young son hid in a boiler room nearby. With Russian forces retreating from the north of Ukraine, disturbing
stories of life under occupation have been emerging. The BBC's Jeremy Bowen has
been told of Russian troops using villagers as human shields against Ukrainian
counter-attacks. Russia has repeatedly denied that its forces have committed
atrocities, and sought to point the finger of blame elsewhere. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,1.2758504e-10
"John Lansdown is seeking damages of Â£76m and wants to set up a trust to protect seafarers' rights A former P&O Ferries chef is suing the company and its chief executive, claiming unfair dismissal, racial discrimination and harassment. John Lansdown is the only seafarer to take legal action after 800 staff were sacked without notice last month. In his tribunal claim he accuses P&O of treating him unfavourably as he is British and eligible for minimum wage. P&O Ferries said job cuts were ""categorically not based on race or the nationality of the staff involved"". The company ""needed fundamental change to make it viable - we knew this decision was the only way to save the business"", P&O said in a statement. Mr Lansdown is seeking financial compensation as well as exemplary damages of up to Â£76m to ""deter"" P&O Ferries or its parent company DP World from acting the same way in future. He would use the money to create a new trust to campaign for improved wages and terms and conditions for seafarers and to outlaw ""fire and hire"" practices in the industry and more widely in the UK, according to his claim. Mr Lansdown, 39, told the BBC he wanted to get ""justice"" for all his former colleagues who felt they had ""no choice"" but to settle their cases. ""This is not just about me,"" he said. ""799 of my seafaring family have lost their livelihoods, their way of life, their homes for half the year and it's about the bigger picture."" P&O confirmed to the BBC that ""all but one"" employee had accepted a settlement and therefore forfeited their right to any legal action as a result. John next to the Old Pride of Kent, the first ship he joined aged 16 Mr Lansdown said he joined P&O Ferries as a 16-year-old trainee and was working as a sous chef on The Pride of Canterbury when he was sacked three weeks ago. He was working on the ship and had to leave his belongings behind when he was notified ""out of the blue, and without any prior consultation"" about his instant dismissal, he said. In his legal papers, seen by the BBC, he claimed private security staff, carrying handcuffs and wearing balaclavas, were hired to remove workers who refused to disembark ferries. ""I was devastated by the brutal summary dismissal after many years of loyal and diligent service,"" his claim states. ""The manner of the dismissal was harassing."" In a statement to the BBC, P&O said: ""No staff involved in the redundancies wore balaclavas nor were they directed to use handcuffs or force. ""Staff remained professional, sympathetic and calm in a challenging situation for everyone, trying to ensure the safety of all the people on board the ships. There was no harassment,"" it said. John and his mum after winning a P&O cake competition Mr Lansdown alleges the redundancy was a ""sham"" and unlawful because there was no fair selection process, no diminished need for his job, and P&O Ferries' parent company, DP World, is very profitable, the document adds. Mr Lansdown's British nationality was also a significant influence on the decision to sack staff and replace them with non-British crew paid below the minimum wage of up to Â£5.50 per hour, it further claims. P&O Ferries boss Peter Hebblethwaite previously admitted to MPs thata decision to sack 800 workers without notice or union consultation had broken the lawbut said he would make the decision again if he had to. At the time, he said of his decision that no union would have accepted the plan and it was easier to compensate workers ""in full"" instead. In his legal claim, Mr Lansdown accused the company of ""violating his dignity and creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating environment"". He told the BBC: ""At the end of the day, it was the essence of Brexit what happened to us. This could give a green light to other companies to do the same."" Mr Lansdown's lawyer, Lawrence Davies of Equal Justice solicitors, said: ""This is the most important battle for British workers' rights post-Brexit; the battle to prevent British jobs being lost on British waters to cheap foreign labour."" He added: ""It is a fight we must win."" P&O Ferries has previously said that all 800 staff made redundant would be offered Â£36.5m in total - with around 40 receiving more than Â£100,000 each. TheInsolvency Service has launched criminal and civil investigationsinto the controversial mass redundancies.

The destruction to the town of Borodyanka is ""much more horrific"" than what has already been uncovered in nearby Bucha, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky has said in his newest Facebook address to the nation late on Thursday. ""They have started sorting through the ruins in Borodyanka,"" Zelensky said in his remarks from Kyiv. ""It's much more horrific there. There are even more victims of Russian occupiers."" Both towns are suburbs of Kyiv and saw fierce fighting in the battle for the capital.

Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Gennady Kuzmin, Russia's deputy Permanent Representative, speaks to the United Nations General Assembly Russiaâs suspension from the UN Human Rights Council is unprecedented. Never before has the General Assembly taken such action against a permanent member of the UN Security Council. The reports emerging from Ukraine have caused horror; an elected member of the human rights council (there are 47) is supposed to protect and promote human rights. The images from Bucha suggest Russian troops have been doing the opposite. That is why 93 UN member states backed the US-led move to suspend Russia. But there are 193 UN members, so less than half voted in favour: 58 abstained, 24 voted against, a further 18 were out of the room having what UN diplomats wryly call a ""strategic coffee break"". Western nations view Russiaâs suspension as essential if the UN is to fulfil its mandate on human rights, but others see it as deeply divisive. Some of the countries which abstained, among them South Africa, objected to taking this decision before the councilâs own inquiry into war crimes in Ukraine has even begun its work, let alone issued its report. And what about other elected council members, like China? Will it be suspended if UN human rights commissioner Michelle Bacheletâs long-awaited report into the treatment of the Uighur population reveals major violations? Today's vote is a huge blow for Russia, but itâs also an ominous reminder that the UN is finding it harder and harder to do its job. Yogita LimayeBBC News, Yahidne Mykola tied himself to a wall so he could sleep standing up. On the white, damp wall of the Yahidne school basement is a crude calendar, drawn in red crayon. It marks a period of unimaginable trauma - from 5 March to 2 April - for the people of this village. Yahidne, 140km (80 miles) north-west of Kyiv, which is close to the borders with Belarus and Russia, was occupied by Russian soldiers for nearly a month. They took men, women and children from their homes at gunpoint and held them in the basement of the local school for four weeks - around 130 people cramped into a room roughly 65 sq m (700 sq ft) in size. Sixty-year-old Mykola Klymchuk was one of them. He offered to show us the basement. ""This was my half a metre of space. I was sleeping standing up,"" he said. His voice choked up and he started crying. ""I tied myself to the railing here with my scarf so I wouldn't fall over. I spent 25 nights like this."" Mykola said you couldn't move for fear of stepping on people. About 40 or 50 children were among those held captive. The youngest was just two months old. ""During my time here, 12 people died,"" Mykola said. Most were elderly people. It's unclear what they died of, but Mykola believes some suffocated to death. When people died, the bodies couldn't immediately be removed. This meant that people, including children, lived amidst corpses for hours, and sometimes days, until they could be taken outside. Read the report in full: Ukraine war: Sharing space with the dead - horror outside Chernihiv The war has entered a ""new and different phase"", UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said, after today's meeting of Nato allies. Ms Truss said there was now ""a more concentrated Russian offensive"" in Ukraine, and Nato had agreed to supply new and heavier equipment to fight it. Speaking after the meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, Ms Truss said: ""Putin has changed his tactics but not his intent. He wants a hold over the whole of Ukraine."" She earlier said the UK would be ""stepping up"" its supply of weapons but has not yet detailed what this would include. You can read abouther comments hereand we look at whatNato is and how it's helping Ukrainehere. Alice EvansBBC News Land warfare analyst Nick Reynolds, who works for the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank, has been filling us in on what the next few weeks of the war in Ukraine might look like, as Russia shifts its focus to the area in the south and east known as the Donbas. Was Ukraine's foreign minister accuratewhen he saidthe fighting in the Donbas could be reminiscent of World War Two? âYes I think thatâs accurate,"" Reynolds said. ""With all the forces freed up
from the north of Ukraineâ¦ weâre going to see a clash of arms on European soil
that hasnât been seen for generations."" Could Ukraine actually take back territory? There are a lot of unknown factors here, Reynolds says. Many Ukrainians will be buoyed up by the withdrawal of Russian forces in the north, but in the south and east âthe map has
still been slowly turning redâ, he says, and that's even before any reinforcements have arrived from the north. So Russia certainly still has some forwards momentum in the south and east, he says. How much difference could Western arms make? The weapons Western countries have so far sent to Ukraine have been game-changing but Nato has handed over a ""significant amount of its stocks - and that supply was finite"", Reynolds says. Western arms will be ""absolutely essential"" in the coming weeks but it's hard to know how they can get them to where they need to go, he adds. Ramping up industrial production of sophisticated weapons such as Javelins, NLAWs and Stingers is not easy, he says, as they have complex supply chains, He believes Western governments are struggling to keep up with demand. Switchblade dronescould âstart to change things on the ground within a short
timeframeâ â but thereâs âvery little elseâ that could do so, he adds. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent Ukrainian soldiers sit on a military vehicule in Severodonetsk, Donbas region. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba isnât the only one warning of horrendous battles to come. Western military officials expect Russia to throw everything into an offensive in the Donbas, in an effort to secure something that Moscow can describe as a victory. The question is how long itâll take before the Russians are ready and whether Ukraine will be able to withstand the pressure when it comes. Hence the sense of urgency, with Kuleba warning on Thursday that additional military support must come in days, not weeks, saying that the three items on his agenda were ""weapons, weapons, and weapons"". He and Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg are deliberately coy about what equipment is being sent. They donât want the Russians to know exactly what is being supplied, something that would help Moscow organise its attack. But the UK Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, says thereâs support within Nato for sending ânew and heavier equipmentâ, and the MoD announced earlier that Ukrainian officials were in the UK earlier this week looking at âprotected mobility vehicles,â which could include the heavily armoured Mastiff patrol vehicle. With the Czech government sending Soviet-era T-72 tanks and the US announcing another $100m worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles, the flow of weapons is continuing, and the pace is picking up. If you are just joining us, or need a recap, here's what's happened so far today. In international diplomacy:  In Ukraine: Gennady Kuzmin, Russia Deputy Permanent Representative, speaks at the United Nations General Assembly. Moscow has said that the decision to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council on Thursday was ""illegal"" and ""politically motivated"". The vote at the United Nations General Assembly saw 93 member states vote to suspend Russia (58 abstained and 24 voted against). Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told Sky News Russia was sorry about the decision and would continue to defend its interests ""using every possible legal means"". It was only the second ever suspension of a country from the Human Rights Council. The first was Libya in 2011. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin People walk through debris on a street in Bucha, following the withdrawal of Russian forces Russian soldiers can be heard talking about the murder of Ukrainian civilians in military radio traffic intercepted by Germany's foreign intelligence (BND), according to several separate media reports. The BND has audio material that appears to match the locations of bodies found in Bucha, the reports from German media say. In one, Russians appear to talk about interrogating people and then shooting them. In another, a soldier talks about shooting someone on a bike - which apparently matches a well-known photo showing a dead cyclist. The intelligence was shared with German parliamentarians during a briefing on Wednesday. However, a German security source told Reuters news agency that the findings on Bucha related to satellite images. âThe radio transmissions cannot be clearly assigned to Bucha."" A German
government spokesman confirmed Berlin has evidence that Russian troops
committed the atrocities. The reported intelligence also
appears to show evidence that Wagner mercenaries are also fighting for Russia
in Ukraine - backing upclaims made by British intelligenceearlier this week. The group has been active over the past eight years in Ukraine, Syria and African countries, and has repeatedly been accused of war crimes and human rights abuses. Russia has suffered ""significant losses of troops"", President Vladimir Putin's spokesman has said. Dmitry Peskov was asked on Sky News whether the war had been a ""humiliation"", given that Russia had retreated from the capital, lost thousands of troops and that President Volodymyr Zelensky was still in power. He said this was a ""wrong understanding"" of what was going on. But asked again if Russia has lost thousands of troops, he said: ""Yes, we have significant losses of troops and it's a huge tragedy for us."" He then added that the withdrawal from the Kyiv region and the northern city of Chernihiv was an ""act of goodwill"" to ""lift tension"" during peace talks. In the interview, Peskov repeated Russia's reasons for what it describes as a ""special military operation"", saying Ukraine had become ""anti-Russian"" and Russia was ""really nervous"" as Nato had ""started to move towards our boundaries"". Russia has previously said that 1,351 soldiers have been killed. The full death toll is not known, but a Nato official has been quoted in the US media as saying between 7,000 and 15,000, and there are similar US estimates. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has been speaking
to reporters after todayâs meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Belgium. âThere is a greater determination than ever to stand with
Ukraine,â he said, and to inflict âeven greater costsâ on Russia for its
invasion. He also said for every Bucha - a city in which Russia has been accused of committing war crimes - there were likely to be more places in which atrocities were happening. Blinken also welcomed the earlier vote to suspend Russia
from the UN Human Rights Council, saying: âToday, a wrong was righted.â Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has responded to the news that Russia has been suspended from the UN's Human Rights Council. Kulebasaid,external: ""War criminals have no place in UN bodies aimed at protecting human rights. Grateful to all member states which supported the relevant UNGA resolution and chose the right side of history."" More now on that vote moments ago to suspend Russia from the UNâs
Human Rights Council during a session in New York. Ninety-three countries voted
in favour of the move, 24 against, and there were 58 abstentions. Among the countries who supported the suspension were the
US, EU nations, the UK, and of course Ukraine itself. China, Syria, and Belarus were among those who voted against the motion. And India, Egypt, and South Africa were among the nations
which abstained. You can see the full list here,external.  The General Assembly of the United Nations has just voted to suspend Russia from its Human Rights Council during a session in New York. It follows allegations of war crimes by Kremlin troops in Ukraine. Before votes were cast, Ukraineâs ambassador to the UN Sergiy Kyslytsya accused Russia of âhorrificâ abuses â raising the issue of alleged civilian killings in the city of Bucha. Russiaâs own representative Gennady Kuzmin condemned the vote, and other nations including North Korea and Syria rallied behind him. Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba speaking at the Nato meeting Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberghas statedthat allies are âready to do moreâ to provide military equipment and support to Ukraine. But Ukraineâs Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, also speaking at a press conference earlier at Nato HQ in Brussels, said that help was needed in âdays not weeksâ if it was to avoid coming too late. Articulating the severity of the situation, Kuleba compared the unfolding fighting in the Donbas region to the Second World War. â[It] will remind you of the Second World War, with large operations... the involvement of thousands of tanks, armoured vehicles, planes, artillery.â He said this would ânot be a local operationâ based on current observations of Russian preparations. ""Russia has its plan, we have ours - and the outcome of this battle will be decided on the battlefield,"" he added. The Donbas is Ukraine's old coal and steel-producing area. The term refers to two big eastern regions, Luhansk and Donetsk. Russian-backed separatists declared ""republics"" in parts of the regions in 2014 and Russian forces have captured more territory since Vladimir Putin's invasion began in late February. Russian forces executed civilians in various locations in the Kyiv region, according to new testimonypublished by Amnesty International.,external The human rights organisation interviewed more than 20 people from towns and villages near the capital, some were witnesses to, or had direct knowledge of, the violence committed, it says. ""In recent weeks, we have gathered evidence that Russian forces have committed extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings, which must be investigated as likely war crimes,"" says Amnesty International Secretary General AgnÃ¨s Callamard. ""Testimonies shows that unarmed civilians in Ukraine are being killed in their homes and streets in acts of unspeakable cruelty and shocking brutality."" In one account given, a woman in a village east of Kyiv told Amnesty two Russian soldiers entered her house on 9 March, killed her husband, then repeatedly raped her at gunpoint while her young son hid in a boiler room nearby. With Russian forces retreating from the north of Ukraine, disturbing
stories of life under occupation have been emerging. The BBC's Jeremy Bowen has
been told of Russian troops using villagers as human shields against Ukrainian
counter-attacks. Russia has repeatedly denied that its forces have committed
atrocities, and sought to point the finger of blame elsewhere. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.22384378
"The burden of tax falling on workers and employers has increased as a hotly-debated rise in National Insurance payments takes effect. Employees, businesses and the self-employed will pay an extra 1.25p in the pound. The government says it will spend it on health and social care. Opposition MPs said it exacerbated cost of living pressures, but mitigation will be introduced in July. Experts are urging people to check their status as a new tax year starts. Earnings levels at which people start to pay income tax have been frozen, increasing the chances of employees being dragged into a new band - with a higher rate of tax - if they receive a pay rise. Employees pay National Insurance on their wages, employers pay extra contributions for staff, and the self-employed pay it on their profits. In September, the government announced the rise in contributions from 6 April, in part to help ease the burden on the NHS. It means that, instead of paying National Insurance contributions of 12% on earnings up to Â£50,270 and 2% on anything above that, employees will now pay 13.25% and 3.25% respectively. The self-employed will see equivalent rates go up from 9% and 2% to 10.25% and 3.25%. Businesses face perfect storm as tax rise kicks in What will April's tax changes cost me? Five reasons why prices and bills are going up Javid defends NI tax hike for NHS funding Those of state pension age do not pay the tax at present, and nor do those on very low incomes. After the announcement last year, the plans were met with disapproval from opposition parties and some backbench Conservative MPs who criticised the timing, as many people face sharp rises in energy bills and prices in general. Chancellor Rishi Sunak responded in his Spring Statement with plans to allow workers and the self-employed to earn more before they start making National Insurance payments. This will take effect in July. The National Insurance rise will - ministers like to say - provide a much needed boost to health and social care. They claim it will pay for the care cap and boost NHS capacity to help tackle the backlog in England - it is up to the rest of the UK to decide how they spend the proceeds. But the truth is it will only contribute to that. Rising inflation, staff shortages and ageing equipment and buildings, means the health and care system is going to suck up the Â£39bn raised over the next three years by the hike and then some more. It is also worth bearing in mind the government had already committed to rises for the NHS up until 2024 under a funding settlement agreed by the May government. This had brought the increases to something close to the 4% health has historically got - although the rising inflation that is being seen will whittle that away from now on. And that came after a decade of the budget rising by little more than 1% - an unprecedented squeeze for the health service. The National Insurance rise is not quite all it seems. From now, employees will payNational Insurance contributions,externalon earnings above Â£9,880 a year. From July, it will be paid on earnings above Â£12,570 a year. Taken together, the measures mean that, over the next 12 months, anyone earning less than about Â£34,000 a year will pay less in National Insurance than they did the previous year, while those earning more will see their payments rise. Had the chancellor stuck with his original plan, then all but the very lowest income workers would have paid more in National Insurance. Many employers will still pay more, and business groups have warned that this may be passed on in higher prices. They also said it would add to the pressures already faced by firms following the withdrawal of Covid support measures. Among those concerned about the bill is Hanna Gentry, an assistant general manager at George's Bistro in Cleckheaton. Hanna Gentry says the bar will need to bring in more business ""Personally for me if I look at my wage I think it's not too much, but as a business when you have to pay that on everybody's wages, it adds up really, really quickly,"" she said. ""We are going to try and bring in more custom, that's the only way we can do it - in terms of events, new menus, to try and draw customers in."" Meanwhile James Hipkins, managing director of Emery's Timber and Builders Merchants in Stoke and Telford, told the BBC's Today programme the rise was ""another little extra bit"" to add to the rising cost of materials, fuel and energy. ""My greater concern is, is it the beginning of a perfect storm? By that I just mean all the little snips going up, is it going to start to stifle industry?"" However, Mr Hipkins said society had a ""moral obligation and responsibility to this"" to fund social care services, which he added have been ""overlooked"" for too long. ""We all know it needs sorting out, we all know it needs to be paid for but none of us are particularly keen on paying for it,"" he added. ""At this stage is it seems a bit wishy washy and woolly as it's coming in. I would feel a lot more confident and a lot more happy when I see it as an actual separate levy and it can be identified for where it's supposed to be going."" The government said it had raisedEmployment Allowance,externalfrom Â£4,000 to Â£5,000, so smaller firms could claim up to Â£5,000 off their National Insurance bills. Ministers said it meant 670,000 firms would not pay the tax at all. Overall, the increases in National Insurance for employers and higher-income workers will raise an extra Â£10.9bn in a year for the government, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Prime Minister Boris Johnson described it as ""necessary, fair and responsible"", adding that it would ""provide the health and care system with the long term funding it needs as we recover from the pandemic"". Next year, the extra tax will be rebranded as the Health and Social Care Levy. Health Minister Sajid Javid said the levy was necessary because it would be ""morally wrong"" to let ""our children pay for our healthcare and our adult social care"". The Labour Leader Keir Starmer has condemned the NI rise saying that the UK now has the highest rate of taxation in 70 years. Calling it the ""wrong tax at the wrong time"" he said: ""In the middle of worst cost of living crisis for decades today the government chooses to increase taxes on working people."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the NI rise ""puts all the burden on working people"". An increase in thetax on dividends,externalis also coming into effect, to add to the funds channelled by the government into the NHS and social care. It has also gone up by 1.25p in the pound. Many private investors hold shares in an Individual Savings Account (Isa) which protects them from tax. However, some business owners pay themselves in dividends and so will face a tax rise. Early last year Mr Sunak said the thresholds at which income tax is paid would be frozen at April 2021 levels for five years (although Scotland has different levels). That means pay rises will push more people into higher tax bands. If a pay rise takes somebody from below Â£12,570 a year to above, then they will start paying income tax at 20% on the amount above Â£12,570. A shift in salary from below Â£50,270 to above means paying the higher rate of 40% on the amount above Â£50,270. The next threshold is at Â£150,000, when the additional tax rate of 45% kicks in. Adrian Lowery, personal finance spokesman at investing platform Bestinvest, urged people to check their tax code, which is issued by HM Revenue and Customs and can be found on a pay slip. ""A tax code of 1257L is currently used for most people who have one job or pension. If yours is different, make sure you understand why, so you're not paying too much tax,"" he said. At last month's Spring Statement, Mr Sunak pledged to reduce the basic rate of income tax by 1p in the pound before the end of the Parliament in 2024. For this new tax year, the personal allowance ofcapital gains tax,externalhas also been frozen at Â£12,300, so this much profit can be realised from assets in a year before tax is paid. The threshold forinheritance tax,external- a levy on estates when somebody dies - has also been frozen again at Â£325,000, as it has since 2009. Will the National Insurance cut leave me better off?

"Craig and Gina Dewdney were told their naturally conceived identical triplets were incredibly rare The parents of ""one-in-200 million"" identical triplet boys are reflecting on the ""best but hardest job"" as they celebrate their sons' first birthday. Gina Dewdney and her husband Craig were shocked when doctors at Liverpool Women's Hospital told them their naturally-conceived babies were such a rare occurrence. When born the boys spent six weeks in hospital before going home. Now Jimmy, Jensen and Jaxson are celebrating their milestone birthday. Mrs Dewdney, from Frodsham in Cheshire, said: ""They've gone through so much already in their tiny little lives so it's going to be a big celebration for them and for us as well. ""Being a mum is the best job I've ever had. It's the hardest job by far but I absolutely love it now, even through the lack of sleep and the hospital visits. ""It's tough but I'm loving it, I really am."" The boys spent six weeks on a neonatal intensive care unit before being allowed home Mrs Dewdney, 34, said she had an ""inkling"" she was having twins at first - which was later confirmed with a scan - before the couple spotted a third head on the screen. ""Twenty minutes into the scan Craig said 'is that a third head?' and there was silence,"" she said. ""The consultant said in 25 years of scanning they'd never seen triplets, and they were all sharing one placenta which is super, super rare."" Mr Dewdney, 35, said: ""I was just like 'how does that work holding them?' And I was thinking that's a lot of nappies."" The couple said they had now established a carefully planned routine. ""If they are even 20 minutes out of sync from one another, you'll settle one down and then the other one will wake up and then that one could potentially wake up the baby that you've just put to sleep,"" Mr Dewdney said. ""Feeding time is interesting. I have to tidy away while Gina is feeding them or if Gina is spoon-feeding two of them I'll go in with the other. It's just learning how to work together with them"".

"British Airways has cancelled four flights at Heathrow Airport today due to Covid-related  absences, on top of 74 services previously withdrawn. The airline had already signalled it intention to cancel most of the flights following a decision to reduce its schedule until the end of May. But recent high levels of staff absence due to Covid have meant further flights being called off ahead of Easter. EasyJet cancelled about 30 flights at Gatwick Airport on Wednesday. Thousands of holidaymakers have seen their Easter getaways - the first holiday since the end of Covid travel restrictions - delayed or cancelled because airlines and airports do not have enough staff to meet the recovery in demand. BA withdrew six flights at the last minute on Tuesday as a result of Covid absences. On Monday, it cancelled scheduled 62 flights but 12 of them were grounded at the last minute. Covid-related absences have compounded staff shortages at airports and airlines, and the industry is struggling to recruit staff after thousands of jobs were lost and many workers left the during the pandemic. EasyJet has said its staff absences were double their normal levels due to Covid. The airline said the main routes affected by cancellations were to Amsterdam, Krakow, Bologna and Berlin. What's the guidance if I have Covid now? Why are so many people catching Covid again? Staff shortages have led to passengers having to face long delays at security and check-in at some airports, with travellers complaining of ""chaos"". Problems at Manchester Airport led to Karen Smart, the airport's managing director, announcing on Tuesday that she would stand down. It came after Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said police and fire and rescue service staff could be drafted in to help tackle the chaos. Former Monarch Airlines boss Tim Jeans, who is now director of Cornwall Airport Newquay, told the BBC's Today programme levels of disruption had varied across the country. ""The problems at Manchester and to a lesser extent at Heathrow are stand out problems because other airports like Birmingham, Gatwick, Newcastle and Glasgow they've not seen the type of problems Manchester and Heathrow have,"" he said. ""The issue really has been you have to plan to recruit to train, in a very difficult labour market, many many many months in advance and it would appear that Manchester for whatever issues they have had, simply didn't do that."" Mr Jeans said it takes on average at least 12 weeks to recruit and train new security staff and predicted it would be ""the middle of June before we see a significant easing of these issues"".

"Twitter has confirmed that it is working on an edit button that would allow users to change tweets after they have been posted. It comes after new board member, Tesla boss Elon Musk, asked his followers in a Twitter poll whether they wanted the feature. Many users have long called for an edit button but there are concerns about how to execute it. Twitter said it would start testing the idea in the coming months. The social media firm's communications team tweeted: ""Now that everyone is askingâ¦ yes, we've been working on an edit feature since last year! ""No, we didn't get the idea from a poll ð,"" it added. ""We're kicking off testing within @TwitterBlue Labs in the coming months to learn what works, what doesn't, and what's possible.""

Elon Musk becomes Twitter's biggest shareholder However, he said the company was exploring how to build the feature ""in a safe manner"". ""Without things like time limits, controls, and transparency about what has been edited, Edit could be misused to alter the record of the public conversation,"" he said. ""Protecting the integrity of that public conversation is our top priority when we approach this work."" During a talk in 2018, former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey said the firm would ""probably never"" add the feature amid concerns about transparency. But rival social media platforms Facebook and Instagram already allow users to edit their posts, and Twitter's new boss Parag Agrawal appears open to the idea. Allow Twitter content?

Elon Musk started a poll on Monday after disclosing that he owned a 9.2% stake in Twitter, which made him the firm's biggest shareholder. On Tuesday it was announced that he had been appointed to Twitter's board. The poll has already attracted over four million votes. Twitter initially said it was exploring an edit button on 1 April but it was widely interpreted as an April Fool's joke. Twitter says it was already working on an edit button before Elon Musk was appointed to its board. But it does certainly look like the Tesla boss has moved the process along. Twitter polls are notoriously unscientific - yet Mr Musk appears to make real-life decisions based on their results. In November last year, he asked his 80 million followers whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock. The poll concluded he should, and he did. Mr Musk's poll on whether there should be an edit button on Twitter is being taken seriously by the chief executive of Twitter. ""The consequences of this poll will be important. Please vote carefully,"" Parag Agrawal said. It certainly suggests that Twitter will now look to change its policy in this area as a consequence of the poll result. Mr Musk overnight has generated huge influence over Twitter - and he seems to be giving his followers the ability to choose what approach he takes.

"Iryna Abramov stands outside her destroyed home in Bucha, where her husband was killed. 'I wish they had killed me too,' she said. Volodymyr Abramov was trying desperately to put out the fire in his home, in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, calling out for his son-in-law to help. Russian troops had smashed through the front gates of Volodymyr's home, opened fire at the house, and dragged Volodymyr, 72, his daughter Iryna, 48, and her husband Oleg, 40, out into the yard. The soldiers took Oleg out beyond the gate on to the pavement, Volodymyr said, and threw a grenade in through the front door of the house that exploded with a deafening bang and set the house on fire. Volodymyr grabbed a small fire extinguisher and tried in vain to extinguish the flames. ""Where is Oleg? Oleg will help!"" he shouted to his daughter. But the reply came from one of the Russian soldiers, he said. ""Oleg will not help you any more."" They found Oleg on the pavement outside the gate, and it was clear from the way he was lying that he had been forced to kneel and shot in the head at point blank range, Iryna said. He was a welder who lived a quiet life on the corner of Yablonska Street in Bucha, who was taken out of his home and killed. Volodymyr Abramov stands in the house once shared by his daughter and son-in-law. ""I felt empty when they killed Oleg,"" he said. ""I only wanted to die."" The killing is one of scores - if not hundreds - being uncovered in Bucha after Russian troops withdrew from the Kyiv suburb recently. The mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said on Monday that at least 300 civilians had been killed. There is no official tally yet. Russia has denied any involvement in the atrocities. But its burned-out tanks litter the city. On the grounds of a church, there is an open mass grave with the dead still inside, some in black body bags, some loose in the sand. On the roads, there are bullet-riddled civilian cars - at least one with a body still inside. Houses are caved in by shelling, their driveways ploughed over by tanks. Residents have described Russian soldiers shooting civilians outside their homes with no provocation, and satellite imagery shows that bodies were lying in the streets while the Russians were still in control. The Russian soldiers who killed Oleg Abramov ""did not ask him anything"", his wife Iryna said. ""They didn't ask anything or say anything, they just killed him,"" she said. ""They only told him to take off his shirt, kneel down, and they shot him."" Volodymyr Abramov points to the spot on the pavement outside their house where he says his son-in-law was forced to kneel and shot in the head She wept on Tuesday as she stood on the spot where he was killed, where a dark patch of blood was still visible on the street. When she ran out and found his disfigured body, the four Russian soldiers who dragged him out were standing casually drinking water, she said. She screamed at them to shoot her, and one raised his gun, then lowered it, then raised it again, and lowered it, until Volodymyr dragged her back inside the gate. ""Those soldiers told us we had three minutes to leave and they forced us to run in our slippers,"" Volodymyr said. ""Bucha was like an apocalypse - dead bodies everywhere, the streets full of smoke."" Volodymyr and Iryna had no choice but to leave Oleg's body lying on the street and it lay there for nearly a month while they sheltered at a relative's house nearby. When it was safe to return, Volodymyr tried to bury his son-in-law on a rough patch of earth by the pavement, and the half-dug hole was still visible there on Tuesday. But exhausted by the effort, and afraid of Russian soldiers, Volodymyr carried Oleg back inside the yard and laid him there. Later, Ukrainian soldiers loaded the body into a van, Volodymyr said, and took it away. ""I have no idea how we are going to find it now,"" he said. A mass grave on the grounds of a church in Bucha, where bodies were discovered when the Russians retreated Ukrainian authorities have now cleared the bodies off the streets of Bucha but there are fears more will be found in the basements and yards of private homes. Officials have only just begun the process of cataloguing the horrors. And so great is the damage in Bucha, it is hard to imagine the scale of the reconstruction needed to restore it to the attractive suburb it once was. Along one road through the town on Tuesday, where burned-out tanks were piled up and almost every house was destroyed, 84-year-old Hryhoriy Zamohylnyi was sweeping the street, as if oblivious to the total destruction around him. Somehow, his home was intact - the only building left undamaged along the whole stretch of road. ""I saw the war with the Germans and now this war with the Russians,"" said Zamohylnyi, a former engineer, born and raised in Bucha. ""What you see here is animal cruelty,"" he said. Addressing the UN security council on Tuesday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, accused the Russians of committing the worst crimes since World War Two, and called for those responsible to be tried as the Nazis were in Nuremberg. ""The Russian military searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our country,"" he said. ""They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies."" The ruins of the Abramovs' home in Bucha Ukraine has begun a war crimes investigation into Russia's actions in Bucha and nearby Irpin. It says 410 bodies have been found across the two suburbs so far. There are fears now that more atrocities will be found as the Russians retreat further and more suburbs are opened up - more bodies in the streets, more mass graves. Volodymyr and Iryna Abramov are only looking for one body, and their fear is that they will never find it. ""He was just a peaceful man, a family man, a welder, who struggled with a spine fracture and was disabled all his life,"" Volodymyr said. ""Just before he died, while I was in the yard, I saw him briefly through the open gate, on his knees, and he said his final words. He asked them why.""

"Putin's daughter Katerina Tikhonova works in academia and business The US has imposed sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle, including his daughters.

Even though satellite images have shown the civilians were killed when Russians were in control of Bucha, Mr Putin on Wednesday described the event as a ""crude and cynical provocation by the Kyiv regime"". Referring to the Bucha murders, US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday: ""There's nothing less happening than major war crimes."" ""Responsible nations have to come together to hold these perpetrators accountable,"" Mr Biden added.

Her sister, Ms Vorontsova, it went on, ""leads state-funded programs that have received billions of dollars from the Kremlin toward genetics research and are personally overseen by Putin"". Asked why the US was targeting Mr Putin's daughters, a senior Biden administration official said the US thought they could be in control of some of their father's assets.

The European Union is also debating cutting off Russian coal imports as concern over alleged war crimes increases. Before the new raft of sanctions was announced in Washington, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he could not ""tolerate any indecisiveness"". Speaking to the Irish parliament on Wednesday, he said there was still a need to convince some in Europe who believe ""war and war crimes are not as horrific as financial losses"" to back tougher sanctions. He added that ""Russian oil cannot feed the Russian military machine"", with Ukraine's foreign minister arguing on Twitter that an embargo on gas and oil was needed to truly impact Russia's ability to finance the war.

"This video can not be played Why the divorce law changes matter The most far-reaching change in divorce laws in decades has come into force - ending the need for separating couples to blame one of themselves. The launch of no-fault divorces for England and Wales comes after years of campaigning by family lawyers. They argue the removal of blame from divorce will help more people rebuild their lives and protect children. A form of no-fault divorce exists in Scotland - but blame rules will remain in force in Northern Ireland. Under the old rules in England and Wales, anyone who wanted to split swiftly had to accuse their partner in a divorce petition of desertion, adultery or unreasonable behaviour. If not, they had to spend two years apart if both partners agreed, or five, if one of the couple objected to the split. Most family law experts have long said the system exacerbated problems for a separating couple - making it harder for them to agree over finances, assets and the future of their children. It also trapped people in loveless and sometimes abusive marriages as the dissenting partner controlled the one who wanted to leave. One partner, or both acting together, can file for divorce, without having to give a reason or apportion blame. A statement that their marriage is over will, in most cases, be all the proof the court needs. There is a 20-week period between starting proceedings and applying for a conditional order, and a further six-week period before divorce is granted. The same no-fault rule applies to the dissolution of civil partnerships. Judges will still step in to resolve disputes over children, maintenance or the just division of wealth. But those cases aside, legal experts say that the reforms will help a huge number of the 100,000 couples who divorce every year - people like Olivia Jack from north London. Olivia Jack: Didn't want blame to harm children When Ms Jack concluded in 2018 her marriage was over, she was shocked when a divorce lawyer explained she would have to blame her husband if she wanted out quickly. ""I felt very uncomfortable right from the beginning,"" she says. ""Someone had to be the bad guy. So, once I found out about the need to apportion blame, that put the brakes on. ""It felt that it was not going to be useful to the divorce process, especially when young children were involved."" The couple decided to wait out the two years - and they used the time to work with a divorce coach to agree how best to look after their children and divide their assets. At the end of the two-year period, they legally parted - the closest they could come to a quick no-fault divorce. Olivia says she and her ex-husband would have used the new law had it been available, because they wanted to part without becoming enemies for life. And it's a view shared by the divorce law profession. Divorce lawyer Karen Dovaston: Lawyers have lobbied for the change for years Karen Dovaston of the Law Society's family law committee has lobbied for years for no-fault divorces. ""This new law will be more humane,"" she says. ""It also recognises the dignity of people wanting to be divorced, and it gives them some autonomy. ""I'm hoping that that sets the tone and the culture and it will roll over into resolving financial and children matters - that's where you really want to have a civilised settlement and a resolution."" 103,592 couples divorced in England and Wales in 2020 Approximately a third of marriages end in divorce, based on all unions between 1964 and 2019 Divorce rates have been declining for 10 years Kate Daly set up Amicable, the divorce service Olivia and her ex used, after her own expensive and acrimonious experience of the law. ""When a divorcing couple are being wrenched apart emotionally and financially, their most precious commodity is co-operation,"" she says. ""The last thing they want or need is to drip-feed the poison of blame into the divorce process. Blame inflames bitterness and recrimination."" Other countries with no-fault divorce laws: Sweden (Since 1973) Australia (1975) Germany (1976) Canada (1986) Spain (2005) Malta (2011) Over 30 years, the proposals were repeatedly considered by governments - and in 2018 the Supreme Court asked Parliament to reconsider the law. It said it had been forced to block Tini Owens, a woman from Worcestershire, from splitting from her husband because of legal questions over proving who was at fault. That led to a new Divorce Act in 2020 - but ministers delayed its implementation to allow testing of a new digital portal to make splitting less painful still. Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said the government had responded to the need for change. ""We're taking the blame game out of divorce,"" said Mr Raab. ""This is a compassionate, also common-sense measure to bring divorce into the 21st Century. ""The 20-week cooling off period is much shorter than if you have to prove fault - so in terms of the length and the anguish and the delays, this is a big step forward."" Olivia Jack is among those who says that the new system will be worth it. She and her ex have a good working relationship - taking decisions about their children - and sharing the family dog and a car. She hopes the new law will help many more couples find peace because, as she says, in many cases, there's no blame - just a need to move on.

"Diners in England will see calories on menus when they eat out from today. Restaurants, cafes and takeaways with more than 250 staff must print how many calories are in meals on their menus, websites, and on delivery platforms. The new rule is part of government plans to tackle obesity by helping people to make healthier choices. Some restaurants fear it will increase their costs, while an eating disorder charity says it could contribute to harmful thoughts and behaviours. Under the new rules, large food and drink businesses in England with 250 or more employees must display the calorie information of non-prepacked food and soft drinks. Some High Street chains already publish information about the calorie content of their food on their menus,such as Wetherspoons pubs and The Real Greek restaurants.McDonald's has been doing it for more than a decade. Mark Selby, co-founder of Mexican-style street food restaurant Wahaca, told the BBC the chain was ""completely up for being clear and transparent"" to customers on food and drink information. But he said the focus on counting calories was a problem. ""It tells part of the story but I think it slightly misses out some quite important fundamentals around food - be it nutrition, fibre, all those things - which potentially we feel might be more relevant or certainly need to be considered,"" he said. Mark Selby said he doesn't think calories on menus will ""sway the dial"" at his restaurants Mr Selby said he believed people visited Wahaca as ""a treat"" and wouldn't look at the menu from a calorie point of view. He also said creating a system to ensure chefs were accurately using the right amounts of the 250 ingredients they use across the restaurants every day had ""obviously had an impact"" on the business and increased costs. The company said it used the change to also add the carbon footprint of meals to measure the climate impact of each dish. Masterchef winner Sven-Hanson Britttweeted,externalthe change was a ""terrible thing to happen to the hospitality industry"". He warned the regulation ""could end creativity, spontaneity and lead to boring tick-box cooking"". ""Kids will grow up in restaurants, hotels and cafes only looking at that little number below a dish. Choices will be made based on a number alone. The love of flavour, ingredients, history, cooking craft or nutrition will be lost and masked by a newly perceived focus,"" he said. Kate Nicholls, boss of the industry group UK Hospitality, said the new rules came at the ""worst possible time for thousands of businesses struggling to survive"". ""We've long called for a delay to the implementation of calorie labelling, and we'd like to see a grace period post-April to allow businesses breathing space in which to implement the new rules without the risk of unnecessary enforcement action from day one,"" she said. ""It's completely unfair to expect businesses devastated by Covid to all of a sudden introduce complicated and costly new labelling when they've much more pressing matters to attend to - recouping their losses of the past 24-months for a start."" For Charlotte Roberts, from Macclesfield, the change won't make any difference to her food choices. ""I come to the restaurant because I go there knowing what I want to eat,"" the 19-year-old said. ""I go there knowing that it's going to be a big meal. I just eat what I want to eat."" James Howlett, from London, said the change wouldn't affect his menu choices. The 18-year-old said: ""I didn't notice that they didn't have it down anyway. ""It's whatever I feel like on the day. If I want a pizza I'll take a pizza, if I want a burger I'll take a burger."" However, Patrick Callaghan, 57, from Monmouth, said the move would make a difference to which dish he picked. ""I think people care what they eat and particularly after the lockdown, people are conscious of being more active and taking an interest in the calories that they take into the body,"" he told the BBC. Kate Callaghan, 56, agreed, adding people should ""accept our own responsibility for what we eat"". Making calories on menus mandatory can contribute to harmful eating disorder thoughts and behaviours worsening, according to Beat, the UK's eating disorder charity. Tom Quinn, the charity's director of external affairs, said there was evidence that calorie information causes anxiety and distress for people affected by eating disorders. ""It can increase a fixation on restricting calories for those with anorexia or bulimia, or increase feelings of guilt for those with binge eating disorder,"" he said. ""There is also very limited evidence that the legislation will lead to changed eating habits among the general population."" Beat told the BBC 1.25 million people in the UK have an eating disorder and said it had ""continually asked"" the government to consider the impact on people affected by eating disorders and to consult ""eating disorder clinicians and experts by experience at every stage of the process"". The Department of Health and Social Care said obesity was one of the biggest health issues the country faced and that food labelling played an important role in helping people make healthier choices. A spokeswoman added people were used to seeing nutritional information on products sold in supermarkets. The government said its policy has been informed by research and it had consulted ""extensively"" with mental health charities and experts.

"Twitter has confirmed that it is working on an edit button that would allow users to change tweets after they have been posted. It comes after new board member, Tesla boss Elon Musk, asked his followers in a Twitter poll whether they wanted the feature. Many users have long called for an edit button but there are concerns about how to execute it. Twitter said it would start testing the idea in the coming months. The social media firm's communications team tweeted: ""Now that everyone is askingâ¦ yes, we've been working on an edit feature since last year! ""No, we didn't get the idea from a poll ð,"" it added. ""We're kicking off testing within @TwitterBlue Labs in the coming months to learn what works, what doesn't, and what's possible.""

Elon Musk started a poll on Monday after disclosing that he owned a 9.2% stake in Twitter, which made him the firm's biggest shareholder. On Tuesday it was announced that he had been appointed to Twitter's board. The poll has already attracted over four million votes. Twitter initially said it was exploring an edit button on 1 April but it was widely interpreted as an April Fool's joke. Twitter says it was already working on an edit button before Elon Musk was appointed to its board. But it does certainly look like the Tesla boss has moved the process along. Twitter polls are notoriously unscientific - yet Mr Musk appears to make real-life decisions based on their results. In November last year, he asked his 80 million followers whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock. The poll concluded he should, and he did. Mr Musk's poll on whether there should be an edit button on Twitter is being taken seriously by the chief executive of Twitter. ""The consequences of this poll will be important. Please vote carefully,"" Parag Agrawal said. It certainly suggests that Twitter will now look to change its policy in this area as a consequence of the poll result.

"The government's reversal of the 1.25p in the pound rise in National Insurance (NI) has come into effect. It means many people will keep more of their pay. NI went up by 1.25p in the pound in April and went back to its previous level on 6 November. For employees under pension age who earn less than Â£12,570 a year, the move will make no difference - because they don't pay NI. Above that income level, the amount saved increases as earnings do. So higher earners stand to benefit more than people on lower incomes - although higher earners will still contribute more tax overall. The majority of businesses will also see a reduction in their NI bills. Each business will save an average of Â£9,600 each in 2023-24,according to the government,external. National Insurance rise to be reversed in November NI is a tax paid by employees, employers and the self-employed: employees pay NI on their wages as well as income tax employers pay extra NI contributions for staff the self-employed pay NI on their profits NI contributes to the cost of benefits and the state pension. However, the government can borrow from the NI fund to help pay for other projects. NI raises a lot of money: Â£158bn last yearaccording to HMRC,external. Whether you receive the full state pensiondepends on your NI record,external. Why do we pay National Insurance? Since 6 April, workers and employers have been paying an extra 1.25p in the pound. The increase was part of the government's plan to fund the NHS and social care. It took the rate of NI to 13.25%. That meant the government went back on its 2019 election manifesto promise not to raise the tax. The NI increase was due to be replaced by a new Health and Social Care Levy - at a rate of 1.25% - in April 2023. But the government has now scrapped these plans, putting the NI rate back to 12%. That rate is paid by employees earning between Â£12,570 a year and just over Â£50,000 a year. Above that level, the rate has gone back down from 3.25% to 2.0%. The 1.25 percentage point increase in NI was supposed to raise Â£12bn a year. The government said the extra money would initially go towards easing pressure on the NHS. Some would then be moved into the social care system. This mainly helps older people and people with high care needs, with tasks such as washing, dressing, eating and taking medication. The government has said that funding for health and social care services will be maintained at the same level as if the levy was in place. The funding for health and social care will now come from general taxation. A proportion of the NI increase was supposed to fund the social care system. The social care system is under pressure because of an ageing population and the effects of the pandemic. At the same time, it has also been hit by staff shortages and falling government spending. The government wants to ensure that people in England pay no more than Â£86,000 in care costs from October 2023 (not including accommodation and food). People with assets - such as a home, savings or investments - worth less than Â£20,000 will not have to pay for care out of those assets, but may still have to contribute from their income. Those with assets worth between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 may have their care costs subsidised. What could care changes cost you and your family? Social care: Nine challenges facing the system NI is a UK-wide tax. Although the government decided to increase it in order to fund health and social care in England, the tax increase was also expected to raise extra money that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland could have chosen to spend on those services.

"EU officials say sanctions on Russian imports of coal and oil are definitely being considered The EU is proposing further sanctions against the Kremlin after allegations of Russian war crimes in Ukraine, with EU ambassadors meeting on Wednesday to decide what steps to take. European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said planned measures included an import ban on coal and a ban on Russian ships and road operators. The US is also planning more sanctions. And UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is calling for a ""tough new wave"" of sanctions from G7 and Nato ministers. She said her Japanese counterpart had agreed the international community had to increase pressure on Russia's Vladimir Putin ""and his war machine with further co-ordinated sanctions"". EU officials had earlier indicated the focus would be on enforcing existing measures. But revelations of atrocities, with hundreds of bodies of civilians found in towns abandoned by Russian troops, have given added impetus for new measures. ""The new sanctions will probably be adopted tomorrow,"" French European Affairs Minister ClÃ©ment Beaune said on Tuesday. Ms von der Leyen said the proposals included: A ban on coal imports worth â¬4bn a year, and a full ban on four Russian banks including Russia's second biggest bank VTB A ban on Russian ships entering EU ports (with some exemptions) and on Russian and Belarusian road transport operators Bans on EU exports in advanced semiconductors and machinery worth â¬10bn and other EU imports on wood and cement, seafood and alcohol. Russian companies would also be barred from taking part in competing for contracts across the EU. The EU was also working on other sanctions including on imports of Russian oil, she said. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? This is the fifth set of EU sanctions so far. Earlier measures have ranged from individuals including Vladimir Putin and hundreds of Russian MPs, to the financial and energy sectors. The 27 member states plan to cut use of Russian gas by two-thirds by the end of this year and then make Europe entirely independent of Russian fossil fuels by 2030. There is an active debate in Germany on imposing a total embargo on Russian energy, but the government warns it would trigger a recession and mass unemployment and for the moment it has ruled it out. ""If it would stop the war, then we would do it immediately,"" said Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock. At the start of the war Germany was quick to halt the big Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia before it went online Germany relied on Russian gas for 55% of its imports last year, while for the EU as a whole it was 40%. Experts widely agree that sanctions agreed by the West until now are unprecedented but Eddie Fishman rates them at ""seven or an eight of 10 in intensity"". He was a lead official in the US State Department in 2014 when sanctions were drawn up in response to Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014. ""Oil remains the life-blood of Russia's economy,"" he argues. ""Putin has made billions of dollars since the war began and Russia's oil sales remain very strong."" The EU's latest proposals tighten sanctions on four Russian banks. Although major Russian banks have been shut out of the Swift financial messaging system, two of the biggest are not. Again, it's energy-related. Sberbank and Gazprombank facilitate energy payments from Europe to Russia. Lithuania announced that from the start of this month it had put a stop to all Russian gas imports. ""Look friends, you can do the same,"" President Gitanis Nauseda told his EU counterparts. It had become possible through investment in liquified natural gas and electricity link infrastructure, he explained. But could the EU, as a whole, really turn off the taps to Russian energy? There have been warnings of factory closures, jobs losses and plummeting public consent for sanctions. You would have to pray for warm and windy weather, says Jacob Kirkegaard of the German Marshall Fund. Warm to lessen the need for heating homes - and windy to power Europe's electricity generating turbines. And while Mr Kirkegaard agrees with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz that a ban could trigger a recession, he believes the blow to Russia would be worse. ""The Russian government would, in my opinion, be compelled to start printing large amounts of new roubles with the risk of inciting significant additional inflation in Russia."" Beyond energy, sanctions so far have hit Russia's tech, aviation and finance sectors, as well as its oligarchs - the wealthy Russians who made their fortunes under President Putin's patronage. But, as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky reminded Belgian lawmakers in an address last week, there are other awkward areas where business goes on. Rough diamonds are still moving from Russia to Antwerp and sea ports remain open to Russian shipping. So while trade ties between the EU and Russia have been seriously frayed, strained but lucrative connections remain. LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine FACT CHECKING:Fact-checking Russian claims about Bucha killings WAR CRIMES:Could Putin be prosecuted? WATCH:Ambulance crew on the front line READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external An energy embargo remains the ""ultimate"" economic severance weapon, and Germany is usually cited as the main obstacle to that. But other countries are accused of hiding behind Chancellor Olaf Scholz's frank assessments. ""Germany is really afraid of what might happen to its economy,"" says Prof Karen Pittel, a director at the Ifo Institute for Economic Research in Munich. ""But in principle, if it happens tomorrow, then we'll survive it."" She also believes that the outlook has shifted after President Putin began demanding payment for gas in roubles. Germany refused but Prof Pittel says it's possible there may come a time when Germany has no other choice than to abandon Russian energy. It still seems extremely unlikely that Europe will be cut off from Russian supplies in one, big dramatic move, but pressure is mounting. ""Clear and determined sanctions are necessary. These sanctions are not working,"" Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said this week. Until recently, the idea of an energy embargo would not have just seemed unlikely. It would have been unthinkable.

"John Lansdown is seeking damages of Â£76m and wants to set up a trust to protect seafarers' rights A former P&O Ferries chef is suing the company and its chief executive, claiming unfair dismissal, racial discrimination and harassment. John Lansdown is the only seafarer to take legal action after 800 staff were sacked without notice last month. In his tribunal claim he accuses P&O of treating him unfavourably as he is British and eligible for minimum wage. P&O Ferries said job cuts were ""categorically not based on race or the nationality of the staff involved"". The company ""needed fundamental change to make it viable - we knew this decision was the only way to save the business"", P&O said in a statement. Mr Lansdown is seeking financial compensation as well as exemplary damages of up to Â£76m to ""deter"" P&O Ferries or its parent company DP World from acting the same way in future. He would use the money to create a new trust to campaign for improved wages and terms and conditions for seafarers and to outlaw ""fire and hire"" practices in the industry and more widely in the UK, according to his claim. Mr Lansdown, 39, told the BBC he wanted to get ""justice"" for all his former colleagues who felt they had ""no choice"" but to settle their cases. ""This is not just about me,"" he said. ""799 of my seafaring family have lost their livelihoods, their way of life, their homes for half the year and it's about the bigger picture."" P&O confirmed to the BBC that ""all but one"" employee had accepted a settlement and therefore forfeited their right to any legal action as a result. John next to the Old Pride of Kent, the first ship he joined aged 16 Mr Lansdown said he joined P&O Ferries as a 16-year-old trainee and was working as a sous chef on The Pride of Canterbury when he was sacked three weeks ago. He was working on the ship and had to leave his belongings behind when he was notified ""out of the blue, and without any prior consultation"" about his instant dismissal, he said. In his legal papers, seen by the BBC, he claimed private security staff, carrying handcuffs and wearing balaclavas, were hired to remove workers who refused to disembark ferries. ""I was devastated by the brutal summary dismissal after many years of loyal and diligent service,"" his claim states. ""The manner of the dismissal was harassing."" In a statement to the BBC, P&O said: ""No staff involved in the redundancies wore balaclavas nor were they directed to use handcuffs or force. ""Staff remained professional, sympathetic and calm in a challenging situation for everyone, trying to ensure the safety of all the people on board the ships. There was no harassment,"" it said. John and his mum after winning a P&O cake competition Mr Lansdown alleges the redundancy was a ""sham"" and unlawful because there was no fair selection process, no diminished need for his job, and P&O Ferries' parent company, DP World, is very profitable, the document adds. Mr Lansdown's British nationality was also a significant influence on the decision to sack staff and replace them with non-British crew paid below the minimum wage of up to Â£5.50 per hour, it further claims. P&O Ferries boss Peter Hebblethwaite previously admitted to MPs thata decision to sack 800 workers without notice or union consultation had broken the lawbut said he would make the decision again if he had to. At the time, he said of his decision that no union would have accepted the plan and it was easier to compensate workers ""in full"" instead. In his legal claim, Mr Lansdown accused the company of ""violating his dignity and creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating environment"". He told the BBC: ""At the end of the day, it was the essence of Brexit what happened to us. This could give a green light to other companies to do the same."" Mr Lansdown's lawyer, Lawrence Davies of Equal Justice solicitors, said: ""This is the most important battle for British workers' rights post-Brexit; the battle to prevent British jobs being lost on British waters to cheap foreign labour."" He added: ""It is a fight we must win."" P&O Ferries has previously said that all 800 staff made redundant would be offered Â£36.5m in total - with around 40 receiving more than Â£100,000 each. TheInsolvency Service has launched criminal and civil investigationsinto the controversial mass redundancies.

"The UK, US, and Australia will begin co-operating on research into hypersonic weapons and how to defend against them, the government has said. The programme will be part of the AUKUS partnership, a security pact announced by the three countries last year. It follows the development of hypersonic missiles by China and Russia and their purported use by Russia in Ukraine last month. Hypersonic weapons are those that exceed five times the speed of sound. They are harder to defend against because of their speed as well as the fact they fly at low altitudes - beyond the line of sight of ground-based radars - and can manoeuvre mid-flight. The UK does not currently possess hypersonic missiles. The US and Australia have an existing joint programme to develop the weapons but the UK government stressed the focus of the new venture would be on defence. Could Chinaâs hypersonic missile spark a new arms race? GCHQ chief warns China over Russia links It said there were no plans for the UK to develop its own hypersonic weapons but the new programme would help it assess whether it would need to develop them in future. It added the latest announcement was not related to Russia's use of the weapons in Ukraine but said the fact other nations were investing in them meant the UK had to think about how to defend against them. On 19 March,Russia claimed to have used a hypersonic missileto destroy an arms depot in western Ukraine, and US military intelligence has suggested Russian forces have used them repeatedly since. The attacks would mark the first use of hypersonic missiles in combat. It came just months afterChina caught US intelligence by surprisewhen it tested two nuclear-capable hypersonic missiles. Each circled the globe in low-orbit space before coming back down to Earth, the second missing its target by only about 24 miles (40 km). The missile is thought to combine a so-called fractional orbital bombardment system, which sends missiles into a partial orbit of the Earth to strike from an unexpected direction, with a hypersonic glider, which remains in the outer atmosphere and is hard to detect until later into its flight. The tests demonstrated China had far more advanced space capability than had previously been understood. North Korea has also claimed to be in the process of testing hypersonic missiles. Hypersonic missiles are potentially a game-changer in the way future wars will be fought. As their name suggests, they travel at immense speed - Mach 5 or greater, which equates to around a mile a second. They are what is called ""dual capable"" meaning they can carry either a conventional explosive or nuclear warhead. They can also be launched from either air, sea or land. There are two types of these weapon: cruise missiles and glide vehicles. The cruise variant, of which Russia has several, can be launched from an aircraft and hit a target more than 1,200 miles away. The glide variant is launched up into space from where it then glides down to earth on an unpredictable path. Hypersonic missiles are changing the way nations plan for their strategic defence for two reasons. Firstly, they are so fast there would be very little time - just minutes - between a launch being detected and a country's leader having to decide whether to retaliate. There is almost no way of knowing whether that missile is nuclear-tipped or not. Secondly, their flight path, especially that of a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV), is so hard to predict it makes interception extremely difficult. Currently China is in the forefront of hypersonic missile development, closely followed by Russia, which has already used them to hit long distance targets in Ukraine. The US is late to the game and some of its tests have not gone well. Britain does not possess any and is only now forming an alliance with the US and Australia to carry out research into them and how, if possible, to defend against them. The AUKUS partnership, announced in September 2021, is a trilateral security pact for the Indo-Pacific region. The primary purpose of the deal is for the US and UK to help Australia acquire nuclear-powered submarines. The deal also aims to deepen co-operation on cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, and additional undersea capabilities. Following Tuesday's announcement, the UK's national security advisor Stephen Lovegrove said: ""When we bring together the technical knowledge and capabilities of our three countries, we can achieve a huge amount to help keep ourselves and our allies and partners safe. ""In light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it's more important now than ever that allies work together to defend democracy, international law and freedom around the world.""
