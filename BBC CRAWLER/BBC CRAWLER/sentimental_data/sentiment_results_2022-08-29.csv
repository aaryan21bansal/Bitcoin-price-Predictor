"Pubs across the UK will be forced to close due to energy costs soaring by as much as 300%, brewery bosses have said. Leaders of six of the country's largest breweries have called for ""immediate government intervention"" on sky-high energy bills this winter. The landlord of one pub in Essex told the BBC that his energy costs had risen from about Â£13,000 a year to Â£35,000. Pub owners said the energy crisis would cause ""real and serious irreversible"" damage to the industry without support. In an open letter to the government, six pub and brewing groups - JW Lees, Carlsberg Marston's, Admiral Taverns, Drake & Morgan, Greene King and St Austell Brewery - called for urgent intervention, including a support package and a cap on the price of energy for businesses. Rocketing energy bills come at a time when the number of pubs in England and Wales is falling,hitting the lowest level on record - 39,970 in June, according to analysis. Energy bills could break firms, warns ex-chancellor Simon Cleary, who runs the Plough in Great Chesterford, Essex, said his gas and electricity bills had nearly tripled to Â£35,000 a year. It means the pub now needs to generate a further Â£1,800 in takings per week to cover the costs. ""It really is that bad,"" he told the BBC. ""I think it's going to be really tough unless there is intervention from the government."" Landlord Simon Cleary needs to take another Â£1,800 each week to afford the bill hikes Mr Cleary said heating the pub in the winter made up the majority of his gas bill, with about 20% used for cooking food. In a bid to try to reduce his electricity bill, the landlord has fitted LED bulbs. However, there is only so much energy he can save because fridges, freezers and the cooling system for the cellar need to be on all the time. ""You cannot turn your cellar cooling off, you need it on even in the winter."" He added: ""Many pubs are very older buildings, few pubs have got cavity wall insulation. This pub was built in 1780. Back in those days nobody was thinking about conserving energy."" Chris Jowsey, boss of Admiral Taverns which has 1,600 pubs, said his tenanted pubs now pay more in energy bills than they do in rent. He told the BBC that one of his tenants told him he was leaving after 20 years due to his electricity bill going up 450% - an increase so large he couldn't pass it on to pub customers. Mr Jowsey said Admiral was investing in energy-saving equipment for pub cellars and to control how much energy fridges use. He also said the company was ""looking very closely at a scheme to try and buy energy in bulk and to allow licensees to make use of our own scale"". But he said: ""Even when we went to the energy market in recent months, no-one was initially willing to supply even us, never mind an individual licensee and their pub. ""So we're trying to do everything we can,"" said Mr Jowsey. ""But frankly, this is of such a scale that even we can't support this on our own, we desperately need government intervention to help because actually the market is broken."" The Department for Business, Energy and Industry said ""no government"" would be able to control the ""global factors pushing up the price of energy and other business costs"". ""But we will continue to support the hospitality sector in navigating the months ahead,"" a spokesman added. The government said it was providing a ""50% business rates relief for businesses across the UK, freezing alcohol duty rates on beer, cider, wine and spirits and reducing employer national insurance"". Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, warned the rise in energy bills would cause more damage to the industry than the pandemic did if it didn't receive support in the next few weeks. The government has previously said no new policies will be announced until the new prime minister is announced on 5 September. But Mr Jowsey said: ""I find it incredible that we have to wait for one person to get elected before we actually get some decisions and some policy which will protect not just jobs, not just people's livelihoods, but also their homes - because remember most people that run pubs in this country actually live above the shop."" Jonathan Reynolds, Labour's shadow business secretary, said businesses couldn't ""afford another day of this zombie government"", saying his party would bring down costs for small firms by cutting business rates. Nick Mackenzie, the boss of Greene King - one of the UK's largest pub groups with over 3,100 pubs - said the company could face ""the prospect of pubs being unable to pay their bills, jobs being lost and beloved locals across the country forced to close their doors"". He added that would mean all the support given to pubs through the pandemic to stay in businesses ""could be wasted"". Meanwhile, William Lees Jones, of JW Lees, said the government needed to extend the energy cap to business as well as households. He said with more fixed-price contracts coming up for renewal the ""time to act is now"". On Friday, the energy regulator Ofgem, which sets the price cap on household bills, said it would rise by 80% in October. But unlike households, businesses aren't covered by a regulated energy price cap, meaning bills are even higher. Aside from bills, breweries also highlighted a possible shortage of carbon dioxide (CO2) which is used in the production of beer. CF Industries, the UK's largest CO2 producer, recently announced that it would temporarily stop production at one of its plants because rising energy prices made it too expensive to continue.

"Andy Murray extended his US Open first-round record to 15 wins and just one loss US Open 2022 Venue:Flushing Meadows, New YorkDates:29 August-11 September Coverage:Daily radio commentaries across BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, with selected live text commentaries and match reports on the website and app Britain's Andy Murray demonstrated his grit and guile to frustrate Argentine 24th seed Francisco Cerundolo and start the 10th anniversary of his US Open victory with a first-round win. Murray, 35, took a tight first set 7-5 and impressively won the next two 6-3 6-3 as Cerundolo became despondent. He is joined in the next round byJack Draper,who beat Finland's Emil Ruusuvuori 6-4 6-3 6-3. Fellow BritonHarriet Dartadvanced by overcoming 10th seed Daria Kasatkina. The 26-year-old world number 88 claimed her first main-draw win in New York as well as her first victory against a top-10 player as she beat the world number nine 7-6 (10-8) 1-6 6-3. But former British number one Kyle Edmund lost 6-3 7-5 6-2 against Norwegian fifth seed Casper Ruud as he made his Grand Slam singles comeback after a serious knee injury, Emma Raducanu starts her title defence on Tuesday, with seventh seed Cameron Norrie and Dan Evans also playing on day two. Williams starts US Open farewell with a win Defending champion Medvedev wins on US Open return Halep suffers shock loss to Ukrainian Snigur Murray was one of seven British players competing in the US Open singles and was the first through to the second round after opening play on Louis Armstrong Stadium, which is the second show court at Flushing Meadows. Almost four years on from having major hip surgery, the former world number one has struggled to string wins together in a season he recently described as ""OK"" and wanted ""to be better"". Climbing the rankings sufficiently to be seeded for the New York major was the target after Wimbledon, where he lost to 20th seed John Isner in the second round. Inconsistent performances in North America since did not enable him to achieve his goal and, as a result, the world number 51 ended up being drawn against a seeded player at Flushing Meadows. While 24-year-old Cerundolo has largely climbed the rankings this year because of his results on clay, it felt like his forehand could cause problems for Murray on the hard court and many predicted a long slog between the pair. However, that did not play out as Murray, who earned the first of his three major titles in New York ground down his opponent to win his first Grand Slam match in straight sets since Wimbledon in 2017. Murray, who will play 20-year-old American wildcard Emilio Nava next, said: ""It felt like five sets to me, it was tricky conditions, very humid and hot. ""But I'm happy with the way I got through that one. He has had a brilliant year, I knew I had to play well and I did that in the important moments."" When asked if he was using the US Open's new rule permitting off-court coaching, Murray said: ""Sometimes when you are in those conditions, it's quite easy to focus on yourself and how you are feeling. But it's good to sometimes have a look down the other end and see how your opponent is getting on. ""Ivan [Lendl, Murray's coach] was trying to get me to keep moving him around the court, because he felt physically Cerundolo was struggling. I tried to do that certainly at the beginning of the sets and managed to get a good lead because of it."" Murray had never played Cerundolo before their first-round match at Flushing Meadows Murray impressed by keeping the pressure on Cerundolo, who became animated between points towards the end of the first set as his head began to drop. After losing serve in the first game, Murray fought back with four on the bounce and looked increasingly assured in his ball-striking. Things are often complicated with Murray, though. He suddenly became edgy when serving for the set and a poor game put the opener back on serve. There was an unusual incident in the ninth game, with Murray leading 5-4, when Cerundolo initially won a point despite a double bounce before sportingly handing it over to the Scot after replays on the big screens showed what had happened. After sealing victory Murray - who also failed to serve out the second and third sets at the first attempts - thanked Cerundolo for his sportsmanship when they met at the net. ""What he did was brilliant and I don't think that loads of players on the tour would have done that. Fair play to him,"" said Murray, who added he thought there was an argument for video assistant review-style challenges in these instances. Another positive for Murray was there appeared to be no sign of the cramping which he has been hampered by recently, despite the warm weather which would have been even hotter on the sun-soaked court. ""I did well physically and mentally to put that to the back of my mind and find a way to get through. So I was really happy with that,"" he added. On paper Draper appeared to have been handed a tricky opponent in Ruusuvuori, who got the better of him at Queen's in June. However, the 20-year-old left-hander delivered a mature display as he made a confident US Open debut to back up recent victories against Stefanos Tsitsipas and Dominic Thiem against another top-50 ranked player. Draper converted all of the five break points he created and dropped serve just once himself. He will now face Canadian sixth seed Felix Auger-Aliassime in an intriguing second-round contest. Harriet Dart reached the quarter-finals at Nottingham and Eastbourne earlier this summer Dart had earned direct entry into the US Open draw for the first time after making it into the world top 100 this year and she proved herself more than worthy of the place. The Briton reached the second round on her third attempt in New York after a rollercoaster match against the in-form Kasatkina, who won two titles in North America this summer. After a first set featuring 10 breaks of serve, Dart saved two set points as she battled her way to victory in the tie-break. However, her level dropped as Kasatkina's rose to give the Russian a swift second-set win. But, after loudly berating herself for being ""so unfit"" when she failed to reach a ball at 2-0 down in the decider, Dart proved she was anything but as she scrapped to an unlikely victory in two hours and 30 minutes. ""I'm a little bit in shock right now,"" she told Amazon Prime. ""Physically I don't feel great but I really tried to stick at it and push through. I can't believe I got the win. ""What's so exciting about women's tennis is anyone can win."" Dart will play Hungarian Dalma Galfi, ranked three places below her at 91, in the second round. Edmund was playing his first Grand Slam singles match since the 2020 US Open Simply being back playing singles at a major tournament was a result for Edmund aftera hellish two years dealing with a knee injurywhich left him wondering about his future. The 27-year-old Yorkshireman was given an unkind draw in the shape of world number seven Ruud, who reached the French Open final this year and recently enjoyed a run to the Montreal semi-finals on the hard courts. Edmund, using a protected injury ranking to play, said he was keen to see his level against one of the world's best and after some encouraging signs early on, the former world number 14 lost in straight sets. Edmund broke for an early 2-1 lead in the first set and showed glimpses of his quality, particularly with his trademark forehand. But there were also signs of rustiness and eventually tiredness, understandable in only his 10th singles match back after three operations, as Ruud fought back to earn a comfortable win.

Some entrepreneurial residents have opened their homes up - or rather their toilets. It's Â£3 to spend a penny in W11 this weekend - or Â£5 if you wish to jump the queue.

Singer Alexandra Burke joined The Utopia Band wearing breast pumps under their costumes to tackle taboos about breastfeeding and pumping in public The Adults Day parade saw many attendees dressed in colourful, sparkling costumes to match the dancers. Pam Small, 54, from the US travelled to attend the carnival for nine years before the pandemic and was delighted to be back. She said: ""I love everything about it. The people, the culture, the diversity - it's really special to be here."" Walking in the parade was Rolando Ponde, 34, who said the carnival was ""special"" because ""it introduces people to their roots, to their culture"". ""We have our community here in the UK and at carnival we can all come together,"" he said. People attending the carnival said it was a ""special"" event By Harry Low, BBC London Europe's largest street party is alive and well. Crowds cluster around the calypso band as one street away reggae has revellers in raptures. Turn the corner and the rum punch stalls are doing a roaring trade. The smell of smoke fills the air as another jerk chicken thigh is tossed onto the barbecue. A woman dances on her doorstep while her neighbour DJs from her balcony. Some entrepreneurial residents have opened their homes up - or rather their toilets. It's Â£3 to spend a penny in W11 this weekend - or Â£5 if you wish to jump the queue. And not everyone is enjoying the festivities. I spoke to one supermarket delivery driver who described it as ""horrendous"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Overflowing bins are seen on nearly every street, including along the busy Grassmarket Unions have confirmed they will continue strike action after turning down a new pay offer from councils. Unite and the GMB both rejected the Cosla offer while Unison, Scotland's largest council union, said it would put it to members. Rubbish has been building up in many town and city centres after several days of bin strikes. The dispute led to action in two-thirds of Scotland's councils and is set to close schools and nurseries next week. Cosla said it was ""disappointed"" with the response from unions. Unions had been seeking an agreement from the local government body similar to the one made to council workers in England - which included a Â£1,925 flat rate pay increase. They said that offering a percentage pay rise would mean the most money would go to the best paid staff. Public health warning as bin strikes continue Is there a bin strike in my area? The people hiring skips and using baths to store rubbish The current round of strikes is due to end on Wednesday in many local authority areas, and at 04:59 in Edinburgh. The first bin strike began in the capital city on 18 August, in the midst of festival season, after the GMB, Unite and Unison rejected aninitial pay offer equivalent to a 3.5% increase. Edinburgh's strike is due to end on Tuesday morning but more action is planned next week It escalated last week when refuse workers at a further 20 local authorities, including Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, walked out despite a revised 5% offer. A second wave of strikes, which will include school workers, is due to begin in a bid to ""achieve a significantly improved pay offer"". Hundreds of schools and nurseries are scheduled to close from 6 to 8 September. Cosla's offer of a Â£1,925 pay uplift matched an offer to council workers south of the border, but only part of this payment was consolidated into council workers' ongoing pay. The rest would be given as one-off cost of living payments. Those earning less than Â£20,500 - about 20% of council staff in Scotland - would receive a pro-rata gross pay increase in 2022 equal to Â£2,000. All staff would also get an extra day of leave. Unite criticised the negotiations as a ""waste of precious time"" because new offer disproportionately hits the lowest paid. The union's industrial officer Wendy Dunsmore said: ""In real terms it leaves the lowest paid workers no better-off and a significant proportion of the offer does not enhance overtime, allowances or pensions."" Mark Ferguson, chair of Unison's local government committee, said strike action was the ""last resort"". ""Half of council workers earn less than Â£25,000 per year and 85% earn less than Â£39,000 per year - they are all worrying about paying their bills,"" he said. GMB Scotland senior organiser Keir Greenaway said they had written to Cosla urging them to return to talks as soon as possible. He said: ""It's not credible that in the grip of the biggest cost of living crisis in forty years, a head of service gets four times the consolidated increase than a bin collector, cleaner or carer."" BBC reporter Angie Brown says residents are dodging massive middens in the streets By Angie Brown, BBC Scotland Edinburgh reporter The noxious ooze now covering Edinburgh's city centre streets from leaking bins full of rotting mountains of rubbish is quite startling. Not only is it now quite hard to dodge these massive middens, as the Scots call them, but it is almost impossible to avoid walking through the rivulets of slime washing over our pavements in Auld Reekie. I tasted the nastiness of this when I mistakenly touched my bike wheel and caught a whiff of the worst smell on my hands that I had ever encountered. In the first few days of the strike, litter was swirling around in our narrow cobbled streets in the Old Town and I remember being quite horrified when the inside of a brown-smeared vegetarian haggis packet slapped me in the face. Now all that rubbish is stuck to the ground - trampled and glued to the pavements by I don't know what - causing a layer of detritus you might expect from the days, hundreds of years ago, when Edinburgh folk threw their rubbish out of their tenement windows shouting ""gardyloo"". Cosla said its offer was at the ""absolute extremes"" of affordability. Resources spokesperson Katie Hagmann said: ""This is already an offer which is stretching our already stretched finance like never before. ""We have done everything we possibly can to get to this stage and that this offer - which is still on the table - is as good as it gets."" The Scottish government has given an additional Â£140m to councils to help fund a pay increase for staff and had urged both sides to seek a ""fair resolution"" to the dispute. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said it was offering a further Â£200m over two years to provide a cost of living payment to workers earning below Â£39,000. He said this additional payment would mean workers on a Â£20,000 salary would receive a Â£2,000 increase pay - equivalent to 10%. Mr Swinney said: ""Intensive discussions between the trades unions and COSLA over recent days has led to a revised pay offer being made. ""No deal is perfect and I wish we could go further but this deal does offer significant increases for those on low pay. ""We must now respect the democratic trade union processes under way while we hope that members decide to accept the offer.""

The 140,000 households which have kerbside pickups in the city have landfill waste and dry recycling waste collected on alternate weeks. The city council confirmed only one type of rubbish would be picked up per household. However, additional resources will be deployed to support the clean up when the strike ends in the capital on Tuesday. Council leader Cammy Day said: ""This dispute has brought the value of our waste and cleansing teams - and their right to fair wage - into sharp focus and I'm delighted they'll be back out from Tuesday, helping to return our city to its best."" He asked residents to store their waste ""little longer"" while refuse workers catch up with the backlog.

"Andy Murray extended his US Open first-round record to 15 wins and just one loss US Open 2022 Venue:Flushing Meadows, New YorkDates:29 August-11 September Coverage:Daily radio commentaries across BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, with selected live text commentaries and match reports on the website and app Britain's Andy Murray demonstrated his grit and guile to frustrate Argentine 24th seed Francisco Cerundolo and start the 10th anniversary of his US Open victory with a first-round win. Murray, 35, took a tight first set 7-5 and impressively won the next two 6-3 6-3 as Cerundolo became despondent. He is joined in the next round byJack Draper,who beat Finland's Emil Ruusuvuori 6-4 6-3 6-3. Fellow BritonHarriet Dartadvanced by overcoming 10th seed Daria Kasatkina. The 26-year-old world number 88 claimed her first main-draw win in New York as well as her first victory against a top-10 player as she beat the world number nine 7-6 (10-8) 1-6 6-3. But former British number one Kyle Edmund lost 6-3 7-5 6-2 against Norwegian fifth seed Casper Ruud as he made his Grand Slam singles comeback after a serious knee injury, Emma Raducanu starts her title defence on Tuesday, with seventh seed Cameron Norrie and Dan Evans also playing on day two. Williams starts US Open farewell with a win Defending champion Medvedev wins on US Open return Halep suffers shock loss to Ukrainian Snigur Murray was one of seven British players competing in the US Open singles and was the first through to the second round after opening play on Louis Armstrong Stadium, which is the second show court at Flushing Meadows. Almost four years on from having major hip surgery, the former world number one has struggled to string wins together in a season he recently described as ""OK"" and wanted ""to be better"". Climbing the rankings sufficiently to be seeded for the New York major was the target after Wimbledon, where he lost to 20th seed John Isner in the second round. Inconsistent performances in North America since did not enable him to achieve his goal and, as a result, the world number 51 ended up being drawn against a seeded player at Flushing Meadows. While 24-year-old Cerundolo has largely climbed the rankings this year because of his results on clay, it felt like his forehand could cause problems for Murray on the hard court and many predicted a long slog between the pair. However, that did not play out as Murray, who earned the first of his three major titles in New York ground down his opponent to win his first Grand Slam match in straight sets since Wimbledon in 2017. Murray, who will play 20-year-old American wildcard Emilio Nava next, said: ""It felt like five sets to me, it was tricky conditions, very humid and hot. ""But I'm happy with the way I got through that one. He has had a brilliant year, I knew I had to play well and I did that in the important moments."" When asked if he was using the US Open's new rule permitting off-court coaching, Murray said: ""Sometimes when you are in those conditions, it's quite easy to focus on yourself and how you are feeling. But it's good to sometimes have a look down the other end and see how your opponent is getting on. ""Ivan [Lendl, Murray's coach] was trying to get me to keep moving him around the court, because he felt physically Cerundolo was struggling. I tried to do that certainly at the beginning of the sets and managed to get a good lead because of it."" Murray had never played Cerundolo before their first-round match at Flushing Meadows Murray impressed by keeping the pressure on Cerundolo, who became animated between points towards the end of the first set as his head began to drop. After losing serve in the first game, Murray fought back with four on the bounce and looked increasingly assured in his ball-striking. Things are often complicated with Murray, though. He suddenly became edgy when serving for the set and a poor game put the opener back on serve. There was an unusual incident in the ninth game, with Murray leading 5-4, when Cerundolo initially won a point despite a double bounce before sportingly handing it over to the Scot after replays on the big screens showed what had happened. After sealing victory Murray - who also failed to serve out the second and third sets at the first attempts - thanked Cerundolo for his sportsmanship when they met at the net. ""What he did was brilliant and I don't think that loads of players on the tour would have done that. Fair play to him,"" said Murray, who added he thought there was an argument for video assistant review-style challenges in these instances. Another positive for Murray was there appeared to be no sign of the cramping which he has been hampered by recently, despite the warm weather which would have been even hotter on the sun-soaked court. ""I did well physically and mentally to put that to the back of my mind and find a way to get through. So I was really happy with that,"" he added. On paper Draper appeared to have been handed a tricky opponent in Ruusuvuori, who got the better of him at Queen's in June. However, the 20-year-old left-hander delivered a mature display as he made a confident US Open debut to back up recent victories against Stefanos Tsitsipas and Dominic Thiem against another top-50 ranked player. Draper converted all of the five break points he created and dropped serve just once himself. He will now face Canadian sixth seed Felix Auger-Aliassime in an intriguing second-round contest. Harriet Dart reached the quarter-finals at Nottingham and Eastbourne earlier this summer Dart had earned direct entry into the US Open draw for the first time after making it into the world top 100 this year and she proved herself more than worthy of the place. The Briton reached the second round on her third attempt in New York after a rollercoaster match against the in-form Kasatkina, who won two titles in North America this summer. After a first set featuring 10 breaks of serve, Dart saved two set points as she battled her way to victory in the tie-break. However, her level dropped as Kasatkina's rose to give the Russian a swift second-set win. But, after loudly berating herself for being ""so unfit"" when she failed to reach a ball at 2-0 down in the decider, Dart proved she was anything but as she scrapped to an unlikely victory in two hours and 30 minutes. ""I'm a little bit in shock right now,"" she told Amazon Prime. ""Physically I don't feel great but I really tried to stick at it and push through. I can't believe I got the win. ""What's so exciting about women's tennis is anyone can win."" Dart will play Hungarian Dalma Galfi, ranked three places below her at 91, in the second round. Edmund was playing his first Grand Slam singles match since the 2020 US Open Simply being back playing singles at a major tournament was a result for Edmund aftera hellish two years dealing with a knee injurywhich left him wondering about his future. The 27-year-old Yorkshireman was given an unkind draw in the shape of world number seven Ruud, who reached the French Open final this year and recently enjoyed a run to the Montreal semi-finals on the hard courts. Edmund, using a protected injury ranking to play, said he was keen to see his level against one of the world's best and after some encouraging signs early on, the former world number 14 lost in straight sets. Edmund broke for an early 2-1 lead in the first set and showed glimpses of his quality, particularly with his trademark forehand. But there were also signs of rustiness and eventually tiredness, understandable in only his 10th singles match back after three operations, as Ruud fought back to earn a comfortable win.

"Ticket sales for Edinburgh Fringe shows slumped by a quarter at some venues compared with 2019. Major venues have warned that spiralling accommodation costs in the city are putting the event's future at risk. In 2019, before the pandemic, eight major venues at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe sold 1,965,961 tickets. But projected ticket sales fell by almost 25% in its first full year back to just 1,486,746. A spokesman for EdFest.com - which is made up of the venues Assembly, Dance Base, Gilded Balloon, Just the Tonic, Pleasance, Summerhall, Underbelly and Zoo - said the fall in sales was a ""major threat for everyone involved in the festival"", and put the blame in part on train strikes, the climbing cost of living and the lingering effects of Covid. Read more stories from Edinburgh, Fife and East Scotland,external The latest headlines from Scotland,external ""Chief among these however is the soaring cost of accommodation in Edinburgh in August - audiences and artists alike are being priced out of town, out of experiences,"" the spokesman warned. ""It is clear to anyone spending time in Edinburgh that there are fewer people in the city this year than in 2019. ""While there are certainly other factors that have affected audience numbers this year, the cost of accommodation is a perennial problem across the board."" On Monday afternoon, the Edinburgh Festival Fringe said an estimated 2,201,175 tickets had been issued this year in total. This was across 3,334 shows which were performed by artists from 63 countries. Fringe Society CEO Shona McCarthy said the figures were nothing short of a miracle, but that much had to be done to make the event the best version of itself, rather than the biggest. She added: ""We recognise the significant amount of work that is still required to support the long-term sustainability of this phenomenal festival. ""The eyes of the world look to this historic city every August, and we need to work together to ensure the Fringe is the best place for creatives to express their ideas, audiences to support them and for people across the sector to develop their skills and careers for the next 75 years."" It is not unusual over the Fringe to see desperate pleas on community Facebook groups of people asking to use a spare room because other options are too expensive, and there have been reports of hotels almost doubling their prices per night for during the festival. Big names including Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Friends star David Schwimmer, comedian Eddie Izzard, and Dame Emma Thompson have seen the Fringe advance their careers. The Fringe performers camping to save money Australian comic wins Edinburgh comedy award 'One person turned up to watch my Fringe show' But EdFest.com said that while suitable housing was not just an August problem ""it's imperative that local and national government, landlords, the universities, Fringe venues and the Fringe Society all come together to find a lasting solution for this issue, or the future of the Fringe is in very real danger"". ""Long term we also have to find solutions that allow the festival to be affordable to performers and the audience,"" an EdFest.com spokesman said. ""Given the extent of the reduction in sales, the overall festival has a major job to do in restoring the event to normality, which may take several years and require some public support. ""We need to stabilise the current situation where many people have made significant losses; to address the accommodation issue; to find ways of supporting work; and a major marketing campaign to get the audience back to the festival."" Benny Higgins, chairman of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society, said: ""The importance of this festival cannot be underestimated. Artists use the Fringe as a place to perform, connect and springboard onto their next career opportunity. ""Recovery takes time, and that is why in June we launched our future development goals. The Society acts to offer anyone a stage and everyone a seat, and there is much to do in the coming months. Eighty per cent was the figure we were quoted for the estimated return of visitors - performers and audiences alike. So the 25% downturn anticipated by many Fringe venues was to be expected. Fewer visitors, buying fewer tickets at the fringe. But with all six summer festivals returning for the first time since 2019, it was a chance to spread interest across the whole city. Not everyone comes to Edinburgh for the Fringe. Some don't come for the festivals at all, and simply pass around the edges (perhaps wondering if the overflowing bins are in fact an artistic intervention by the art festival). For all those here this summer, it's been (bins aside) a much more pleasant city to be in. The pressures of 2019 on public transport, and the city's infrastructure, reduced enough to make it that little bit easier to get around. The numbers at the Fringe may have dipped but other festivals - that planned for smaller audiences and a slower recovery - look likely to have done better. The Edinburgh International Festival - which has kept close tabs on its audiences over the last two years - found people booking later and booking fewer shows. The Edinburgh International Book Festival - which has also been keeping its audiences connected online - reduced its programme. The result, a slow and steady return to form. The mistake is to compare 2022 with 2019. These are very different times, and the challenges of this year will only multiply in the years ahead. The quiet resilience of these festivals - and their importance to the city of Edinburgh - should be celebrated, before everyone moves on to planning for next year's events.

"Andy Murray extended his US Open first-round record to 15 wins and just one loss US Open 2022 Venue:Flushing Meadows, New YorkDates:29 August-11 September Coverage:Daily radio commentaries across BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, with selected live text commentaries and match reports on the website and app Britain's Andy Murray demonstrated his grit and guile to frustrate Argentine 24th seed Francisco Cerundolo and start the 10th anniversary of his US Open victory with a first-round win. Murray, 35, took a tight first set 7-5 and impressively won the next two 6-3 6-3 as Cerundolo became despondent. He is joined in the next round byJack Draper,who beat Finland's Emil Ruusuvuori 6-4 6-3 6-3. Fellow BritonHarriet Dartadvanced by overcoming 10th seed Daria Kasatkina. The 26-year-old world number 88 claimed her first main-draw win in New York as well as her first victory against a top-10 player as she beat the world number nine 7-6 (10-8) 1-6 6-3. But former British number one Kyle Edmund lost 6-3 7-5 6-2 against Norwegian fifth seed Casper Ruud as he made his Grand Slam singles comeback after a serious knee injury, Emma Raducanu starts her title defence on Tuesday, with seventh seed Cameron Norrie and Dan Evans also playing on day two. Williams starts US Open farewell with a win Defending champion Medvedev wins on US Open return Halep suffers shock loss to Ukrainian Snigur Murray was one of seven British players competing in the US Open singles and was the first through to the second round after opening play on Louis Armstrong Stadium, which is the second show court at Flushing Meadows. Almost four years on from having major hip surgery, the former world number one has struggled to string wins together in a season he recently described as ""OK"" and wanted ""to be better"". Climbing the rankings sufficiently to be seeded for the New York major was the target after Wimbledon, where he lost to 20th seed John Isner in the second round. Inconsistent performances in North America since did not enable him to achieve his goal and, as a result, the world number 51 ended up being drawn against a seeded player at Flushing Meadows. While 24-year-old Cerundolo has largely climbed the rankings this year because of his results on clay, it felt like his forehand could cause problems for Murray on the hard court and many predicted a long slog between the pair. However, that did not play out as Murray, who earned the first of his three major titles in New York ground down his opponent to win his first Grand Slam match in straight sets since Wimbledon in 2017. Murray, who will play 20-year-old American wildcard Emilio Nava next, said: ""It felt like five sets to me, it was tricky conditions, very humid and hot. ""But I'm happy with the way I got through that one. He has had a brilliant year, I knew I had to play well and I did that in the important moments."" When asked if he was using the US Open's new rule permitting off-court coaching, Murray said: ""Sometimes when you are in those conditions, it's quite easy to focus on yourself and how you are feeling. But it's good to sometimes have a look down the other end and see how your opponent is getting on. ""Ivan [Lendl, Murray's coach] was trying to get me to keep moving him around the court, because he felt physically Cerundolo was struggling. I tried to do that certainly at the beginning of the sets and managed to get a good lead because of it."" Murray had never played Cerundolo before their first-round match at Flushing Meadows Murray impressed by keeping the pressure on Cerundolo, who became animated between points towards the end of the first set as his head began to drop. After losing serve in the first game, Murray fought back with four on the bounce and looked increasingly assured in his ball-striking. Things are often complicated with Murray, though. He suddenly became edgy when serving for the set and a poor game put the opener back on serve. There was an unusual incident in the ninth game, with Murray leading 5-4, when Cerundolo initially won a point despite a double bounce before sportingly handing it over to the Scot after replays on the big screens showed what had happened. After sealing victory Murray - who also failed to serve out the second and third sets at the first attempts - thanked Cerundolo for his sportsmanship when they met at the net. ""What he did was brilliant and I don't think that loads of players on the tour would have done that. Fair play to him,"" said Murray, who added he thought there was an argument for video assistant review-style challenges in these instances. Another positive for Murray was there appeared to be no sign of the cramping which he has been hampered by recently, despite the warm weather which would have been even hotter on the sun-soaked court. ""I did well physically and mentally to put that to the back of my mind and find a way to get through. So I was really happy with that,"" he added. On paper Draper appeared to have been handed a tricky opponent in Ruusuvuori, who got the better of him at Queen's in June. However, the 20-year-old left-hander delivered a mature display as he made a confident US Open debut to back up recent victories against Stefanos Tsitsipas and Dominic Thiem against another top-50 ranked player. Draper converted all of the five break points he created and dropped serve just once himself. He will now face Canadian sixth seed Felix Auger-Aliassime in an intriguing second-round contest. Harriet Dart reached the quarter-finals at Nottingham and Eastbourne earlier this summer Dart had earned direct entry into the US Open draw for the first time after making it into the world top 100 this year and she proved herself more than worthy of the place. The Briton reached the second round on her third attempt in New York after a rollercoaster match against the in-form Kasatkina, who won two titles in North America this summer. After a first set featuring 10 breaks of serve, Dart saved two set points as she battled her way to victory in the tie-break. However, her level dropped as Kasatkina's rose to give the Russian a swift second-set win. But, after loudly berating herself for being ""so unfit"" when she failed to reach a ball at 2-0 down in the decider, Dart proved she was anything but as she scrapped to an unlikely victory in two hours and 30 minutes. ""I'm a little bit in shock right now,"" she told Amazon Prime. ""Physically I don't feel great but I really tried to stick at it and push through. I can't believe I got the win. ""What's so exciting about women's tennis is anyone can win."" Dart will play Hungarian Dalma Galfi, ranked three places below her at 91, in the second round. Edmund was playing his first Grand Slam singles match since the 2020 US Open Simply being back playing singles at a major tournament was a result for Edmund aftera hellish two years dealing with a knee injurywhich left him wondering about his future. The 27-year-old Yorkshireman was given an unkind draw in the shape of world number seven Ruud, who reached the French Open final this year and recently enjoyed a run to the Montreal semi-finals on the hard courts. Edmund, using a protected injury ranking to play, said he was keen to see his level against one of the world's best and after some encouraging signs early on, the former world number 14 lost in straight sets. Edmund broke for an early 2-1 lead in the first set and showed glimpses of his quality, particularly with his trademark forehand. But there were also signs of rustiness and eventually tiredness, understandable in only his 10th singles match back after three operations, as Ruud fought back to earn a comfortable win.

"Soaring energy bills could be the ""straw that finally breaks the camel's back"" for small businesses, former chancellor Alistair Darling has warned. Mr Darling, who was Labour chancellor during the financial crisis, said ""bold action"" was needed to help the economy. The energy price cap for households will soar by 80% from October. But firms are not covered by the cap and Mr Darling said that after surviving Covid, energy costs risked finishing them off. Mr Darling described the current situation as a ""lethal cocktail"" and said it required ""bold action"" to be taken by the government. Both candidates in the Conservative Party leadership race, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, have come under pressure to outline further support for households and firms following the announcement that energy bills would rise again this Autumn. The new leader - and prime minster to succeed Boris Johnson - will be announced next Monday. What is the energy price cap and what will I actually pay? What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill? Ms Truss has so far confirmed she will cut National Insurance and green levies on bills. Mr Sunak has proposed tax cuts on energy bills as part of a Â£10bn package. It emerged at the weekend that Ms Truss is considering a ""nuclear"" option of cutting VAT by 5% as well as raising the threshold at which people start paying tax. In May, the government announced Â£37bn worth of help for households with the rising cost of living. But Mr Darling told the BBC's Today programme the government needed to announce more support. ""You've got to announce it now,"" he said. ""Frankly the stuff that's been announced so far might have passed muster earlier this year, it simply won't do now, you need something far more substantial."" Alistair Darling was chancellor of the exchequer during the 2008 financial crisis Mr Darling said many firms, ""especially the smaller ones who have been struggling through the whole Covid problems over the last couple of years may find that [the cost of energy] is the straw that finally breaks the camel's back"". He said: ""My fear is if the government doesn't do something, you will not just have hardship for individuals and businesses, but you will find that people's spending goes down. ""And the risk is, at the moment people are saying the chances of us going into recession are 50-50. It could just tip us into recession, which of course would be disastrous for us."" He added: ""One lesson I drew from what happened in 2008 is you've got to do more than people expect, and you've got to it more quickly than people expect, if it's going to work."" A spokesperson for the Treasury said it was ""making the necessary preparations to ensure a new government has options to deliver additional support as quickly as possible, as the chancellor has made clear"". ""And as the prime minister has made clear, no major fiscal decisions will be taken until the new prime minister is in post,"" they added. On Friday, energy regulator Ofgem announced a rise in the energy price cap. It means a typical household will pay Â£3,549 a year for gas and electricity starting in October up from Â£1,971 currently. And some economists have warned that could rise even further. Wholesale gas prices have been rising since last year but have worsened recently because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Kremlin's decision to squeeze energy supplies to Europe. Small businesses across a number of industries have voiced their concerns over rising energy bills. More than 750 restaurant and cafÃ© owners called on the government and Conservative leadership candidates for support through VAT cuts, grants and business rate rebates. In an open letter, the signatories said takeaways were being quoted ""eyewatering bills"" that were ""simply impossible to pay"". ""The government has waited until the last moment to act before, but now cannot be one of those times. ""It must work with the Conservative leadership candidates on a plan to support Britain's smallest restaurants before it's too late,"" said Ibrahim Dogus, chair of the British Takeaway Campaign. Jon Long, who runs five fish and chips shops in Dorset, told the BBC if he had to pay the current market rate for gas and electricity, it would mean the end his business after four generations in his family. He managed to fix his gas and electric rates with his energy provider in 2021 and secured a two-year contract, but many businesses aren't in his position. Jon Long runs five fish and chips shops in Dorset ""What seemed to be extortionate then now seems like an absolute steal,"" he said. The 59-year-old said currently his average bill per shop is about Â£15,000 per year, but based on current wholesale prices, it would cost him up to Â£80,000. ""We are on a war footing here. There has been a lot of talk, a lot of sympathy, they (the government) have been listening but no action,"" he said. ""Businesses coming out of contracts need drastic help, and they need it now or we face losing thousands of previously viable businesses."" The Bank of England recently warned that the UK economy will fall into recession later this year as rising energy costs push up the rate of inflation. It recently raised interest rates by 0.5% - the biggest increase in 27 years - in an attempt to cool rising consumer prices which hit 10.1% in July. Mr Darling said the financial crisis more than a decade ago was different to today's economic climate, but warned the current situation was ""just as threatening to people, [and] to the economy as the financial crisis was back in 2008"". ""It's not just people on low incomes who are going to be affected by this, it's going to be people right up the income chain,"" he said.

"A flooded street on Monday in Nowshera district One-third of Pakistan has been completely submerged by historic flooding, its climate minister says. Devastating flash floods have washed away roads, homes and crops - leaving a trail of deadly havoc across Pakistan. ""It's all one big ocean, there's no dry land to pump the water out,"" Sherry Rehman said, calling it a ""crisis of unimaginable proportions."" At least 1,136 people have died since the monsoon season began in June, according to officials. The summer rain is the heaviest recorded in a decade and is blamed by the government on climate change. ""Literally, one-third of Pakistan is underwater right now, which has exceeded every boundary, every norm we've seen in the past,"" Ms Rehman told AFP news agency. ""We've never seen anything like this,"" the minister added. Of those who are known to have died, 75 were in the past 24 hours alone, officials said on Monday, adding that the death toll is expected to rise. Speaking to the BBC, Pakistan's Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said one-third of those killed are believed to be children. ""We're still coming to grips with the extent of the damage,"" he added. Officials estimate that more than 33 million Pakistanis - one in seven people - have been affected by the historic flooding. Heavy waters in the country's northern Swat Valley have swept away bridges and roads, cutting off entire villages. Thousands of people living in the mountainous area have been ordered to evacuate - but even with the help of helicopters, authorities are still struggling to reach those who are trapped. ""Village after village has been wiped out. Millions of houses have been destroyed,"" Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Sunday after flying over the area in a helicopter. Those who managed to escape have been crowded into one of many makeshift camps across the country. ""Living here is miserable. Our self-respect is at stake,"" flood victim Fazal Malik told AFP from a school that was being used to home some 2,500 evacuees in the north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Provinces like Sindh and Balochistan are the worst affected but mountainous regions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have also been badly hit. IN PICTURES:Floods and fear in Pakistan WATCH:Bed frames used to pull victims over floodwaters ON THE GROUND:Pakistan flood victims throw note pleading for help This year's record monsoon is comparable to the devastating floods of 2010 - the deadliest in Pakistan's history - which left more than 2,000 people dead.

"A flooded street on Monday in Nowshera district One-third of Pakistan has been completely submerged by historic flooding, its climate minister says. Devastating flash floods have washed away roads, homes and crops - leaving a trail of deadly havoc across Pakistan. ""It's all one big ocean, there's no dry land to pump the water out,"" Sherry Rehman said, calling it a ""crisis of unimaginable proportions."" At least 1,136 people have died since the monsoon season began in June, according to officials. The summer rain is the heaviest recorded in a decade and is blamed by the government on climate change. ""Literally, one-third of Pakistan is underwater right now, which has exceeded every boundary, every norm we've seen in the past,"" Ms Rehman told AFP news agency. ""We've never seen anything like this,"" the minister added. Of those who are known to have died, 75 were in the past 24 hours alone, officials said on Monday, adding that the death toll is expected to rise. Speaking to the BBC, Pakistan's Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said one-third of those killed are believed to be children. ""We're still coming to grips with the extent of the damage,"" he added. Officials estimate that more than 33 million Pakistanis - one in seven people - have been affected by the historic flooding. Heavy waters in the country's northern Swat Valley have swept away bridges and roads, cutting off entire villages. Thousands of people living in the mountainous area have been ordered to evacuate - but even with the help of helicopters, authorities are still struggling to reach those who are trapped. ""Village after village has been wiped out. Millions of houses have been destroyed,"" Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Sunday after flying over the area in a helicopter. Those who managed to escape have been crowded into one of many makeshift camps across the country. ""Living here is miserable. Our self-respect is at stake,"" flood victim Fazal Malik told AFP from a school that was being used to home some 2,500 evacuees in the north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Provinces like Sindh and Balochistan are the worst affected but mountainous regions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have also been badly hit.

"This video can not be played Overflowing bins are seen on nearly every street, including along the busy Grassmarket Unions have confirmed they will continue strike action after turning down a new pay offer from councils. Unite and the GMB both rejected the Cosla offer while Unison, Scotland's largest council union, said it would put it to members. Rubbish has been building up in many town and city centres after several days of bin strikes. The dispute led to action in two-thirds of Scotland's councils and is set to close schools and nurseries next week. Cosla said it was ""disappointed"" with the response from unions. Unions had been seeking an agreement from the local government body similar to the one made to council workers in England - which included a Â£1,925 flat rate pay increase. They said that offering a percentage pay rise would mean the most money would go to the best paid staff. Public health warning as bin strikes continue Is there a bin strike in my area? The people hiring skips and using baths to store rubbish The current round of strikes is due to end on Wednesday in many local authority areas, and at 04:59 in Edinburgh. The first bin strike began in the capital city on 18 August, in the midst of festival season, after the GMB, Unite and Unison rejected aninitial pay offer equivalent to a 3.5% increase. Edinburgh's strike is due to end on Tuesday morning but more action is planned next week It escalated last week when refuse workers at a further 20 local authorities, including Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, walked out despite a revised 5% offer. A second wave of strikes, which will include school workers, is due to begin in a bid to ""achieve a significantly improved pay offer"". Hundreds of schools and nurseries are scheduled to close from 6 to 8 September. Cosla's offer of a Â£1,925 pay uplift matched an offer to council workers south of the border, but only part of this payment was consolidated into council workers' ongoing pay. The rest would be given as one-off cost of living payments. Those earning less than Â£20,500 - about 20% of council staff in Scotland - would receive a pro-rata gross pay increase in 2022 equal to Â£2,000. All staff would also get an extra day of leave. Unite criticised the negotiations as a ""waste of precious time"" because new offer disproportionately hits the lowest paid. The union's industrial officer Wendy Dunsmore said: ""In real terms it leaves the lowest paid workers no better-off and a significant proportion of the offer does not enhance overtime, allowances or pensions."" Mark Ferguson, chair of Unison's local government committee, said strike action was the ""last resort"". ""Half of council workers earn less than Â£25,000 per year and 85% earn less than Â£39,000 per year - they are all worrying about paying their bills,"" he said. GMB Scotland senior organiser Keir Greenaway said they had written to Cosla urging them to return to talks as soon as possible. He said: ""It's not credible that in the grip of the biggest cost of living crisis in forty years, a head of service gets four times the consolidated increase than a bin collector, cleaner or carer."" BBC reporter Angie Brown says residents are dodging massive middens in the streets By Angie Brown, BBC Scotland Edinburgh reporter The noxious ooze now covering Edinburgh's city centre streets from leaking bins full of rotting mountains of rubbish is quite startling. Not only is it now quite hard to dodge these massive middens, as the Scots call them, but it is almost impossible to avoid walking through the rivulets of slime washing over our pavements in Auld Reekie. I tasted the nastiness of this when I mistakenly touched my bike wheel and caught a whiff of the worst smell on my hands that I had ever encountered. In the first few days of the strike, litter was swirling around in our narrow cobbled streets in the Old Town and I remember being quite horrified when the inside of a brown-smeared vegetarian haggis packet slapped me in the face. Now all that rubbish is stuck to the ground - trampled and glued to the pavements by I don't know what - causing a layer of detritus you might expect from the days, hundreds of years ago, when Edinburgh folk threw their rubbish out of their tenement windows shouting ""gardyloo"". Cosla said its offer was at the ""absolute extremes"" of affordability. Resources spokesperson Katie Hagmann said: ""This is already an offer which is stretching our already stretched finance like never before. ""We have done everything we possibly can to get to this stage and that this offer - which is still on the table - is as good as it gets."" The Scottish government has given an additional Â£140m to councils to help fund a pay increase for staff and had urged both sides to seek a ""fair resolution"" to the dispute. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said it was offering a further Â£200m over two years to provide a cost of living payment to workers earning below Â£39,000. He said this additional payment would mean workers on a Â£20,000 salary would receive a Â£2,000 increase pay - equivalent to 10%. Mr Swinney said: ""Intensive discussions between the trades unions and COSLA over recent days has led to a revised pay offer being made. ""No deal is perfect and I wish we could go further but this deal does offer significant increases for those on low pay. ""We must now respect the democratic trade union processes under way while we hope that members decide to accept the offer."" Refuse workers at 20 local authorities, including Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, walked out This video can not be played Rubbish is dumped outside Glasgow's Dawsholm Recycling Centre as bin workers across Scotland continue strike action City of Edinburgh Council said many residents would not have their full backlog of waste collected before the next round of industrial action begins on 6 September. The 140,000 households which have kerbside pickups in the city have landfill waste and dry recycling waste collected on alternate weeks. The city council confirmed only one type of rubbish would be picked up per household. However, additional resources will be deployed to support the clean up when the strike ends in the capital on Tuesday. Council leader Cammy Day said: ""This dispute has brought the value of our waste and cleansing teams - and their right to fair wage - into sharp focus and I'm delighted they'll be back out from Tuesday, helping to return our city to its best."" He asked residents to store their waste ""little longer"" while refuse workers catch up with the backlog. Residents are being asked to put their bins out as normal on their scheduled collection day, when extra waste will be collected if it is bagged. The strikes have led to huge piles of waste building up in Edinburgh Environment convenor Scott Arthur said while he had been ""ashamed"" of some of the images of the capital over the past week said he supported waste collection workers and believed they deserved a pay rise. Public Health Scotland has warned of a human health risk from overflowing waste, and advised councils to decontaminate areas where bins have overflowed. Professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh Linda Bauld told BBC Scotland their concerns included pests and vermin that are attracted to waste, bacteria, and the effects on surface water. ""There certainly could be an opportunity for germs and bacteria to spread if we don't sort this out,"" she said. She warned people not to touch the waste. ""I know people are trying to still shove things in the bins if there is a bit of space - don't do that and if you do please use a hand sanitiser or wash your hands,"" Prof Bauld added.

"Ticket sales for Edinburgh Fringe shows slumped by a quarter at some venues compared with 2019. Major venues have warned that spiralling accommodation costs in the city are putting the event's future at risk. In 2019, before the pandemic, eight major venues at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe sold 1,965,961 tickets. But projected ticket sales fell by almost 25% in its first full year back to just 1,486,746. A spokesman for EdFest.com - which is made up of the venues Assembly, Dance Base, Gilded Balloon, Just the Tonic, Pleasance, Summerhall, Underbelly and Zoo - said the fall in sales was a ""major threat for everyone involved in the festival"", and put the blame in part on train strikes, the climbing cost of living and the lingering effects of Covid. Read more stories from Edinburgh, Fife and East Scotland,external The latest headlines from Scotland,external ""Chief among these however is the soaring cost of accommodation in Edinburgh in August - audiences and artists alike are being priced out of town, out of experiences,"" the spokesman warned. ""It is clear to anyone spending time in Edinburgh that there are fewer people in the city this year than in 2019. ""While there are certainly other factors that have affected audience numbers this year, the cost of accommodation is a perennial problem across the board."" On Monday afternoon, the Edinburgh Festival Fringe said an estimated 2,201,175 tickets had been issued this year in total. This was across 3,334 shows which were performed by artists from 63 countries. Fringe Society CEO Shona McCarthy said the figures were nothing short of a miracle, but that much had to be done to make the event the best version of itself, rather than the biggest. She added: ""We recognise the significant amount of work that is still required to support the long-term sustainability of this phenomenal festival. ""The eyes of the world look to this historic city every August, and we need to work together to ensure the Fringe is the best place for creatives to express their ideas, audiences to support them and for people across the sector to develop their skills and careers for the next 75 years."" It is not unusual over the Fringe to see desperate pleas on community Facebook groups of people asking to use a spare room because other options are too expensive, and there have been reports of hotels almost doubling their prices per night for during the festival. Big names including Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Friends star David Schwimmer, comedian Eddie Izzard, and Dame Emma Thompson have seen the Fringe advance their careers. The Fringe performers camping to save money Australian comic wins Edinburgh comedy award 'One person turned up to watch my Fringe show' But EdFest.com said that while suitable housing was not just an August problem ""it's imperative that local and national government, landlords, the universities, Fringe venues and the Fringe Society all come together to find a lasting solution for this issue, or the future of the Fringe is in very real danger"". ""Long term we also have to find solutions that allow the festival to be affordable to performers and the audience,"" an EdFest.com spokesman said. ""Given the extent of the reduction in sales, the overall festival has a major job to do in restoring the event to normality, which may take several years and require some public support. ""We need to stabilise the current situation where many people have made significant losses; to address the accommodation issue; to find ways of supporting work; and a major marketing campaign to get the audience back to the festival."" Benny Higgins, chairman of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society, said: ""The importance of this festival cannot be underestimated. Artists use the Fringe as a place to perform, connect and springboard onto their next career opportunity. ""Recovery takes time, and that is why in June we launched our future development goals. The Society acts to offer anyone a stage and everyone a seat, and there is much to do in the coming months. Eighty per cent was the figure we were quoted for the estimated return of visitors - performers and audiences alike. So the 25% downturn anticipated by many Fringe venues was to be expected. Fewer visitors, buying fewer tickets at the fringe. But with all six summer festivals returning for the first time since 2019, it was a chance to spread interest across the whole city. Not everyone comes to Edinburgh for the Fringe. Some don't come for the festivals at all, and simply pass around the edges (perhaps wondering if the overflowing bins are in fact an artistic intervention by the art festival). For all those here this summer, it's been (bins aside) a much more pleasant city to be in. The pressures of 2019 on public transport, and the city's infrastructure, reduced enough to make it that little bit easier to get around. The numbers at the Fringe may have dipped but other festivals - that planned for smaller audiences and a slower recovery - look likely to have done better. The Edinburgh International Festival - which has kept close tabs on its audiences over the last two years - found people booking later and booking fewer shows. The Edinburgh International Book Festival - which has also been keeping its audiences connected online - reduced its programme. The result, a slow and steady return to form. The mistake is to compare 2022 with 2019. These are very different times, and the challenges of this year will only multiply in the years ahead. The quiet resilience of these festivals - and their importance to the city of Edinburgh - should be celebrated, before everyone moves on to planning for next year's events.

"The Ocean Vanguard left Scotland on Thursday Three North Sea oil rigs which were set to be dumped on an Indian beach will now be dismantled legally in Turkey. The Ocean Vanguard, Ocean Princess and Ocean Nomad have been detained in the Cromarty Firth since 2018 by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. The rigs were formerly owned by Dubai-based Global Marketing Systems (GMS). Sepa stepped in over fears that it planned to take them overseas in potential violation of international laws on transporting hazardous waste. A BBC investigation from 2020 revealed their likely destination was Alang in India, where ships are beached and dismantled by low-paid migrant workers in dirty and often dangerous conditions. Breaking Bad: Uncovering the oil industry's dirty secret Rigs prevented from leaving firth GMS had purchased the rigs from North Sea oil firm Diamond Offshore, which has a base in Aberdeen. GMS has previously denied that it intended to flout international laws. In June, the company sold the rigs to a new owner which has reached an agreement with Sepa to dismantle them at an accredited shipyard in Turkey. The Ocean Vanguard left Scotland on Thursday. The Ocean Princess and Ocean Nomad are expected to follow over the next nine months. Sepa's Colin Morrow said the environmental watchdog was content that the destination yard is EU-approved and has all the necessary consents in place. ""It is important we work with partner agencies across the world to ensure that infrastructure which has driven our prosperity doesn't become another country's environmental problem,"" he said. The Ocean Princess and Ocean Nomad have been detained in the Cromarty Firth since 2018 Unlike in India, where there are no scrapyards accredited to dismantle European vessels, facilities in Turkey meet stringent EU safety and environmental laws. Vessels are dismantled above the tide line on concrete platforms, which prevent hazardous chemicals leaking into the sea and soil. Ingvild Jenssen, director of the pressure group Shipbreaking Platform, said: ""Turkey is a legal destination under international waste law and the conditions there are better than they are in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan."" But she added: ""Whilst it might be a legal destination, we do have some concerns it might not be the best destination for these platforms."" The latest headlines from Scotland,external Read more stories from the Highlands and Islands,external Ilker Sari, the president of Rota Shipping, which now owns the Cromarty rigs, admitted that conditions could be better. ""Recycling a vessel or a rig in a dry dock is the best possible way to do it, but operationally it's very expensive and in most cases it doesn't make it feasible,"" he said. There are only two fully accredited shipbreaking yards in the UK - both in Scotland - and there are concerns the industry will not have the capacity to meet future decommissioning needs, leading to more North Sea rigs ending up dumped on South Asian beaches. ""It definitely needs to change,"" added Ingvild Jenssen. ""There is a need to build up proper capacity to recycle them sustainably."" BBC Scotland revealed in 2020 that two other rigs previously sold to GMS by Diamond Offshore ended up beached in India. The Disclosure programme travelled to Alang to investigate the conditions workers were subject to while breaking up those rigs.

"Facade lighting of the Frauenkirche, Church of Our Lady, is switched off to save energy in Dresden, Germany European Union countries will face five to 10 terrible winters if nothing is done to reduce gas prices, Belgium's energy minister says. Tinne Van der Straeten said gas prices should be frozen and not used to dictate the price of electricity. EU states have been struggling with huge energy price hikes since key gas supplier Russia invaded Ukraine in February, triggering sanctions. Countries backing Ukraine are trying to cut imports of Russian gas and oil. Russia, which supplied the EU with 40% of its gas last year, has in turn restricted supplies. As well as gas, electricity prices have reached record highs. Natural gas is still widely used to generate electricity. Because gas prices have risen, this costs more. Significantly, this price is used when buying electricity wholesale even when it comes from much cheaper renewable resources. ""We have to stop this madness that is happening right now on energy markets,"" Austria's Chancellor Karl Nehammer said. ""We cannot let [Russian President Vladimir] Putin determine the European electricity price every day,"" he added. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also criticised the method used to price electricity being sold on the EU market. Speaking to reporters in Slovenia, she said the bloc was preparing ""structural"" emergency reforms that would tackle high costs - but did not give further details. Can the world cope without Russian gas and oil? Germany - the largest importer of Russian gas in 2020 - has been racing to bolster its gas reserves before winter despite Russia cutting deliveries. Its aim is to fill its gas capacity to 85% by October. It has implemented energy-saving measures to do so. Economy Minister Robert Habeck said such measures - along with buying gas from alternative suppliers - had enabled Germany to fulfil its goal sooner than anticipated. He estimated that the 85% target could be reached by the start of September. Belgium's Prime Minister Alexander de Croo last week warned that people should ""hope for the best and prepare for the worst"". And the French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne told business leaders on Monday to submit energy-saving plans by next month - otherwise there could be rationing.

"Soaring energy bills could be the ""straw that finally breaks the camel's back"" for small businesses, former chancellor Alistair Darling has warned. Mr Darling, who was Labour chancellor during the financial crisis, said ""bold action"" was needed to help the economy. The energy price cap for households will soar by 80% from October. But firms are not covered by the cap and Mr Darling said that after surviving Covid, energy costs risked finishing them off. Mr Darling described the current situation as a ""lethal cocktail"" and said it required ""bold action"" to be taken by the government. Both candidates in the Conservative Party leadership race, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, have come under pressure to outline further support for households and firms following the announcement that energy bills would rise again this Autumn. The new leader - and prime minster to succeed Boris Johnson - will be announced next Monday. What is the energy price cap and what will I actually pay? What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill? Ms Truss has so far confirmed she will cut National Insurance and green levies on bills. Mr Sunak has proposed tax cuts on energy bills as part of a Â£10bn package. It emerged at the weekend that Ms Truss is considering a ""nuclear"" option of cutting VAT by 5% as well as raising the threshold at which people start paying tax. In May, the government announced Â£37bn worth of help for households with the rising cost of living. But Mr Darling told the BBC's Today programme the government needed to announce more support. ""You've got to announce it now,"" he said. ""Frankly the stuff that's been announced so far might have passed muster earlier this year, it simply won't do now, you need something far more substantial."" Alistair Darling was chancellor of the exchequer during the 2008 financial crisis Mr Darling said many firms, ""especially the smaller ones who have been struggling through the whole Covid problems over the last couple of years may find that [the cost of energy] is the straw that finally breaks the camel's back"". He said: ""My fear is if the government doesn't do something, you will not just have hardship for individuals and businesses, but you will find that people's spending goes down. ""And the risk is, at the moment people are saying the chances of us going into recession are 50-50. It could just tip us into recession, which of course would be disastrous for us."" He added: ""One lesson I drew from what happened in 2008 is you've got to do more than people expect, and you've got to it more quickly than people expect, if it's going to work."" A spokesperson for the Treasury said it was ""making the necessary preparations to ensure a new government has options to deliver additional support as quickly as possible, as the chancellor has made clear"". ""And as the prime minister has made clear, no major fiscal decisions will be taken until the new prime minister is in post,"" they added. On Friday, energy regulator Ofgem announced a rise in the energy price cap. It means a typical household will pay Â£3,549 a year for gas and electricity starting in October up from Â£1,971 currently. And some economists have warned that could rise even further. Wholesale gas prices have been rising since last year but have worsened recently because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Kremlin's decision to squeeze energy supplies to Europe. Small businesses across a number of industries have voiced their concerns over rising energy bills. More than 750 restaurant and cafÃ© owners called on the government and Conservative leadership candidates for support through VAT cuts, grants and business rate rebates. In an open letter, the signatories said takeaways were being quoted ""eyewatering bills"" that were ""simply impossible to pay"". ""The government has waited until the last moment to act before, but now cannot be one of those times. ""It must work with the Conservative leadership candidates on a plan to support Britain's smallest restaurants before it's too late,"" said Ibrahim Dogus, chair of the British Takeaway Campaign. Jon Long, who runs five fish and chips shops in Dorset, told the BBC if he had to pay the current market rate for gas and electricity, it would mean the end his business after four generations in his family. He managed to fix his gas and electric rates with his energy provider in 2021 and secured a two-year contract, but many businesses aren't in his position. Jon Long runs five fish and chips shops in Dorset ""What seemed to be extortionate then now seems like an absolute steal,"" he said. The 59-year-old said currently his average bill per shop is about Â£15,000 per year, but based on current wholesale prices, it would cost him up to Â£80,000. ""We are on a war footing here. There has been a lot of talk, a lot of sympathy, they (the government) have been listening but no action,"" he said. ""Businesses coming out of contracts need drastic help, and they need it now or we face losing thousands of previously viable businesses."" The Bank of England recently warned that the UK economy will fall into recession later this year as rising energy costs push up the rate of inflation. It recently raised interest rates by 0.5% - the biggest increase in 27 years - in an attempt to cool rising consumer prices which hit 10.1% in July. Mr Darling said the financial crisis more than a decade ago was different to today's economic climate, but warned the current situation was ""just as threatening to people, [and] to the economy as the financial crisis was back in 2008"". ""It's not just people on low incomes who are going to be affected by this, it's going to be people right up the income chain,"" he said.

"Facade lighting of the Frauenkirche, Church of Our Lady, is switched off to save energy in Dresden, Germany European Union countries will face five to 10 terrible winters if nothing is done to reduce gas prices, Belgium's energy minister says. Tinne Van der Straeten said gas prices should be frozen and not used to dictate the price of electricity. EU states have been struggling with huge energy price hikes since key gas supplier Russia invaded Ukraine in February, triggering sanctions. Countries backing Ukraine are trying to cut imports of Russian gas and oil. Russia, which supplied the EU with 40% of its gas last year, has in turn restricted supplies. As well as gas, electricity prices have reached record highs. Natural gas is still widely used to generate electricity. Because gas prices have risen, this costs more. Significantly, this price is used when buying electricity wholesale even when it comes from much cheaper renewable resources. ""We have to stop this madness that is happening right now on energy markets,"" Austria's Chancellor Karl Nehammer said. ""We cannot let [Russian President Vladimir] Putin determine the European electricity price every day,"" he added. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also criticised the method used to price electricity being sold on the EU market. Speaking to reporters in Slovenia, she said the bloc was preparing ""structural"" emergency reforms that would tackle high costs - but did not give further details. Can the world cope without Russian gas and oil? Germany - the largest importer of Russian gas in 2020 - has been racing to bolster its gas reserves before winter despite Russia cutting deliveries. Its aim is to fill its gas capacity to 85% by October. It has implemented energy-saving measures to do so. Economy Minister Robert Habeck said such measures - along with buying gas from alternative suppliers - had enabled Germany to fulfil its goal sooner than anticipated. He estimated that the 85% target could be reached by the start of September. Belgium's Prime Minister Alexander de Croo last week warned that people should ""hope for the best and prepare for the worst"". And the French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne told business leaders on Monday to submit energy-saving plans by next month - otherwise there could be rationing.

"This video can not be played Overflowing bins are seen on nearly every street, including along the busy Grassmarket Unions have confirmed they will continue strike action after turning down a new pay offer from councils. Unite and the GMB both rejected the Cosla offer while Unison, Scotland's largest council union, said it would put it to members. Rubbish has been building up in many town and city centres after several days of bin strikes. The dispute led to action in two-thirds of Scotland's councils and is set to close schools and nurseries next week. Cosla said it was ""disappointed"" with the response from unions. Unions had been seeking an agreement from the local government body similar to the one made to council workers in England - which included a Â£1,925 flat rate pay increase. They said that offering a percentage pay rise would mean the most money would go to the best paid staff. Public health warning as bin strikes continue Is there a bin strike in my area? The people hiring skips and using baths to store rubbish The current round of strikes is due to end on Wednesday in many local authority areas, and at 04:59 in Edinburgh. The first bin strike began in the capital city on 18 August, in the midst of festival season, after the GMB, Unite and Unison rejected aninitial pay offer equivalent to a 3.5% increase. Edinburgh's strike is due to end on Tuesday morning but more action is planned next week It escalated last week when refuse workers at a further 20 local authorities, including Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, walked out despite a revised 5% offer. A second wave of strikes, which will include school workers, is due to begin in a bid to ""achieve a significantly improved pay offer"". Hundreds of schools and nurseries are scheduled to close from 6 to 8 September. Cosla's offer of a Â£1,925 pay uplift matched an offer to council workers south of the border, but only part of this payment was consolidated into council workers' ongoing pay. The rest would be given as one-off cost of living payments. Those earning less than Â£20,500 - about 20% of council staff in Scotland - would receive a pro-rata gross pay increase in 2022 equal to Â£2,000. All staff would also get an extra day of leave. Unite criticised the negotiations as a ""waste of precious time"" because new offer disproportionately hits the lowest paid. The union's industrial officer Wendy Dunsmore said: ""In real terms it leaves the lowest paid workers no better-off and a significant proportion of the offer does not enhance overtime, allowances or pensions."" Mark Ferguson, chair of Unison's local government committee, said strike action was the ""last resort"". ""Half of council workers earn less than Â£25,000 per year and 85% earn less than Â£39,000 per year - they are all worrying about paying their bills,"" he said. GMB Scotland senior organiser Keir Greenaway said they had written to Cosla urging them to return to talks as soon as possible. He said: ""It's not credible that in the grip of the biggest cost of living crisis in forty years, a head of service gets four times the consolidated increase than a bin collector, cleaner or carer."" BBC reporter Angie Brown says residents are dodging massive middens in the streets By Angie Brown, BBC Scotland Edinburgh reporter The noxious ooze now covering Edinburgh's city centre streets from leaking bins full of rotting mountains of rubbish is quite startling. Not only is it now quite hard to dodge these massive middens, as the Scots call them, but it is almost impossible to avoid walking through the rivulets of slime washing over our pavements in Auld Reekie. I tasted the nastiness of this when I mistakenly touched my bike wheel and caught a whiff of the worst smell on my hands that I had ever encountered. In the first few days of the strike, litter was swirling around in our narrow cobbled streets in the Old Town and I remember being quite horrified when the inside of a brown-smeared vegetarian haggis packet slapped me in the face. Now all that rubbish is stuck to the ground - trampled and glued to the pavements by I don't know what - causing a layer of detritus you might expect from the days, hundreds of years ago, when Edinburgh folk threw their rubbish out of their tenement windows shouting ""gardyloo"". Cosla said its offer was at the ""absolute extremes"" of affordability. Resources spokesperson Katie Hagmann said: ""This is already an offer which is stretching our already stretched finance like never before. ""We have done everything we possibly can to get to this stage and that this offer - which is still on the table - is as good as it gets."" The Scottish government has given an additional Â£140m to councils to help fund a pay increase for staff and had urged both sides to seek a ""fair resolution"" to the dispute. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said it was offering a further Â£200m over two years to provide a cost of living payment to workers earning below Â£39,000. He said this additional payment would mean workers on a Â£20,000 salary would receive a Â£2,000 increase pay - equivalent to 10%. Mr Swinney said: ""Intensive discussions between the trades unions and COSLA over recent days has led to a revised pay offer being made. ""No deal is perfect and I wish we could go further but this deal does offer significant increases for those on low pay. ""We must now respect the democratic trade union processes under way while we hope that members decide to accept the offer."" Refuse workers at 20 local authorities, including Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, walked out This video can not be played Rubbish is dumped outside Glasgow's Dawsholm Recycling Centre as bin workers across Scotland continue strike action City of Edinburgh Council said many residents would not have their full backlog of waste collected before the next round of industrial action begins on 6 September. The 140,000 households which have kerbside pickups in the city have landfill waste and dry recycling waste collected on alternate weeks. The city council confirmed only one type of rubbish would be picked up per household. However, additional resources will be deployed to support the clean up when the strike ends in the capital on Tuesday. Council leader Cammy Day said: ""This dispute has brought the value of our waste and cleansing teams - and their right to fair wage - into sharp focus and I'm delighted they'll be back out from Tuesday, helping to return our city to its best."" He asked residents to store their waste ""little longer"" while refuse workers catch up with the backlog. Residents are being asked to put their bins out as normal on their scheduled collection day, when extra waste will be collected if it is bagged. The strikes have led to huge piles of waste building up in Edinburgh Environment convenor Scott Arthur said while he had been ""ashamed"" of some of the images of the capital over the past week said he supported waste collection workers and believed they deserved a pay rise. Public Health Scotland has warned of a human health risk from overflowing waste, and advised councils to decontaminate areas where bins have overflowed. Professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh Linda Bauld told BBC Scotland their concerns included pests and vermin that are attracted to waste, bacteria, and the effects on surface water. ""There certainly could be an opportunity for germs and bacteria to spread if we don't sort this out,"" she said. She warned people not to touch the waste. ""I know people are trying to still shove things in the bins if there is a bit of space - don't do that and if you do please use a hand sanitiser or wash your hands,"" Prof Bauld added.

"There has been a big fall in the number of chain stores shutting across Britain, new figures show. Closures in the first six months of 2022 dropped by a third compared with the first half of last year, accountancy firm PwC said. Shop openings are still below pre-Covid levels, but closures are now at their lowest level for seven years. PwC said the shock of the pandemic had ""eased"" but warned that high inflation will hit the retail sector. The firm produced the research in partnership with the Local Data Company (LDC), which tracks over 3,000 locations, including High Streets, retail parks and shopping centres in England, Wales and Scotland. ""The good news is that we're back on High Streets, there are more people out shopping and eating,"" said Kien Tan, director of retail strategy at PwC. ""But the bad news is inflation hangs over us. It will affect shoppers in their pocket. But it will also affect businesses in terms of higher bills to pay. So there could be more closures to come,"" said Mr Tan. Consumer confidence hits record low as prices soar Why are prices rising so quickly? For now though, the figures are heading in the right direction. The analysis covers businesses with more than five outlets and includes everything from retail and hospitality to gyms, banks and hairdressers. It does not include independent traders. More than 6,000 stores closed in the first half of this year, but the numbers are sharply down on the previous 12 months. Store openings are still lacklustre and below pre-pandemic levels, resulting in an overall loss of more than 2,200 outlets. That is an average closure rate of 12 stores a day, although it is the smallest number of net closures in five years. Lucy Stainton, commercial director at the LDC, said the trends seen were ""hugely varied"". ""Although it has been over two years since the start of the pandemic, we are still yet to define our 'new normal' which is having a sustained impact on city centre locations, with many new openings being focused on smaller market towns and local High Streets as people continue to work from home. ""City centres are further hampered by both train strikes and airport travel disruption reducing tourist numbers,"" she added. The types of closures is changing, too. In the first half of last year, more than 1,000 clothing shops disappeared as the pandemic pushed a wave of big names, like Philip Green's Arcadia group, over the edge. This time round, it is betting shops, banks and charity shops that are declining the most. ""Our High Streets are still changing quite dramatically and they will continue to evolve. Banking and betting can all be done online. Restaurant chains are actually back in growth for the first time in five years and that's because we can't replace that kind of eating and drinking at home,"" said PwC's Mr Tan. Leisure operators can benefit from spaces that retailers have vacated, says Nick Collins Nick Collins, chief executive of hospitality business Loungers, says changes in the property market are helping his company expand. The firm was founded in 2002 and has two brands, Cosy Club and Lounge, offering all-day cafe-bar and restaurant dining. It now has 203 sites across England and Wales and its latest outlet opened in Canterbury three weeks ago, replacing a home and haberdashery shop. ""We've been looking at the city for four or five years. And we're really pleased to be open,"" Mr Collins says. As retailers have moved out, he has been seizing the chance to move in, nabbing sites he would not have had a chance of securing a decade ago. And the rents are usually better, too. ""As banks and retailers like Dorothy Perkins have come out of the High Street, these units are prime pitch locations right in the centre of the High Street, benefiting from strong footfall going past all day and through the evening. That's giving leisure operators like us a great opportunity."" Cosy Club's newest outlet opened in Canterbury earlier this month The business has gone from strength to strength, he says, and hopes to open around 30 sites this year in smaller, regional locations. But do the economics still stack up, given the ""cost-of-doing business"" crisis facing the sector? Potentially ruinous energy bills and a collapse in discretionary spending could make this a bleak midwinter. He says that Loungers is ""well set"" to weather the economic storm. For instance, the company has long-term hedging contracts for energy in place for its existing sites until 2024. But he is fearful for other less well-capitalised firms.

"More than 100 children a day have been kitted out with second-hand school uniforms at a hub in west Belfast in the past three weeks, the founder of a food bank has said. Paul Doherty said demand was ""staggering"" and the number of people using the service was ""frightening"". ""We've been running this for a number of years, and this is the worst year,"" he told BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster. ""We have seen many parents come to the door quite distressed. ""Many parents are telling us of financial hardship; turning to loan sharks; turning to debt as a result, that's the reality of what's happening in communities right now. ""It's quite shocking."" Minister urged to 'step up' over uniform costs Should there be a school uniform price limit? Mr Doherty said Foodstock was primarily a food bank. However, he said that if people could not afford to put food on their table, heat their homes or put petrol in their cars, then they would struggle to pay for school uniforms. ""I saw a mother break down in front of her children and her children consoling the mother saying: 'It's okay mum, our friends' parents are doing this too'. ""I've seen many older children come in and get themselves kitted out as well in our uniform hub, which in itself is heart breaking."" Paul Doherty said that this year the demand for second hand uniforms had been ""staggering"" But Mr Doherty said what was most striking thing for him was the number of working families affected. ""It's seeing the amount of working families - low income families - who are just coming under that threshold of being eligible for any sort of grants really struggling. ""They're not getting any support. ""Going forward, this is the sort of thing we need to look at in terms of how widespread this is and how many people this is impacting across the board."" What was heartening, he added, was the community response. ""What we have seen is a real sense of community solidarity in place of any mitigation by government, or even some of our schools in terms of this situation."" Emma Davies who runs the school uniform bank at Trinity Methodist Church in Lisburn told Good Morning Ulster that people from ""all walks of life"" used their service. ""I've had people coming to my door apologising for what they're driving because they're afraid in case people think that just because they're driving a big car that they've got money,"" she said. ""We have had people coming to us saying they had to get into debt, take Credit Union loans or borrow money off family,"" she said. ""We had one girl in and her child was supposed to start school on Thursday and wasn't able to start school at all because she didn't have a school uniform to put her in. ""We're finding that children are missing days or they're having to go into school wearing bits of uniform that don't belong to that school."" Ms Davies said that one mother said that she was having to colour in pieces of logo on her child's uniform because the school kept changing the colour of the  logo. She said some items of uniform were ""extortionate"". A project in Londonderry says demand for its uniform scheme has spiked since last year Rachel Carlin of the Focus Project in the Creggan area of Londonderry said there had been a surge in demand for their free school uniform service compared to last year. Hundreds of local families have availed of the service over the summer months, she said. She added: ""We are seeing a lot more working people than in previous years, people who are not able to claim grant support. ""We were fortunate to be given a lot of donations, but no sooner were the items coming in than they were going out,"" she said. The Focus Project was originally set up to empower women through training and education. But with families facing ever increasing costs post Covid, she said they've had to shift their focus to more practical ways of helping. ""We are very much working in crisis mode now and are really concerned as we head into the winter,"" she said. In June,Education Minister Michelle McIlveensaid she was spending just over Â£1m to increase the school uniform grant by 20%. The Department of Education spoke previously of a ""huge discrepancy"" between the grant available to Northern Ireland families and other parts of the UK. The department is reviewing the criteria for the uniform grant and for free school meals. Minister must 'step up' over uniform costs Should there be a school uniform price limit?

"Arctic Monkeys have headlined Reading and Leeds twice before, in 2009 and 2014 Arctic Monkeys slipped a new tune in among some old favourites during a career-spanning headline set to close Leeds Festival on Sunday evening. ""Hello Leeds, you're looking well,"" smiled singer Alex Turner, to legions of adoring fans in their home county. The gigs at Leeds and Reading marked their first in the UK for four years. Fellow Sheffield co-headliners Bring Me the Horizon brought out Doncastrian Yungblud as Bramham Park was turned into a cathedral of Yorkshire music. After rap had reigned supreme on Saturday, Sunday was all about rock 'n' roll (baby) and the return of the prodigal sons, fresh back from festival dates in Europe, drew the biggest and most vocal crowd of the whole weekend by some distance. From the opening strains of Do I Wanna Know? (which found their frontman riffing on a teardrop guitar) to Matt Helders hitting the hell out of his drumkit during the haunting Pretty Visitors and their collective falsetto for Knee Socks; the nowadays expanded High Green outfit demonstrated their Transatlantic appeal. In the middle of a set that plucked from slick rock-pop beats and old indie sleaze bangers from their six number one albums, Turner and co also performed the unreleased I Ain't Quite Where I Think I Am - a funk/soul-era Bowie-esque track which gave a glimpse of their upcoming LP, The Car. Most bands could not get away with road testing fresh material on the biggest of stages, but then the Arctic Monkeys are not most bands, especially around these here parts. Frontman Alex Turner later threw off his jacket, put down his guitar and put on his shades to sing Their newer stuff, including the title track from their divisive left field space pop/jazz last album Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino, was greeted with warm applause. But it was the arrival of the rapid-fire nightclub queueing anthem From the Ritz to the Rubble that saw it all kick off, as flares were lit by fans in the frenzied crowd. The group then unleashed a series of big singalong hits like I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor, 505 and finale RU Mine? ""Thanks for having us Leeds,"" said Turner, from behind his night shades. ""It means a lot to us."" The evolution of the Monkeys from local indie lads to international showmen, with Turner directing the audience with the occasional line or action, has been a fascinating thing for regulars at this festival to follow. The 36-year-old songwriter recently toldThe Big Issue,external""you don't feel the need to prove yourself as much"" after 15 years in the spotlight, and he and his bandmates seemed confident and relaxed in familiar surroundings on their return. Oli Sykes of Bring Me the Horizon got the mosh pit going Remarkably, on one of the biggest nights in Yorkshire's recent rock history, Bring Me the Horizon frontman Oli Sykes actually went to the same school as the Arctic Monkeys - Stocksbridge High. ""It might not be that mad for them but it's mad for me that we're here doing this with one of our favourite bands in the world,"" he said on stage. ""This is next level simulation stuff."" The metal rockers roared their way through tracks like Drown and Throne during a high-octane, mosh pit inducing co-headliner set. Screaming his lungs out for the most part, singer Sykes declared: ""This is as close to a homecoming gig as it gets"". He thanked fans for helping him through when he ""nearly died a good few times"", referring to his past drug and mental health issues. In a rare softer moment, Sykes, who like Turner has a Yorkshire white rose tattoo, paused to say a quick hello to the locals in customary fashion. ""I feel like I haven't had chance to say eh up yet,"" he said. ""Eh up!"" The crowd returned the favour, and cries of ""Yorrrkshire!"" came from all angles, including from the stage. The baton was then passed to the next generation, as Yungblud - succeeding Ed Sheeran as the band's special guest from the night before at Reading - joined Sykes et al for a head-banging rendition of their collaboration Obey, and a second round of ""Yorrrkshire!""s was ordered by the young star. One man near me yelled ""Barnsley!"" while another raised him a ""Hebden Bridge!"" Wolf Alice may not be from the country's biggest county but they once again showed on Sunday why they seem destined for the top slot one day, while Fontaines DC did their burgeoning reputation no harm either. The Sherlocks opened up for their fellow south Yorkshire musicians Another band whoarefrom south Yorkshire, The Sherlocks were given ""the graveyard shift"", as singer Kiaran Crook put it on stage, opening one of the main stages at midday. Crook and his brother and drummer Brandon told us they were blown away that so many (likely hungover) people had dragged themselves out of their tents to see them. The siblings were 11 and 14, respectively when the Arctic Monkeys first blew up in the mid-noughties and said they ""had a massive influence on us when we were just finding our feet"". They recalled being shocked when Helders and his family turned up to watch them perform at a gig in Los Angeles, and said they intended to go find him just as soon as our interview was over. While several of Sunday's acts won't have too far to go to get home to their families, many festival-goers will wake up on Monday morning with a mission on their hands. This year, Music Declares Emergency hosted it's first eco camps at Reading and Leeds, where campers are rewarded for agreeing to leave the campsite as they found it on departure. Claire O'Neill from A Greener Festival, an organisation that helps events improve sustainability told the BBC taglines and hashtags like ""#NoLeedsOnADeadPlanet"" can ""really help to tie in the messages that can be quite complicated into something quite simple and direct"". She urged punters to take their re-usable tents home -many left theirs last year- and to reduce traffic pollution by taking public transport or travelling in vehicles that are as full as possible, while calling on festivals to collaborate with local authorities and the government to improve infrastructure going forwards. A spokesman for the Department of Transport told the BBC the government was ""going further and faster than ever before to achieve a net zero future"". Rou Reynolds of Enter Shikari put in an impassioned display Enter Shikari, whose recent track Elegy For Extinction addressed the threat of climate change, backed this year's scheme and appealed to the crowd's better nature during their energetic set on Sunday afternoon. The St Albans rock band told the BBC backstage they once completed a whole tour driving in a van powered by chip oil, instead of petrol. And frontman Rou Reynolds believes it is pivotal to take conversations about pressing environmental concerns into areas of everyday life. ""Festivals are a place where people come together, they connect, they experience things together,"" he said. ""So I think the the more fury really that can build and be harnessed and used to demand real change, the better.""

"There has been a big fall in the number of chain stores shutting across Britain, new figures show. Closures in the first six months of 2022 dropped by a third compared with the first half of last year, accountancy firm PwC said. Shop openings are still below pre-Covid levels, but closures are now at their lowest level for seven years. PwC said the shock of the pandemic had ""eased"" but warned that high inflation will hit the retail sector. The firm produced the research in partnership with the Local Data Company (LDC), which tracks over 3,000 locations, including High Streets, retail parks and shopping centres in England, Wales and Scotland. ""The good news is that we're back on High Streets, there are more people out shopping and eating,"" said Kien Tan, director of retail strategy at PwC. ""But the bad news is inflation hangs over us. It will affect shoppers in their pocket. But it will also affect businesses in terms of higher bills to pay. So there could be more closures to come,"" said Mr Tan. Consumer confidence hits record low as prices soar Why are prices rising so quickly? For now though, the figures are heading in the right direction. The analysis covers businesses with more than five outlets and includes everything from retail and hospitality to gyms, banks and hairdressers. It does not include independent traders. More than 6,000 stores closed in the first half of this year, but the numbers are sharply down on the previous 12 months. Store openings are still lacklustre and below pre-pandemic levels, resulting in an overall loss of more than 2,200 outlets.

"Gibraltar can officially call itself a city, 180 years after it was first granted the status by Queen Victoria. The British overseas territory had bid to become a city earlier this year as part of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. But when researchers looked through the National Archives, they found it had already been recognised as one in 1842. The Rock has now had its status reaffirmed - Boris Johnson described it as a ""huge accolade"" celebrating its ""rich history and dynamism"". Gibraltar has been a British overseas territory since 1713, when it was ceded to Britain under a peace treaty signed following the War of the Spanish Succession. A Jubilee competition saw 39 places apply to become cities andeight of them, including Doncaster, Bangor, and Dunfermline, ultimately granted the status. City status is often associated with having a cathedral, university, or large population, but there are no set rules for it being granted - it's awarded by the monarch on advice of ministers. It bringslittle in the way of material benefits, although it can often provide a boost to communities by putting them on the map and is normally a source of pride for residents. The government said Gibraltar had been omitted from official lists after being originally given the title by Queen Victoria, but it is not clear how this happened. An updated record of the 81 places named as cities has now been published. Gibraltar is one of only five outside the UK to be recognised. Hamilton in Bermuda, Jamestown in Saint Helena, and Douglas on the Isle of Man were already on the list, while Stanley in the Falklands Islands was among those named for the Jubilee this year. Southend in Essex was also granted city status earlier this year following themurder of David Amess MP, who had represented the Southend West constituency since 1997 and had long campaigned on the issue. Cabinet Office Minister Kit Malthouse said: ""The cities in this list are incredibly rich with history and culture, and the local people of those areas are rightly very proud to see their city's significance put to paper. ""I'm hopeful people based in these places, particularly the new cities, can reap the benefits of their home's increased global standing and that it will attract more inward investment for local businesses.""

"This video can not be played Overflowing bins are seen on nearly every street, including along the busy Grassmarket Unions have confirmed they will continue strike action after turning down a new pay offer from councils. Unite and the GMB both rejected the Cosla offer while Unison, Scotland's largest council union, said it would put it to members. Rubbish has been building up in many town and city centres after several days of bin strikes. The dispute led to action in two-thirds of Scotland's councils and is set to close schools and nurseries next week. Cosla said it was ""disappointed"" with the response from unions. Unions had been seeking an agreement from the local government body similar to the one made to council workers in England - which included a Â£1,925 flat rate pay increase. They said that offering a percentage pay rise would mean the most money would go to the best paid staff. Public health warning as bin strikes continue Is there a bin strike in my area? The people hiring skips and using baths to store rubbish The current round of strikes is due to end on Wednesday in many local authority areas, and at 04:59 in Edinburgh. The first bin strike began in the capital city on 18 August, in the midst of festival season, after the GMB, Unite and Unison rejected aninitial pay offer equivalent to a 3.5% increase. Edinburgh's strike is due to end on Tuesday morning but more action is planned next week It escalated last week when refuse workers at a further 20 local authorities, including Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, walked out despite a revised 5% offer. A second wave of strikes, which will include school workers, is due to begin in a bid to ""achieve a significantly improved pay offer"". Hundreds of schools and nurseries are scheduled to close from 6 to 8 September. Cosla's offer of a Â£1,925 pay uplift matched an offer to council workers south of the border, but only part of this payment was consolidated into council workers' ongoing pay. The rest would be given as one-off cost of living payments. Those earning less than Â£20,500 - about 20% of council staff in Scotland - would receive a pro-rata gross pay increase in 2022 equal to Â£2,000. All staff would also get an extra day of leave. Unite criticised the negotiations as a ""waste of precious time"" because new offer disproportionately hits the lowest paid. The union's industrial officer Wendy Dunsmore said: ""In real terms it leaves the lowest paid workers no better-off and a significant proportion of the offer does not enhance overtime, allowances or pensions."" Mark Ferguson, chair of Unison's local government committee, said strike action was the ""last resort"". ""Half of council workers earn less than Â£25,000 per year and 85% earn less than Â£39,000 per year - they are all worrying about paying their bills,"" he said. GMB Scotland senior organiser Keir Greenaway said they had written to Cosla urging them to return to talks as soon as possible. He said: ""It's not credible that in the grip of the biggest cost of living crisis in forty years, a head of service gets four times the consolidated increase than a bin collector, cleaner or carer."" BBC reporter Angie Brown says residents are dodging massive middens in the streets By Angie Brown, BBC Scotland Edinburgh reporter The noxious ooze now covering Edinburgh's city centre streets from leaking bins full of rotting mountains of rubbish is quite startling. Not only is it now quite hard to dodge these massive middens, as the Scots call them, but it is almost impossible to avoid walking through the rivulets of slime washing over our pavements in Auld Reekie. I tasted the nastiness of this when I mistakenly touched my bike wheel and caught a whiff of the worst smell on my hands that I had ever encountered. In the first few days of the strike, litter was swirling around in our narrow cobbled streets in the Old Town and I remember being quite horrified when the inside of a brown-smeared vegetarian haggis packet slapped me in the face. Now all that rubbish is stuck to the ground - trampled and glued to the pavements by I don't know what - causing a layer of detritus you might expect from the days, hundreds of years ago, when Edinburgh folk threw their rubbish out of their tenement windows shouting ""gardyloo"". Cosla said its offer was at the ""absolute extremes"" of affordability. Resources spokesperson Katie Hagmann said: ""This is already an offer which is stretching our already stretched finance like never before. ""We have done everything we possibly can to get to this stage and that this offer - which is still on the table - is as good as it gets."" The Scottish government has given an additional Â£140m to councils to help fund a pay increase for staff and had urged both sides to seek a ""fair resolution"" to the dispute. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said it was offering a further Â£200m over two years to provide a cost of living payment to workers earning below Â£39,000. He said this additional payment would mean workers on a Â£20,000 salary would receive a Â£2,000 increase pay - equivalent to 10%. Mr Swinney said: ""Intensive discussions between the trades unions and COSLA over recent days has led to a revised pay offer being made. ""No deal is perfect and I wish we could go further but this deal does offer significant increases for those on low pay. ""We must now respect the democratic trade union processes under way while we hope that members decide to accept the offer."" Refuse workers at 20 local authorities, including Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, walked out This video can not be played Rubbish is dumped outside Glasgow's Dawsholm Recycling Centre as bin workers across Scotland continue strike action City of Edinburgh Council said many residents would not have their full backlog of waste collected before the next round of industrial action begins on 6 September. The 140,000 households which have kerbside pickups in the city have landfill waste and dry recycling waste collected on alternate weeks. The city council confirmed only one type of rubbish would be picked up per household. However, additional resources will be deployed to support the clean up when the strike ends in the capital on Tuesday. Council leader Cammy Day said: ""This dispute has brought the value of our waste and cleansing teams - and their right to fair wage - into sharp focus and I'm delighted they'll be back out from Tuesday, helping to return our city to its best."" He asked residents to store their waste ""little longer"" while refuse workers catch up with the backlog. Residents are being asked to put their bins out as normal on their scheduled collection day, when extra waste will be collected if it is bagged. The strikes have led to huge piles of waste building up in Edinburgh Environment convenor Scott Arthur said while he had been ""ashamed"" of some of the images of the capital over the past week said he supported waste collection workers and believed they deserved a pay rise. Public Health Scotland has warned of a human health risk from overflowing waste, and advised councils to decontaminate areas where bins have overflowed. Professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh Linda Bauld told BBC Scotland their concerns included pests and vermin that are attracted to waste, bacteria, and the effects on surface water. ""There certainly could be an opportunity for germs and bacteria to spread if we don't sort this out,"" she said. She warned people not to touch the waste. ""I know people are trying to still shove things in the bins if there is a bit of space - don't do that and if you do please use a hand sanitiser or wash your hands,"" Prof Bauld added.

"Shares in Asia have fallen after the chairman of the US central bank said it would continue to raise interest rates to tackle soaring prices. Jerome Powell warned that the Federal Reserve's policies will cause ""some pain to households and businesses"". Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for individuals and companies, which could slow economic growth as well as inflation. Japan's Nikkei 225 index closed 2.7% lower on Monday in Tokyo. Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, the Kospi in South Korea and Australia's ASX 200 were both down by around 2%, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was 0.8% lower. That came after the main share indexes in New York each fell by more than 3% on Friday after Mr Powell's remarks. US stock markets down after interest rate warning Why are prices rising and what is the inflation rate in the US? During a highly-anticipated speech at a conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Mr Powell said the Federal Reserve was likely to continue raising interest rates in the coming months and could keep them high ""for some time"". He said that, while the hikes would come at a cost to American households and businesses, ""a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain"". Inflation in the world's largest economy by gross domestic product (GDP) is at a four-decade high. ""Fed Chair Powell went for the jugular, conveying (an) unflinching assault on inflation,"" Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank, said in a note. ""Justification for this unrelentingly hawkish posture was as plain as it was unequivocal,"" he added. Investors are also concerned that the Chinese economy is slowing, Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China, told the BBC. ""The economic perspective has worsened in China due to prolonged Covid control, which means further policy rate cuts have to take place. Domestic demand is too weak without further rate cuts in China,"" she said. China's central bank cut its lending rates earlier this month aftereconomic growth slowed sharply in the second quarter of this year. Power shortages in the Sichuan provincehave also hit major manufacturers of cars and smartphones in China. Over the weekend, official data showed that profits of China industrial firms had fallen by 1.1% from January to July, from a year earlier. A crisis in the country's property market is also proving to be a major challenge to government efforts to keep the economy growing.

"Tourists pose for pictures beside overflowing bins in Edinburgh It is hoped a new pay offer could be made to unions in a bid to end the council strike in Scotland. Bin strikes now affect two thirds of Scotland's local authorities and rubbish is building up in many town and city centres. Discussions between the unions and the council's umbrella body, Cosla, took place on Sunday. There is still no new offer but sources close to negotiations believe it is possible one may be made on Monday. No talks are scheduled, but a revised pay offer could come from Cosla. Kate Hagmman, Cosla's resources spokeswoman, said: ""We remain in intense active discussions with our trade union colleagues."" Public health warning as bin strikes continue Is there a bin strike in my area? The people hiring skips and using baths to store rubbish The Scottish government has encouraged both sides to seek a ""fair resolution"" to the dispute. Ben MacPherson, minister for social security and local government, toldBBC Radio's Good Morning ScotlandÂ programmeÂ that afterÂ ""constructive discussions over recent days""Â CoslaÂ met with local government leaders to discuss a ""potential proposition"".Â Â However, he said: ""It would not be appropriate for the Scottish government to comment further beyond continuing to encourage both sides to continue to seek that fair resolution to the dispute that we all want to see as soon as possible.Â ""The unions andÂ CoslaÂ are the negotiating parties in this scenario. The Scottish government can't make the unions an offer because we are not the employer in this situation but we're engaged with local government leaders and we want to see a resolution to this just like everyone else.""Â Edinburgh's strike is due to end after Monday but more action is planned next week Meanwhile City of Edinburgh Council said additional resources would be deployed to support the clean up on Tuesday, when the strike ends. Council leader Cammy Day said he was continuing to press the Scottish government to fund an ""acceptable settlement"". ""This dispute has brought the value of our waste and cleansing teams - and their right to fair wage - into sharp focus and I'm delighted they'll be back out from Tuesday, helping to return our city to its best,"" he said. ""While they'll be working hard to catch up on collections and making every effort to collect litter across the city, it'll take time for things to return to normal. ""Please bear with them as they do so and, if you can store your extra waste safely for a little longer or are able to book an appointment at a recycling centre, please do so."" Residents are being asked to put their bins out as normal on their scheduled collection day, when extra waste will be collected if it is bagged. Public Health Scotland has warned of a human health risk from overflowing waste, and advised councils to decontaminate areas where bins have overflowed. Scott Rennox spoke to BBC Scotland in Portobello Scott Rennox, a street cleanser in Edinburgh, spoke to BBC Scotland to explain why he was on strike. ""Everything's going up, the energy prices are going up and we're still getting the same pay,"" the Unite member said. ""We're just letting them see what it's like if we don't get our pay."" He said he and his colleagues worked all through the pandemic. ""We're picking up more masks than we do cigarette packets now - and there's plenty of disease around them,"" he said. ""What we're wanting is fair pay for what we do because it's not just rubbish we're picking up, it's dog bags, needles, dead animals, glass, everything. ""We don't want to see the town black, we just want a clean city but pay us fair to keep the city clean."" He said he was hopeful that a deal could be struck. ""But they're talking and talking and talking - how much is there to talk about? Just sort something out and get us back to work, get the streets clean again and get us back to normal."" Unions are seeking an agreement similar to the one made to council workers in England, which included a Â£1,925 flat rate pay offer. They say that offering a percentage pay rise would mean the most money would go to the best paid staff. The bin strike began in Edinburgh on 18 August, in the midst of festival season, after the unions rejected aninitial pay offer equivalent to a 3.5% increase. It escalated last week when refuse workers at a further 20 local authorities, including Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, walked out despite a revised 5% offer. Monday is the last full day of the current bin strike in Edinburgh but action is due to last until Wednesday in some other places. Fresh strikes are due to start next week.Â Cosla had described it as ""one of, if not the best offer in decades for Scottish local government workers"" with some workers getting an overall 7.36% increase. The Scottish government has given an additional Â£140m to councils to help fund a pay increase for staff. But the unions - Unite, Unison and GMB - are calling for more funding from the government to pay for an improved offer. And they have refused a government request to suspend strikes while negotiations are held with Cosla. The council unions sense they are in a very strong negotiating position. The strike is having a major effect on refuse collections in much of Scotland and leaving town and city centres filthy. The threat of a second strike in just over a week means these scenes could be repeated. This is something nobody wants to see happen. The unions want a ""flat cash offer"" rather than a percentage pay rise. This means everybody would get the same pay rise but the most benefit would go to the lowest paid. A straightforward percentage rise would mean that senior staff would get the most.

"A castle built under the command of Sir Arthur Chichester in the early 1600s was destroyed by fire a century later The history of Belfast can be told through many of its street names and buildings, much of it reflecting the city's industrial heritage and Victorian boom. But in one block, under the feet of shoppers, there is a story which dates back several hundred years. Castle Lane, Castle Arcade, Castle Place and Castle Buildings. Each pays tribute to the site of not one, but three Belfast castles, and archaeologists believe their foundations and artefacts could still lie below the surface. Part of the area is the former British Homes Stores (BHS) site, which is now to be converted into a complex of leisure and retail units. It will be called The Keep, a nod by developers to a past which was first referenced in 1262. Then it was an Anglo-Norman castle, believed to consist of an earthen mound, similar to mottes that remain visible in townlands such as Dundonald. It was a ""critical part of the medieval Norman settlement of Belfast"", striding the Farset River, which we now know as High Street, archaeologist RuairÃ­ Ã Baoill told BBC News NI. However, the site was destroyed in the 1300s, as power shifted to the Gaelic lords in Ireland, such as the Clandeboye O'Neills. The O'Neills in turn built a new castle, a ""strategic base"", Mr Ã Baoill explained. ""We know there was a castle there because there are references to it being attacked in the 1400s and the 1500s in both Irish and English histories and it's actually shown in two maps,"" he said. Medieval burials have also been documented in Cornmarket, an area which is now home to shops, cafes and buskers. 'The Keep' development site has referenced the castle in its promotional material According to Queen's University academic Dr Colm Donnelly, the O'Neill castle would have looked like a tower house, ""a small building, maybe four storeys high"", with rooms stacked on top of one another, connected by a spiral staircase. Similar stone towers from this period have survived, such as Audley's Castle and Kilclief Castle, close to Strangford. ""They were abandoned by and large in the 17th century, but they survive in the Irish landscape,"" Dr Donnelly said. The Clandeboye O'Neill building is believed to have resembled tower houses such as the 15th century Kilclief Castle, near Strangford ""They're really well constructed, but they're not immune from the forces of nature, such as frost getting into the walls."" This second Belfast castle was also replaced, but not entirely. ""At the end of the 16th century the Gaelic lords went into revolt and they were defeated by the forces of Queen Elizabeth I, one of whom was Arthur Chichester,"" Mr Ã Baoill said. ""He was given land all over the place, including the town of Belfast."" The Chichester castle features prominently to the top right of Thomas Phillips' map of Belfast in 1685 A report by the plantation commissioners in 1611 gives an account of shops being built in the new Chichester town, with 120,000 bricks being used by masons. Among the writings is a reference to the old ""decayed"" castle, the O'Neill building, part of which was retained and linked to the new Chichester castle via a staircase. The third castle survived for a century, but burnt down in 1708, killing four people, including three sisters of the 4th Earl of Donegall. The Plantation of Ulster explained It can be seen in a map of Belfast in 1685, however, along with the city's walls, which were ground-made ramparts that partly enclosed the town. ""It was smack in the centre of Belfast, around Cornmarket and Castle Arcade,"" Mr Ã Baoill said. ""Underground are the remains of at least two castles side by side, and possibly the Anglo-Norman one as well, but it's really frustrating because you can't see them."" ""Underground they're safe,"" he added. Due to the risk of flooding in Belfast, Mr Ã Baoill said archaeologists believed few of the city centre's buildings have deep basements, meaning there is a possibility that ""substantial archaeological remains"" exist across the area. The castles, off modern Castle Place, were built at a site of strategic importance, according to RuairÃ­ Ã Baoill Historian Dr Jim O'Neill agreed and explained a shallow trench he once excavated in Waring Street revealed centuries of buildings had been layered on top of each other, indicating that the castles' remains could exist mere metres underground. He said it is believed the medieval tower house contained masonry vaulting. ""If you had a limitless budget and luck on your side, you should find this large brick structure with a masonry core, which would be astounding,"" he detailed. ""It would be astonishing to find that and then, of course, associated with that the remains of domestic life from that time."" The planned redevelopment of the BHS site has been limited to ""areas of previous ground disturbance"", the Department for Communities told BBC News NI, with the need for an archaeological assessment ""likely to be minimal or avoided entirely"". It added, however, the area was recognised as having a ""heightened archaeological potential within the historic core of Belfast"". RuairÃ­ Ã Baoill (red jacket) has previously carried out excavations in Castle Lane in 1983 The department's Historic Environment Division (HED), which advises on the potential archaeological impact on planning decisions, highlighted the history of the location to Belfast City Council, which approved the project. The council said the planning conditions ""ensure appropriate mitigation of any archaeological impacts of development"". Dr O'Neill said the castles had always been of great interest to archaeologists and that local experts would like to excavate in the wider area. ""There's always that possibility, that frisson of excitement that we might get gold in terms of the archaeology of Belfast,"" he said. RuairÃ­ Ã Baoill added there remained a ""massive interest"" from Belfast people too in the city's history as more resources are made available to tell its story online. ""It's frustrating you can't see it [the castle], but just because you can't see it, it doesn't mean it isn't there,"" he said. ""There are hundreds of years of history back to the Anglo-Normans in the city centre, there's thousands of years in the hills around Belfast. ""We have a really really interesting past, a much longer past than sometimes people believe.""

"Arctic Monkeys have headlined Reading and Leeds twice before, in 2009 and 2014 Arctic Monkeys slipped a new tune in among some old favourites during a career-spanning headline set to close Leeds Festival on Sunday evening. ""Hello Leeds, you're looking well,"" smiled singer Alex Turner, to legions of adoring fans in their home county. The gigs at Leeds and Reading marked their first in the UK for four years. Fellow Sheffield co-headliners Bring Me the Horizon brought out Doncastrian Yungblud as Bramham Park was turned into a cathedral of Yorkshire music. After rap had reigned supreme on Saturday, Sunday was all about rock 'n' roll (baby) and the return of the prodigal sons, fresh back from festival dates in Europe, drew the biggest and most vocal crowd of the whole weekend by some distance. From the opening strains of Do I Wanna Know? (which found their frontman riffing on a teardrop guitar) to Matt Helders hitting the hell out of his drumkit during the haunting Pretty Visitors and their collective falsetto for Knee Socks; the nowadays expanded High Green outfit demonstrated their Transatlantic appeal. In the middle of a set that plucked from slick rock-pop beats and old indie sleaze bangers from their six number one albums, Turner and co also performed the unreleased I Ain't Quite Where I Think I Am - a funk/soul-era Bowie-esque track which gave a glimpse of their upcoming LP, The Car. Most bands could not get away with road testing fresh material on the biggest of stages, but then the Arctic Monkeys are not most bands, especially around these here parts. Frontman Alex Turner later threw off his jacket, put down his guitar and put on his shades to sing Their newer stuff, including the title track from their divisive left field space pop/jazz last album Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino, was greeted with warm applause. But it was the arrival of the rapid-fire nightclub queueing anthem From the Ritz to the Rubble that saw it all kick off, as flares were lit by fans in the frenzied crowd. The group then unleashed a series of big singalong hits like I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor, 505 and finale RU Mine? ""Thanks for having us Leeds,"" said Turner, from behind his night shades. ""It means a lot to us."" The evolution of the Monkeys from local indie lads to international showmen, with Turner directing the audience with the occasional line or action, has been a fascinating thing for regulars at this festival to follow. The 36-year-old songwriter recently toldThe Big Issue,external""you don't feel the need to prove yourself as much"" after 15 years in the spotlight, and he and his bandmates seemed confident and relaxed in familiar surroundings on their return. Oli Sykes of Bring Me the Horizon got the mosh pit going Remarkably, on one of the biggest nights in Yorkshire's recent rock history, Bring Me the Horizon frontman Oli Sykes actually went to the same school as the Arctic Monkeys - Stocksbridge High. ""It might not be that mad for them but it's mad for me that we're here doing this with one of our favourite bands in the world,"" he said on stage. ""This is next level simulation stuff."" The metal rockers roared their way through tracks like Drown and Throne during a high-octane, mosh pit inducing co-headliner set. Screaming his lungs out for the most part, singer Sykes declared: ""This is as close to a homecoming gig as it gets"". He thanked fans for helping him through when he ""nearly died a good few times"", referring to his past drug and mental health issues. In a rare softer moment, Sykes, who like Turner has a Yorkshire white rose tattoo, paused to say a quick hello to the locals in customary fashion. ""I feel like I haven't had chance to say eh up yet,"" he said. ""Eh up!"" The crowd returned the favour, and cries of ""Yorrrkshire!"" came from all angles, including from the stage. The baton was then passed to the next generation, as Yungblud - succeeding Ed Sheeran as the band's special guest from the night before at Reading - joined Sykes et al for a head-banging rendition of their collaboration Obey, and a second round of ""Yorrrkshire!""s was ordered by the young star. One man near me yelled ""Barnsley!"" while another raised him a ""Hebden Bridge!"" Wolf Alice may not be from the country's biggest county but they once again showed on Sunday why they seem destined for the top slot one day, while Fontaines DC did their burgeoning reputation no harm either. The Sherlocks opened up for their fellow south Yorkshire musicians Another band whoarefrom south Yorkshire, The Sherlocks were given ""the graveyard shift"", as singer Kiaran Crook put it on stage, opening one of the main stages at midday. Crook and his brother and drummer Brandon told us they were blown away that so many (likely hungover) people had dragged themselves out of their tents to see them. The siblings were 11 and 14, respectively when the Arctic Monkeys first blew up in the mid-noughties and said they ""had a massive influence on us when we were just finding our feet"". They recalled being shocked when Helders and his family turned up to watch them perform at a gig in Los Angeles, and said they intended to go find him just as soon as our interview was over. While several of Sunday's acts won't have too far to go to get home to their families, many festival-goers will wake up on Monday morning with a mission on their hands. This year, Music Declares Emergency hosted it's first eco camps at Reading and Leeds, where campers are rewarded for agreeing to leave the campsite as they found it on departure. Claire O'Neill from A Greener Festival, an organisation that helps events improve sustainability told the BBC taglines and hashtags like ""#NoLeedsOnADeadPlanet"" can ""really help to tie in the messages that can be quite complicated into something quite simple and direct"". She urged punters to take their re-usable tents home -many left theirs last year- and to reduce traffic pollution by taking public transport or travelling in vehicles that are as full as possible, while calling on festivals to collaborate with local authorities and the government to improve infrastructure going forwards. A spokesman for the Department of Transport told the BBC the government was ""going further and faster than ever before to achieve a net zero future"". Rou Reynolds of Enter Shikari put in an impassioned display Enter Shikari, whose recent track Elegy For Extinction addressed the threat of climate change, backed this year's scheme and appealed to the crowd's better nature during their energetic set on Sunday afternoon. The St Albans rock band told the BBC backstage they once completed a whole tour driving in a van powered by chip oil, instead of petrol.

"Facade lighting of the Frauenkirche, Church of Our Lady, is switched off to save energy in Dresden, Germany European Union countries will face five to 10 terrible winters if nothing is done to reduce gas prices, Belgium's energy minister says. Tinne Van der Straeten said gas prices should be frozen and not used to dictate the price of electricity. EU states have been struggling with huge energy price hikes since key gas supplier Russia invaded Ukraine in February, triggering sanctions. Countries backing Ukraine are trying to cut imports of Russian gas and oil. Russia, which supplied the EU with 40% of its gas last year, has in turn restricted supplies. As well as gas, electricity prices have reached record highs. Natural gas is still widely used to generate electricity. Because gas prices have risen, this costs more. Significantly, this price is used when buying electricity wholesale even when it comes from much cheaper renewable resources. ""We have to stop this madness that is happening right now on energy markets,"" Austria's Chancellor Karl Nehammer said. ""We cannot let [Russian President Vladimir] Putin determine the European electricity price every day,"" he added. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also criticised the method used to price electricity being sold on the EU market. Speaking to reporters in Slovenia, she said the bloc was preparing ""structural"" emergency reforms that would tackle high costs - but did not give further details. Can the world cope without Russian gas and oil? Germany - the largest importer of Russian gas in 2020 - has been racing to bolster its gas reserves before winter despite Russia cutting deliveries. Its aim is to fill its gas capacity to 85% by October. It has implemented energy-saving measures to do so. Economy Minister Robert Habeck said such measures - along with buying gas from alternative suppliers - had enabled Germany to fulfil its goal sooner than anticipated. He estimated that the 85% target could be reached by the start of September. Belgium's Prime Minister Alexander de Croo last week warned that people should ""hope for the best and prepare for the worst"". And the French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne told business leaders on Monday to submit energy-saving plans by next month - otherwise there could be rationing.

"There has been a big fall in the number of chain stores shutting across Britain, new figures show. Closures in the first six months of 2022 dropped by a third compared with the first half of last year, accountancy firm PwC said. Shop openings are still below pre-Covid levels, but closures are now at their lowest level for seven years. PwC said the shock of the pandemic had ""eased"" but warned that high inflation will hit the retail sector. The firm produced the research in partnership with the Local Data Company (LDC), which tracks over 3,000 locations, including High Streets, retail parks and shopping centres in England, Wales and Scotland. ""The good news is that we're back on High Streets, there are more people out shopping and eating,"" said Kien Tan, director of retail strategy at PwC. ""But the bad news is inflation hangs over us. It will affect shoppers in their pocket. But it will also affect businesses in terms of higher bills to pay. So there could be more closures to come,"" said Mr Tan. Consumer confidence hits record low as prices soar Why are prices rising so quickly? For now though, the figures are heading in the right direction. The analysis covers businesses with more than five outlets and includes everything from retail and hospitality to gyms, banks and hairdressers. It does not include independent traders. More than 6,000 stores closed in the first half of this year, but the numbers are sharply down on the previous 12 months. Store openings are still lacklustre and below pre-pandemic levels, resulting in an overall loss of more than 2,200 outlets. That is an average closure rate of 12 stores a day, although it is the smallest number of net closures in five years. Lucy Stainton, commercial director at the LDC, said the trends seen were ""hugely varied"". ""Although it has been over two years since the start of the pandemic, we are still yet to define our 'new normal' which is having a sustained impact on city centre locations, with many new openings being focused on smaller market towns and local High Streets as people continue to work from home. ""City centres are further hampered by both train strikes and airport travel disruption reducing tourist numbers,"" she added. The types of closures is changing, too. In the first half of last year, more than 1,000 clothing shops disappeared as the pandemic pushed a wave of big names, like Philip Green's Arcadia group, over the edge. This time round, it is betting shops, banks and charity shops that are declining the most. ""Our High Streets are still changing quite dramatically and they will continue to evolve. Banking and betting can all be done online. Restaurant chains are actually back in growth for the first time in five years and that's because we can't replace that kind of eating and drinking at home,"" said PwC's Mr Tan. Leisure operators can benefit from spaces that retailers have vacated, says Nick Collins Nick Collins, chief executive of hospitality business Loungers, says changes in the property market are helping his company expand. The firm was founded in 2002 and has two brands, Cosy Club and Lounge, offering all-day cafe-bar and restaurant dining. It now has 203 sites across England and Wales and its latest outlet opened in Canterbury three weeks ago, replacing a home and haberdashery shop. ""We've been looking at the city for four or five years. And we're really pleased to be open,"" Mr Collins says. As retailers have moved out, he has been seizing the chance to move in, nabbing sites he would not have had a chance of securing a decade ago. And the rents are usually better, too. ""As banks and retailers like Dorothy Perkins have come out of the High Street, these units are prime pitch locations right in the centre of the High Street, benefiting from strong footfall going past all day and through the evening. That's giving leisure operators like us a great opportunity."" Cosy Club's newest outlet opened in Canterbury earlier this month The business has gone from strength to strength, he says, and hopes to open around 30 sites this year in smaller, regional locations. But do the economics still stack up, given the ""cost-of-doing business"" crisis facing the sector? Potentially ruinous energy bills and a collapse in discretionary spending could make this a bleak midwinter. He says that Loungers is ""well set"" to weather the economic storm. For instance, the company has long-term hedging contracts for energy in place for its existing sites until 2024. But he is fearful for other less well-capitalised firms. ""It's a very, very challenging time to be operating in the leisure sector at the moment. Most operators have seen a four, five-fold increase in their energy costs. And for many businesses, they won't be able to survive that.
