"This video can not be played The three-carriage train made the journey across the Kerch Strait to Taman in Russia President Vladimir Putin has heralded the opening of a railway bridge to the Russian-annexed Crimea peninsula by posing in the driver's cab and praising construction workers. But theopening of the railway was immediately condemned by the European Union,externalas ""another violation"" by Russia of Ukraine's sovereignty and territory. Russia's 19km (12-mile) bridge to Crimea first opened in May last year. President Putin marked that occasion by driving a lorry over it. On Monday he asserted that millions of cars had already crossed the bridge and said the rail link ""was a big deal as well"", with plans to carry 14 million passengers and 13 million tonnes of freight in 2020. Until the bridge was built, Russia had to rely on sea and air to supply the peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in February 2014 before annexing it througha referendum rejected by the United Nations as invalid,external. The $3.6bn (Â£2.8bn; â¬3.2bn) bridge was built by a close friend of the president, Arkady Rotenberg. Mr Rotenberg and several of his companies had EU and US sanctions imposed on them.

Russia's president said the Kerch Strait bridge, with its new rail link, would have an impact on Russia's economy as a whole. In a tweet, the presidency declared the bridge open to railway traffic. Mr Putin boarded a three-carriage train in the Crimean city of Kerch, stood in the cab beside the driver and sounded the horn, before sitting with Mr Rotenberg as well as Russian and local officials as they travelled across the strait to Taman in southern Russia. The direct train service is due to take 43 hours and 30 minutes Mr Putin told construction workers that there had only been three times in 145 years that the rail route from St Petersburg to Sevastopol in Crimea had been broken: during the Russian revolution, during World War Two and in 2014. The first train left St Petersburg on Monday afternoon carrying more than 500 people on the 2,500km trip to Sevastopol. What didUkraineand the EUsay? EU spokesman Peter Stano said not only was the Kerch bridge ""a continuation of [Russia's] forced integration of illegally annexed Crimea"", it also limited free passage for ships heading to Ukrainian ports in the Azov Sea. The EU has already banned imports of non-Ukrainian goods from Crimea or Sevastopol and banned European companies from investing there. European cruise ships are not allowed to dock in Crimea unless in emergency. Mr Putin told construction workers they had shown Russia could carry out large-scale infrastructure projects The Ukrainian president's office in Crimea also condemned the new link saying it showed a disregard by the Kremlin of ""the universally recognised principles and norms of international law"". Will a deal with Russia bring peace to Ukraine? Long-awaited talks aim to end Ukraine conflict Apple changes Crimea map to meet Russian demands Russia returns Ukrainian boats seized off Crimea However, the opening of the link comes against a backdrop of otherwise improving relations between the two neighbours. President Volodymyr Zelensky met Mr Putin earlier this month for their first international summit aimed at resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine. There are hopes that Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists will complete a prisoner exchange by the end of the month as part of efforts to reduce tensions. After Crimea was annexed by Russian, rebels armed with Russian weapons rose up against the Kyiv government. More than 13,000 people have died in the ensuing conflict that has lasted more than five and a half years. Moscow has always denied sending regular troops to help the separatists.

"The winning number for Spain's annual Christmas lottery was 26590 A Spanish TV reporter who told her colleagues live on air that she was ""not coming to work tomorrow"" while clutching a winning lottery ticket had only won a fraction of the total prize. Natalia Escudero, who works for public broadcaster RTVE, started screaming on camera - before later learning she had won just â¬5,000 ($5,550; Â£4,285). The Christmas lottery's top prize is â¬4m, but can be shared among winners. Ms Escudero later apologised over the way she reacted during the broadcast. She said she regretted behaving in such an ""emotional"" manner and wanted to explain her actions to viewers who ""felt cheated"". El Gordo: Winners celebrate share in world's richest draw Ms Escudero's response came after she was accused of a lack of professionalism over the footage, which was widely shared on social media. It showed her jumping for joy while champagne was sprayed into the air as it was announced that the winning number for the top prize in the Christmas lottery known as El Gordo (The Fat One) was 26590.

"PC Shazad Saddique's family said he ""had a real passion for the outdoors and helping others"". A policeman drowned after being sucked into a whirlpool during an adventure holiday in Scotland, an inquest heard. PC Shazad Saddique, 38, died while swimming near the Fairy Pools waterfall on the Isle of Skye on 19 July. Tourists including a French policeman pulled the father-of-three, of Oldham, Greater Manchester clear but they could not revive him. The Greater Manchester Police (GMP) officer's wife was expecting their fourth child at the time. Rochdale Coroner's Court heard PC Saddique, who was a student officer based in Ashton-under-Lyne,was involved in outreach work with local youthsto get them into the countryside. He had arranged the Scottish trip for 30 people including his brother and 13-year-old son. The court heard that he jumped into the water at Fairy Pools - a natural waterfall phenomenon in the Cuillin Mountain Range in Glen Brittle - with goggles, wetsuit and swimming shoes. He had been swimming for about an hour when tragedy struck. PC Shazad Saddique was also a keen runner who ran marathons around the world and hiked Family friend Temour Ahmed said: ""I heard people shouting and went to the pool I could see Shazad was unresponsive in the water. ""I tried to get into the water but there was a very strong undercurrent which was pulling my trousers down so I got out."" He added: ""It was looking like a whirlpool effect. ''Eventually we were able to get to Shazad from the water but sadly his lips where blue and he was totally unresponsive."" PC Saddique, who joined GMP in 2018, was praised by the coroner for being a ""role model"" Recording a conclusion of death by drowning Coroner Joanne Kearsley recorded a conclusion of death by drowning and said it was a ""very, very sad case"". She added: ''More likely than not he became caught up in a strong current which created a vortex effect."" The coroner also praised PC Saddique for touching ""the lives of many"". His family said he was ""the most selfless person you could ever hope to meet"". Their statement added: ""He was the best dad, and his wife and kids were his absolute world.''

"Boeing has fired its chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, in a bid to restore confidence in the firm after two deadly crashes involving its 737 Max plane. More than 340 people died in the disasters, prompting accusations that Boeing put profit before safety. Families of the victims welcomed Mr Muilenberg's resignation as overdue. But they said Boeing's decision to replace him with a long-time board member raised questions about its commitment to change. Boeing named David Calhoun, who has served on the firm's board since 2009 and is its current chairman, as chief executive and president. ""While the resignation of Mr Muilenburg is a step in the right direction, it is clear that the Boeing Company needs a revamp of its corporate governance,"" said Paul Njoroge, who lost his wife, three children and mother-in-law when Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed in March. Mr Calhoun ""is not the right person for the job"", he added. What went wrong in Boeing's cockpit? Boeing to temporarily halt 737 Max production in January US regulator knew of Boeing 737 crash risks Boeing 'is not a trustworthy company anymore' Zipporah Kuria, whose father was also killed on the Ethiopian Airlines flight, said Mr Muilenburg should have been replaced ""a long time ago"" but responsibility for the crashes is shared. ""I feel as though a lot more people should have resigned including the person who's becoming CEO,"" she told the BBC. Boeing has been under intense scrutiny since two 737 Max planes crashed within five months of each other, first in Indonesia and then in Ethiopia. The 737 Max fleet has been grounded worldwide since March. While the company had been hoping to have the best-selling jet back in the air by the end of this year, US regulators have made it clear that it would not be certified to return to the skies that quickly. The crash site of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 Last week,Boeing said it would halt production of the aircraft. Then on Friday, the company's reputation took another hit when its Starliner spacecraft suffered technical problems that prevented it from taking the right path to the International Space Station. Boeing's board said it had ""decided that a change in leadership was necessary to restore confidence in the company moving forward as it works to repair relationships with regulators, customers, and all other stakeholders"". Mr Calhoun, a private equity executive, will take over from 13 January. Lawrence Kellner, a board member since 2011, is to become non-executive chairman immediately. ""Under the company's new leadership, Boeing will operate with a renewed commitment to full transparency, including effective and proactive communication with the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration], other global regulators and its customers,"" it said. This video can not be played Senator says he ""would walk before I got on a 737 Max"" Despite the ouster, some of the firm's harshest critics in Washington said they still had questions about the firm's commitment to change. Senator Richard Bumenthal said: ""The company needs new leadership across the board who will take safety seriously."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Michael Stumo, who lost his daughter Samya Rose on the Ethiopian Airlines flight and has organised victims' families against Boeing, called the resignation a ""good first step toward restoring Boeing to a company that focuses on safety and innovation"". ""The next step is for several board members who are underperforming or unqualified to resign,"" he said. Air safety officials investigating the tragedies have identified an automated control system in the plane, known as MCAS, as a factor in both crashes. Boeing has said the MCAS software system, which relied on a single sensor, received erroneous data, which led it to override pilot commands and push the aircraft downwards. It has said it is fixing the software and has overhauled its review procedures. But US lawmakers, who are investigating the company, have said the firm was aware that the software system could be unreliable. They have accused the company of trying to hide the risks and rush the plane back into service. Dennis Muilenburg had faced calls or his resignation Congressman Peter DeFazio, who leads a committee investigating Boeing, had called for Mr Muilenburg's resignation in an interview with the New York Times, published over the weekend. In a statement on Monday,external, he said the shake-up was ""long overdue"". Mr Muilenburg first joined Boeing in 1985. He led the company's defence, space and security division prior to his appointment as chief executive in 2015. He was stripped of his role as chairman of Boeing's board of directors in October andlater agreed to give up his bonus. However, Boeing, including Mr Calhoun, had continued to express confidence in him. Dennis Muilenburg's departure was inevitable, although the timing was unexpected. Since the two accidents, he has faced intense criticism over the corporate culture that existed at Boeing on his watch, and over the company's relationship with regulators. Questions have been asked about how a seemingly flawed aircraft was allowed into service in the first place, and why it was allowed to continue flying after the first accident. There have been claims - emphatically denied by the company - that it prioritised profits and speed of production over safety. His response to the crisis has also come under fire. Although he insisted that Boeing ""owned"" its failures, he also repeatedly said that the crashes were the result of a chain of events. This was seen by some as an attempt to divert blame away from the aerospace giant. The final humiliation came last week, when Boeing announced it would have to suspend production of the 737 Max, because regulators had yet to clear the aircraft as safe to fly again. For months, Mr Muilenburg had insisted the plane would be back in the air by the end of the year. He had lost credibility, and the board decided he had to go.

"Warning: Graphic content I walked along a tree-lined street in a quiet area of Istanbul and approached a cream-coloured villa, decked with CCTV cameras. A year ago, an exiled Saudi journalist took the same journey. Jamal Khashoggi was caught on CCTV.  It would be the last image of him. He entered the Saudi consulate and was murdered by an assassination squad. But the consulate was bugged by Turkish intelligence - the planning and the execution were all recorded. The tapes have only been heard by very few people. Two of those people have now spoken exclusively to the BBC's Panorama programme. British barrister Baroness Helena Kennedy listened to Jamal Khashoggi's dying moments. ""The horror of listening to somebody's voice, the fear in someone's voice, and that you're listening to something live. It makes a shiver go through your body."" Baroness Helena Kennedy QC Kennedy made detailed notes of the conversations she heard between members of the Saudi hit squad. ""You can hear them laughing. It's a chilling business. They're waiting there knowing that this man is going to come in and he's going to be murdered and cut up."" Kennedy was invited to join a team headed by AgnÃ¨s Callamard, the UN's special rapporteur for extrajudicial killing. Callamard, a human rights expert, told me of her determination to use her own mandate to probe the killing, when the UN proved reluctant to mount an international criminal investigation. AgnÃ¨s Callamard, UN Special Rapporteur for Extrajudicial Killing It took her a week to persuade Turkish intelligence to let her and Kennedy, along with their Arabic translator, listen to the tapes. ""The intention clearly on the part of Turkey to give me access, was to help me prove planning and premeditation,"" she says. They were able to listen to 45 minutes, extracted from recordings made on two crucial days. This video can not be played British barrister Helena Kennedy and UN special rapporteur Agnes Callamard describe the Jamal Khashoggi secret tapes Jamal Khashoggi had been in Istanbul - a city where opponents of regimes across the Middle East have long sought refuge - for a few weeks before he was killed. The 59-year-old divorced father of four had recently become engaged to Hatice Cengiz, a Turkish academic researcher. They were hoping to build their life together in this cosmopolitan city, but to remarry, Khashoggi needed his divorce papers. On 28 September, he and Cengiz visited the Turkish municipal office but were told they needed to get the papers from the Saudi consulate. ""This was the last resort. He had to go and get those documents from the consulate for us to get officially married because he couldn't go back to his country,"" Cengiz tells me when I meet her in a cafe. Hatice Cengiz Khashoggi hadn't always been an outcast, exiled from his own country.  I met him 15 years ago at the Saudi embassy in London's Mayfair. He was then at the heart of the Saudi establishment - a smooth-talking aide to the ambassador. We discussed a recent terror attack by al-Qaeda. Khashoggi had known its Saudi leader, Osama bin Laden, for decades. Initially Khashoggi had some sympathy for al-Qaeda's aim to overthrow autocratic Middle Eastern regimes. But later, he spoke out against the group's atrocities as his views became more liberal and he championed democracy. Jamal Khashoggi with Jane Corbin in 2004 In 2007, he returned home to edit the pro-government newspaper al-Watan. But he was fired three years later for what he described as ""pushing the boundaries of debate within Saudi society"". By 2011, inspired by the events of the Arab Spring, Khashoggi was speaking out against what he saw as the repressive and autocratic Saudi regime. By 2017 he had been banned from writing and went into self-imposed exile in America. His wife was forced to divorce him. Khashoggi became a contributor for the Washington Post, for whom he wrote 20 hard-hitting columns in the year before he died. ""When he was an editor in the Kingdom he would cross red lines,"" says his friend David Ignatius, the Post's senior foreign affairs columnist and investigative journalist. ""What I saw with Jamal was that he kept getting himself in trouble by speaking his mind."" Much of Khashoggi's criticism was targeted at the new crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. MBS, as he is known, was admired by many in the West. He was seen as a reformer and moderniser with a new vision for his country. But at home in Saudi Arabia, he was cracking down on dissent and Khashoggi was highlighting it in the pages of the Post. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman This was not the image the crown prince wanted to project. ""I think that particularly aggravated the crown prince, and he kept asking his aides to do something about this Jamal problem,"" says Ignatius, who regularly visits Saudi and writes about its politics. In Istanbul, the Saudis were presented with an opportunity to ""do something"" about Khashoggi. On the day of his first visit to the consulate, Cengiz had to remain outside. She remembers Khashoggi coming out of the building with a smile on his face. He told her that officials had been surprised to see him and had offered him tea and coffee. ""He said there was nothing to be afraid of, he missed his country so much and breathing that familiar air had made him feel really good."" Khashoggi was told to come back in a few days. But as soon as he was gone, phone calls were being made back to Riyadh in Saudi Arabia - all recorded by Turkish intelligence. ""What was interesting about this phone call is that it referred to Mr Khashoggi as one of the persons that was being sought,"" says Callamard. The first call is believed to have alerted the powerful aide who ran MBS's so-called communications office - Saud al-Qahtani. ""Someone in the communication office had authorised the mission. It makes sense to see that reference to the communication office as being a reference to Saud al-Qahtani,"" she continues. ""He has been named directly in various other campaigns against individuals."" Saud al Qahtani Al-Qahtani had already been accused of involvement in the detention and torture of dissidents in Saudi, such as female activists who dared to drive before the ban was lifted, and high-profile individuals suspected of disloyalty. In his writings, Khashoggi had accused al-Qahtani of operating a ""blacklist"" for the crown prince. ""Qahtani began doing extraordinary services - secret black operations,"" says Ignatius, who has investigated the royal aide. ""That became part of his portfolio and he managed it with a particular ruthlessness."" There are recordings of at least four phone calls on 28 September between the consulate and Riyadh. These include conversations between the consul general and the head of security at the ministry of foreign affairs, who told him a top-secret mission - ""a national duty"" - was planned. There's no doubt in my mind this was a seriously, highly organised mission coming from the top,"" says Kennedy. ""This was not some flaky, maverick operation on the side."" On the afternoon of 1 October, three Saudi intelligence officers flew into Istanbul. It's known that two worked in the office of the crown prince. Callamard believes they were on a reconnaissance mission. ""They probably assess the consulate building, they determine what can and cannot be done."" On a quiet and shady terrace in Istanbul, overlooking the Bosphorus, I meet a former Turkish intelligence officer with 27 years' experience. Metin ErsÃ¶z is an expert on Saudi Arabia and its special operations missions. He says its intelligence services became more aggressive after Mohammed bin Salman became crown prince. Metin ErsÃ¶z ""They started the kidnapping operations and pressuring dissidents,"" he says. ""Khashoggi was late in recognising the threat and taking precautions and he would pay a heavy price for it."" In the early hours of 2 October, a private jet landed at Istanbul airport. On board were nine Saudis - including a forensic pathologist named Dr Salah al-Tubaigy. Dr Salah al-Tubaigy After probing their identities and backgrounds, Callamard believes this was the Saudi hit squad. ""The operation was conducted by state officials, they were acting in their official capacities,"" she says. ""Two of them had diplomatic passports."" ErsÃ¶z says that this kind of mission - a special operation - would have needed approval from either the Saudi King or the crown prince. The Saudis checked into the large and impersonal MÃ¶venpick Hotel, located within a few minutes' walk of the consulate. Just before 10:00, CCTV shows one of the hit squad entering the Saudi consulate. From listening to the tapes, Kennedy believes that Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb was the man who ran the operation. Mutreb was regularly seen travelling with the crown prince, discreetly in the background, close to him as part of his security detail. ""In the calls between the consul general and Mutreb, there's a reference to the fact that 'we received the information Khashoggi will be coming on Tuesday',"" says Kennedy. Later on the morning of 2 October, Khashoggi received a call to come to the consulate for his documents. As he and Cengiz walked towards the consulate, a macabre and shocking phone conversation was taking place inside between Mutreb and the forensic pathologist, Dr al-Tubaigy. ""He talks about how when he's doing autopsies. You can hear them laughing,"" Kennedy says. ""He says, 'I often play music when I'm cutting cadavers. And sometimes I have a coffee and a cigar at hand.'"" Then the tapes reveal the doctor knows what he is expected to do, according to Kennedy. ""It's the first time in my life, I will have to cut (up) pieces on the ground,"" she recalls him saying. ""Even if you are a butcher you hang the animal up to do so."" An upstairs office in the consulate had been made ready. The floor was covered in plastic sheeting. Local Turkish staff had all been given the day off. ""They speak aboutâ¦ when is Khashoggi to arrive, and they say, 'Has the sacrificial animal arrived?' That's how they refer to him,"" says Kennedy. She is reading to me from her notebook, horror in her voice. At 13:15, CCTV shows Khashoggi entering the consulate building. ""I remember we walked there hand-in-hand and when we arrived in front of the consulate, Jamal gave me his phones and said, 'See you later darling, wait for me here,'"" says Cengiz. Khashoggi knew his phones would be taken at the entrance and did not want the Saudis to access his private information. The tapes reveal that he is met by a reception committee and told that there is an Interpol warrant out for his arrest and he must return to Saudi Arabia. He is heard refusing to text his son to assure the family he is fine. The silencing of Jamal Khashoggi then begins. Watch The Khashoggi Murder Tapes onBBC iPlayer ""There was a point where you can hear Khashoggi moving from being a man who's a confident person, towards a sense of fear - rising anxiety, rising terror - and then knowing that something fatal is about to happen,"" says Kennedy. She continues: ""There's something absolutely horrifying about the voice changing. The cruelty of it comes across by listening to the tapes."" Callamard is not sure how aware Khashoggi was of the Saudis' plans: ""I don't know whether he thinks he could be killed, but he certainly thinks that they could try to abduct him. He is asking, 'Are you going to give me an injection?' to which he's being told 'Yes'."" Kennedy says she heard Khashoggi asking twice whether he is being kidnapped and then saying, 'How could this happen in an embassy?'"" ""The sounds that are heard after that point will tend to indicate that he's suffocated. Probably with a plastic bag over his head,"" says Callamard. ""His mouth was also closed - violently - maybe with a hand or something else."" Kennedy believes the forensic pathologist now takes over on the orders of the team leader. ""You hear a voice saying, 'Let him cut,' and it sounds like Mutreb. ""Then somebody shouting, 'It's over,' and someone else shouting, 'Take it off, take it off. Put this on his head. Wrap it.' I can only assume that they had removed his head."" For Cengiz, only half an hour had passed since Khashoggi left her outside the consulate. ""During that time, I was dreaming of my future - like how our wedding would be. We were planning a small ceremony,"" she says. About 15:00, CCTV shows consular vehicles leaving and arriving at the consul general's residence two streets away. Three men enter with suitcases and plastic bags. Callamard believes they may have contained parts of the body. A car later drives away. Khashoggi's body has never been found. What about the most disturbing detail reported at the time of the murder - the bone saw used to dismember the body? Kennedy says she did not hear the kind of grating noise she would have associated with that type of surgical instrument on the tape. But she says there was a low-level humming sound. Turkish intelligence officials believe this was the sound of the saw. At 15.53, CCTV shows two members of the hit squad leaving the consulate. I retraced their footsteps down the street past the cameras that detailed their route between the consulate and the heart of old Istanbul. One man is dressed in Khashoggi's clothes, but wearing different shoes. The other man, his face obscured by a hoodie, is carrying a white plastic bag. They head towards Istanbul's famous Blue Mosque. When they re-emerge, the man previously dressed in Khashoggi's clothes has changed. They hail a taxi back to their hotel, dumping the plastic bag - thought to contain Khashoggi's clothes - in a bin nearby, before going down into a subway and back to the MÃ¶venpick Hotel. ""There was a very large degree of planning used to give the impression that nothing harmful had happened to Mr Khashoggi,"" says Callamard. All this time, Cengiz was still waiting outside the consulate. ""I waited and waited and waited there past 15:30. Then, when I realised the consulate had closed, I started running towards it. I asked why Jamal didn't come out. A guard told me he didn't know what I was talking about."" At 16:41, Cengiz was desperate and phoned an old friend of Khashoggi's. He had given her the number in case he was ever in trouble. Dr Yasin Aktay is a member of Turkey's ruling party with contacts at the highest levels. ""I received a call from an unknown number, a really worried voice from a lady I didn't know,"" he says. ""She said, 'My fiance Jamal Khashoggi went into the Saudi consulate and didn't come out.'"" Dr Yasin Aktay Yasin swiftly called the head of Turkish intelligence and alerted the office of President Tayyip Erdogan. By 18:30, the members of the hit squad were on a private jet to Riyadh, less than 24 hours after they had arrived. The next day, the Saudi and Turkish governments issued contradictory statements about what had happened inside the consulate. Saudi Arabia insisted Khashoggi had left the consulate. The Turks said he was still inside. Turkish intelligence was already poring over the consulate recordings - including the calls made four days before Khashoggi disappeared. So did they know at that time that his life was in danger and, if so, why did they not warn him? ""I don't think they knew. There is no evidence that they were listening live to what was happening,"" says Callamard. ""This kind of intelligence is done on a regular basis, and it's only because there is a trigger that they may return to the tapes. It was only because Mr Khashoggi was killed and disappeared that they returned to the tape."" ErsÃ¶z tells me his former intelligence colleagues reviewed the tapes retrospectively and went through between 4,000 and 5,000 hours of material to find the key days and the 45 minutes presented to Callamard and Kennedy. Four days after Khashoggi was killed, another Saudi team arrived - claiming they had come to find out what had happened. Callamard believes they were really a clean-up team. For two weeks, the Saudis would not allow Turkish investigators to enter the consulate. ""By the time they were able to collect some evidence, there was nothing there, not even DNA evidence of Mr Khashoggi having been there,"" says Callamard. ""The only logical conclusion is that the place was thoroughly, forensically cleaned."" Turkish police at the Saudi consulate That evening, the Turkish authorities told the media that Khashoggi had been murdered in the Saudi consulate. ""Jamal really didn't deserve this, He deserved so much better,"" says Cengiz. ""The way they killed him, it killed all my hope in life."" The killing in Istanbul, inside an embassy with diplomatic immunity, put the Turkish authorities in a quandary. For weeks, despite mounting pressure from the Turks, the Saudis refused to admit the murder, saying first there had been ""a fist fight"" in the consulate and then claiming it was ""a rogue operation"". Protest outside the Saudi Embassy in the United States, six days after the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi The Turkish authorities' strategy was to leak some of what they knew to local and international press. They then invited representatives from the CIA and a few handpicked intelligence agencies, including MI6, to listen to the tapes, proving Khashoggi was murdered by Saudi state operatives. The CIA reportedly came to the conclusion there was ""medium to high certainty"" that Mohammad bin Salman had ordered the killing. They briefed Congressmen who were left in no doubt about the finding. In January, the Saudi government finally put 11 people on trial in Riyadh for the murder of Khashoggi, including Mutreb and Dr al-Tubaigy, but not the alleged mastermind - Saud al-Qahtani. He has not been indicted or even summoned to court to give evidence. I have been told he is being kept in seclusion away from everyone, including his own family, but is still in contact with the crown prince. Callamard's report for the UN Human Rights Council has reached a decisive conclusion. ""There is no indication under international law that this crime could be qualified under any other way but as a state killing,"" she says. Kennedy says the revelations of the Khashoggi murder tapes must be acted on. ""Something treacherous and terrible happened in that embassy. The international community has a responsibility to insist on a high-level judicial enquiry,"" she says. Turkey has demanded the extradition of those involved to face trial in Istanbul. But Saudi Arabia has refused. The Saudi government declined to give an interview to Panorama, but said it condemned the ""abhorrent killing"" and it was committed to holding the perpetrators accountable. It said that the crown prince had ""absolutely nothing to do"" with what it called a ""heinous crime"". Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman One year on, as we leave the cafe, I can see the pain still suffered by the woman left behind when her fiance's life was cut short so brutally. In her parting words to me, Hatice Cengiz warns of the true significance of the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. ""It's not only a tragedy for me - but for all humanity, all the people who think like Jamal and who took a stance like him.""

"Zipporah Kuria met with the European Aviation Safety Agency about the Boeing 737 Max Boeing is not a trustworthy company anymore, according to Zipporah Kuria, whose father was killed when a 737 Max plane crashed earlier this year. Ms Kuria, who met with Europe's aviation watchdog on Wednesday, said: ""I wouldn't even use the word trust anywhere near Boeing."" Boeing is fighting for its reputation while the 737 Max remains grounded. A company spokesman said: ""The safety of passengers and crews flying on our aircraft is our absolute priority."" He said: ""We are truly sorry and we continue to offer our deepest sympathies to the families and friends who lost loved ones in the accidents of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. ""We know we have a deep responsibility to everyone who flies on our airplanes to ensure that the 737 Max is one of the safest aircraft ever to fly."" Ms Kuria met with European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) along with other family members who lost loved ones, to gain reassurances that the Boeing 737 Max will not return to the skies until rigorous tests are carried out. The British woman's father, Joseph Waithaka, died with 156 others on board an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March. It was the second crash involving a Boeing 737 Max following the Lion Air disaster in Indonesia which killed all 189 people onboard. ""They are not trustworthy anymore - if they had been in the past,"" Ms Kuria said. What went wrong in Boeing's cockpit? Europe will not accept US verdict on 737 Max safety Boeing to temporarily halt 737 Max production in January She said the EASA's executive director Patrick Ky had reassured her that ""he would not be caving"" to either the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the US regulator, or Boeing in terms of reclassifying whether the 737 Max is safe for European air travel. Boeing will temporarily stop making the 737 Max in January Boeing is hoping that the FAA will allow the Max back into the air in the early part of next year but the FAA's close relationship with Boeing has been under intense scrutiny. It recently emerged thatthe FAA allowed the 737 Max to keep flying after the first disasterin October last year despite knowing there was a risk of further crashes. Ms Kuria said: ""I think the more discovery is done, the more reason we are finding not to trust [Boeing] when it comes to the 737 Max. ""There are so many things that were hidden that shouldn't have been, so many things that were bypassed that shouldn't have been and I think every time we sit down and have a hearing or hear from an aviation authority on documents of discovery we just find out how preventable the death of our loved ones was."" Mr Ky said that the European regulator will ""take their time to recertify"" the plane. Ms Kuria also said her safety concerns not only relate to the plane's automated flight control system which malfunctioned before both crashes but other critical safety systems on board the 737 Max. During the meeting, EASA said ""they would reassess all the critical safety systems that are on the 737 Max"", according to Ms Kuria.

"This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death On 2 October 2018, Jamal Khashoggi, a US-based journalist and critic of Saudi Arabia's government, walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where he was murdered. In the months that followed, conflicting narratives emerged over how he died, what happened to his remains, and who was responsible. Saudi officials said the journalist was killed in a ""rogue operation"" by a team of agents sent to persuade him to return to the kingdom, while Turkish officials said the agents acted on orders from the highest levels of the Saudi government. As a prominent Saudi journalist, he covered major stories, including the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the rise of the late al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, for various Saudi news organisations. For decades, the 59-year-old was close to the Saudi royal family and also served as an adviser to the government. But he fell out of favour and went into self-imposed exile in the US in 2017. From there, he wrote a monthly column in the Washington Post in which he criticised the policies of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the son of King Salman and Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler. In his first column for the Post in September 2017, Khashoggi said he had feared being arrested in an apparent crackdown on dissent overseen by the prince. The journalist who vanished into a consulate Read excerpts from some of his columns This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Khashoggi first visited the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 28 September 2018 to obtain a Saudi document stating that he was divorced, so that he could marry his Turkish fiancÃ©e, Hatice Cengiz. But he was told he would have to return to pick up the document and arranged to come back on 2 October. ""He did not believe that something bad could happen on Turkish soil,"" Ms Cengiz wrote in the Post. Ms Cengiz accompanied him to the entrance of the consulate on 2 October. He was last seen on CCTV footage entering the building at 13:14 local time. The journalist's fiancÃ©e, Hatice Cengiz, waited for him outside the consulate for hours Despite reassuring friends that he would not face any problems inside, he gave Ms Cengiz two mobile phones and told her to call an adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan if he did not come back out. She ultimately waited for more than 10 hours outside the consulate and returned the following morning when Khashoggi had still not reappeared. For more than two weeks, Saudi Arabia consistently denied any knowledge of Khashoggi's fate. Prince Mohammed told Bloomberg News that the journalist had left the consulate ""after a few minutes or one hour"". ""We have nothing to hide,"" he added. Who is Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman? Did Apple Watch record Khashoggi killing? But in a change of tune on 20 October, the Saudi government said a preliminary investigation by prosecutors had concluded that the journalist died during a ""fight"" after resisting attempts to return him to Saudi Arabia. Later, a Saudi official attributed the death to a chokehold. The Saudi consulate initially said Khashoggi had left after completing paperwork On 15 November, Saudi Arabia's deputy public prosecutor Shalaan al-Shalaan said the murder was ordered by the head of a ""negotiations team"" sent to Istanbul by the Saudi deputy intelligence chief to bring Khashoggi back to the kingdom ""by means of persuasion"" or, if that failed, ""by force"". Investigators concluded that Khashoggi was forcibly restrained after a struggle and injected with a large amount of a drug, resulting in an overdose that led to his death, Mr Shalaan said. His body was then dismembered and handed over to a local ""collaborator"" outside the consulate for disposal, he added. Five individuals had confessed to the murder, Mr Shalaan asserted, adding: ""[The crown prince] did not have any knowledge about it."" The Saudi public prosecution said in late September 2018 that a total of 31 individuals were investigated over the killing and that 21 of them were arrested. Five senior government officials were also sacked, including Deputy Intelligence Chief Ahmad Asiri and Saud al-Qahtani, a senior aide to Prince Mohammed. In January 2019, 11 individuals - who have not been named - were put on trial at the Riyadh Criminal Court in connection with Khashoggi's murder, and the public prosecutor sought the death penalty for five of them. This video can not be played Mohammed bin Salman is asked: ""Did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?"" Human Rights Watch said the trial, which took place behind closed doors, did not meet international standards and that authorities ""obstructed meaningful accountability"". In December 2019, the court sentenced five individuals to death for ""committing and directly participating in the murder of the victim"". Three others were handed prison sentences totalling 24 years for ""covering up this crime and violating the law"", while the remaining three were found not guilty. The public prosecution said Mr Asiri was tried but acquitted ""due to insufficient evidence"", while Mr Qahtani was investigated over the killing but not charged. At a news conference following the verdict, Shalaan al-Shalaan said the public prosecution's investigation had shown that ""the killing was not premeditated"". Ms Callamard dismissed that assertion as ""utterly ridiculous"" and said the trial represented ""the antithesis of justice"", from which the ""masterminds"" walked free. Khashoggi's son Salah met Saudi Arabia's king and crown prince weeks after the murder But Khashoggi's son Salah, who lives in Saudi Arabia, tweeted: ""We affirm our confidence in the Saudi judiciary at all levels, that it has been fair to us and that justice has been achieved."" In May 2020, Salah Khashoggi announced that he and his brothers were ""pardoning those who killed our father, seeking reward from God almighty"", accepting the public prosecution's contention that the murder was not premeditated. Four months later, the Riyadh Criminal Court commuted the death sentences handed to five of the defendants to 20 years in prison. The three others were given sentences of between seven and 10 years. The prosecution said the verdicts were final and that the criminal trial was now closed. Ms Cengiz said the ruling made ""a complete mockery of justice"". ""The Saudi authorities are closing the case without the world knowing the truth of who is responsible for Jamal's murder,"" she added. ""Who planned it, who ordered it, where is his body? These are the most basic and important questions that remain totally unanswered."" Turkish officials said that a team of 15 Saudi agents, assisted by three intelligence officers, arrived in Istanbul in the days before the murder, and that the group removed the security cameras and surveillance footage from the consulate before Khashoggi's arrival. Istanbul's chief prosecutor, Irfan Fidan, said on 31 October 2018 that the journalist was suffocated almost as soon as entered the consulate, and that his body was dismembered and destroyed. Writing in the Washington Post on 2 November, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared it had been established that Khashoggi ""was killed in cold blood by a death squad"" and ""that his murder was premeditated"". ""Yet there are other, no less significant questions whose answers will contribute to our understanding of this deplorable act"" he added. ""Where is Khashoggi's body? Who is the 'local collaborator' to whom Saudi officials claimed to have handed over Khashoggi's remains? Who gave the order to kill this kind soul? Unfortunately, the Saudi authorities have refused to answer those questions."" Mr Erdogan said he knew the order to kill Khashoggi ""came from the highest levels of the Saudi government"", but that he did ""not believe for a second that King Salman, the custodian of the holy mosques, ordered the hit"". In March 2020, the Istanbul chief prosecutor formally charged Saad al-Qahtani, Ahmad Asiri and 18 other Saudi nationals with murder. Prince Mohammed's two former aides were accused of ""instigating a premeditated murder with the intent of [causing] torment through fiendish instinct"". The others were charged with carrying out ""a premeditated murder with the intent of [causing] torment through fiendish instincts"". Saudi Arabia rejected Turkey's extradition request, so all 20 men were put on trial in absentia in Istanbul in July 2020. Court-appointed Turkish lawyers representing the defendants said their clients denied the charges. In November, the court accepted a second indictment adding another six Saudis to the case. A vice-consul and an attachÃ© were accused of ""premeditated murder with monstrous intent"". The four others were charged with destroying, concealing or tampering with evidence. A report released in June 2019 by Agnes Callamard, the special rapporteur, concluded that Khashoggi's death ""constituted an extrajudicial killing for which the state of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is responsible"". She also found there was ""credible evidence"" to warrant an investigation into Prince Mohammed and other high-level Saudi officials, and said the prince should be subject to the targeted sanctions already imposed by some UN member states against other named individuals allegedly involved in the killing. Ms Callamard said both the investigations into Khashoggi's death by Saudi Arabia and Turkey ""failed to meet international standards"". This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi's fiancÃ©e: ""We didn't say any goodbyes"" She called for the trial in Saudi Arabia of the 11 suspects to be suspended, saying it would ""not deliver credible accountability"". ""The trial is held behind closed doors; the identity of those charged has not been released nor is the identity of those facing the death penalty. At the time of writing, at least one of those identified as responsible for the planning and organising of the execution of Mr Khashoggi has not been charged,"" she noted. The Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Adel al-Jubeir, rejected the report, tweeting that it was ""nothing new"" and contained ""clear contradictions and baseless allegations which challenge its credibility"". ""The Saudi judiciary is the sole party qualified to deal with the Khashoggi case and works with full independence,"" he added. Saudi prince 'may be liable for Khashoggi death' In mid-November 2018, Turkey's government said it had shared audio recordings of the killing with Saudi Arabia, the US, the UK, Germany and France. While not officially made public, details of the recordings were included in Ms Callamard's report. The UN special rapporteur noted that she was not able to obtain copies of the recordings from Turkish intelligence or authenticate them. This video can not be played The Jamal Khashoggi secret tapes explained But in one recording, her report says, two Saudi officials are apparently heard discussing how to cut up and transport Khashoggi's body just minutes before the journalist entered the consulate. One is quoted as saying: ""The body is heavy. First time I cut on the ground. If we take plastic bags and cut it into pieces, it will be finished."" At the end of the conversation, the other asks whether ""the sacrificial animal"" has arrived. A later conversation recorded inside the consul general's office purportedly features Khashoggi being told by officials: ""We will have to take you back. There is an order from Interpol. Interpol requested you to be sent back. We are coming to get you."" The reports quotes Khashoggi as replying that ""there isn't a case against me. I notified some people outside; they are waiting for me; a driver is waiting for me."" At 13:33 local time, he is heard saying: ""There is a towel here. Are you going to give me drugs?"" Someone responds: ""We will anaesthetise you."" The report says the conversation was followed by sounds of a struggle, during which people are heard saying, ""Did he sleep?"", ""He raises his head,"" and ""Keep pushing."" Later, there are sounds of movement, heavy panting, and plastic sheets. Turkish intelligence identified the sound of a saw at 13:39, but Ms Callamard said she and her delegation could not make out the sources of the sounds they heard. Investigators searched Belgrad forest for Khashoggi's body Assessments of the recordings by intelligence officers in Turkey and other countries suggest Khashoggi could have been injected with a sedative and then suffocated using a plastic bag, according to the special rapporteur. Turkish officials were not granted access to the Saudi consulate for DNA testing until more than two weeks after the incident. The special rapporteur said there was credible evidence that crime scenes had been ""thoroughly, even forensically, cleaned"" before investigators arrived. Among the areas searched for Khashoggi's remains are the Belgrad forest, which a consular attachÃ© visited on 1 October 2018, and the coastal town of Yalova, the location of a farmhouse allegedly owned by a Saudi national. None of those put on trial have been identified by Saudi prosecutors, but the report by the UN special rapporteur named them, citing information from ""various governments' sources"". According to the report, the five facing the death penalty were Fahad Shabib Albalawi; Turki Muserref Alshehri; Waleed Abdullah Alshehri; Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, an intelligence officer who the US says worked for the crowd prince's aide Saud al-Qahtani; and Dr Salah Mohammed Tubaigy, a forensic doctor with the interior ministry. The other six defendants were Mansour Othman Abahussain; Mohammed Saad Alzahrani; Mustafa Mohammed Almadani; Saif Saad Alqahtani; Muflih Shaya Almuslih, reportedly a member of the consulate staff; and Ahmad Asiri, the former deputy intelligence chief. According to interviews conducted by the special rapporteur, the defendants' lawyers argued during a court hearing in January that they were ""state employees and could not object to the orders of their superiors"". Turkish officials identified these men as Saudis suspected of involvement in Khashoggi's murder Three defendants allegedly said that Khashoggi ""started screaming, so they covered his mouth to prevent him from making noise, which accidentally killed him"", according to the report. Ms Callamard noted that she had heard no screaming in the audio recordings from the consulate. Mr Asiri was cited as telling the court that he had ""never ordered the use of force"" to bring Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia. Nine of the defendants named by Ms Callamard were previously identified by Turkish officials as members of the 15-strong team of agents sent to Istanbul. Most of the agents arrived at and departed from the city's airport by private or commercial jet the same day as Khashoggi's killing. CCTV footage appears to show vehicles driving them to the consulate, and two hours after Khashoggi's arrival, some of them heading to the consul's residence. The special rapporteur said three men were filmed entering the residence with what seemed like plastic trash bags, and at least one rolling suitcase. Khashoggi's killing was internationally condemned and caused a diplomatic crisis between Saudi Arabia and some of its closest allies, including the US. After the murder was confirmed by the Saudis, then US President Donald Trump described it as the ""worst cover-up in history"". However, he defended US ties to the kingdom, a key trading partner. Analysing Trump's Saudi statement line by line Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West This response was widely derided by senators in Congress, who pointed the finger at Prince Mohammed. According to US media reports, the CIA - whose director heard the consulate audio recordings - concluded with ""medium to high confidence"" that Prince Mohammed ordered Khashoggi's killing. Mr Trump denied that and his administration defied a legal requirement to release an unclassified report identifying anyone implicated in ""the directing, ordering or tampering of evidence"" in the case. His successor, Joe Biden, has said he will declassify the report. The US, Canada, France and the UK all levied sanctions against 18 Saudis allegedly linked to the killing. The Saudi crown prince was not among them. Germany, Finland and Denmark were among the European nations to cancel arms deals with Saudi Arabia after the killing.

"Prince Charles met rescue workers on the outskirts of the South Yorkshire village of Fishlake Prince Charles has been visiting South Yorkshire to meet people affected by last month's floods. He met firefighters, police officers and soldiers at the village of Fishlake, near Doncaster, and toured the worst-affected areas. Hundreds of home were evacuated and businesses were affected when a month's worth of rain fell in 24 hours, causing the River Don to burst its banks. About 200 Army personnel helped support the flood effort. The prince has made a donation to the flood relief fund, Clarence House said. Charles shared a joke with some of the residents of Fishlake during his walkabout Asked by a reporter about his father the Duke of Edinburgh as he walked into the village, Charles said: ""He's being looked after very well in hospital. ""At the moment that's all we know."" The prince spent two hours in the village chatting to many of the locals lining the streets and looking inside some of the badly damaged homes. Many of the villagers gathered outside the Old Butchers cafe, which owners Louise and Claire Holling turned into a relief centre during worst of the flooding. The prince spent two hours touring the village of Fishlake The royal visitor praised the pair when they turned up later at the village hall, serving refreshments for locals and dignitaries who had gathered to meet him. As he left, Charles told the crowds: ""I hope you've been in and tried those cakes. They're amazing those two, aren't they?"" Charles also had a beer at the Hare and Hounds pub, which was at the centre of the flood relief effort in the village. The prince visited the Hare and Hounds pub which acted as a relief hub during the flooding Angie and Scott Godfrey, who run the pub, made sure stranded residents were fed by sending round hot meals on boats. Mr Godfrey said to Charles outside the pub: ""We were just going to get you a pint when you got here. You might have needed one by this time."" The prince replied ""I do"" and went inside for a quick sip of a half of bitter before moving on to St Cuthbert's Church, which also acted as a relief hub.

"The pack of cards cost Â£1.50 from Tesco A factory in China has denied it used forced labour after a six-year-old girl found a message from workers inside a Tesco charity Christmas card. The card supplier, Zhejiang Yunguang Printing, told China's Global Times it had""never done such a thing"",external. Tesco halted production at the factory over the message, allegedly written by prisoners claiming they were ""forced to work against our will"". The Chinese foreign ministry said the allegation was ""a farce"". Speaking to the nationalist newspaper Global Times on Monday, a spokesman for the card supplier said: ""We only became aware of this when some foreign media contacted us. We have never done such a thing. ""Why did they include our company's name?"" Girl's find in Tesco card halts China production A spokesman for Tesco said it had launched an on-site investigation at the factory on Friday ""before suspending the site and communicating this decision to factory management over the weekend"". He added: ""Our product team have also spoken to the supplier to communicate this decision."" The supermarket added that it has further meetings scheduled for this week with representatives from both the factory and the supplier, and that it has not placed any orders from the site since October. The message -first reported by the Sunday Times,external- was found by Florence Widdicombe, who was writing cards to her school friends. She found that one of them - featuring a kitten with a Santa hat - had already been written in. In block capitals, it said: ""We are foreign prisoners in Shanghai Qingpu prison China. Forced to work against our will. Please help us and notify human rights organisation."" Florence Widdicombe, aged six, says finding the message made her feel shocked The message in the card asked whoever found the message to contact Peter Humphrey, a British journalist who was himself imprisoned there four years ago. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters on Monday the allegation was ""a farce"" created by Mr Humphrey. ""Shanghai's Qingpu prison has no such foreign prisoners undergoing forced labour,"" Mr Shuang said. Zhejiang Yunguang Printing's factory manager, Shu Yunjia, told the BBC it had not outsourced any of its work to the Qingpu prison. By Robin Brant, BBC China correspondent China's denial is a specific one: Shanghai's Qingpu prison ""does not at all have...forced labour by foreign convicts"". The key word there is 'forced'. The convicts who allegedly wrote the note found in the card claimed they were being forced to work against their will. But China's foreign ministry is likely making that denial in light of article 69 of the country's Prison Law, which stipulates that ""criminals with working capacity must participate in labour"". Making Christmas cards - even ones destined to raise money for UK charities - is almost certainly the least worst outcome in China's penal system. A politicised judiciary, controlled by the Communist Party, is one step on a road for some prisoners which can involve disappearing, torture and forced confession. Forced hard labour has been used as a tool of punishment and political persecution. Florence, from Tooting in south London, said she was writing her ""sixth or eighth card"" when she saw ""somebody had already written in it"". ""It made me feel shocked,"" she said, adding that when it was explained to her what the message meant she felt ""sad"". This video can not be played Florence Widdicombe was writing the cards last Sunday when she discovered the message A Tesco spokeswoman previously said: ""We were shocked by these allegations and immediately halted production at the factory where these cards are produced and launched an investigation."" Tesco added that it would de-list Zhejiang Yunguang if it was found to have used prison labour. The supermarket said it has a ""comprehensive auditing system"" to ensure suppliers are not exploiting forced labour. The factory in question was checked only last month and no evidence of it breaking the ban on prison labour was found, it said. Sales of charity Christmas cards at the company's supermarkets raise Â£300,000 a year for the British Heart Foundation, Cancer Research UK and Diabetes UK. Tesco has not received any other complaints from customers about messages inside Christmas cards. The message in the card urged the recipient to contact Mr Humphrey, who was formerly imprisoned at Qingpu on what he described as ""bogus charges that were never heard in court"". After the Widdicombe family sent him a message via Linkedin, Mr Humphrey said he then contacted ex-prisoners who confirmed inmates had been forced to work. This video can not be played Peter Humphrey: ""I think I know who it was but I will never disclose the name"" Mr Humphrey told the BBC that the cell block of foreign prisoners has about 250 people in it, who are living a ""very bleak daily life"" with 12 prisoners per cell. He added that when he was in there, manufacturing labour work was voluntary - to earn money to buy soap or toothpaste - but that work has now become compulsory. Mr Humphrey told the BBC: ""I spent two years in captivity in Shanghai between 2013 and 2015 and my final nine months of captivity was in this very prison in this very cell block where this message has come from. ""So this was written by some of my cellmates from that period who are still there serving sentences. ""I'm pretty sure this was written as a collective message. Obviously one single hand produced this capital letters' handwriting and I think I know who it was, but I will never disclose that name."" Oxfam alleges UK supermarket supply chain abuse âThe SOS in my Halloween decorationsâ It is not the first time that prisoners in China have reportedly smuggled out messages in products they have been forced to make for Western markets. In 2012, Julie Keith from Portland, Oregon, discoveredan account of torture and persecutionby a prisoner who said he was forced to manufacture the Halloween decorations she had purchased. And in 2014, Karen Wisinska from Co Fermanagh in Northern Ireland,found a note on a pair of Primark trousersreading: ""Our job inside the prison is to produce fashion clothes for export.

"A backlog of hundreds of tonnes of clinical and human waste piled up at a failed disposal firm for the last 12 months is being cleared. Healthcare Environmental Services (HES) stopped trading last December after becoming embroiled in awaste stockpiling scandal. The collapse left about 300 tonnes of waste at the firm's plant in Shotts, North Lanarkshire. But now HES liquidator BDO has said work to clear this backlog has begun. BDO said a licence has been agreed with Cliniwaste Ltd to operate the Shotts site, and two more in Nottingham and Newcastle, with an option for the Glasgow-based firm to also buy them. Specialist officers from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency have been working with BDO will oversee the clearance operation. It comes as BBC Scotland can also reveal the firm appointed to take over the contract to remove waste from every hospital, GP surgery, dental practice and pharmacy in Scotland will not be operating at full capacity until April next year. Tradebe Healthcare was due to start removing hazardous waste in April this year butthis was delayedand the Spanish-owned firm is now implementing the deal on a phased basis. This means that some NHS contingency measures,which have cost more than the previous contract, will stay in place until then. Waste was pictured piling up at health centres in Coatbridge, Kilsyth and Cumbernauld in January but has since been collected Monica Lennon MSP, Scottish Labour's health spokeswoman, said: ""It's encouraging that steps are now being taken to clear the mountain of stockpiled waste from the Shotts yard. ""The local community has had to endure this blight since 2018 and it's important the waste is removed quickly and safely. ""The clinical waste scandal has cost the NHS in Scotland millions of pounds and it is staggering that emergency payments to private firms will continue well into 2020."" Ms Lennon added that it was ""hard to see where lessons have been learned"" from the saga. HES: Clinical waste firm staff made redundant Waste collection costs hit Â£15m after HES collapse Hundreds of tonnes of clinical and human waste piles up The collapse of HES, which previously had the NHS Scotland waste collection contract, saw 150 workers in Scotland lose their jobs and forced contingency measures to be put in place across the health service. In the eight months following the collapse of HES these contingency measures cost the taxpayer a total of Â£14.8m. By contrast the ten-year deal with Tradebe Healthcare will be worth about Â£10m a year. However, the Scottish government has said the higher costs for the contingency measures come as a result of them being put in place at short notice following the collapse of HES. About 150 workers in Scotland lost their jobs when HES collapsed, the majority of whom worked at the firm's headquarters in Shotts A spokeswoman for BDO said: ""The joint liquidators have agreed a licence with Cliniwaste Ltd to operate the Shotts, Newcastle and Nottingham sites. ""This agreement provides an option to purchase after three months. As part of this licence, Cliniwaste Ltd is already on site clearing waste."" A spokeswoman for NHS National Services Scotland said: ""Contingency plans were introduced last year when HES was no longer able to provide waste collection services to NHS boards across Scotland. ""Contingency arrangements will reduce as Tradebe Healthcare implement the new contract on a phased basis until Spring, 2020. ""During the phased introduction, the cost of contingency will decrease, and the amount paid to Tradebe Healthcare will increase because they will be paid for the services they provide.""

"Ex-Labour leader Ed Miliband will sit on a panel of party figures to review its general election failure. Labour Together, which describes itself as a network of activists from all traditions, is setting up a commission to ""map out a route back to power"". It says the panel will view attempts to pin the blame on a single cause, such as Brexit or Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, as simplistic and wrong. Members, focus groups in heartlands, and defeated candidates will get a say. Labour leadership: How wide will the debate be? Labour leadership takes blame over election result Corbyn 'unfairly demonised' by media Labour lost its fourth general election in a row on Thursday, 12 December, recording its worst performance, in terms of seats, since 1935, as a string of constituencies in its traditional Northern strongholds fell to the Conservatives. A row has broken out between the different wings of the party about what caused the defeat, as contenders to replace leader Jeremy Corbyn jockey for position. Labour Together was launched after the 2015 general election by a group of Labour MPs, including Lisa Nandy, one of those tipped to be lining up a leadership bid. This video can not be played John McDonnell: ""This is on me. I own this disaster"" It says it wants to involve all wings of the party, from left-wing campaign group Momentum to the centrist pressure group Progress, in its post-mortem. The group aims to publish its report by the end of February, before the new Labour leader is chosen. Labour Together's commissioners intend to: Interview all 59 MPs who lost their seats this month, as well as defeated candidates in target seats Analyse election data Ask organisers, councillors and activists what went right and wrong Survey members The review will be spearheaded by Lucy Powell, who ran Ed Miliband's 2015 election campaign. Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme, she said there was ""a real appetite"" for Labour members of all traditions to come together and analyse what has changed. ""I think retreating into a factional-based analysis would be the worst thing we could do at this juncture,"" she said. Ms Powell added: ""The Labour coalition has fundamentally changed over the last 20 years. ""Unless we properly reflect on that, then whoever is leader next won't be able to deal with it."" Other confirmed commissioners include Birmingham Ladywood MP Shabana Mahmood, Jo Platt, who lost her seat in the former stronghold of Leigh, Greater Manchester, Sienna Rodgers, editor of the news website LabourList, and James Meadway, former economic adviser to shadow chancellor John McDonnell. The panel is also expected to recruit a trade union representative and a local organiser. This video can not be played Tony Blair: ""Election result brought shame on us"" Ms Rodgers said the review would pore over the results in ""an even-handed way, which doesn't start with blaming one faction, or individual"". Some MPs who lost their seat blame Mr Corbyn's unpopularity with voters. Mr Corbyn says Labour ""won the argument"" but blamed the media and the fact that the campaign was dominated by Brexit, rather than Labour's plans to boost public spending. But internal opponents of Mr Corbyn say the party must ditch his left-wing policy agenda to stand any chance of regaining power. Labour last won a general election in 2005 under the leadership of former Prime Minister Tony Blair. Mr Blairsaid last weekthat the ""takeover of the Labour Party by the far left"" had ""turned it into a glorified protest movement, with cult trimmings, utterly incapable of being a credible government"".

"Boeing has fired its chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, in a bid to restore confidence in the firm after two deadly crashes involving its 737 Max plane. More than 340 people died in the disasters, prompting accusations that Boeing put profit before safety. Families of the victims welcomed Mr Muilenberg's resignation as overdue. But they said Boeing's decision to replace him with a long-time board member raised questions about its commitment to change. Boeing named David Calhoun, who has served on the firm's board since 2009 and is its current chairman, as chief executive and president. ""While the resignation of Mr Muilenburg is a step in the right direction, it is clear that the Boeing Company needs a revamp of its corporate governance,"" said Paul Njoroge, who lost his wife, three children and mother-in-law when Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed in March. Mr Calhoun ""is not the right person for the job"", he added. What went wrong in Boeing's cockpit? Boeing to temporarily halt 737 Max production in January US regulator knew of Boeing 737 crash risks Boeing 'is not a trustworthy company anymore' Zipporah Kuria, whose father was also killed on the Ethiopian Airlines flight, said Mr Muilenburg should have been replaced ""a long time ago"" but responsibility for the crashes is shared. ""I feel as though a lot more people should have resigned including the person who's becoming CEO,"" she told the BBC. Boeing has been under intense scrutiny since two 737 Max planes crashed within five months of each other, first in Indonesia and then in Ethiopia. The 737 Max fleet has been grounded worldwide since March. While the company had been hoping to have the best-selling jet back in the air by the end of this year, US regulators have made it clear that it would not be certified to return to the skies that quickly. The crash site of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 Last week,Boeing said it would halt production of the aircraft. Then on Friday, the company's reputation took another hit when its Starliner spacecraft suffered technical problems that prevented it from taking the right path to the International Space Station. Boeing's board said it had ""decided that a change in leadership was necessary to restore confidence in the company moving forward as it works to repair relationships with regulators, customers, and all other stakeholders"". Mr Calhoun, a private equity executive, will take over from 13 January. Lawrence Kellner, a board member since 2011, is to become non-executive chairman immediately. ""Under the company's new leadership, Boeing will operate with a renewed commitment to full transparency, including effective and proactive communication with the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration], other global regulators and its customers,"" it said. This video can not be played Senator says he ""would walk before I got on a 737 Max"" Despite the ouster, some of the firm's harshest critics in Washington said they still had questions about the firm's commitment to change. Senator Richard Bumenthal said: ""The company needs new leadership across the board who will take safety seriously."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Michael Stumo, who lost his daughter Samya Rose on the Ethiopian Airlines flight and has organised victims' families against Boeing, called the resignation a ""good first step toward restoring Boeing to a company that focuses on safety and innovation"". ""The next step is for several board members who are underperforming or unqualified to resign,"" he said. Air safety officials investigating the tragedies have identified an automated control system in the plane, known as MCAS, as a factor in both crashes. Boeing has said the MCAS software system, which relied on a single sensor, received erroneous data, which led it to override pilot commands and push the aircraft downwards. It has said it is fixing the software and has overhauled its review procedures. But US lawmakers, who are investigating the company, have said the firm was aware that the software system could be unreliable. They have accused the company of trying to hide the risks and rush the plane back into service. Dennis Muilenburg had faced calls or his resignation Congressman Peter DeFazio, who leads a committee investigating Boeing, had called for Mr Muilenburg's resignation in an interview with the New York Times, published over the weekend. In a statement on Monday,external, he said the shake-up was ""long overdue"". Mr Muilenburg first joined Boeing in 1985. He led the company's defence, space and security division prior to his appointment as chief executive in 2015. He was stripped of his role as chairman of Boeing's board of directors in October andlater agreed to give up his bonus. However, Boeing, including Mr Calhoun, had continued to express confidence in him. Dennis Muilenburg's departure was inevitable, although the timing was unexpected. Since the two accidents, he has faced intense criticism over the corporate culture that existed at Boeing on his watch, and over the company's relationship with regulators. Questions have been asked about how a seemingly flawed aircraft was allowed into service in the first place, and why it was allowed to continue flying after the first accident. There have been claims - emphatically denied by the company - that it prioritised profits and speed of production over safety. His response to the crisis has also come under fire. Although he insisted that Boeing ""owned"" its failures, he also repeatedly said that the crashes were the result of a chain of events. This was seen by some as an attempt to divert blame away from the aerospace giant. The final humiliation came last week, when Boeing announced it would have to suspend production of the 737 Max, because regulators had yet to clear the aircraft as safe to fly again. For months, Mr Muilenburg had insisted the plane would be back in the air by the end of the year. He had lost credibility, and the board decided he had to go.

"Prince Charles met rescue workers on the outskirts of the South Yorkshire village of Fishlake Prince Charles has been visiting South Yorkshire to meet people affected by last month's floods. He met firefighters, police officers and soldiers at the village of Fishlake, near Doncaster, and toured the worst-affected areas. Hundreds of home were evacuated and businesses were affected when a month's worth of rain fell in 24 hours, causing the River Don to burst its banks. About 200 Army personnel helped support the flood effort. The prince has made a donation to the flood relief fund, Clarence House said. Charles shared a joke with some of the residents of Fishlake during his walkabout Asked by a reporter about his father the Duke of Edinburgh as he walked into the village, Charles said: ""He's being looked after very well in hospital. ""At the moment that's all we know."" The prince spent two hours in the village chatting to many of the locals lining the streets and looking inside some of the badly damaged homes. Many of the villagers gathered outside the Old Butchers cafe, which owners Louise and Claire Holling turned into a relief centre during worst of the flooding. The prince spent two hours touring the village of Fishlake The royal visitor praised the pair when they turned up later at the village hall, serving refreshments for locals and dignitaries who had gathered to meet him. As he left, Charles told the crowds: ""I hope you've been in and tried those cakes. They're amazing those two, aren't they?"" Charles also had a beer at the Hare and Hounds pub, which was at the centre of the flood relief effort in the village. The prince visited the Hare and Hounds pub which acted as a relief hub during the flooding Angie and Scott Godfrey, who run the pub, made sure stranded residents were fed by sending round hot meals on boats. Mr Godfrey said to Charles outside the pub: ""We were just going to get you a pint when you got here. You might have needed one by this time."" The prince replied ""I do"" and went inside for a quick sip of a half of bitter before moving on to St Cuthbert's Church, which also acted as a relief hub.

"Two women were found dead outside the property and a man was found inside A man arrested on suspicion of murdering two women in a village in West Sussex is in a ""very unstable condition"" in hospital, police said. One of the victims of the attack in Crawley Down has been named locally as 76-year-old Sandy Seagrave. She was found dead outside a house in Hazel Way, alongside the body of a 32-year-old woman, on Sunday. The 37-year-old suspect, who knew one of the women, is at the Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton. He was found injured inside the property by police at 10:20 GMT, on Sunday. Retired milkman Tony Jones, 74, said of Ms Seagrave: ""Everybody knows Sandy because she used to walk round the village. ""Everybody used to see her, wave to her... a lovely lady. ""I can't believe what happened to her,"" he said. A message written on a bouquet of flowers at the police cordon read: ""A terrible tragedy. Rest in peace."" Residents near the scene turned off their Christmas lights on Sunday night in tribute to those who had been killed, according to a homeowner. ""It was all the village lights. It was quite dark and eerie but it was a mark of respect,"" she said. Police in Hazel Way, Crawley Down Earlier reports suggested a knife was used in the attack, but Sussex Police has since said ""this is not a knife crime"".

""Members of the public, police and paramedics did all they could to help the victims but sadly the two women died at the scene. ""I extend my heartfelt sympathies to their families, who are being supported by specialist officers. I ask that people respect their privacy at this distressing time.

"NHS Resolution launched a scheme aimed at improving maternity care in 2018 An NHS trust at the centre of England's largest inquiry into baby deaths was paid almost Â£1m for providing good maternity care, the BBC has learned. Under the Maternity Incentive Scheme run by NHS Resolution, which aims to improve maternity care, trusts must certify they meet 10 safety standards. The Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust did so and received Â£953,391. But weeks after the payment was made, inspectors rated the trust's maternity care as inadequate. NHS Resolution said it was ""unable to comment on specific trust cases"". The trust said evidence of its progress against the maternity safety actions had been shared with committees before being submitted to its board. The care of mothers and babies at the Shrewsbury and Telford Trust (SaTH) has been under the spotlight since April 2017 when the BBC revealeda number of preventable deaths at the trust. Hundreds of families have alleged the trust provided them with poor maternity care. An interim report into what has become the largest inquiry into maternity care in the history of the NHS, leaked last month, founda toxic culture had contributed to the avoidable deaths of babies and mothersas well as dozens of instances of significant harm. Rhiannon Davies campaigned for an independent inquiry after her baby died in 2009 Rhiannon Davies, whose family was among the first to push for the independent inquiry after thedeath of her baby daughter Kate in 2009, said the trust should ""pay the money back"". ""They self-certified that they met the 10 standards, the board signed it off and they received no scrutiny, it is more lies,"" she said. ""It is another perfect, pure example of SaTh creating their own narrative. ""I want to know what they spent the money on."" Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust was placed in special measures In summer 2018, NHS Resolution, the legal arm of NHS trusts in England, launched a scheme aimed at improving maternity care and reducing the cost of errors. Trusts were required to assess whether they had met 10 separate maternity safety actions, including reducing errors, workforce development and acting on the concerns of patients. To qualify for an incentive payment, the board of a trust had to certify that they met all the standards. NHS Resolution did not ensure each trust had met its requirements. Of the 132 trusts that participated in the scheme, 75 certified that they had scored 10 out of 10 and became eligible to receive a full refund of their own contribution as well as a portion of the money paid by those trusts that had not scored a perfect 10. The money was paid to the Shrewsbury and Telford trust last September, while inspectors from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) were assessing the trust. The CQC report, published in November, rated the trust, including its maternity services, as inadequate. More cases in maternity scandal emerge 'She knows it makes Mummy sad' Babies and mums died 'amid toxic hospital culture' Inspectors were forced to take enforcement action to ensure care was immediately improved. While the trust received almost Â£1m for providing good maternity care, it has emerged it has paid out almost Â£50m for maternity errors since 2006. A Freedom of Information request to NHS Resolution showed 82 claims for damages against the trust had been successful since 2006/7, costing the NHS Â£47,568,755. The largest single category was cerebral palsy. Nine babies were left with the condition as a result of medical errors, forcing the trust to pay out more than Â£25m. In a statement, the trust said: ""Evidence of the trust's progress against the 10 safety actions was shared with committees including the Women and Children's Care Group Board and the Quality and Safety Assurance Committee, before being submitted to the trust board. ""The content of the report was also shared with the trust's commissioners.""

"Iolo Williams says there needs to be an appreciation of the work done by conservation volunteers The role played by volunteers in monitoring the UK's wildlife needs greater recognition, a leading Welsh naturalist has urged. Broadcaster Iolo Williams said ""absolutely vital"" data was being gathered by a ""huge army"". But he claimed this was not always appreciated by those making key decisions on the environment. The Welsh Government said it funded a range of important monitoring projects involving volunteers. It comes after the recentState of Nature report, compiled by more than 70 wildlife charities, suggested there had been a 46% increase in time donated by volunteers for conservation work - including monitoring - across the UK since 2000. Mr Williams said it was important for governments to understand that wildlife data, including numbers and distribution of species, ""is more often than not gathered by people who are volunteers"". ""When you get to Welsh assembly, UK government and European level I don't think they really appreciate that a lot of the information that is fed through to them to decide on policy has been collected by this huge army of volunteers out there - so our debt to them is a great one."" Ornithologists would like more help to train volunteers The Welsh Ornithological Society added its members often felt their work was ""very much in the background"". Chairman Mick Green said ""almost all"" of the monitoring in Wales was done by volunteers. ""The government is required to collect some of this data by various laws but they rely very much on the voluntary base to pick up the details because obviously people like Natural Resources Wales are having cuts year on year and they just don't have the resources to do it. ""We'd like to have more resources available to help the volunteer base, to help train them more, perhaps pay their expenses for travel and so on. ""Our message to ministers is fund us - if you're funding a volunteer network you're getting much more bang for your buck because you're getting all your time for free."" Dan Rouse has been monitoring birds in Llanelli since she was a child Since she was a child, Dan Rouse from Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, has been monitoring birds at her local wetland reserve, documenting sighting of different species. She uses an app to share data with researchers and other wildlife enthusiasts. ""All this data that is collected by everyone that plays their part gives us an idea of what's happening to our country with things like climate change,"" she said. ""We can see the numbers decreasing or increasing depending on whether the birds prefer warmer or colder conditions."" ""It also tells us about the impact of infrastructure projects, new roads and so on - and how we're affecting their habitats"". Hundreds of species in Wales under threat The little bird whose first flight is 7,000 miles Erosion of wildlife 'staggering' In recent years, she has noticed an increase in young people wanting to get involved: ""Nature is a hobby for teenagers now, there's not a stigma anymore. It's bringing a whole new generation into conservation."" A Welsh Government spokesman said it was ""extremely grateful to volunteers for the essential contribution they make in Wales"". ""We fund local environment record centres, which help to coordinate a range of important monitoring and surveillance projects, many of which involve volunteers, and we are funding a Â£2.8m project to strengthen existing local nature partnership coordinators."" Guillemot colony perched at Elegug Stacks in Pembrokeshire The State of Nature report estimates 18,700 volunteers are involved in structured monitoring schemes that cover bats, birds, butterflies and plants - with the financial value of their time contribution put at Â£20.5m a year. In addition, as many as 70,000 volunteers submit records to national recording schemes and societies or local environment records centres. There are also widely publicised surveys such as the RSPB's Big Garden Birdwatch, now in its 40th year and attracting almost 500,000 participants. Monitoring ""builds our knowledge of the natural world, and underpins efforts to conserve it, and to halt and reverse declines in nature"", the report says.

"This video can not be played Florence Widdicombe was writing the cards last Sunday when she discovered the message Tesco has suspended production of charity Christmas cards at a factory in China after a six-year-old girl found a message from workers inside one. The note, found by Florence Widdicombe, was allegedly written by prisoners in Shanghai claiming they were ""forced to work against our will"". ""Please help us and notify human rights organisation,"" the message said. Tesco said it was ""shocked"" by the report, adding: ""We would never allow prison labour in our supply chain."" The supermarket said it would de-list the supplier of the cards, Zhejiang Yunguang Printing, if it was found to have used prison labour. Florence was writing cards to her school friends when she found that one of them - featuring a kitten with a Santa hat - had already been written in. The pack of cards cost Â£1.50 from Tesco In block capitals, it said: ""We are foreign prisoners in Shanghai Qingpu prison China. Forced to work against our will. Please help us and notify human rights organisation."" It asked whoever found the message to contact Peter Humphrey, a British journalist who was himself imprisoned there four years ago. Oxfam alleges UK supermarket supply chain abuse âThe SOS in my Halloween decorationsâ Data leak details China's 'brainwashing system' Florence, from Tooting in south London, told BBC News she was writing ""my sixth or eighth card"" when she saw ""somebody had already written in it"". ""It made me feel shocked,"" she said, adding that when it was explained to her what the message meant she felt ""sad"". Her father, Ben Widdicombe, said he first felt ""incredulity"" at discovering the message, adding he first thought it was ""some sort of prank"". ""But on reflection we realised it was potentially quite a serious thing,"" he said. ""I felt very shocked but also felt a responsibility to pass it on to Peter Humphrey as the author asked me to do."" He said: ""It hits home. There are injustices in the world and there are people in difficult situations and we know about that and we read about that each and every day. ""There is something about that message hitting home at Christmas... that really does make it very poignant and very powerful."" Florence Widdicombe, aged six, says finding the message made her feel shocked He added: ""It could have ended up anywhere. And indeed we have many cards as all families do that are left over and we put them in a drawer and forget about them. There is an incredible element of chance in all of this that the card was written, it got to us and we opened it on the day we did."" A Tesco spokeswoman said: ""We were shocked by these allegations and immediately halted production at the factory where these cards are produced and launched an investigation."" The supermarket said it has a ""comprehensive auditing system"" to ensure suppliers are not exploiting forced labour. The factory in question was checked only last month and no evidence of it breaking the ban on prison labour was found, it said. Sales of charity Christmas cards at the company's supermarkets raise Â£300,000 a year for the British Heart Foundation, Cancer Research UK and Diabetes UK. The retailer has not received any other complaints from customers about messages inside Christmas cards. The message in the card urged the recipient to contact Peter Humphrey, whowas formerly imprisoned at Qingpuon what he described as ""bogus charges that were never heard in court"". After the Widdicombe family sent him a message via Linkedin, Mr Humphrey said he then contacted ex-prisoners who confirmed inmates had been forced to work. He then wrote the storyfor the Sunday Times,external. Mr Humphrey told the BBC: ""I spent two years in captivity in Shanghai between 2013 and 2015 and my final nine months of captivity was in this very prison in this very cell block where this message has come from. ""So this was written by some of my cellmates from that period who are still there serving sentences. This video can not be played Peter Humphrey: ""I think I know who it was but I will never disclose the name"" ""I'm pretty sure this was written as a collective message. Obviously one single hand produced this capital letters' handwriting and I think I know who it was, but I will never disclose that name."" He said the cell block of foreign prisoners has about 250 people in it, who are living a ""very bleak daily life"" with 12 prisoners per cell. ""They sleep in very rusty iron bunkbeds with a mattress which is no more than about 1cm thick underneath,"" he said. ""In the winter it's extremely cold, there's no heating in the building and in the summer it's extremely hot because there is no air conditioning. ""They get up around 5:30-6:00am every day they have to go to bed again at about 9.30."" He said when he was in there, manufacturing labour work was voluntary - to earn money to buy soap or toothpaste - but that work has now become compulsory. ""Everyone I know in there at the time was in there for very questionable reasons,"" he said. ""I met so many people who I considered to be the victims of wrongful imprisonment or at least reckless sentencing for minor offences."" A foreign inmate dries clothes at Shanghai Qingpu prison in 2006 Mr Humphrey said he believes those who wrote the note ""knew very well what risks they were taking and they were prepared to take this risk"". ""They know very well that if they're caught, they will be punished. They could be punished for example by losing some merit points or having some kind of deprivation of some of their food allowance. ""They could be punished by sending them to solitary confinement for a month or something like that where conditions are fairly harsh."" Mr Humphrey also said that censorship in the prison had increased, cutting off his usual methods of contacting prisoners he had met before his release in 2015. ""They resorted to the Qingpu equivalent of a message in a bottle, scribbled on a Tesco Christmas card,"" he said. It is not the first time that prisoners in China have reportedly smuggled out messages in products they have been forced to make for Western markets. In 2012, Julie Keith from Portland, Oregon, discoveredan account of torture and persecutionby a prisoner who said he was forced to manufacture the Halloween decorations she had purchased. And in 2014, Karen Wisinska from Co Fermanagh in Northern Ireland,found a note on a pair of Primark trousersreading: ""Our job inside the prison is to produce fashion clothes for export. We work 15 hours per day and the food we eat wouldn't even be given to dogs or pigs.""

"Ex-Labour leader Ed Miliband will sit on a panel of party figures to review its general election failure. Labour Together, which describes itself as a network of activists from all traditions, is setting up a commission to ""map out a route back to power"". It says the panel will view attempts to pin the blame on a single cause, such as Brexit or Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, as simplistic and wrong. Members, focus groups in heartlands, and defeated candidates will get a say. Labour leadership: How wide will the debate be? Labour leadership takes blame over election result Corbyn 'unfairly demonised' by media Labour lost its fourth general election in a row on Thursday, 12 December, recording its worst performance, in terms of seats, since 1935, as a string of constituencies in its traditional Northern strongholds fell to the Conservatives. A row has broken out between the different wings of the party about what caused the defeat, as contenders to replace leader Jeremy Corbyn jockey for position. Labour Together was launched after the 2015 general election by a group of Labour MPs, including Lisa Nandy, one of those tipped to be lining up a leadership bid. This video can not be played John McDonnell: ""This is on me. I own this disaster"" It says it wants to involve all wings of the party, from left-wing campaign group Momentum to the centrist pressure group Progress, in its post-mortem. The group aims to publish its report by the end of February, before the new Labour leader is chosen. Labour Together's commissioners intend to: Interview all 59 MPs who lost their seats this month, as well as defeated candidates in target seats Analyse election data Ask organisers, councillors and activists what went right and wrong Survey members The review will be spearheaded by Lucy Powell, who ran Ed Miliband's 2015 election campaign. Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme, she said there was ""a real appetite"" for Labour members of all traditions to come together and analyse what has changed. ""I think retreating into a factional-based analysis would be the worst thing we could do at this juncture,"" she said. Ms Powell added: ""The Labour coalition has fundamentally changed over the last 20 years. ""Unless we properly reflect on that, then whoever is leader next won't be able to deal with it."" Other confirmed commissioners include Birmingham Ladywood MP Shabana Mahmood, Jo Platt, who lost her seat in the former stronghold of Leigh, Greater Manchester, Sienna Rodgers, editor of the news website LabourList, and James Meadway, former economic adviser to shadow chancellor John McDonnell. The panel is also expected to recruit a trade union representative and a local organiser. This video can not be played Tony Blair: ""Election result brought shame on us"" Ms Rodgers said the review would pore over the results in ""an even-handed way, which doesn't start with blaming one faction, or individual"". Some MPs who lost their seat blame Mr Corbyn's unpopularity with voters. Mr Corbyn says Labour ""won the argument"" but blamed the media and the fact that the campaign was dominated by Brexit, rather than Labour's plans to boost public spending. But internal opponents of Mr Corbyn say the party must ditch his left-wing policy agenda to stand any chance of regaining power. Labour last won a general election in 2005 under the leadership of former Prime Minister Tony Blair. Mr Blairsaid last weekthat the ""takeover of the Labour Party by the far left"" had ""turned it into a glorified protest movement, with cult trimmings, utterly incapable of being a credible government"".

"Ungaro (pictured in 1999) was known for his bold colours and prints French fashion designer Emanuel Ungaro has died in Paris aged 86. Ungaro was the son of Italian immigrants who trained under Spanish designer Cristobal Balenciaga. He founded his fashion house in the 1960s and described himself as a ""sensual obsessive"" - with a reputation for bold colours and prints. He retired and sold the brand in 2005. He went on to criticise the fashion house when US actress Lindsay Lohan was briefly hired as an artistic director. Ungaro was born in Aix-en-Province in the south of France in 1933. He first learned tailoring by working under his father and moved to Paris in his early 20s to launch a career in fashion. His time training with Balenciaga taught him ""rigor and perfectionism"", according to his former brand's website. ""Season after season, Emanuel Ungaro dared to be different, combining unexpected yet sensual clashes of bright colours and prints with beautiful draping,"" the House of Emanuel Ungaro website says. His ready-to-wear looks were popular among consumers in the 1980s Ungaro's work included haute couture designs as well as clothes for the ready-to-wear market. ""One should not wear a dress, one should live in it,"" he once said, according to the AFP news agency. The label was at the height of its popularity in the 1980s and 1990s. Ungaro sold the label to Silicon Valley businessman Asim Abdullah in 2005. After his departure, the brand gained a reputation for a high turnover of creative staff - most notably Ms Lohan. Emanuel Ungaro seen at his Autumn-Winter show in 2002-2003 The collections the actress worked on were widely panned by fashion critics, and Ungaro himself, as a ""disaster"". The designer was quoted at the time as saying he was ""furious"" with the move and said his former fashion house was ""in the process of losing its soul"". Today it continues to produce women's fashion, as well as other products including perfumes and luxury furniture. Ungaro was married and had a daughter, but in recent years stayed out of the spotlight. He had spent the last two years of his life in a ""weakened"" state of health, a family member told AFP.
