"High Street lenders are now starting to offer mortgages to borrowers offering a deposit of just 5% under a new government guarantee scheme. The policy, announced in the Budget, is designed to help more first-time buyers secure a home. But the launch comes as average house prices in the UK continue to rise to record levels. Analysts also suggest that cheaper deals are available for those able to stretch to a 10% deposit. When does the stamp duty holiday extension end? Ten ways the Budget will affect you Home movers 'have a spring in their step' The scheme is similar to policies previously used to boost the housing market and the economy, as well as offering support to those buying a home for the first time. The new scheme will be available to anyone buying a home costing up to Â£600,000, unless they are buy-to-let or second homes. The government is offering a partial guarantee, generally of 15%, to compensate lenders if the borrower defaults on repayments. Karen Wright, 41, runs a beauty salon in Cheshire, while her husband Christopher, 33, is a joiner. As self-employed people, they have both been hit hard by the pandemic, with Karen's salon closed for five months out of the past year. That's made it all the more difficult to save for a deposit for their dream home. ""We've been renting since 2010,"" says Karen, ""but we want something that's a 'forever' home for us. ""Trying to save up 20% is very difficult, but with this scheme, we might be able to pay down more than we thought we could and be able to come within the budget of what we currently pay in the rental market."" The couple are keen to find a three-bedroom house in the Wirral, so their two children can each have a room of their own. ""It's not the cheapest area, but we're looking for something we can maybe do up, utilising my husband's skills."" The guarantee is designed to give lenders the confidence to offer 95% loan-to-value mortgages - many of which were withdrawn during the Covid crisis. Lloyds, Santander, Barclays, HSBC andÂ NatWestÂ are starting to offer products this week and Virgin Money will do so next month.Â However, some lenders such as Halifax, which is part of Lloyds Banking Group, and Barclays have said that these products will not be available for new-build properties. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Every new homeowner and moverÂ supportsÂ jobs right across the housingÂ sector, butÂ saving for a big enough deposit can be hard, especially for first-time buyers.Â Â ""By giving lenders the option of a government guarantee on 95% mortgages, many more products will become available, boosting the sector, creating new jobs and helping people achieve their dream of owning their own home."" However, lenders will still carry out affordability checks. Anyone who has lost a job, or whose income has been sporadic owing to the pandemic's effect on employment may find it difficult to secure a mortgage. House prices have been rising - partly because of government stimulus, and there are concerns too about the potential for some to fall into negative equity if this is followed by sharp falls in property values. Some of the new mortgage rates are close to 4% for a two-year fixed rate deal. For example, rates on NatWest's new 95% mortgages will start at 3.9%. Lloyd Cochran, head of mortgages at NatWest, told the BBC's Today programme: ""It reflects the extra risk the bank is taking on. I think over the long term that is a pretty competitive rate for customers. ""One of the things we do is ensure that the customer can afford that rate. We also ensure... the customer can afford that loan if interest rates were to rise."" However, analysts say rates could be cut significantly, by as much as 0.75 of a percentage point, for borrowers able to stretch to a 10% deposit. ""With more lenders poised to launch deals for this sector of the market, [borrowers] level of choice should hopefully increase even further,"" said Eleanor Williams, from financial information service Moneyfacts. ""Increased competition within the higher loan-to-value tiers will hopefully translate to more competitive rates for these borrowers.""

"This video can not be played FA Cup: Leicester City 1-0 Southampton highlights Leicester City boss Brendan Rodgers says his side have ""the chance to create history"" after reaching their first FA Cup final since 1969 at the expense of Southampton at Wembley. Kelechi Iheanacho's second-half goal proved decisive for the Foxes, whose last major final of any description came in 2000, when they lifted the League Cup. ""That is what this game is about, creating a memory,"" said Rodgers, who is yet to win major silverware in English football, but won seven trophies in less than three years as manager of Celtic. ""I have been made aware since I've been at Leicester how important this cup is for the supporters. ""We have the chance to create history. When we arrived here, that was the ambition. From a football perspective we wanted to be able to compete and we have been able to do that. Now we have a trophy to genuinely go for."" Iheanacho, who benefited from Jamie Vardy's fine work to score at the second attempt 10 minutes after the interval, added: ""It is a dream come true. I watched the FA Cup when I was little and now I get the chance to play in the final. ""I think the FA Cup loves me and I love the FA Cup."" The game was played in front of 4,000 supporters as part of a pilot scheme, with research being carried out on allowing fans back in to sporting events as coronavirus restrictions are eased. Tickets were limited to residents of Brent - the north London borough where Wembley Stadium is situated - and key workers. Those inside Wembley witnessed a mainly dour game but Leicester, playing in their first semi-final since 1982, will not care - and neither will their followers. Southampton were strangely lacking in intensity, barely threatening Leicester keeper Kasper Schmeichel. Ibrahima Diallo went closest to an equaliser for the Saints but his powerful drive went just wide. Rodgers' side will now face Chelsea in the final on 15 May, their first appearance in the showpiece since they lost 1-0 against Manchester City 52 years ago. Reaction as Leicester City reach the FA Cup final The past four FA Cup goals at Wembley have been scored by African players - Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Hakim Ziyech and Kelechi Iheanacho Leicester fully merited their victory as they were much the more composed and ordered side in a low-key semi-final with few chances. It took Iheanacho, who scored the winner against Brighton in the fifth round and was on target twice in the 3-1 win against Manchester United in the quarter-final, to make the decisive contribution. His goal secured a place in the final against Chelsea, who the Foxes beat in the Premier League in January. And while they will be underdogs, Leicester have enough quality and resilience to be quietly confident. This FA Cup final appearance is further evidence of the fine work being done by Rodgers, who also has Leicester right in the mix for the Champions League places next season. Now they have the chance to turn all this endeavour into silverware at Wembley against Thomas Tuchel's side. Southampton will leave Wembley with bitter regrets as they failed to produce anything near their best and can have no complaints about the outcome. They showed little of the intensity and energy that is their trademark when at their best under manager Ralph Hasenhuttl. The Saints lacked ambition and positive intent apart from a brief revival a couple of minutes after Leicester scored, when Diallo was not far off target and there was a scramble after a corner. Main marksman Danny Ings cut a frustrated figure, starved of service and reduced mainly to chasing lost causes. ""That such a goal decides such a game is a pity for us,"" said Hasenhuttl. ""In the end, especially in the final third, we didn't have good moments. We couldn't get a shot on goal and this is not enough."" This will be a real blow to Southampton, who fancied their chances in the FA Cup this season and had a big opportunity to reach the final, but they came up short and must now return to ensuring their Premier League status. This was the biggest crowd at a football match in England since the country went into lockdown in March last year - and what a glorious sound it was as the Leicester and Southampton players came out to cheers from 4,000 fans inside Wembley, reciprocating the gesture as they lined up before kick-off. It did not have the partisanship and passion of the tradition football crowd because this was a test and research event with only locals and key workers in attendance. There were moments, however, especially when Leicester scored and when Southampton substitute Theo Walcott came on to a very loud, mixed reception - presumably from Arsenal fans inside Wembley who idolised him from his time with the Gunners and Tottenham supporters who took the opposite view. There were resounding cheers when the supporters were thanked over the public address system for their attendance and the hope is that this test event will help navigate a route out of the behind-closed-doors occasions that have been the way of things during lockdown. The sight and sound of fans added to the spectacle, even when most of those watching this FA Cup semi-final were neutrals. Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers, speaking to BBC Sport:""It feels amazing. I thought we deserved it, the players worked so hard. Commiserations to Southampton, they are a terrific team. ""We got the goal which was a great piece of play by Jamie [Vardy]. We had two or three moments after that to close it out. When you are 1-0 up, you have to show that self-control and stay calm and we did that. ""Even thought there were only 4,000 fans, it felt great. It will be amazing when we get supporters back into stadiums. I did hear some Leicester supporters in there and it was really nice."" Southampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl, speaking to BBC Sport:""We conceded our first goal in the FA Cup. [It is] Hard to take because we haven't been the worst team. We tried to put pressure on them. We saw a not very good football game to be honest, with both teams a little nervous. ""We had the chance to get to the final. We will try again next year."" Leicester City have reached their first FA Cup final since 1969, a gap of 52 years, the longest between finals since Portsmouth went 69 and Cardiff went 81 between finals before facing one another in 2008. Southampton have now been eliminated in eight of their past 10 FA Cup semi-final appearances, two of which have come in the past four seasons (2017-18 vs Chelsea, 2020-21 vs Leicester). This was only Leicester's fourth win in 15 appearances at Wembley (D1 L10) and their first since the 2000 League Cup final against Tranmere, while Southampton have lost eight of their 10 matches at Wembley (W2), losing their last five in a row. Since his debut in the FA Cup in January 2016, Kelechi Iheanacho has scored more goals in the competition (first round onwards) than any other player, netting 14 times in 19 games. Iheanacho is the first Nigerian player to score 15 goals in all competitions in a season for a Premier League club since Odion Ighalo in 2015-16 for Watford, who scored 17. Southampton failed to have a single shot in the first half, the first time that had happened since November 2019 against Everton in a Premier League game. Only Sheffield United (13) have lost more games in all competitions in 2021 among Premier League clubs than Southampton (12). Jamie Vardy has gone 11 games without a goal in all competitions for Leicester, his longest goal drought since a run of 16 games between September - December 2016. Leicester return to action when they host West Bromwich Albion in the Premier League on Thursday, 22 April (20:00 BST). Southampton travel to Tottenham for their next match in the Premier League on Wednesday, 21 April (18:00 BST). Should we eat bacteria?:One simple thing that could improve your life!

"The billionaire Issa brothers who own Asda have bought the British fast food chain, Leon. More than 70 Leon restaurants across the UK and Europe have been sold to the brothers' giant petrol forecourt business EG Group. In a joint statement, Mohsin Issa and Zuber Issa said the firm was a ""fantastic brand we have long admired"". Leon boss John Vincent, who co-founded the firm in 2004, said: ""In some ways this is a sad day for me."" ""We have tried hard, done some good things, made a healthy amount of mistakes, and built a business that quite a few people are kind enough to say that they love,"" he added. The deal includes 42 company-owned restaurants, as well as 29 franchise sites which are mainly found in airports and train stations across the UK and a handful of European countries such as the Netherlands and Spain. The group has also committed to keeping on Leon's management team and staff. EG Group said that the acquisition, reportedly worth up to Â£100m according tothe Mail on Sunday,external, is ""complementary"" as it seeks to expand the food side of its business. How to buy a Â£6.8bn supermarket for Â£780m Who are the Issa brothers? 'We try to make good food emotionally addictive' It already operates more than 700 food outlets in the UK and Ireland, including branches and ""drive-thrus"" for KFC, Starbucks and Greggs. In a statement, EG Group said it planned to open about 20 new Leon outlets a year from 2022. It also cited the importance of Leon's cookbooks, own-brand groceries and ready-meals sold in supermarkets. John Vincent co-founded the firm - named after his father - with Henry Dimbleby and Allegra McEvedy, when he was 33. The brand placed importance on creating a menu of ""healthy fast-food"", Mr Vincent told the BBCin a 2019 interview. Leon now has more than 70 restaurants Mr Vincent said on Sunday that he has ""had the pleasure of getting to know Mohsin and Zuber [Issa] across the last few years. ""They have been enthusiastic customers of Leon, going out of their way to eat here whenever they visit London. They are decent, hard-working business people who are committed to sustaining and further strengthening the values and culture that we have built"". The Asda deal has understandably attracted the most attention, but this is the latest example of EG Group's wider strategy in growing its non-fuel and food service operations. The Issa brothers' statement today certainly gave no indication they're finished yet. It was already apparent they were also interested in adding to their menu of cafÃ© and restaurant brands. They have shown a taste for CaffÃ¨ Nero, although the coffee chain rejected their bid in November - shortly after launching a company voluntary agreement (CVA). John Vincent has been open about how tough the past year's lockdowns have been for the brand he started 17 years ago, and Leon's outlets are most concentrated in London. Locations such as Canary Wharf, London Bridge railway station and Heathrow Airport seem unlikely to experience a return to pre-pandemic levels of trade soon. Under EG Group's plans, it's now set to expand into both new geographical and - with possible drive-throughs - operational areas. The Issa brothers, two entrepreneurs from Blackburn,in February completed a dealto buy Asda, Britain's third-largest supermarket chain, from US owners Walmart. It was valued at Â£6.8bn, but the brothers and the investment firm TDR Capital paid just Â£780m. The deal is still awaiting approval from the UK's Competition and Markets Authority, which is expected by the summer. As part of it, Asda's 323 petrol stations will be sold for Â£750m to EG Group, adding to the portfolio of more than 6,000 around the world. In 2020, questions were raised about the group's finances after its auditor, Deloitte, suddenly quit in October and was replaced by KPMG. EG Group said the auditor had signed a ""clean audit"" for EG Group's 2019 financial accounts and there had been ""no disagreements on any auditing or accounting matters"".

"Facebook's plans to roll out encryption across its messaging services could jeopardise ongoing work to combat child abuse, the Home Secretary has warned. Such encryption means only the sender and recipient can read messages. ""We cannot allow a situation where law enforcement's ability to tackle abhorrent criminal acts and protect victims is severely hampered,"" Priti Patel told a charity-hosted event. Facebook says its plans for wider encryption protects users' privacy. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), which invited Ms Patel to speak, has claimed that private messaging ""is the frontline of child sexual abuse"". Encrypting messages by default could lead to the easier spread of child abuse imagery or online grooming, it has said. In her speech, the Home Secretary said that Facebook must take into account public safety when it makes changes to its platform - and in particular seriously consider the effect on children. ""Sadly, at a time when we need to be taking more action... Facebook is still pursuing end-to-end encryption plans that place the good work and the progress that has already been made at jeopardy,"" she said. ""Offending is continuing, and will continue - these images of children being abused just continue to proliferate, even right now while we are speaking. But the company intends to blind itself to this problem through end-to-end encryption which prevents all access to messaging content."" ""My view is that this is simply not acceptable,"" she added. Facebook, however, said that ""end-to-end encryption is already the leading security technology used by many services to keep people safe from hackers and criminals"". Safety features are already a part of its plans, it added. End-to-end encryption guarantees privacy by making sure only the sender or recipient can read the messages. While it travels, it is scrambled to be unreadable, including by law enforcement. The only way to read the message is usually to get physical access to an unlocked device receiving it. Currently, only one of Facebook's major messaging platforms - WhatsApp - uses end-to-end encryption by default. The company has plans to make the privacy feature the norm on Facebook Messenger and Instagram - but has not yet done so. When messaging platforms are not end-to-end encrypted, tech giants such as Facebook can use automatic scanning of their users' posts to identify the sharing of known child abuse images and detect questionable use of private messaging - such as an older person chatting to underage users they do not already know. This video can not be played What is encryption? The NSPCC argues that rolling out the encryption as planned would ""render these [scanning] tools useless"", and is calling on Facebook to reconsider. An estimate from the US National Center for Missing and Exploited children suggests as many as 70% of child abuse reports around the world could be lost if it goes ahead. The NPSCC unveiled research at the event that suggests social media users are keen to see some guarantee that children's safety will be protected. The charity is demanding a ""reset"" of the debate, arguing that it has become stuck as an ""either/or"" debate between personal privacy and child safety. Instead, it is calling for a ""balanced"" solution that protects both. Ms Patel echoed that sentiment, saying: ""I want to make it clear that the government does support encryption, where of course companies can protect users' privacy, and there are many areas where this is important."" ""We believe that it is possible to implement end-to-end encryption, the service, in a way in which is also consistent with public protection and child safety,"" she said. But she did not say what that would look like. Some possible solutions, such as on-device software that scans messages before they are sent, have their own privacy concerns. Gaining access to the content of encrypted messages has long been a topic of debate in government. One of Ms Patel's predecessors, Amber Rudd,argued in the wake of the 2017 Westminster attackthat ""we need to make sure that our intelligence services have the ability to get into... encrypted WhatsApp"". And former Prime Minister David Cameron,in the wake of the 2015 Paris attacks, declaredthat there should be no ""means of communication"" which ""we cannot read"". Despite such concerns, encrypted messaging remains a sensitive topic with much public support. Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, said: ""Encryption is popular and growing because users want security and protection from fraud, scams and abuse of their data."" ""It would be completely unreasonable to ban or limit everyday security for one set of people over the other. ""It is absolutely necessary to deal with child abuse images, but solutions must be compatible with people's right to keep themselves safe from other kinds of criminality, so should move away from endlessly debating how to stop the use of encryption."" Children 'at risk' from encrypted message apps Facebook dominates cases of social media grooming Facebook shareholders try to block encryption plan But Sir Peter Wanless, NSPCC chief executive, argued that view risked ""leaving children unprotected where there is most harm"". ""It's in firms' interests to find a fix that allows them to continue to use tech to disrupt abuse in an end-to-end encrypted world,"" he added. And he said that if the tech giants failed to do so, ""ultimately government must be the guardrail"" to protect children. Facebook has long defended its plans to introduce end-to-end encryption as essential to user privacy. In a statement reacting to the Home Secretary's remarks, a company spokesman said: ""Child exploitation has no place on our platforms and Facebook will continue to lead the industry in developing new ways to prevent, detect and respond to abuse. ""Its full rollout on our messaging services is a long-term project and we are building strong safety measures into our plans."" Should governments be given keys to access our messages? Facebook shareholders try to block encryption plan How encryption works on different apps Facebook encryption threatens safety - ministers Child protectors urge Facebook encryption rethink Children 'at risk' from encrypted message apps Facebook dominates cases of social media grooming Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction Warning on gas prices as cold snap hits supplies UK records coldest night of winter as freeze to last into weekend 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 Weekly quiz: Zendaya looked happy but who else sparkled at the Golden Globes?

"Liverpool and Chelsea are understood to be part of the group that have signed up to a breakaway league Uefa, the Premier League and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have condemned 12 major European clubs, including the 'big six' from England,signing up to a breakaway European Super League. Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham are part of the group. La Liga's Atletico Madrid, Barcelona and Real Madrid and Serie A's AC Milan, Inter Milan and Juventus are involved. Uefa said it will use ""all measures"" possible to stop the ""cynical project"". Senior figures at European football's governing body are furious about the proposals. This video can not be played Dion Dublin & Danny Murphy discuss the plans for a European Super League Johnson said the plans would be ""very damaging for football"" and that the UK government supports the sport's authorities ""in taking action"". He added: ""The clubs involved must answer to their fans and the wider footballing community before taking any further steps."" The European Clubs' Association (ECA), which represents Europe's clubs, held an emergency meeting on Sunday in the wake of the reports. BBC Sport understands none of the clubs mentioned in the Super League reports responded to a request to attend the meeting. The meeting was chaired by Ajax chief executive Edwin van der Sar. Bayern Munich and Paris St-Germain were among the clubs who were present. In a statement the ECA said it would be ""strongly opposed"" to a ""closed super league model"". It has pushedplans for a 36-team Champions League,which Uefa had hoped would head off the formation of a Super League. The Champions League reforms are set to be confirmed on Monday. BBC Sport was told last week of plans for some sort of confirmation about a European Super League. Uefa released a joint statement, together with England's Football Association, the Premier League, the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), La Liga, and the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) as well as Serie A, on Sunday. They said they will ""remain united"" in trying to stop the breakaway, using both judicial and sporting measures if required. They also reiterated Fifa's stance that players taking part in the Super League would be banned from all other competitions at domestic, European or world level and could be prevented from representing their national teams. In a separate statement, the Premier League said it condemned the proposal as it ""attacks the principles of open competition and sporting merit which are at the heart"" of domestic and European football. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said in a statement the government is ""concerned this plan could create a closed shop at the very top of our national game"". He added: ""We have a football pyramid where funds from the globally successful Premier League flow down the leagues and into local communities. This video can not be played A European Super League: The future of football? ""I would be bitterly disappointed to see any action that destroys that."" Labour leader Keir Starmer said the clubs involved should ""rethink immediately"" or ""face the consequences of their actions"". ""This proposal risks shutting the door on fans for good, reducing them to mere spectators and consumers,"" he said. Juventus owner Andrea Agnelli, Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and AC Milan chief executive Ivan Gazidis would all have had a significant input into the Champions League discussions on Friday. However, those clubs are among those to have broken ranks, to the fury of Uefa, whose president Aleksander Ceferin wanted to stave off a Super League threat. The Premier League said a European Super League would ""destroy"" the dream of fans that ""their team may climb to the top and play against the best"". It added such a league would ""undermine the appeal of the whole game"" and that they would work with the FA, the English Football League, Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), League Managers Association (LMA) and fans to ""defend the integrity and future prospects of English football"". Juventus and AC Milan have signed up to the breakaway league plans The FA said it will ""not provide permission to any competition that would be damaging to English football"" and will ""take any legal and/or regulatory action necessary"" to stop it. Bundesliga sides are opposed to the plans because the German model means commercial investors cannot have more than a 49% stake in clubs, so fans hold a majority of their own voting rights. French Ligue 1 side Paris St-Germain are not part of the group either. Uefa said it thanked ""those clubs in other countries, especially the French and German clubs, who have refused to sign up"" to the breakaway league. ""We call on all lovers of football, supporters and politicians, to join us in fighting against such a project if it were to be announced,"" it added. ""This persistent self-interest of a few has been going on for too long. Enough is enough."" Quite when the European Super League would start is unclear. However, world governing bodyFifa has already said it would not recognise such a competitionand any players involved in it would be denied the chance to play at a World Cup. Serie A has called an emergency board meeting to discuss the matter. The Football Supporters' Association said it is ""totally opposed"" to the plans, which it said were ""motivated by nothing but cynical greed"". It added: ""This competition is being created behind our backs by billionaire club owners who have zero regard for the game's traditions and continue to treat football as their personal fiefdom."" The PFA said it had ""substantial concerns"" about the proposal, adding it would ""detract from the strength and joy of domestic football and diminish the game for the vast majority of fans across the continent"". France's President Emmanuel Macron said he ""welcomes the position of French clubs to refuse to participate"" in a European Super League ""that threatens the principle of solidarity and sporting merit"". A statement from the French presidency added: ""The French state will support all the steps taken by the LFP [France's professional leagues governing body], FFF [France's football association], Uefa and Fifa to protect the integrity of federal competitions, whether national or European."" It has been agreed the new-look Champions League will involve an initial phase where every club plays 10 matches each rather than the current group phase. In addition there would be play-offs, followed by a knockout phase.

"Liverpool and Chelsea are understood to be part of the group that have signed up to a breakaway league Uefa, the Premier League and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have condemned 12 major European clubs, including the 'big six' from England,signing up to a breakaway European Super League. Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham are part of the group. La Liga's Atletico Madrid, Barcelona and Real Madrid and Serie A's AC Milan, Inter Milan and Juventus are involved. Uefa said it will use ""all measures"" possible to stop the ""cynical project"". Senior figures at European football's governing body are furious about the proposals. This video can not be played Dion Dublin & Danny Murphy discuss the plans for a European Super League Johnson said the plans would be ""very damaging for football"" and that the UK government supports the sport's authorities ""in taking action"". He added: ""The clubs involved must answer to their fans and the wider footballing community before taking any further steps."" The European Clubs' Association (ECA), which represents Europe's clubs, held an emergency meeting on Sunday in the wake of the reports. BBC Sport understands none of the clubs mentioned in the Super League reports responded to a request to attend the meeting. The meeting was chaired by Ajax chief executive Edwin van der Sar. Bayern Munich and Paris St-Germain were among the clubs who were present. In a statement the ECA said it would be ""strongly opposed"" to a ""closed super league model"". It has pushedplans for a 36-team Champions League,which Uefa had hoped would head off the formation of a Super League. The Champions League reforms are set to be confirmed on Monday. BBC Sport was told last week of plans for some sort of confirmation about a European Super League. Uefa released a joint statement, together with England's Football Association, the Premier League, the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), La Liga, and the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) as well as Serie A, on Sunday. They said they will ""remain united"" in trying to stop the breakaway, using both judicial and sporting measures if required. They also reiterated Fifa's stance that players taking part in the Super League would be banned from all other competitions at domestic, European or world level and could be prevented from representing their national teams. In a separate statement, the Premier League said it condemned the proposal as it ""attacks the principles of open competition and sporting merit which are at the heart"" of domestic and European football. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said in a statement the government is ""concerned this plan could create a closed shop at the very top of our national game"". He added: ""We have a football pyramid where funds from the globally successful Premier League flow down the leagues and into local communities. This video can not be played A European Super League: The future of football? ""I would be bitterly disappointed to see any action that destroys that."" Labour leader Keir Starmer said the clubs involved should ""rethink immediately"" or ""face the consequences of their actions"". ""This proposal risks shutting the door on fans for good, reducing them to mere spectators and consumers,"" he said. Juventus owner Andrea Agnelli, Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and AC Milan chief executive Ivan Gazidis would all have had a significant input into the Champions League discussions on Friday. However, those clubs are among those to have broken ranks, to the fury of Uefa, whose president Aleksander Ceferin wanted to stave off a Super League threat. The Premier League said a European Super League would ""destroy"" the dream of fans that ""their team may climb to the top and play against the best"". It added such a league would ""undermine the appeal of the whole game"" and that they would work with the FA, the English Football League, Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), League Managers Association (LMA) and fans to ""defend the integrity and future prospects of English football"". Juventus and AC Milan have signed up to the breakaway league plans The FA said it will ""not provide permission to any competition that would be damaging to English football"" and will ""take any legal and/or regulatory action necessary"" to stop it. Bundesliga sides are opposed to the plans because the German model means commercial investors cannot have more than a 49% stake in clubs, so fans hold a majority of their own voting rights. French Ligue 1 side Paris St-Germain are not part of the group either. Uefa said it thanked ""those clubs in other countries, especially the French and German clubs, who have refused to sign up"" to the breakaway league. ""We call on all lovers of football, supporters and politicians, to join us in fighting against such a project if it were to be announced,"" it added. ""This persistent self-interest of a few has been going on for too long. Enough is enough."" Quite when the European Super League would start is unclear. However, world governing bodyFifa has already said it would not recognise such a competitionand any players involved in it would be denied the chance to play at a World Cup. Serie A has called an emergency board meeting to discuss the matter. The Football Supporters' Association said it is ""totally opposed"" to the plans, which it said were ""motivated by nothing but cynical greed"". It added: ""This competition is being created behind our backs by billionaire club owners who have zero regard for the game's traditions and continue to treat football as their personal fiefdom."" The PFA said it had ""substantial concerns"" about the proposal, adding it would ""detract from the strength and joy of domestic football and diminish the game for the vast majority of fans across the continent"". France's President Emmanuel Macron said he ""welcomes the position of French clubs to refuse to participate"" in a European Super League ""that threatens the principle of solidarity and sporting merit"". A statement from the French presidency added: ""The French state will support all the steps taken by the LFP [France's professional leagues governing body], FFF [France's football association], Uefa and Fifa to protect the integrity of federal competitions, whether national or European."" It has been agreed the new-look Champions League will involve an initial phase where every club plays 10 matches each rather than the current group phase. In addition there would be play-offs, followed by a knockout phase. The most controversial aspect of the proposals surround the allocation of the four additional places, with two being reserved for the clubs ranked highest in Uefa's coefficient table who fail to qualify for the Champions League through their domestic competition, but do secure some kind of European football. At the moment, Liverpool and Chelsea would be the clubs who benefited from that system if it was in place this season.

"This video can not be played 'It's a time of great concern' - Lineker on European Super League Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham are among 12 clubs who have agreed to join a new European Super League (ESL). In a seismic move for European football, the Premier League clubs will join AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Juventus and Real Madrid. The ESL said the founding clubs had agreed to establish a ""new midweek competition"" with teams continuing to ""compete in their respective national leagues"". European Super League a 'grotesque concept', says Villa chief executive Purslow 'I'm disappointed and disgusted' - ex-Liverpool and Tottenham midfielder Murphy 'A bonfire of greed' - how Europe reacted to the Super League 'Football pyramid must be protected' - Rooney It said the inaugural season was ""intended to commence as soon as practicable"" and ""anticipated that a further three clubs"" would join the breakaway. The ESL said it also planned to launch a women's competition as soon as possible after the men's tournament starts. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Uefa and the Premier Leaguecondemned the movewhen the news broke on Sunday. And speaking on Monday, he said the government was ""going to look at everything that we can do with the football authorities to make sure that this doesn't go ahead in the way that it's currently being proposed"". Speaking to broadcasters on a visit to Gloucestershire, he said: ""I don't think that it is good news for fans, I don't think it's good news for football in this country."" The 14 Premier League clubs not signed up to the ESL will meet on Tuesday to assess the proposals and consider a response. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Critics say the move is being driven purely by money, would destroy domestic leagues and is against the integrity of the sport. Unlike the Champions League, which teams must qualify for, the ESL would include the same 15 teams every year, with the remaining five qualifying annually. World governing body Fifa had previously said itwould not recognise such a competition,and any players involved could be denied the chance to play at a World Cup. Uefa, Europe's governing body, reiterated that warning on Sunday when it said players involved would be banned from all other competitions at domestic, European or world level and could be prevented from representing their national teams. After the ESL was announced, Fifa expressed its ""disapproval"" of the proposed competition and called on ""all parties involved in heated discussions to engage in calm, constructive and balanced dialogue for the good of the game"". The ESL has sent a letter to Fifa president Gianni Infantino and Uefa boss Aleksander Ceferin issuing notice of legal proceedings in European courts designed to block any sanctions the two governing bodies may try enforce over the formation of the ESL. In a statement, the ESL said: ""Going forward, the founding clubs look forward to holding discussions with Uefa and Fifa to work together in partnership to deliver the best outcomes for the new league and for football as a whole."" This video can not be played Dion Dublin & Danny Murphy discuss the plans for a European Super League There were talks in October, involving Wall Street bank JP Morgan, overa new Â£4.6bn competitionthat would replace the Champions League. Uefa had hoped the plans fora new 36-team Champions League- with reforms confirmed on Monday - would head off the formation of a Super League. However, the 12 sides involved in the Super League do not think the reforms go far enough. They said the global pandemic had ""accelerated the instability in the existing European football economic model"". ""In recent months, extensive dialogue has taken place with football stakeholders regarding the future format of European competitions,"" they added. ""The founding clubs believe the solutions proposed following these talks do not solve fundamental issues, including the need to provide higher-quality matches and additional financial resources for the overall football pyramid."" Super League: Why are football's biggest clubs starting a new tournament? Younger fans happier about prospect of breakaway league - December 2020 poll Tell us your thoughts on the proposals. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external The league will have 20 teams - the 12 founding members plus the three unnamed clubs they expect to join soon, and five sides who qualify annually according to their domestic achievements. Under the proposals, the ESL campaign would start in August each year, with midweek fixtures, and the clubs would be split into two groups of 10, playing each other home and away. The top three in each group would qualify for the quarter-finals, with the teams in fourth and fifth playing a two-legged play-off for the two remaining spots. From then on, it would have the same two-leg knockout format used in the Champions League before a single-leg final in May at a neutral venue. The ESL said it would generate more money than the Champions League and would result in a greater distribution of revenue throughout the game. Juventus and AC Milan have signed up to the breakaway league plans Real Madrid president Florentino Perez, the first chairman of the ESL, said the new competition would ""help football at every level"". ""Football is the only global sport in the world with more than four billion fans and our responsibility as big clubs is to respond to their desires,"" he added. Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli has resigned from the Uefa executive committee and as chairman of the European Club Association (ECA), which had pushed the planned Champions League reforms. He said the 12 clubs had ""come together at this critical moment, enabling European competition to be transformed, putting the game we love on a sustainable footing for the long-term future"". It is understood all 12 clubs have resigned from the ECA and their respective representatives from the ECA board. Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and Manchester City chief executive Ferran Soriano have also stood down from their roles at Uefa. Manchester United co-chairman Joel Glazer will be a vice-chairman of the Super League. He said: ""By bringing together the world's greatest clubs and players to play each other throughout the season, the Super League will open a new chapter for European football, ensuring world-class competition and facilities, and increased financial support for the wider football pyramid."" Meanwhile, Borussia Dortmund have said they will not be joining and are committed to the ECA, along with fellow German side Bayern Munich. Liverpool and Manchester United are the two most successful sides in English football history Essentially, widespread condemnation from anyone not involved in the proposed league. Johnson said the plans would be ""very damaging for football"". He said: ""These clubs are not just great global brands - of course they're great global brands - they're also clubs that have originated historically from their towns, from their cities, from their local communities, they should have a link with those fans, and with the fan base in their community. ""So it is very, very important that that continues to be the case. I don't like the look of these proposals, and we'll be consulting about what we can do."" France's President Emmanuel Macron welcomed French clubs refusing to join. Uefa released a joint statement with England's Football Association, the Premier League, the Spanish Football Federation, La Liga and the Italian Football Federation, as well as Serie A, saying they would ""remain united"" in trying to stop the breakaway, using ""all available measures"". The ECA said it ""strongly opposed"" the league, while the Football Supporters' Association said the plans were ""motivated by nothing but cynical greed"". World players' union Fifpro said it will ""vigorously oppose measures by either side that would impede the rights of players, such as exclusion from their national teams"". It added: ""This decision leaves players and their unions with many concerns and questions about its impact not only on the fabric and cultural identity of football but also more practically on their careers."" A protest sign outside Manchester United's Old Trafford ground The League Managers Association said a Super League would be ""catastrophically destabilising to the entire European football pyramid, with deep and far-reaching consequences"". It added: ""Closing off the top of the pyramid of European club football would immediately extinguish many of the ambitions and dreams that drive managers, coaches, players and fans."" Former Portugal midfielder Luis Figotweeted:,external""This greedy and callous move would spell disaster for our grassroots, for women's football, and the wider football community only to serve self-interested owners, who stopped caring about their fans long ago, and [show] complete disregard for sporting merit. Tragic."" Paris St-Germain and former Manchester United midfielder Ander Herreratweeted:,external""I fell in love with popular football, with the football of the fans, with the dream of seeing the team of my heart compete against the greatest. ""If this European super league advances, those dreams are over. ""I love football and I cannot remain silent about this, I believe in an improved Champions League, but not in the rich stealing what the people created."" Among ex-professionals, former Liverpool and Tottenham midfielder Danny Murphy told BBC Sport the plans ""sound soulless"", former Manchester United captain Gary Neville told Sky Sports he was ""absolutely disgusted"", while former team-mate Rio Ferdinand said on BT Sport that the proposals will hurt fans the most.

Fan groups associated with all six English clubs involved are strongly opposed to the Super League. Liverpool supporters' group Spirit of Shankly (SOS) said it was ""appalled"" by the decision of Fenway Sports Group, the club's US-based owner. In a social media post, SOS said: ""FSG have ignored fans in their relentless and greedy pursuit of money. Football is ours, not theirs. Our football club is ours not theirs."" Chelsea Supporters' Trust called the move ""unforgivable"" and said its members and ""football supporters across the world have experienced the ultimate betrayal"". The Arsenal Supporters' Trust called the club's agreement to join ""the death of Arsenal as a sporting institution"". Manchester City's Official Supporters Club said the move showed ""those involved have zero regard for the game's traditions"", adding it was ""determined to fight against this proposed Super League"". The Manchester United Supporters' Trust had earlier said the proposals were ""completely unacceptable"" and the ESL ""goes against everything football, and Manchester United, should stand for"". Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust said the ESL was a ""concept driven by avarice and self-interest at the expense of the intrinsic values of the game we hold so dear"". BBC Sport's Simon Stone If there was any lingering doubt over the desire of these 12 clubs to launch their own competition, it has been removed by their statement - reinforced by each of them through their own media platforms. So many questions remain unanswered. Chiefly, can they actually get their plan over the line given the strong resistance from Uefa and the leagues and associations of the countries concerned? But beyond that, who will the other three clubs be to make up the 15 founding members? Will Bayern Munich and Paris St-Germain eventually join up? And how will the other five clubs be decided? These discussions will be fascinating. But right now, the clubs who have signed up to the European Super League have a public relations battle to turn around perceptions - because initial reaction has been overwhelmingly negative.

"This video can not be played From February 2019: Is a European Super League the future of football? Talks have taken place over the creation of a new Â£4.6bn European Premier League, involving the top sides from across the continent. Sources told the BBC that discussions are still at an early stage but the plan would involve replacing the Champions League with a new format. Industry insiders confirmed talks involved Wall Street bank JP Morgan. But the project is said to still have a ""long way to go"" and the deal ""may not happen"". Reports suggest,externalfive Premier League clubs, including champions Liverpool and Manchester United, have been approached by those behind the plan with more than a dozen teams from England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain in negotiations about becoming founder members of the competition. It has also been reported that the European Premier League would see 18 sides compete in a single league with the top sides taking part in a play-off to determine an overall winner and that world governing body Fifa is involved. Last week Premier League clubsrejected 'Project Big Picture'- a proposal to reduce the league from 20 to 18 clubs and scrap the EFL Cup and Community Shield. It would also have seen more power transferred to the so-called 'big six' Premier League clubs. European football's governing body Uefa said it opposed the plan. ""The Uefa president has made it clear on many occasions that Uefa strongly opposes a Super League. ""The principles of solidarity, of promotion, relegation and open leagues are non-negotiable.  It is what makes European football work and the Champions League the best sports competition in the world. ""Uefa and the clubs are committed to build on such strength not to destroy it to create a super league of 10, 12, even 24 clubs, which would inevitably become boring."" Kevin Miles, chief executive of the Football Supporters' Association, said the idea of a European Super League shows that billionaire owners of clubs ""are out of control"". ""The latest reports of plots, allegedly involving Manchester United and Liverpool, to create a European Super League, expose the myth that billionaire owners care about the English football pyramid, or indeed anything other than their own greed,"" said Miles. ""This has to be the last nail in the coffin of the idea that football can be relied upon to regulate itself."" La Liga president Javier Tebas said: ""The authors of that idea - if they really exist, because there is nobody actually defending it - not only show a total ignorance of the organisation and customs of European and world football, but also a serious ignorance of the audiovisual rights markets. ""A project of this type will mean serious economic damage to the organisers themselves and to those entities that finance it, if they exist, because theyÂ´re never official.

Asked on Politics Wales if that was an admission schools had been underfunded while the party's sole Senedd member, Kirsty Williams, was responsible for the education portfolio, party leader Jane Dodds said: ""The local authorities are the responsible body for funding schools, and we need to look at how that funding happens. ""So it is about us making sure that there's parity, making sure that is fair funding."" A Welsh government commissioned report,published in October 2020, calculated total spending on schools in Wales in 2018-19 was Â£2.6bn, or about Â£6,000 per pupil - 6% lower in today's prices than the figure for 2009-10. Ms Dodds said: ""There's a need for us to look at how schools are funded, absolutely. ""But look at other issues around what we've done in education, smaller class sizes, we're funding holiday hunger, we're making sure that that doesn't happen, we have the new, very first ever made-in-Wales Welsh curriculum. ""Those are real advances in terms of what we're doing in education."" Vaughan Gething says the ""real choice"" in May's election is between Labour and the Tories Welsh Labour's Vaughan Gething said: ""The real choice at this election - as the numbers, the polling and the voter conversations tell us - is between Welsh Labour and the Tories in Wales. ""We all know that the Tories in Wales won't stand up to their London bosses. ""They never put the economic interests of Wales first, and will never speak out when Tory policies hit jobs in Wales.""

"This video can not be played FA Cup: Leicester City 1-0 Southampton highlights Leicester City boss Brendan Rodgers says his side have ""the chance to create history"" after reaching their first FA Cup final since 1969 at the expense of Southampton at Wembley. Kelechi Iheanacho's second-half goal proved decisive for the Foxes, whose last major final of any description came in 2000, when they lifted the League Cup. ""That is what this game is about, creating a memory,"" said Rodgers, who is yet to win major silverware in English football, but won seven trophies in less than three years as manager of Celtic. ""I have been made aware since I've been at Leicester how important this cup is for the supporters. ""We have the chance to create history. When we arrived here, that was the ambition. From a football perspective we wanted to be able to compete and we have been able to do that. Now we have a trophy to genuinely go for."" Iheanacho, who benefited from Jamie Vardy's fine work to score at the second attempt 10 minutes after the interval, added: ""It is a dream come true. I watched the FA Cup when I was little and now I get the chance to play in the final. ""I think the FA Cup loves me and I love the FA Cup."" The game was played in front of 4,000 supporters as part of a pilot scheme, with research being carried out on allowing fans back in to sporting events as coronavirus restrictions are eased. Tickets were limited to residents of Brent - the north London borough where Wembley Stadium is situated - and key workers. Those inside Wembley witnessed a mainly dour game but Leicester, playing in their first semi-final since 1982, will not care - and neither will their followers. Southampton were strangely lacking in intensity, barely threatening Leicester keeper Kasper Schmeichel. Ibrahima Diallo went closest to an equaliser for the Saints but his powerful drive went just wide. Rodgers' side will now face Chelsea in the final on 15 May, their first appearance in the showpiece since they lost 1-0 against Manchester City 52 years ago. Reaction as Leicester City reach the FA Cup final The past four FA Cup goals at Wembley have been scored by African players - Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Hakim Ziyech and Kelechi Iheanacho Leicester fully merited their victory as they were much the more composed and ordered side in a low-key semi-final with few chances. It took Iheanacho, who scored the winner against Brighton in the fifth round and was on target twice in the 3-1 win against Manchester United in the quarter-final, to make the decisive contribution. His goal secured a place in the final against Chelsea, who the Foxes beat in the Premier League in January. And while they will be underdogs, Leicester have enough quality and resilience to be quietly confident. This FA Cup final appearance is further evidence of the fine work being done by Rodgers, who also has Leicester right in the mix for the Champions League places next season. Now they have the chance to turn all this endeavour into silverware at Wembley against Thomas Tuchel's side. Southampton will leave Wembley with bitter regrets as they failed to produce anything near their best and can have no complaints about the outcome. They showed little of the intensity and energy that is their trademark when at their best under manager Ralph Hasenhuttl. The Saints lacked ambition and positive intent apart from a brief revival a couple of minutes after Leicester scored, when Diallo was not far off target and there was a scramble after a corner. Main marksman Danny Ings cut a frustrated figure, starved of service and reduced mainly to chasing lost causes. ""That such a goal decides such a game is a pity for us,"" said Hasenhuttl. ""In the end, especially in the final third, we didn't have good moments. We couldn't get a shot on goal and this is not enough."" This will be a real blow to Southampton, who fancied their chances in the FA Cup this season and had a big opportunity to reach the final, but they came up short and must now return to ensuring their Premier League status. This was the biggest crowd at a football match in England since the country went into lockdown in March last year - and what a glorious sound it was as the Leicester and Southampton players came out to cheers from 4,000 fans inside Wembley, reciprocating the gesture as they lined up before kick-off. It did not have the partisanship and passion of the tradition football crowd because this was a test and research event with only locals and key workers in attendance. There were moments, however, especially when Leicester scored and when Southampton substitute Theo Walcott came on to a very loud, mixed reception - presumably from Arsenal fans inside Wembley who idolised him from his time with the Gunners and Tottenham supporters who took the opposite view. There were resounding cheers when the supporters were thanked over the public address system for their attendance and the hope is that this test event will help navigate a route out of the behind-closed-doors occasions that have been the way of things during lockdown. The sight and sound of fans added to the spectacle, even when most of those watching this FA Cup semi-final were neutrals. Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers, speaking to BBC Sport:""It feels amazing. I thought we deserved it, the players worked so hard. Commiserations to Southampton, they are a terrific team. ""We got the goal which was a great piece of play by Jamie [Vardy]. We had two or three moments after that to close it out. When you are 1-0 up, you have to show that self-control and stay calm and we did that. ""Even thought there were only 4,000 fans, it felt great. It will be amazing when we get supporters back into stadiums. I did hear some Leicester supporters in there and it was really nice."" Southampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl, speaking to BBC Sport:""We conceded our first goal in the FA Cup. [It is] Hard to take because we haven't been the worst team. We tried to put pressure on them. We saw a not very good football game to be honest, with both teams a little nervous. ""We had the chance to get to the final. We will try again next year."" Leicester City have reached their first FA Cup final since 1969, a gap of 52 years, the longest between finals since Portsmouth went 69 and Cardiff went 81 between finals before facing one another in 2008. Southampton have now been eliminated in eight of their past 10 FA Cup semi-final appearances, two of which have come in the past four seasons (2017-18 vs Chelsea, 2020-21 vs Leicester). This was only Leicester's fourth win in 15 appearances at Wembley (D1 L10) and their first since the 2000 League Cup final against Tranmere, while Southampton have lost eight of their 10 matches at Wembley (W2), losing their last five in a row. Since his debut in the FA Cup in January 2016, Kelechi Iheanacho has scored more goals in the competition (first round onwards) than any other player, netting 14 times in 19 games. Iheanacho is the first Nigerian player to score 15 goals in all competitions in a season for a Premier League club since Odion Ighalo in 2015-16 for Watford, who scored 17. Southampton failed to have a single shot in the first half, the first time that had happened since November 2019 against Everton in a Premier League game. Only Sheffield United (13) have lost more games in all competitions in 2021 among Premier League clubs than Southampton (12). Jamie Vardy has gone 11 games without a goal in all competitions for Leicester, his longest goal drought since a run of 16 games between September - December 2016. Leicester return to action when they host West Bromwich Albion in the Premier League on Thursday, 22 April (20:00 BST). Southampton travel to Tottenham for their next match in the Premier League on Wednesday, 21 April (18:00 BST). Should we eat bacteria?:One simple thing that could improve your life!

"Liverpool and Chelsea are understood to be part of the group that have signed up to a breakaway league Uefa, the Premier League and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have condemned 12 major European clubs, including the 'big six' from England,signing up to a breakaway European Super League. Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham are part of the group. La Liga's Atletico Madrid, Barcelona and Real Madrid and Serie A's AC Milan, Inter Milan and Juventus are involved. Uefa said it will use ""all measures"" possible to stop the ""cynical project"". Senior figures at European football's governing body are furious about the proposals. This video can not be played Dion Dublin & Danny Murphy discuss the plans for a European Super League Johnson said the plans would be ""very damaging for football"" and that the UK government supports the sport's authorities ""in taking action"". He added: ""The clubs involved must answer to their fans and the wider footballing community before taking any further steps."" The European Clubs' Association (ECA), which represents Europe's clubs, held an emergency meeting on Sunday in the wake of the reports. BBC Sport understands none of the clubs mentioned in the Super League reports responded to a request to attend the meeting. The meeting was chaired by Ajax chief executive Edwin van der Sar. Bayern Munich and Paris St-Germain were among the clubs who were present. In a statement the ECA said it would be ""strongly opposed"" to a ""closed super league model"". It has pushedplans for a 36-team Champions League,which Uefa had hoped would head off the formation of a Super League. The Champions League reforms are set to be confirmed on Monday. BBC Sport was told last week of plans for some sort of confirmation about a European Super League. Uefa released a joint statement, together with England's Football Association, the Premier League, the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), La Liga, and the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) as well as Serie A, on Sunday. They said they will ""remain united"" in trying to stop the breakaway, using both judicial and sporting measures if required. They also reiterated Fifa's stance that players taking part in the Super League would be banned from all other competitions at domestic, European or world level and could be prevented from representing their national teams. In a separate statement, the Premier League said it condemned the proposal as it ""attacks the principles of open competition and sporting merit which are at the heart"" of domestic and European football. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said in a statement the government is ""concerned this plan could create a closed shop at the very top of our national game"". He added: ""We have a football pyramid where funds from the globally successful Premier League flow down the leagues and into local communities. This video can not be played A European Super League: The future of football? ""I would be bitterly disappointed to see any action that destroys that."" Labour leader Keir Starmer said the clubs involved should ""rethink immediately"" or ""face the consequences of their actions"". ""This proposal risks shutting the door on fans for good, reducing them to mere spectators and consumers,"" he said. Juventus owner Andrea Agnelli, Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and AC Milan chief executive Ivan Gazidis would all have had a significant input into the Champions League discussions on Friday. However, those clubs are among those to have broken ranks, to the fury of Uefa, whose president Aleksander Ceferin wanted to stave off a Super League threat. The Premier League said a European Super League would ""destroy"" the dream of fans that ""their team may climb to the top and play against the best"". It added such a league would ""undermine the appeal of the whole game"" and that they would work with the FA, the English Football League, Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), League Managers Association (LMA) and fans to ""defend the integrity and future prospects of English football"". Juventus and AC Milan have signed up to the breakaway league plans The FA said it will ""not provide permission to any competition that would be damaging to English football"" and will ""take any legal and/or regulatory action necessary"" to stop it. Bundesliga sides are opposed to the plans because the German model means commercial investors cannot have more than a 49% stake in clubs, so fans hold a majority of their own voting rights. French Ligue 1 side Paris St-Germain are not part of the group either. Uefa said it thanked ""those clubs in other countries, especially the French and German clubs, who have refused to sign up"" to the breakaway league. ""We call on all lovers of football, supporters and politicians, to join us in fighting against such a project if it were to be announced,"" it added. ""This persistent self-interest of a few has been going on for too long. Enough is enough."" Quite when the European Super League would start is unclear. However, world governing bodyFifa has already said it would not recognise such a competitionand any players involved in it would be denied the chance to play at a World Cup. Serie A has called an emergency board meeting to discuss the matter. The Football Supporters' Association said it is ""totally opposed"" to the plans, which it said were ""motivated by nothing but cynical greed"". It added: ""This competition is being created behind our backs by billionaire club owners who have zero regard for the game's traditions and continue to treat football as their personal fiefdom."" The PFA said it had ""substantial concerns"" about the proposal, adding it would ""detract from the strength and joy of domestic football and diminish the game for the vast majority of fans across the continent"". France's President Emmanuel Macron said he ""welcomes the position of French clubs to refuse to participate"" in a European Super League ""that threatens the principle of solidarity and sporting merit"". A statement from the French presidency added: ""The French state will support all the steps taken by the LFP [France's professional leagues governing body], FFF [France's football association], Uefa and Fifa to protect the integrity of federal competitions, whether national or European."" It has been agreed the new-look Champions League will involve an initial phase where every club plays 10 matches each rather than the current group phase. In addition there would be play-offs, followed by a knockout phase. The most controversial aspect of the proposals surround the allocation of the four additional places, with two being reserved for the clubs ranked highest in Uefa's coefficient table who fail to qualify for the Champions League through their domestic competition, but do secure some kind of European football. At the moment, Liverpool and Chelsea would be the clubs who benefited from that system if it was in place this season. Former Manchester United captain Gary Neville said he is ""absolutely disgusted"" by the plans. ""I'm a Manchester United fan and have been for 40 years,"" Neville, who also co-owns League Two club Salford City, told Sky Sports. ""It's an absolute disgrace. ""Honestly, we have to wrestle back the power in this country from the clubs at the top of this league and that includes my club."" The former England defender said the six English clubs involved should be docked points and fined. ""It's pure greed,"" Neville said. ""They're [the club's owners] imposters. ""They're nothing to do with football in this country. There's 100-odd years of history in this country of fans who have lived and loved these clubs. ""We're in the middle of a pandemic and an economic crisis. Football clubs in the [semi-professional] National League are going bust, furloughing players and these lot are having Zoom calls about breaking away. ""Dock them all points tomorrow. Put them at the bottom of the league and take the money off them. Seriously. You have to stamp on this.""

"This video can not be played From February 2019: Is a European Super League the future of football? Talks have taken place over the creation of a new Â£4.6bn European Premier League, involving the top sides from across the continent. Sources told the BBC that discussions are still at an early stage but the plan would involve replacing the Champions League with a new format. Industry insiders confirmed talks involved Wall Street bank JP Morgan. But the project is said to still have a ""long way to go"" and the deal ""may not happen"". Reports suggest,externalfive Premier League clubs, including champions Liverpool and Manchester United, have been approached by those behind the plan with more than a dozen teams from England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain in negotiations about becoming founder members of the competition. It has also been reported that the European Premier League would see 18 sides compete in a single league with the top sides taking part in a play-off to determine an overall winner and that world governing body Fifa is involved. Last week Premier League clubsrejected 'Project Big Picture'- a proposal to reduce the league from 20 to 18 clubs and scrap the EFL Cup and Community Shield. It would also have seen more power transferred to the so-called 'big six' Premier League clubs. European football's governing body Uefa said it opposed the plan. ""The Uefa president has made it clear on many occasions that Uefa strongly opposes a Super League. ""The principles of solidarity, of promotion, relegation and open leagues are non-negotiable.  It is what makes European football work and the Champions League the best sports competition in the world. ""Uefa and the clubs are committed to build on such strength not to destroy it to create a super league of 10, 12, even 24 clubs, which would inevitably become boring."" Kevin Miles, chief executive of the Football Supporters' Association, said the idea of a European Super League shows that billionaire owners of clubs ""are out of control"". ""The latest reports of plots, allegedly involving Manchester United and Liverpool, to create a European Super League, expose the myth that billionaire owners care about the English football pyramid, or indeed anything other than their own greed,"" said Miles. ""This has to be the last nail in the coffin of the idea that football can be relied upon to regulate itself."" La Liga president Javier Tebas said: ""The authors of that idea - if they really exist, because there is nobody actually defending it - not only show a total ignorance of the organisation and customs of European and world football, but also a serious ignorance of the audiovisual rights markets. ""A project of this type will mean serious economic damage to the organisers themselves and to those entities that finance it, if they exist, because theyÂ´re never official.

"Yulia and Sergei Skripal both survived being poisoned in March last year A senior Russian military intelligence officer commanded the team suspected of the Salisbury poisoning, evidence uncovered by the BBC's Newsnight and the investigative website Bellingcat suggests. Details of the ""third man's"" trip to London in March 2018 have been assembled after the investigative website obtained his phone records and shared them with the BBC. In February,Bellingcat published information,externalidentifying Denis Sergeyev as a man who travelled to London under the false identity of Sergei Fedotov. They also established details of his career and connection to his country's military intelligence service, known by its Russian acronym, the GRU, and linked him to a 2015 suspected poisoning in Bulgaria. 'Stop irresponsible activity,' May tells Putin What happened to the Skripals? The website behind the Skripal revelation Newsnight understands that Denis Sergeyev holds the rank of major general in the GRU. The other two men (Alexander Mishkin and Anatoly Chepiga) are colonels. The pattern of his communications while in the UK indicates that Maj Gen Sergeyev liaised with officers in Moscow. Independently, sources speaking to Newsnight have pointed to Maj Gen Sergeyev being the operational commander. The developments come as Prime Minister Theresa Maycalled for an end to Russia's ""irresponsible and destabilising activity"", describing the Salisbury poisoning as a ""truly despicable act"". Russia denies any involvement in the attack. Evidence suggests Denis Sergeyev ran the operation to poison the Skripals Maj Gen Sergeyev arrived at London's Heathrow airport on the morning of Friday 2 March, and left on the afternoon of Sunday 4 March, after Novichok nerve agent was placed on the Skripals' front door handle in Salisbury, Wiltshire. Analysis by Bellingcat of position data from his phone shows that he stayed near Paddington station in west London, whereas the other men took a room in Bow, east London. During his visit, Maj Gen Sergeyev shunned wi-fi networks, using 4G and 3G connections to access the internet hundreds of times. His billing records show that he used secure messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Viber and Telegram, which might have been the way that he communicated with the other suspected members of his team. Although he spent much of his 2018 visit to the UK secreted away in Paddington, the phone data shared with Newsnight shows that on the morning of 3 March, Maj Gen Sergeyev made his way to the centre of the city, passing by Oxford Circus on his way to the Thames Embankment. It was there, as shown by correlating his position data with police information about the other suspects, that there was a 30 to 40-minute window when Maj Gen Sergeyev could have met the others before they caught a train from nearby Waterloo station to carry out their final reconnaissance in Salisbury. Police are still probing the questions of when Mr Chepiga and Mr Mishkin were given the Novichok nerve agent and how they disposed of it on 4 March. In addition to contaminating Mr Skripal, his daughter Yulia and Det Sgt Nick Bailey, in July 2018 the poison claimed the life of Dawn Sturgess and caused her partner Charlie Rowley - who found the discarded Novichok container - to fall ill. Bellingcat has established that while travelling to the UK and on all of the other operational trips he made during 2017-18, Maj Gen Sergeyev only spoke to a single telephone number, a Russian ""ghost mobile"" believed to be his connection to GRU headquarters. Although it resembles a pay as you go SIM, this number produces no cell tower or IMEI (the unique serial identifying the handset using a SIM card) information, and has for years remained unregistered to any individual, a violation of Russian law. Maj Gen Sergeyev took 10 calls from the Russian number while in London - and phoned it himself before departing Paddington on Sunday 4 March. While he was booked to leave on the same flight that evening as Colonels Chepiga and Mishkin, it is now believed that Maj Gen Sergeyev took an earlier flight home from Heathrow that afternoon. He left about an hour after police say the others planted the Novichok at Mr Skripal's home. Records show that, using his Sergei Fedotov alias, Maj Gen Sergeyev had visited the UK before, in 2016 and 2017. On the latter occasion, almost exactly one year before the poisoning, Colonel Mishkin was also in the country at the same time. Investigators believe that the Salisbury plan may have taken shape during this 2017 visit. Police had previously identified other suspects Although the evidence suggests long-term GRU surveillance of Mr Skripal and his daughter,as well as planning for an operation, it seems that the decision to take action in March 2018 may have been a last minute one. Christo Grozev from Bellingcat says the phone records show Maj Gen Sergeyev ""frantically calling travel agents"" on 1 March in order to book flights to London. Bellingcat's coup in obtaining his phone records follows its success in accessing travel, passport, and motoring databases for the suspects. Separately, journalists from the BBC Russian Service discovered that Maj Gen Sergeyev's wife works as a teacher in Moscow and that the couple listed the address of the GRU training academy as their own home on an official registry. Contacted in February, Mrs Sergeyeva described claims that her husband was part of the Salisbury operation as ""a fairy story"". Responding to Newsnight's story, the Metropolitan Police said: ""The investigation team continues to pursue a number of lines of inquiry, including identifying any other suspects who may have been involved in carrying out or planning the attack. We are not prepared to discuss further details of what remains an ongoing investigation.""

"This video can not be played George Eustice: ""Rishi Sunak didn't do any favour for Greensill or David Cameron"" The government will examine suggestions to improve lobbying rules after a series of inquiries, the environment secretary has pledged. George Eustice said current systems were ""quite robust"" but it was possible they could be ""tweaked or improved"". He said David Cameron's actions were ""acceptable"" when he lobbied ministers on behalf of finance firm Greensill Capital. But Labour said the row over the ex-PM's work had eroded trust in politics. A government review and three separate MP-led inquiries are now looking into Mr Cameron's attempts to lobby ministers on behalf of Greensill. His work for the firm, which collapsed in March, has prompted increased scrutiny of private companies' attempts to influence ministers and officials. What is the David Cameron lobbying row about? Government launches probe into Cameron's lobbying Johnson urged to launch 'full' Cameron inquiry Mr Cameron began working as an adviser to Greensill in August 2018, just over two years after he stood down as PM in July 2016. He has been criticised for unsuccessfully trying to help the firm, in which he had a financial interest, gain access to government-backed Covid schemes, including bysending text messagesto Chancellor Rishi Sunak. He also met Health Secretary Matt Hancock in 2019 for a ""private drink"" todiscuss a new payment schemefor NHS staff developed by the firm. Currently, former ministers are not allowed to lobby government for two years after they leave office - a rule the ex-PM appears to have followed. But critics of the current system, including former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown, have suggested a longer ban is required. All external lobbyists also have to list their work on a special register - although as an in-house employee, Mr Cameronwas not required to do this. Mr Cameron quit Downing Street in the wake of the 2016 Brexit referendum Asked whether Mr Cameron's work for the firm was acceptable, Mr Eustice told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: ""Well it is acceptable obviously, because he would have worked within the rules."" Mr Eustice said that all current cabinet ministers will be asked to declare contact with the firm as part of the government review, to be led by lawyer Nigel Boardman. ""Once it's concluded, and once all those parliamentary committees that are now looking at this have concluded, I'm sure some of them will make policy recommendations. ""And of course the government will look at that. I'm not saying that things couldn't be tweaked or improved."" The terms of reference for the government's own review,externalsay Mr Boardman will report ""findings and any recommendations"" to Prime Minister Boris Johnson by the end of June. Speaking earlier to Sky's Sophy Ridge, Mr Eustice said that review was ""not really there to prescribe policy"" and would not have enforcement powers. It's another word for trying to persuade the government to change its policies It can be done by individuals, companies, organisations and charities who contact ministers, backbench MPs and other politicians Some organisations and companies employ professional lobbyists to make their case for them Former MPs and civil servants often work as lobbyists Read more: What jobs can ex-ministers do and what are the rules? Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said the Greensill affair showed the need for stricter lobbying rules. She told the Marr programme that the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which advises former ministers and civil servants on outside employment, should be given greater powers. ""We are seeing the erosion of trust in our politics because of the behaviour by a few at the top of the Conservative Party,"" she added. This video can not be played Rachel Reeves says the Greensill lobbying crisis is ""tip of the iceberg"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who was energy secretary under Mr Cameron during the Tory-Lib Dem coalition government, said ""much greater transparency"" over lobbying was required. He suggested the code which governs the behaviour of current ministers should be overseen by an ""independent body"" similar to the one that oversees MPs' expenses. Meanwhile, senior Tory MP Sir Bernard Jenkin has warned Mr Johnson he could lose trust from former Labour voters in ""red wall"" constituencies they won in the last election - unless he can show he is more transparent. Writing in the Observer newspaper,external, Sir Bernard said the current system had ""allowed the lines between public service and private gain to become blurred"". He said there had been a ""failure of successive governments"" to be more transparent about the relationships between administrations and business. Mr Cameron has defended his work for Greensill but accepted he should have contacted ministers using more formal channels. He has said he welcomes the government review andwill ""respond positively""to any requests from MPs for him to give evidence.

"Blossoms will headline the gig at Liverpool's Sefton Park Music fans in Liverpool are to get the chance to enjoy a near-normal gig as part of a government pilot event. A crowd of 5,000 will see headline act Blossoms without having to social-distance or wear face coverings. But they will only get into the 2 May event by having a negative Covid test. Meanwhile, the FA Cup semi-final between Leicester City and Southampton at London's Wembley Stadium will host a crowd of 4,000 later as part of a series of government trial events. On Sunday, the UK recorded 1,882 new Covid cases and 10 deaths within 28 days of a positive test,according to the latest government figures,external. The number of deaths recorded over the weekend tends to be lower because of reporting delays. More than 32.8 million people have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while more than 9.9 million people have had their second dose. Cinema trial organisers targeted by anti-vax activists Trials to begin for return of England mass events The outdoor concert at Sefton Park will operate below its capacity of 7,500. Ticket-holders will be required to take a lateral flow test, which can produce a result within 30 minutes, at a local testing centre before entry, the Department for Digital Culture Media and Sport said. Attendees will also be asked to take a test after the concert - and will have to provide contact details to NHS Test and Trace to ensure they can be reached if someone who attended tests positive. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""We're one step closer to a summer of live events now our science-led programme is under way. ""Testing different settings and looking at different mitigations is key to getting crowds back safely."" ""I hope it won't be too much longer until gigs are back for good,"" he added. Announcing Blossoms as headliners, Claire McColgan, director of Culture Liverpool, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Breakfast it was nearly two years since the city had held outdoor mass-attendance events. She said scientists would assess how attendees move and respond during the gig, and voluntary tests taken afterwards will be used to identify any infections that might arise. ""The stuff you see on stage is just a tiny, tiny part of it,"" she said. ""It's loads of people's jobs - it's 60,000 jobs across our city region."" Blossoms are an indie-pop band from Stockport, Manchester Tom Ogden is the lead vocalist, Charlie Salt is on bass, Josh Dewhurst on lead guitar, Joe Donovan on drums and Myles Kellock on keyboards 2016 was a major breakthrough year for the band, when their self-titled debut album landed at number one on the official albums chart Their most-streamed songs on Spotify are Charlemagne, There's A Reason Why (I Never Returned Your Calls), and Your Girlfriend They were on a UK tour as the coronavirus pandemic struck in March 2020 - with their biggest gig at Manchester Arena cancelled during the first lockdown They are hoping to perform at the Victorious, TRNSMT and Kendal Calling festivals later this year Source: Official Charts, Spotify, and@BlossomsBand,external Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the results from the concert would ""inform our approach to ensuring future big events can take place safely"". The event will be organised by music promoter Festival Republic in partnership with Culture Liverpool. Greg Parmley, chief executive of Live, the UK's live music industry body, said the outdoor pilot was ""a hugely positive development and brings the summer festival season one step closer"".

The government is trialling crowds at a series of events in England. The first of these - the World Snooker Championships -began on Saturday, with a reduced crowd of 213 watching at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre. Organisers hope the crowd will be at its full capacity of 980 by the final on 2 May. Other events planned as part of the pilot schemeinclude other events in Liverpool including an evening at an indoor nightclub, a business conference and a cinema screening. A mass-participation 6.2 mile (10km) run was scheduled for later this month at Hatfield Park in Hertfordshire buthas since been postponed,external. Under the government's roadmap for easing lockdown in England, large events can restart from 17 May at the earliest - but with limits on audience numbers - and nightclubs will be able to reopen no earlier than 21 June. The Welsh governmentis planning to hold a series of pilot events for audiences of up to 1,000 people after 12 April. A target date for the restart of large events in Scotland and Northern Ireland has not yet been set. Meanwhile, leaders of the UK's biggest hospitality businesses have signed an open letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson urging him to ""stick"" with England's roadmap to reopen the economy. The letterin the Sunday Telegraph,external, signed by the chief executives of Mitchells & Butlers, Fuller's, Young's, JD Wetherspoon, Pizza Hut and Alton Towers owner Merlin, said two-thirds of hospitality venues ""couldn't open outdoors from 12 April, and none is breaking even"". The signatories added: ""The prime minister set out the right path. He should stick to it and not let it be derailed by talk of vaccine passports in pubs and restaurants."" Sefton Park in Liverpool hosted capacity crowds the summer before the pandemic struck The Night Time Industries Association admitted the reopening of outdoor hospitality in England had led to a ""challenging"" weekend. The association's Michael Kill told BBC Breakfast: ""As you can appreciate it is a very challenging environment. It's great to be back - it's been a very busy weekend and the majority of customers have adhered to measures that have been put in place by the businesses."" ""I think there is going to be a bit of a bedding in period for people to get used to things and for things to settle - particularly over the first weekend,"" he added.

A Southampton fan is ready for the FA Cup semi final match with Leicester City at Wembley Stadium We are going to be bringing our coronavirus updates to a close shortly so here's a recap of the news we've been reporting today: Claire Morris of the Nantybwch and Waundeg community group and Ffion Cudlip, a film student with Cymru Creations which set up the project, were two of the volunteers A ""remarkable"" documentary about a community coming together during the pandemic has won a European film award. Volunteers in Blaenau Gwent in Wales were filmed as they completed 15,000 tasks including delivering food and prescriptions to those self-isolating. The documentary, called Together - Volunteers of a Covid community, won two awards at theNorth Europe Fusion International Film Festival,external, including best film. Festival director Steve Grossmith says: ""A big part of why this film was chosen was because this group of film-makers are selfless and the work they have done is incredible...What they have done is nothing short of remarkable."" Alison RobertsPortugal Correspondent Smaller shops in Portugal were able to open earlier in April Portugal will continue its lockdown easing on Monday with shopping
centres and the largest on-street shops allowed to open for the first
time in two months, and pupils returning to school, in most areas. Though coronavirus cases are rising again in the country,
it still has the lowest infection rate in the European Union, at a time
when most of the bloc is tightening restrictions. As well as all retail
and services being allowed to function more or less normally, cafÃ©s and
restaurants will be able to serve customers indoors  - up to four per table
- as well as outdoors. Medium-risk sports such as basketball will be
allowed as well as outdoor exercise with up to six people. But in 10
municipalities where infection rates are higher, restrictions are being
kept in place or, in some cases, tightened. This video can not be played Football's forgotten faces tell us why they look forward to going back to stadiums From the stadium announcers to the caterers and to the fans themselves, the closure of sports venues has hit many people hard. Here some of football's forgotten faces tell us about how they are feeling about the return of spectators. Here's a look at how people across England are enjoying the spring weekend weather after coronavirus restrictions eased to allow more reasons for groups to meet outside. Waterside views proved a big draw as families and friends headed to the beach or river to relax in the sunshine. And people enjoyed a bite to eat and a refreshing drink outside pubs and restaurants which are now able to serve outdoors. If you're making planshere's a reminderof what's allowed now and what's coming next in the roadmap out of lockdown. People make their way along the seafront on Bournemouth beach in Dorset Kite flyers on a hill at Northala Fields in west London A man and his dog paddleboard along the River Cam in Cambridge People relax on bank of the River Thames in Richmond The number of daily coronavirus infections recorded in the UK has dropped below 2,000 for only the second time in more than seven months. As we reported earlier this hour, the government's daily figures show 1,882 new infections have been reported today. Last Sunday, that figure was 1,730. But the last time cases fell below 2,000 before that was 5 September 2020 when the total was 1,813. By contrast, in late December and early January the number of daily cases was more than 60,000 a few times - the highest figure was 81,529 on 29 December. Meanwhile, the number of people who have had both doses of coronavirus vaccine is edging closer to 10 million. Currently 9,930,846 people have had their first and second dose. But clinics across the UK could hit the 10 million milestone today and it could be announced in tomorrow's figures. Australia is in no rush to reopen its international borders and risk jeopardising its almost completely coronavirus-free lifestyle, Prime Minister Scott Morrison says. Australia shut its borders to all non-citizens and non-residents more than a year ago. This, along with local lockdowns and swift contact tracing, has meant Australia has avoided the worst of the pandemic, with about 29,500 cases and 910 deaths. With the exception of the occasional snap lockdown, Australians have been able to eat out, gather relatively freely and stop wearing face masks in most places for months. ""Australia is in no hurry to open those borders, I assure you,"" Morrison says in a televised briefing. ""I will not be putting at risk the way we are living in this country, which is so different to the rest of the world today."" The UK has given a total of 42,780,069 coronavirus vaccinations,according to the government's daily statistics.,external That's 32,849,223 first doses and 9,930,846 second doses. You can use ourpostcode look-up toolto find out how many people have been vaccinated in your area. A further 10 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,the government's daily figures show.,external That brings the total number of people to die within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test to 127,270. There were also 1,882 new cases detected. A ""huge"" backlog of patients in England caused by Covid-19 could take years to clear, NHS Providers says. The organisation, which represents every NHS hospital, and mental health, community and ambulance service in England, says tackling the problem in the worst-affected areas could take three to five years. According to data from NHS England,4.7 million people were waiting to start treatmentat the end of February - the highest figure since records began in August 2007. The number waiting more than 52 weeks to start hospital treatment was 387,885 - the highest for any calendar month since December 2007. NHS Providers is calling for a ""bold transformative approach"" with additional funding from the government to clear the backlog in a reasonable period of time. Its chief executive Chris Hopson says: ""We need to work together over the next few months to create a joint plan to deliver for patients and service users to be announced in the multi-year spending review we are expecting at the end of the year."" A Department of Health spokesman says the NHS has ""faced significant challenges over the past year"" and the government is backing the service with an extra Â£7bn this year. As England enjoys eased lockdown restrictions - allowing outdoor eating and drinking at pubs, bars and restaurants - we've been answering your questions. Frank Shaw, from Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria asks: ""When pubs open will bar staff have to wear face masks and/or visors when serving?"" The answer is yes. By law, staff working in venues that provide food and drink are required to wear face coverings (similar to masks), unless they have an exemption. Thegovernment guidance for the hospitality sector in England,externalsays a face visor or shield may be worn in addition to a face covering - but not instead of one. This is because face visors or shields âdo not adequately cover the nose and mouth, and do not filter airborne particlesâ. The owners of pubs, restaurants and cafes are also being urgedto put other measures in place when they reopen,external- including completing Covid risk assessments, cleaning more often and providing adequate ventilation. You can read the answers to more coronavirus questions, and ask your own,here. A Church of Ireland rector described as one of the church's ""most likeable people"" hasdied at the age of 46 with Covid-19. The Reverend John Anderson, rector of Billy and Derrykeighan in County Antrim, died on Saturday morning after going into intensive care. He was admitted to Causeway Hospital just over a week ago. He leaves behind his wife Eleanor and three young children. The Bishop of Connor, Right Reverend George Davison, says his death had come ""as a terrible shock to us all"". Israelis have been able to walk outside without masks today for the first time in a year. About 81% of citizens or residents over 16 are fully vaccinated against Covid-19. The government announced this week masks would no longer be required in public outdoor spaces. Protective masks outdoors had been made compulsory a year ago for non-exercise activities. ""It's very strange but it's very nice,"" Eliana Gamulka, 26, tells the AFP news agency after getting off a bus in Jerusalem. ""You can't pretend that you don't know anyone any more,"" she smiles. Israel boasts one of the world's fastest inoculation campaigns. But that is in stark contrast to the West Bank and the blockaded Gaza Strip, where infection rates remain high and vaccinations are low. There have been monks on Caldey Island since the 6th Century A holy Welsh island cut off from the rest of the world by the pandemic can reopen to visitors now all the monks living there have been vaccinated. NHS staffferried first and second jabs to Caldey Island from Tenby. The island, which is home to just 40 people - including about 18 Cistercian monks - will reopen to tourist boat trips from 1 May. Islanders say the medics appeared ""like angels"" in wet weather as they carried a box of vaccines on to the island. The health board's primary care director Jill Paterson says: ""This is definitely one of our moreunique vaccination clinics to reach our communities."" The crisis caused by the pandemic has forced a growing number of people to depend on food donations The queue snakes around the block and each day it gets longer: hungry residents of Heliopolis, SÃ£o Paulo's largest favela, waiting in line for the handout that will keep them going until the next morning. They are given a bowl of pasta with meat and a portion of rice, two packets of biscuits and a carton of milk, shared between a whole household and usually their only meal of the day. Before the pandemic, 300 people would queue up here. Now it is more than 1,000, and the charity that runs it has 650 others across SÃ£o Paulo. ""The vast majority of people who live in the favelas work in the informal economy, as cleaners in homes or helping to bake cakes, so when businesses close or houses stop using them, they feel the impact,"" says Marcivan Barreto, the local co-ordinator. ""You see people queuing up at 03:00 for food. I'm very worried that as the pandemic continues, a hungry father will start looting supermarkets. When you're starving, despair hits."" Read more here. Fans will return to Wembley Stadium later for the FA Cup semi-final between Leicester and Southampton. The match will have 4,000 fans, withtickets limited to Brent residents and key workers.

"Liverpool and Chelsea are understood to be part of the group that have signed up to a breakaway league Uefa, the Premier League and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have condemned 12 major European clubs, including the 'big six' from England,signing up to a breakaway European Super League. Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham are part of the group. La Liga's Atletico Madrid, Barcelona and Real Madrid and Serie A's AC Milan, Inter Milan and Juventus are involved. Uefa said it will use ""all measures"" possible to stop the ""cynical project"". Senior figures at European football's governing body are furious about the proposals. This video can not be played Dion Dublin & Danny Murphy discuss the plans for a European Super League Johnson said the plans would be ""very damaging for football"" and that the UK government supports the sport's authorities ""in taking action"". He added: ""The clubs involved must answer to their fans and the wider footballing community before taking any further steps."" The European Clubs' Association (ECA), which represents Europe's clubs, held an emergency meeting on Sunday in the wake of the reports. BBC Sport understands none of the clubs mentioned in the Super League reports responded to a request to attend the meeting. The meeting was chaired by Ajax chief executive Edwin van der Sar. Bayern Munich and Paris St-Germain were among the clubs who were present. In a statement the ECA said it would be ""strongly opposed"" to a ""closed super league model"". It has pushedplans for a 36-team Champions League,which Uefa had hoped would head off the formation of a Super League. The Champions League reforms are set to be confirmed on Monday. BBC Sport was told last week of plans for some sort of confirmation about a European Super League. Uefa released a joint statement, together with England's Football Association, the Premier League, the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), La Liga, and the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) as well as Serie A, on Sunday. They said they will ""remain united"" in trying to stop the breakaway, using both judicial and sporting measures if required. They also reiterated Fifa's stance that players taking part in the Super League would be banned from all other competitions at domestic, European or world level and could be prevented from representing their national teams. In a separate statement, the Premier League said it condemned the proposal as it ""attacks the principles of open competition and sporting merit which are at the heart"" of domestic and European football. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said in a statement the government is ""concerned this plan could create a closed shop at the very top of our national game"". He added: ""We have a football pyramid where funds from the globally successful Premier League flow down the leagues and into local communities. This video can not be played A European Super League: The future of football? ""I would be bitterly disappointed to see any action that destroys that."" Labour leader Keir Starmer said the clubs involved should ""rethink immediately"" or ""face the consequences of their actions"". ""This proposal risks shutting the door on fans for good, reducing them to mere spectators and consumers,"" he said. Juventus owner Andrea Agnelli, Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and AC Milan chief executive Ivan Gazidis would all have had a significant input into the Champions League discussions on Friday. However, those clubs are among those to have broken ranks, to the fury of Uefa, whose president Aleksander Ceferin wanted to stave off a Super League threat. The Premier League said a European Super League would ""destroy"" the dream of fans that ""their team may climb to the top and play against the best"". It added such a league would ""undermine the appeal of the whole game"" and that they would work with the FA, the English Football League, Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), League Managers Association (LMA) and fans to ""defend the integrity and future prospects of English football"". Juventus and AC Milan have signed up to the breakaway league plans The FA said it will ""not provide permission to any competition that would be damaging to English football"" and will ""take any legal and/or regulatory action necessary"" to stop it. Bundesliga sides are opposed to the plans because the German model means commercial investors cannot have more than a 49% stake in clubs, so fans hold a majority of their own voting rights. French Ligue 1 side Paris St-Germain are not part of the group either. Uefa said it thanked ""those clubs in other countries, especially the French and German clubs, who have refused to sign up"" to the breakaway league. ""We call on all lovers of football, supporters and politicians, to join us in fighting against such a project if it were to be announced,"" it added. ""This persistent self-interest of a few has been going on for too long. Enough is enough."" Quite when the European Super League would start is unclear. However, world governing bodyFifa has already said it would not recognise such a competitionand any players involved in it would be denied the chance to play at a World Cup. Serie A has called an emergency board meeting to discuss the matter. The Football Supporters' Association said it is ""totally opposed"" to the plans, which it said were ""motivated by nothing but cynical greed"". It added: ""This competition is being created behind our backs by billionaire club owners who have zero regard for the game's traditions and continue to treat football as their personal fiefdom."" The PFA said it had ""substantial concerns"" about the proposal, adding it would ""detract from the strength and joy of domestic football and diminish the game for the vast majority of fans across the continent"". France's President Emmanuel Macron said he ""welcomes the position of French clubs to refuse to participate"" in a European Super League ""that threatens the principle of solidarity and sporting merit"". A statement from the French presidency added: ""The French state will support all the steps taken by the LFP [France's professional leagues governing body], FFF [France's football association], Uefa and Fifa to protect the integrity of federal competitions, whether national or European."" It has been agreed the new-look Champions League will involve an initial phase where every club plays 10 matches each rather than the current group phase. In addition there would be play-offs, followed by a knockout phase. The most controversial aspect of the proposals surround the allocation of the four additional places, with two being reserved for the clubs ranked highest in Uefa's coefficient table who fail to qualify for the Champions League through their domestic competition, but do secure some kind of European football. At the moment, Liverpool and Chelsea would be the clubs who benefited from that system if it was in place this season. Former Manchester United captain Gary Neville said he is ""absolutely disgusted"" by the plans. ""I'm a Manchester United fan and have been for 40 years,"" Neville, who also co-owns League Two club Salford City, told Sky Sports. ""It's an absolute disgrace. ""Honestly, we have to wrestle back the power in this country from the clubs at the top of this league and that includes my club."" The former England defender said the six English clubs involved should be docked points and fined. ""It's pure greed,"" Neville said. ""They're [the club's owners] imposters. ""They're nothing to do with football in this country. There's 100-odd years of history in this country of fans who have lived and loved these clubs. ""We're in the middle of a pandemic and an economic crisis. Football clubs in the [semi-professional] National League are going bust, furloughing players and these lot are having Zoom calls about breaking away. ""Dock them all points tomorrow.

"The unpredictable Welsh weather means most people have been caught in a downpour at some stage There are few things more predictable in Wales than rain. Areas of Snowdonia and Powys see high levels, with much of it collected in reservoirs to provide water. So, why are we not harnessing more renewable energy from the grey clouds that often hover ominously in the sky? We asked readers what they'd do if they ran Wales, and Andrew Fullman, of Cardiff, said he'd like hydroelectric reservoirs to be considered after the Senedd election on 6 May. The 51-year-old has heard politicians advocate the use of solar panels, wind turbines on land and at sea, and even examine a tidal barrage as we try to cut carbon emissions and provide greener energy. Could floating turbines power our homes? How much water does Wales pump to England? He now wants a commission to examine the viability of utilising reservoirs more, adding: ""We have over 100 in Wales, the infrastructure is already there. ""There can't be many places that have as many reservoirs as us, certainly not in terms of the size of the area, and we supply half of England with water. ""So let's put it to some use."" WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage This video can not be played Water from Lake Vyrnwy helps supply people in Liverpool and Cheshire According to the Met Office, areas of Snowdonia and Powys, as well as locations in the Scottish Highlands and the Lake District, receivemore than four metres,external(13ft) of rainfall a year. Mr Fullman believes this puts sites such as Lake Vyrnwy in Powys, Llyn Conwy in north-west Wales and Ystradfellte Reservoir in the Brecon Beacons in a prime position to provide energy as they export water to our taps. Andrew Fullman believes rainy days should be seen as an energy opportunity There are currently363 hydropower projectsin Wales, which use turbines to generate electricity as water flows through, and contribute 2% of the country's needs. While some reservoirs, such as Caban Coch in the Elan Valley, produce this form of renewable power, most are small initiatives, such as farmers using streams running through their land. However,a grant scheme for theseends this month. Much renewables focus has been on wind farms - with one capable of generating enoughenergy to power 3.4 million homesproposed off the north Wales coast. There are also plans to putfloating turbines in the Celtic Seaabout 28 miles (45km) off Pembrokeshire. A Â£1.3bn tidal lagoon was also explored in Swansea, butplans did not progressafter the UK government decided not to back them. Some proposals have been controversial, such asthe Parc Solar Traffwll developmenton Anglesey, which supermarket giant Tesco plans to source renewable energy from. Leaders debate:If you would like to be part of the virtual audience for the BBC Wales Election 2021 Leaders Debate on 29 April, please email us your details to waleslive@bbc.co.uk. Mr Fullman believes reservoirs could be an alternative, adding: ""The infrastructure is already there, with water running through them. ""Any hydroelectric plant could be incorporated into the countryside, which would not affect the beauty of the landscape such as when you put big (wind) turbines there."" Another big plus, he said, was ""it rains all the time"" in Wales, making it ""an endless supply of energy"". The Cofiwch Dryweryn mural, remembering the village of Tryweryn, has been vandalised and repainted many times The large volumes supply people in Wales, with billions of litres also exported over the border each year to homes in England. For example, Severn Trent's water from the Elan Valley reservoirsmostly goes to customers in Birminghamvia a 63-mile (102km) aqueduct which has been in use for 100 years. Some reservoir developments in Wales, though, have proved controversial. There was an outcry in 1965 when 70 people were forced to leave their homes in Capel Celyn before their houses, the village school, chapel and post office vanished under millions of litres of water for the new Tryweryn reservoir, built to service Liverpool more than 60 miles (95km) away. In 2005, Liverpool City Council apologised, saying: ""We realise the hurt of 40 years ago when the Tryweryn Valley was transformed into a reservoir to help meet the water needs of Liverpool."" From the parties' manifestos it would seem that the environment has shot up the list of priorities at this election. But it's no surprise given the scale of the challenge involved in responding to climate change and Wales' new legally binding targets to eliminate greenhouse gases by 2050. A lot of spadework needs to be done by the next government. Many will see it as an opportunity to secure a ""green recovery"" from the pandemic. And on renewable energy - Welsh ministers have in recent years gained extra powers and more say over larger schemes. Mr Fullman added: ""We may as well put it all to good use. How much energy could it provide? When it rains more, we could be producing more energy. ""With solar power, you need the panels everywhere, but when there is less sunlight, they produce less. ""But it always rains in Wales, all year round. This could produce more electricity. It's a win-win.""

"This video can not be played George Eustice: ""Rishi Sunak didn't do any favour for Greensill or David Cameron"" The government will examine suggestions to improve lobbying rules after a series of inquiries, the environment secretary has pledged. George Eustice said current systems were ""quite robust"" but it was possible they could be ""tweaked or improved"". He said David Cameron's actions were ""acceptable"" when he lobbied ministers on behalf of finance firm Greensill Capital. But Labour said the row over the ex-PM's work had eroded trust in politics. A government review and three separate MP-led inquiries are now looking into Mr Cameron's attempts to lobby ministers on behalf of Greensill. His work for the firm, which collapsed in March, has prompted increased scrutiny of private companies' attempts to influence ministers and officials. What is the David Cameron lobbying row about? Government launches probe into Cameron's lobbying Johnson urged to launch 'full' Cameron inquiry Mr Cameron began working as an adviser to Greensill in August 2018, just over two years after he stood down as PM in July 2016. He has been criticised for unsuccessfully trying to help the firm, in which he had a financial interest, gain access to government-backed Covid schemes, including bysending text messagesto Chancellor Rishi Sunak. He also met Health Secretary Matt Hancock in 2019 for a ""private drink"" todiscuss a new payment schemefor NHS staff developed by the firm. Currently, former ministers are not allowed to lobby government for two years after they leave office - a rule the ex-PM appears to have followed. But critics of the current system, including former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown, have suggested a longer ban is required. All external lobbyists also have to list their work on a special register - although as an in-house employee, Mr Cameronwas not required to do this. Mr Cameron quit Downing Street in the wake of the 2016 Brexit referendum Asked whether Mr Cameron's work for the firm was acceptable, Mr Eustice told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: ""Well it is acceptable obviously, because he would have worked within the rules."" Mr Eustice said that all current cabinet ministers will be asked to declare contact with the firm as part of the government review, to be led by lawyer Nigel Boardman. ""Once it's concluded, and once all those parliamentary committees that are now looking at this have concluded, I'm sure some of them will make policy recommendations. ""And of course the government will look at that. I'm not saying that things couldn't be tweaked or improved."" The terms of reference for the government's own review,externalsay Mr Boardman will report ""findings and any recommendations"" to Prime Minister Boris Johnson by the end of June. Speaking earlier to Sky's Sophy Ridge, Mr Eustice said that review was ""not really there to prescribe policy"" and would not have enforcement powers. It's another word for trying to persuade the government to change its policies It can be done by individuals, companies, organisations and charities who contact ministers, backbench MPs and other politicians Some organisations and companies employ professional lobbyists to make their case for them Former MPs and civil servants often work as lobbyists Read more: What jobs can ex-ministers do and what are the rules? Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said the Greensill affair showed the need for stricter lobbying rules. She told the Marr programme that the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which advises former ministers and civil servants on outside employment, should be given greater powers. ""We are seeing the erosion of trust in our politics because of the behaviour by a few at the top of the Conservative Party,"" she added. This video can not be played Rachel Reeves says the Greensill lobbying crisis is ""tip of the iceberg"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who was energy secretary under Mr Cameron during the Tory-Lib Dem coalition government, said ""much greater transparency"" over lobbying was required. He suggested the code which governs the behaviour of current ministers should be overseen by an ""independent body"" similar to the one that oversees MPs' expenses. Meanwhile, senior Tory MP Sir Bernard Jenkin has warned Mr Johnson he could lose trust from former Labour voters in ""red wall"" constituencies they won in the last election - unless he can show he is more transparent. Writing in the Observer newspaper,external, Sir Bernard said the current system had ""allowed the lines between public service and private gain to become blurred"". He said there had been a ""failure of successive governments"" to be more transparent about the relationships between administrations and business. Mr Cameron has defended his work for Greensill but accepted he should have contacted ministers using more formal channels. He has said he welcomes the government review andwill ""respond positively""to any requests from MPs for him to give evidence.

"The billionaire Issa brothers who own Asda have bought the British fast food chain, Leon. More than 70 Leon restaurants across the UK and Europe have been sold to the brothers' giant petrol forecourt business EG Group. In a joint statement, Mohsin Issa and Zuber Issa said the firm was a ""fantastic brand we have long admired"". Leon boss John Vincent, who co-founded the firm in 2004, said: ""In some ways this is a sad day for me."" ""We have tried hard, done some good things, made a healthy amount of mistakes, and built a business that quite a few people are kind enough to say that they love,"" he added. The deal includes 42 company-owned restaurants, as well as 29 franchise sites which are mainly found in airports and train stations across the UK and a handful of European countries such as the Netherlands and Spain. The group has also committed to keeping on Leon's management team and staff. EG Group said that the acquisition, reportedly worth up to Â£100m according tothe Mail on Sunday,external, is ""complementary"" as it seeks to expand the food side of its business. How to buy a Â£6.8bn supermarket for Â£780m Who are the Issa brothers? 'We try to make good food emotionally addictive' It already operates more than 700 food outlets in the UK and Ireland, including branches and ""drive-thrus"" for KFC, Starbucks and Greggs. In a statement, EG Group said it planned to open about 20 new Leon outlets a year from 2022. It also cited the importance of Leon's cookbooks, own-brand groceries and ready-meals sold in supermarkets. John Vincent co-founded the firm - named after his father - with Henry Dimbleby and Allegra McEvedy, when he was 33. The brand placed importance on creating a menu of ""healthy fast-food"", Mr Vincent told the BBCin a 2019 interview. Leon now has more than 70 restaurants Mr Vincent said on Sunday that he has ""had the pleasure of getting to know Mohsin and Zuber [Issa] across the last few years. ""They have been enthusiastic customers of Leon, going out of their way to eat here whenever they visit London. They are decent, hard-working business people who are committed to sustaining and further strengthening the values and culture that we have built"". The Asda deal has understandably attracted the most attention, but this is the latest example of EG Group's wider strategy in growing its non-fuel and food service operations. The Issa brothers' statement today certainly gave no indication they're finished yet. It was already apparent they were also interested in adding to their menu of cafÃ© and restaurant brands. They have shown a taste for CaffÃ¨ Nero, although the coffee chain rejected their bid in November - shortly after launching a company voluntary agreement (CVA). John Vincent has been open about how tough the past year's lockdowns have been for the brand he started 17 years ago, and Leon's outlets are most concentrated in London. Locations such as Canary Wharf, London Bridge railway station and Heathrow Airport seem unlikely to experience a return to pre-pandemic levels of trade soon. Under EG Group's plans, it's now set to expand into both new geographical and - with possible drive-throughs - operational areas. The Issa brothers, two entrepreneurs from Blackburn,in February completed a dealto buy Asda, Britain's third-largest supermarket chain, from US owners Walmart. It was valued at Â£6.8bn, but the brothers and the investment firm TDR Capital paid just Â£780m. The deal is still awaiting approval from the UK's Competition and Markets Authority, which is expected by the summer. As part of it, Asda's 323 petrol stations will be sold for Â£750m to EG Group, adding to the portfolio of more than 6,000 around the world. In 2020, questions were raised about the group's finances after its auditor, Deloitte, suddenly quit in October and was replaced by KPMG. EG Group said the auditor had signed a ""clean audit"" for EG Group's 2019 financial accounts and there had been ""no disagreements on any auditing or accounting matters"".

"Wide but extremely thin: A68 was about 230m thick on average The iceberg that was for a time the biggest in the world is no more. A68, as it was known, covered an area of nearly 6,000 sq km (2,300 sq miles) when it broke away from Antarctica in 2017. That's like a small country; it's equal to a quarter of the size of Wales. But satellites show the mega-berg has now virtually gone, broken into countless small fragments that theUS National Ice Center,externalsays are no longer worth tracking. A68 calved from the Larson C Ice Shelfon the edge of the Antarctic Peninsula, and for a year it hardly moved. But then it started to drift north with increasing speed, riding on strong currents and winds. The billion-tonne block took a familiar route, spinning out into the South Atlantic towards the British Overseas Territory of South Georgia. The small island is where many of the biggest icebergs go to die. Caught in the local shallows, they are doomed to gradually melt away. Polar seafloor exposed after 50 years of ice cover Radar images capture new Antarctic mega-iceberg New Sentinels to check the pulse of Earth This video can not be played The RAF flew over the iceberg as it moved around South Georgia But this one somehow managed to escape that particular fate. Instead, it was the waves, the warm water and higher air temperatures in the Atlantic that eventually consumed A68. It simply shattered into smaller and smaller fragments. ""It's amazing that A68 lasted as long as it did,""Adrian Luckman, from Swansea University,external, told BBC News. ""If you think about the thickness ratio - it's like four pieces of A4 paper stacked up on top of one another. So this thing is incredibly flexible and fragile as it moved around the ocean. It lasted for years like that. But it eventually broke into four-to-five pieces and then those broke up as well."" A68 will probably be best remembered as the first iceberg to become a star on social media. People around the world shared satellite pictures online, especially as the frozen block neared South Georgia. Had it grounded, the berg's immense bulk could have disrupted the foraging behaviour of the island's many penguins - and who isn't worried about penguins in peril? The daily conversation on the likes of Twitter and Instagram was made possible by today's easy access to a suite of publicly available space data tools. ""A68 caught the attention of a lot of different people,"" commented Laura Gerrish, a mapping specialist with theBritish Antarctic Survey (BAS),external. ""We saw every little twist and turn. We were able to follow its progress with daily satellite images, at a level of detail we've not really been able to do before."" The largest fragment, A68a, had the look of a hand with an outstretched index finger Of course, the iceberg wasn't just an object of wonder; it was also the target of some serious scientific investigation. Its place of origin, Larsen C, is an enormous floating platform of ice, built by the merging of glacier tongues that have slid off the land into the ocean. A68's life story will almost certainly tell researchers something both about how ice shelves are constructed and how they break apart to produce icebergs. ""The one thing that is probably worth mentioning as a scientific result was how much was learned about the fracture toughness of the suture zones where inland glaciers joined together to form the floating shelf ice,"" commented Christopher Shuman from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) and Nasa-Goddard. ""Because we had new sensors seeing the rift evolution more frequently, I'm sure useful insights were gleaned that could not have been 'seen' in the decade before. This is a real testament to the investments being made in Earth observation."" Larsen C is formed from an amalgam of glacier ice that has flowed off the land into the sea Most glaciologists regard A68 as the product of a very natural process. Ice shelves will maintain an equilibrium, and the ejection of bergs is one way they balance the accumulation of mass from snowfall and the input of more ice from the feeding glaciers on land. So in that sense, A68 cannot be presented as a poster child for human-induced climate change. All that said, A68 did showcase the sorts of processes through which warming can destroy ice structures. Hydrofracturing: The bottom of this iceberg fragment undergoes sudden collapse One of these is what's termed hydrofracturing. In this process, warming produces a lot of surface meltwater that then fills fissures and cracks, driving these openings through to the base of the ice. There were some spectacular examples towards the end of A68's existence where hydrofracturing turned remnant fragments to mush almost overnight. ""'Death by hydrofracture', 'slush puppies',"" Ted Scambos called it. ""Another example of iceberg fast-forward evolution, showing us how ice shelves might collapse in a warmer world. I guess the iceberg tested a lot of supposed knowledge, and the knowledge mostly stood up to the challenge,"" the CIRES-University of Colorado Boulder expert told BBC News. BAS put robotic gliders in the water to study the environment around the berg BAS also put a couple of robots in the ocean in February to try to study up close some of A68's latter-day segments. One went missing soon after, and the other actually got stuck under the ice for two weeks before managing to free itself and continue its observations. This robot will be recovered in May to pull down its data. It should reveal information about how icebergs affect their surroundings by, for example, dumping huge volumes of fresh water into the ocean as they melt. The last major fragment, known as A68a, viewed at the edge of an icy slush The USNIC is the body recognised internationally for naming icebergs and tracking those that might pose a threat to shipping. To make it on to the USNIC list of concern, a berg must either have a long-axis of greater than 10 nautical miles (18.5km) or an area of at least 20 square nautical miles (68.5 sq km). None of A68's fragments now qualify. The last major piece, known as A68a, was measured on Friday to be just 3 nautical miles by 2 nautical miles. RIP.

"This video can not be played George Eustice: ""Rishi Sunak didn't do any favour for Greensill or David Cameron"" The government will examine suggestions to improve lobbying rules after a series of inquiries, the environment secretary has pledged. George Eustice said current systems were ""quite robust"" but it was possible they could be ""tweaked or improved"". He said David Cameron's actions were ""acceptable"" when he lobbied ministers on behalf of finance firm Greensill Capital. But Labour said the row over the ex-PM's work had eroded trust in politics. A government review and three separate MP-led inquiries are now looking into Mr Cameron's attempts to lobby ministers on behalf of Greensill. His work for the firm, which collapsed in March, has prompted increased scrutiny of private companies' attempts to influence ministers and officials. What is the David Cameron lobbying row about? Government launches probe into Cameron's lobbying Johnson urged to launch 'full' Cameron inquiry Mr Cameron began working as an adviser to Greensill in August 2018, just over two years after he stood down as PM in July 2016. He has been criticised for unsuccessfully trying to help the firm, in which he had a financial interest, gain access to government-backed Covid schemes, including bysending text messagesto Chancellor Rishi Sunak. He also met Health Secretary Matt Hancock in 2019 for a ""private drink"" todiscuss a new payment schemefor NHS staff developed by the firm. Currently, former ministers are not allowed to lobby government for two years after they leave office - a rule the ex-PM appears to have followed. But critics of the current system, including former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown, have suggested a longer ban is required. All external lobbyists also have to list their work on a special register - although as an in-house employee, Mr Cameronwas not required to do this. Mr Cameron quit Downing Street in the wake of the 2016 Brexit referendum Asked whether Mr Cameron's work for the firm was acceptable, Mr Eustice told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: ""Well it is acceptable obviously, because he would have worked within the rules."" Mr Eustice said that all current cabinet ministers will be asked to declare contact with the firm as part of the government review, to be led by lawyer Nigel Boardman. ""Once it's concluded, and once all those parliamentary committees that are now looking at this have concluded, I'm sure some of them will make policy recommendations. ""And of course the government will look at that. I'm not saying that things couldn't be tweaked or improved."" The terms of reference for the government's own review,externalsay Mr Boardman will report ""findings and any recommendations"" to Prime Minister Boris Johnson by the end of June. Speaking earlier to Sky's Sophy Ridge, Mr Eustice said that review was ""not really there to prescribe policy"" and would not have enforcement powers. It's another word for trying to persuade the government to change its policies It can be done by individuals, companies, organisations and charities who contact ministers, backbench MPs and other politicians Some organisations and companies employ professional lobbyists to make their case for them Former MPs and civil servants often work as lobbyists Read more: What jobs can ex-ministers do and what are the rules? Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said the Greensill affair showed the need for stricter lobbying rules. She told the Marr programme that the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which advises former ministers and civil servants on outside employment, should be given greater powers. ""We are seeing the erosion of trust in our politics because of the behaviour by a few at the top of the Conservative Party,"" she added.

A government spokesperson said: ""We cannot be complacent or lose sight of the risks this virus poses."" Chief executives of Mitchells & Butlers, Fuller's, Young's, JD Wetherspoon, Pizza Hut and Alton Towers owner Merlin signed the letter, which said: ""We must be driven by data not dates.

"Lisa Lanfear was commended for her commitment to equine welfare during the pandemic There are calls for charities to be handed powers to enforce laws around horse welfare. Lisa Lanfear, a welfare officer for the Communities For Horses charity, said no charity had the statutory power to act on concerns about horses. Councils are able to act, and Ms Lanfear said the situation had improved slightly in some areas. But she said there were not enough properly trained officers. Councils are also not obliged to uphold the laws, and Ms Lanfear would like to see them become accountable for equine welfare and be given the resources to enable this. Get extra updates on BBC election coverage A really simple guide to the Welsh elections Wales election 2021: Compare party policies The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) said councils had taken ""strong enforcement action"" and enforcement teams were facing ""significant financial pressures"" and ""considerable costs"" when taking action. However, the WLGA said councils would ""consider all the circumstances of any case to determine the most appropriate course of action"". As part of a series looking at the issues people in Wales would like to see tackled after the Senedd election, BBC News spoke to Ms Lanfear. There are calls for tethering horses to be banned but Lisa Lanfear fears it will drive people to hide them It follows a separate petition going before the Senedd calling for horse tethering - securing a horse to an area with a long rope or chain tied from its headcollar or neck strap - to be banned. However, Ms Lanfear did not think this was necessarily the correct approach. She said laws were already there to protect horses, and a code of practice was in place for horse tethering, but these needed to be enforced more proactively. ""I can understand why the petition is going, it's not the first to try and ban tethering and I feel a lot of empathy and sympathy towards it."" WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage Ms Lanfear added: ""I can understand how people feel when they see a horse tethered as it's not very nice and it's a very emotive subject. ""But there are a lot of things already in place. We already have three sets of legislation."" This includes a requirement for all horses to be passported and microchipped by law, meaning all should be identifiable. Lisa Lanfear says horses are sometimes tethered or stabled for 24 hours a day Ms Lanfear said banning tethering would not stop people from owning horses, especially if it was within their culture and heritage to do so. She added there were issues with stabled horses too, and generally how they were kept across the board. ""Horses are sometimes tethered or stabled 24/7."" WALES ELECTION: THE BASICS What's happening?On 6 May, people will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.Find out more here.

Who can vote?Anyone who lives in Wales, is registered to vote and aged 16 or over on 6 May is eligible.You can register to vote online,external. Ms Lanfear said she also wanted more awareness of thefive domains of welfare,external, a tool to measure welfare needs of all animals. ""Some people do see them as a status symbol, but some people have an innate desire to have horses because it's part of their heritage. ""The horse community is very close-knit, and it comes down to a society which has marginalised them so they stick together, and we need to look at the fact that they are really marginalised and disadvantaged and, again, we see that across the whole of the UK."" Ms Lanfear added that, if tethering were banned, people would still keep the horses and in potentially worse conditions. She instead called for more organised grazing schemes and for otherwise unused land to be utilised for horses, so there was enough space for people to offer horses better welfare standards. ""People start hiding horses any way they can, because all are not going to get rid of the horses, they are going to put them somewhere else. ""We have pulled horses out of sheds, coal bunkers, back gardens."" Hundreds of animals saved in 'harrowing' rescue 'Significant' drop in tethered horses Swansea tethering horses ban blocked Animal cruelty cases reach five-year high Ms Lanfear, who said horse sanctuaries were already overburdened, said the necessary legislation was already in place but there were simply not enough local authority officers with the correct skillsets to enforce it. ""When there are concerns about horses, we are totally powerless, we don't have statutory powers to act."" She said equine experts existed within charities who could be used to help enforce the rules if they were granted the power to do so. Ms Lanfear, who co-founded Communities for Horses, was commended by the National Equine Forum for her commitment to equine welfare during the Covid-19 pandemic. The charity received hundreds of calls during the pandemic from people concerned about the health and safety of horses in Swansea, and Ms Lanfear said she was ""thrilled"" her work had been recognised. The WLGA spokesman said: ""Local authorities have taken strong enforcement action - including prosecutions leading to imprisonment - in a number of high-profile cases... and will continue to do so wherever appropriate. ""However, enforcement teams are experiencing significant financial pressures, and there are considerable costs involved in taking enforcement action of this kind. Individual local authorities will consider all the circumstances of any case to determine the most appropriate course of action.""

Alison RobertsPortugal Correspondent Smaller shops in Portugal were able to open earlier in April Portugal will continue its lockdown easing on Monday with shopping
centres and the largest on-street shops allowed to open for the first
time in two months, and pupils returning to school, in most areas. Though coronavirus cases are rising again in the country,
it still has the lowest infection rate in the European Union, at a time
when most of the bloc is tightening restrictions. As well as all retail
and services being allowed to function more or less normally, cafÃ©s and
restaurants will be able to serve customers indoors  - up to four per table
- as well as outdoors. Medium-risk sports such as basketball will be
allowed as well as outdoor exercise with up to six people. But in 10
municipalities where infection rates are higher, restrictions are being
kept in place or, in some cases, tightened.

Here's a look at how people across England are enjoying the spring weekend weather after coronavirus restrictions eased to allow more reasons for groups to meet outside. Waterside views proved a big draw as families and friends headed to the beach or river to relax in the sunshine. And people enjoyed a bite to eat and a refreshing drink outside pubs and restaurants which are now able to serve outdoors. If you're making planshere's a reminderof what's allowed now and what's coming next in the roadmap out of lockdown. People make their way along the seafront on Bournemouth beach in Dorset Kite flyers on a hill at Northala Fields in west London A man and his dog paddleboard along the River Cam in Cambridge People relax on bank of the River Thames in Richmond The number of daily coronavirus infections recorded in the UK has dropped below 2,000 for only the second time in more than seven months. As we reported earlier this hour, the government's daily figures show 1,882 new infections have been reported today. Last Sunday, that figure was 1,730. But the last time cases fell below 2,000 before that was 5 September 2020 when the total was 1,813. By contrast, in late December and early January the number of daily cases was more than 60,000 a few times - the highest figure was 81,529 on 29 December. Meanwhile, the number of people who have had both doses of coronavirus vaccine is edging closer to 10 million. Currently 9,930,846 people have had their first and second dose. But clinics across the UK could hit the 10 million milestone today and it could be announced in tomorrow's figures. Australia is in no rush to reopen its international borders and risk jeopardising its almost completely coronavirus-free lifestyle, Prime Minister Scott Morrison says. Australia shut its borders to all non-citizens and non-residents more than a year ago. This, along with local lockdowns and swift contact tracing, has meant Australia has avoided the worst of the pandemic, with about 29,500 cases and 910 deaths. With the exception of the occasional snap lockdown, Australians have been able to eat out, gather relatively freely and stop wearing face masks in most places for months. ""Australia is in no hurry to open those borders, I assure you,"" Morrison says in a televised briefing. ""I will not be putting at risk the way we are living in this country, which is so different to the rest of the world today."" The UK has given a total of 42,780,069 coronavirus vaccinations,according to the government's daily statistics.,external That's 32,849,223 first doses and 9,930,846 second doses. You can use ourpostcode look-up toolto find out how many people have been vaccinated in your area. A further 10 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,the government's daily figures show.,external That brings the total number of people to die within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test to 127,270. There were also 1,882 new cases detected. A ""huge"" backlog of patients in England caused by Covid-19 could take years to clear, NHS Providers says. The organisation, which represents every NHS hospital, and mental health, community and ambulance service in England, says tackling the problem in the worst-affected areas could take three to five years. According to data from NHS England,4.7 million people were waiting to start treatmentat the end of February - the highest figure since records began in August 2007. The number waiting more than 52 weeks to start hospital treatment was 387,885 - the highest for any calendar month since December 2007. NHS Providers is calling for a ""bold transformative approach"" with additional funding from the government to clear the backlog in a reasonable period of time. Its chief executive Chris Hopson says: ""We need to work together over the next few months to create a joint plan to deliver for patients and service users to be announced in the multi-year spending review we are expecting at the end of the year."" A Department of Health spokesman says the NHS has ""faced significant challenges over the past year"" and the government is backing the service with an extra Â£7bn this year. As England enjoys eased lockdown restrictions - allowing outdoor eating and drinking at pubs, bars and restaurants - we've been answering your questions. Frank Shaw, from Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria asks: ""When pubs open will bar staff have to wear face masks and/or visors when serving?"" The answer is yes. By law, staff working in venues that provide food and drink are required to wear face coverings (similar to masks), unless they have an exemption. Thegovernment guidance for the hospitality sector in England,externalsays a face visor or shield may be worn in addition to a face covering - but not instead of one. This is because face visors or shields âdo not adequately cover the nose and mouth, and do not filter airborne particlesâ. The owners of pubs, restaurants and cafes are also being urgedto put other measures in place when they reopen,external- including completing Covid risk assessments, cleaning more often and providing adequate ventilation.

A Church of Ireland rector described as one of the church's ""most likeable people"" hasdied at the age of 46 with Covid-19. The Reverend John Anderson, rector of Billy and Derrykeighan in County Antrim, died on Saturday morning after going into intensive care. He was admitted to Causeway Hospital just over a week ago. He leaves behind his wife Eleanor and three young children. The Bishop of Connor, Right Reverend George Davison, says his death had come ""as a terrible shock to us all"". Israelis have been able to walk outside without masks today for the first time in a year. About 81% of citizens or residents over 16 are fully vaccinated against Covid-19. The government announced this week masks would no longer be required in public outdoor spaces. Protective masks outdoors had been made compulsory a year ago for non-exercise activities. ""It's very strange but it's very nice,"" Eliana Gamulka, 26, tells the AFP news agency after getting off a bus in Jerusalem. ""You can't pretend that you don't know anyone any more,"" she smiles. Israel boasts one of the world's fastest inoculation campaigns. But that is in stark contrast to the West Bank and the blockaded Gaza Strip, where infection rates remain high and vaccinations are low. There have been monks on Caldey Island since the 6th Century A holy Welsh island cut off from the rest of the world by the pandemic can reopen to visitors now all the monks living there have been vaccinated. NHS staffferried first and second jabs to Caldey Island from Tenby. The island, which is home to just 40 people - including about 18 Cistercian monks - will reopen to tourist boat trips from 1 May. Islanders say the medics appeared ""like angels"" in wet weather as they carried a box of vaccines on to the island. The health board's primary care director Jill Paterson says: ""This is definitely one of our moreunique vaccination clinics to reach our communities."" The crisis caused by the pandemic has forced a growing number of people to depend on food donations The queue snakes around the block and each day it gets longer: hungry residents of Heliopolis, SÃ£o Paulo's largest favela, waiting in line for the handout that will keep them going until the next morning. They are given a bowl of pasta with meat and a portion of rice, two packets of biscuits and a carton of milk, shared between a whole household and usually their only meal of the day. Before the pandemic, 300 people would queue up here. Now it is more than 1,000, and the charity that runs it has 650 others across SÃ£o Paulo. ""The vast majority of people who live in the favelas work in the informal economy, as cleaners in homes or helping to bake cakes, so when businesses close or houses stop using them, they feel the impact,"" says Marcivan Barreto, the local co-ordinator. ""You see people queuing up at 03:00 for food. I'm very worried that as the pandemic continues, a hungry father will start looting supermarkets. When you're starving, despair hits."" Read more here.

The Indian city worst affected by coronavirus, Delhi, has ordered all residents returning from a major Hindu festival on the Ganges to stay in quarantine at home for 14 days. The order applies to all those attending the Kumbh Mela between 4 April and the end of the month. They must also be registered and tested. Anyone found to have flouted the rules must go to government quarantine centres. India has reported a ninth straight day of record Covid cases - more than 260,000. The opposition has criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for continuing to attend huge political rallies in West Bengal state, which is currently undergoing elections. Millions of devotees have descended on the banks of the Ganges river in the northern city of Haridwar to take a dip in the water.

Volunteers in Blaenau Gwent in Wales were filmed as they completed 15,000 tasks including delivering food and prescriptions to those self-isolating. The documentary, called Together - Volunteers of a Covid community, won two awards at theNorth Europe Fusion International Film Festival,external, including best film. Festival director Steve Grossmith says: ""A big part of why this film was chosen was because this group of film-makers are selfless and the work they have done is incredible...What they have done is nothing short of remarkable."" Alison RobertsPortugal Correspondent Smaller shops in Portugal were able to open earlier in April Portugal will continue its lockdown easing on Monday with shopping
centres and the largest on-street shops allowed to open for the first
time in two months, and pupils returning to school, in most areas. Though coronavirus cases are rising again in the country,
it still has the lowest infection rate in the European Union, at a time
when most of the bloc is tightening restrictions. As well as all retail
and services being allowed to function more or less normally, cafÃ©s and
restaurants will be able to serve customers indoors  - up to four per table
- as well as outdoors. Medium-risk sports such as basketball will be
allowed as well as outdoor exercise with up to six people. But in 10
municipalities where infection rates are higher, restrictions are being
kept in place or, in some cases, tightened. This video can not be played Football's forgotten faces tell us why they look forward to going back to stadiums From the stadium announcers to the caterers and to the fans themselves, the closure of sports venues has hit many people hard. Here some of football's forgotten faces tell us about how they are feeling about the return of spectators. Here's a look at how people across England are enjoying the spring weekend weather after coronavirus restrictions eased to allow more reasons for groups to meet outside. Waterside views proved a big draw as families and friends headed to the beach or river to relax in the sunshine. And people enjoyed a bite to eat and a refreshing drink outside pubs and restaurants which are now able to serve outdoors. If you're making planshere's a reminderof what's allowed now and what's coming next in the roadmap out of lockdown. People make their way along the seafront on Bournemouth beach in Dorset Kite flyers on a hill at Northala Fields in west London A man and his dog paddleboard along the River Cam in Cambridge People relax on bank of the River Thames in Richmond The number of daily coronavirus infections recorded in the UK has dropped below 2,000 for only the second time in more than seven months. As we reported earlier this hour, the government's daily figures show 1,882 new infections have been reported today. Last Sunday, that figure was 1,730. But the last time cases fell below 2,000 before that was 5 September 2020 when the total was 1,813. By contrast, in late December and early January the number of daily cases was more than 60,000 a few times - the highest figure was 81,529 on 29 December. Meanwhile, the number of people who have had both doses of coronavirus vaccine is edging closer to 10 million. Currently 9,930,846 people have had their first and second dose. But clinics across the UK could hit the 10 million milestone today and it could be announced in tomorrow's figures. Australia is in no rush to reopen its international borders and risk jeopardising its almost completely coronavirus-free lifestyle, Prime Minister Scott Morrison says. Australia shut its borders to all non-citizens and non-residents more than a year ago. This, along with local lockdowns and swift contact tracing, has meant Australia has avoided the worst of the pandemic, with about 29,500 cases and 910 deaths. With the exception of the occasional snap lockdown, Australians have been able to eat out, gather relatively freely and stop wearing face masks in most places for months. ""Australia is in no hurry to open those borders, I assure you,"" Morrison says in a televised briefing. ""I will not be putting at risk the way we are living in this country, which is so different to the rest of the world today."" The UK has given a total of 42,780,069 coronavirus vaccinations,according to the government's daily statistics.,external That's 32,849,223 first doses and 9,930,846 second doses. You can use ourpostcode look-up toolto find out how many people have been vaccinated in your area. A further 10 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,the government's daily figures show.,external That brings the total number of people to die within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test to 127,270. There were also 1,882 new cases detected. A ""huge"" backlog of patients in England caused by Covid-19 could take years to clear, NHS Providers says. The organisation, which represents every NHS hospital, and mental health, community and ambulance service in England, says tackling the problem in the worst-affected areas could take three to five years. According to data from NHS England,4.7 million people were waiting to start treatmentat the end of February - the highest figure since records began in August 2007. The number waiting more than 52 weeks to start hospital treatment was 387,885 - the highest for any calendar month since December 2007. NHS Providers is calling for a ""bold transformative approach"" with additional funding from the government to clear the backlog in a reasonable period of time. Its chief executive Chris Hopson says: ""We need to work together over the next few months to create a joint plan to deliver for patients and service users to be announced in the multi-year spending review we are expecting at the end of the year."" A Department of Health spokesman says the NHS has ""faced significant challenges over the past year"" and the government is backing the service with an extra Â£7bn this year. As England enjoys eased lockdown restrictions - allowing outdoor eating and drinking at pubs, bars and restaurants - we've been answering your questions. Frank Shaw, from Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria asks: ""When pubs open will bar staff have to wear face masks and/or visors when serving?"" The answer is yes. By law, staff working in venues that provide food and drink are required to wear face coverings (similar to masks), unless they have an exemption. Thegovernment guidance for the hospitality sector in England,externalsays a face visor or shield may be worn in addition to a face covering - but not instead of one. This is because face visors or shields âdo not adequately cover the nose and mouth, and do not filter airborne particlesâ. The owners of pubs, restaurants and cafes are also being urgedto put other measures in place when they reopen,external- including completing Covid risk assessments, cleaning more often and providing adequate ventilation.

A Southampton fan is ready for the FA Cup semi final match with Leicester City at Wembley Stadium We are going to be bringing our coronavirus updates to a close shortly so here's a recap of the news we've been reporting today: Claire Morris of the Nantybwch and Waundeg community group and Ffion Cudlip, a film student with Cymru Creations which set up the project, were two of the volunteers A ""remarkable"" documentary about a community coming together during the pandemic has won a European film award. Volunteers in Blaenau Gwent in Wales were filmed as they completed 15,000 tasks including delivering food and prescriptions to those self-isolating. The documentary, called Together - Volunteers of a Covid community, won two awards at theNorth Europe Fusion International Film Festival,external, including best film. Festival director Steve Grossmith says: ""A big part of why this film was chosen was because this group of film-makers are selfless and the work they have done is incredible...What they have done is nothing short of remarkable."" Alison RobertsPortugal Correspondent Smaller shops in Portugal were able to open earlier in April Portugal will continue its lockdown easing on Monday with shopping
centres and the largest on-street shops allowed to open for the first
time in two months, and pupils returning to school, in most areas. Though coronavirus cases are rising again in the country,
it still has the lowest infection rate in the European Union, at a time
when most of the bloc is tightening restrictions. As well as all retail
and services being allowed to function more or less normally, cafÃ©s and
restaurants will be able to serve customers indoors  - up to four per table
- as well as outdoors. Medium-risk sports such as basketball will be
allowed as well as outdoor exercise with up to six people. But in 10
municipalities where infection rates are higher, restrictions are being
kept in place or, in some cases, tightened. This video can not be played Football's forgotten faces tell us why they look forward to going back to stadiums From the stadium announcers to the caterers and to the fans themselves, the closure of sports venues has hit many people hard. Here some of football's forgotten faces tell us about how they are feeling about the return of spectators. Here's a look at how people across England are enjoying the spring weekend weather after coronavirus restrictions eased to allow more reasons for groups to meet outside. Waterside views proved a big draw as families and friends headed to the beach or river to relax in the sunshine. And people enjoyed a bite to eat and a refreshing drink outside pubs and restaurants which are now able to serve outdoors. If you're making planshere's a reminderof what's allowed now and what's coming next in the roadmap out of lockdown. People make their way along the seafront on Bournemouth beach in Dorset Kite flyers on a hill at Northala Fields in west London A man and his dog paddleboard along the River Cam in Cambridge People relax on bank of the River Thames in Richmond The number of daily coronavirus infections recorded in the UK has dropped below 2,000 for only the second time in more than seven months. As we reported earlier this hour, the government's daily figures show 1,882 new infections have been reported today. Last Sunday, that figure was 1,730. But the last time cases fell below 2,000 before that was 5 September 2020 when the total was 1,813. By contrast, in late December and early January the number of daily cases was more than 60,000 a few times - the highest figure was 81,529 on 29 December. Meanwhile, the number of people who have had both doses of coronavirus vaccine is edging closer to 10 million. Currently 9,930,846 people have had their first and second dose. But clinics across the UK could hit the 10 million milestone today and it could be announced in tomorrow's figures. Australia is in no rush to reopen its international borders and risk jeopardising its almost completely coronavirus-free lifestyle, Prime Minister Scott Morrison says. Australia shut its borders to all non-citizens and non-residents more than a year ago. This, along with local lockdowns and swift contact tracing, has meant Australia has avoided the worst of the pandemic, with about 29,500 cases and 910 deaths. With the exception of the occasional snap lockdown, Australians have been able to eat out, gather relatively freely and stop wearing face masks in most places for months. ""Australia is in no hurry to open those borders, I assure you,"" Morrison says in a televised briefing. ""I will not be putting at risk the way we are living in this country, which is so different to the rest of the world today."" The UK has given a total of 42,780,069 coronavirus vaccinations,according to the government's daily statistics.,external That's 32,849,223 first doses and 9,930,846 second doses. You can use ourpostcode look-up toolto find out how many people have been vaccinated in your area. A further 10 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,the government's daily figures show.,external That brings the total number of people to die within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test to 127,270. There were also 1,882 new cases detected. A ""huge"" backlog of patients in England caused by Covid-19 could take years to clear, NHS Providers says. The organisation, which represents every NHS hospital, and mental health, community and ambulance service in England, says tackling the problem in the worst-affected areas could take three to five years. According to data from NHS England,4.7 million people were waiting to start treatmentat the end of February - the highest figure since records began in August 2007. The number waiting more than 52 weeks to start hospital treatment was 387,885 - the highest for any calendar month since December 2007. NHS Providers is calling for a ""bold transformative approach"" with additional funding from the government to clear the backlog in a reasonable period of time. Its chief executive Chris Hopson says: ""We need to work together over the next few months to create a joint plan to deliver for patients and service users to be announced in the multi-year spending review we are expecting at the end of the year."" A Department of Health spokesman says the NHS has ""faced significant challenges over the past year"" and the government is backing the service with an extra Â£7bn this year. As England enjoys eased lockdown restrictions - allowing outdoor eating and drinking at pubs, bars and restaurants - we've been answering your questions. Frank Shaw, from Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria asks: ""When pubs open will bar staff have to wear face masks and/or visors when serving?"" The answer is yes. By law, staff working in venues that provide food and drink are required to wear face coverings (similar to masks), unless they have an exemption. Thegovernment guidance for the hospitality sector in England,externalsays a face visor or shield may be worn in addition to a face covering - but not instead of one. This is because face visors or shields âdo not adequately cover the nose and mouth, and do not filter airborne particlesâ. The owners of pubs, restaurants and cafes are also being urgedto put other measures in place when they reopen,external- including completing Covid risk assessments, cleaning more often and providing adequate ventilation. You can read the answers to more coronavirus questions, and ask your own,here. A Church of Ireland rector described as one of the church's ""most likeable people"" hasdied at the age of 46 with Covid-19. The Reverend John Anderson, rector of Billy and Derrykeighan in County Antrim, died on Saturday morning after going into intensive care. He was admitted to Causeway Hospital just over a week ago. He leaves behind his wife Eleanor and three young children. The Bishop of Connor, Right Reverend George Davison, says his death had come ""as a terrible shock to us all"". Israelis have been able to walk outside without masks today for the first time in a year. About 81% of citizens or residents over 16 are fully vaccinated against Covid-19. The government announced this week masks would no longer be required in public outdoor spaces. Protective masks outdoors had been made compulsory a year ago for non-exercise activities. ""It's very strange but it's very nice,"" Eliana Gamulka, 26, tells the AFP news agency after getting off a bus in Jerusalem. ""You can't pretend that you don't know anyone any more,"" she smiles. Israel boasts one of the world's fastest inoculation campaigns. But that is in stark contrast to the West Bank and the blockaded Gaza Strip, where infection rates remain high and vaccinations are low. There have been monks on Caldey Island since the 6th Century A holy Welsh island cut off from the rest of the world by the pandemic can reopen to visitors now all the monks living there have been vaccinated. NHS staffferried first and second jabs to Caldey Island from Tenby. The island, which is home to just 40 people - including about 18 Cistercian monks - will reopen to tourist boat trips from 1 May. Islanders say the medics appeared ""like angels"" in wet weather as they carried a box of vaccines on to the island. The health board's primary care director Jill Paterson says: ""This is definitely one of our moreunique vaccination clinics to reach our communities."" The crisis caused by the pandemic has forced a growing number of people to depend on food donations The queue snakes around the block and each day it gets longer: hungry residents of Heliopolis, SÃ£o Paulo's largest favela, waiting in line for the handout that will keep them going until the next morning. They are given a bowl of pasta with meat and a portion of rice, two packets of biscuits and a carton of milk, shared between a whole household and usually their only meal of the day. Before the pandemic, 300 people would queue up here. Now it is more than 1,000, and the charity that runs it has 650 others across SÃ£o Paulo. ""The vast majority of people who live in the favelas work in the informal economy, as cleaners in homes or helping to bake cakes, so when businesses close or houses stop using them, they feel the impact,"" says Marcivan Barreto, the local co-ordinator. ""You see people queuing up at 03:00 for food. I'm very worried that as the pandemic continues, a hungry father will start looting supermarkets. When you're starving, despair hits."" Read more here. Fans will return to Wembley Stadium later for the FA Cup semi-final between Leicester and Southampton. The match will have 4,000 fans, withtickets limited to Brent residents and key workers. Elsewhere fans returned to the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, which was about a third full for thefirst round of the World Snooker Championshipon Saturday. Before attending any of the events, spectators will have to test negative for coronavirus in a lateral flow test - supervised where possible - taken in the previous 36 hours. And after attending they will be asked to conduct a PCR coronavirus swab test. This morning we brought you news of a 5,000 ticket open-air gig in Liverpool as part of a government pilot on resuming mass gatherings as we emerge from the coronavirus pandemic. We have some more details now - including that the headline act has been announced as Stockport indie-pop band Blossoms.

The Indian city worst affected by coronavirus, Delhi, has ordered all residents returning from a major Hindu festival on the Ganges to stay in quarantine at home for 14 days. The order applies to all those attending the Kumbh Mela between 4 April and the end of the month. They must also be registered and tested. Anyone found to have flouted the rules must go to government quarantine centres. India has reported a ninth straight day of record Covid cases - more than 260,000. The opposition has criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for continuing to attend huge political rallies in West Bengal state, which is currently undergoing elections. Millions of devotees have descended on the banks of the Ganges river in the northern city of Haridwar to take a dip in the water. 

Hindus believe the river is holy and taking a dip in it will cleanse them of their sins and bring salvation. Here are some of the headlines from across the UK this Sunday afternoon: Â© 2025 BBC.

"Blossoms will headline the gig at Liverpool's Sefton Park Music fans in Liverpool are to get the chance to enjoy a near-normal gig as part of a government pilot event. A crowd of 5,000 will see headline act Blossoms without having to social-distance or wear face coverings. But they will only get into the 2 May event by having a negative Covid test. Meanwhile, the FA Cup semi-final between Leicester City and Southampton at London's Wembley Stadium will host a crowd of 4,000 later as part of a series of government trial events. On Sunday, the UK recorded 1,882 new Covid cases and 10 deaths within 28 days of a positive test,according to the latest government figures,external. The number of deaths recorded over the weekend tends to be lower because of reporting delays. More than 32.8 million people have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while more than 9.9 million people have had their second dose. Cinema trial organisers targeted by anti-vax activists Trials to begin for return of England mass events The outdoor concert at Sefton Park will operate below its capacity of 7,500. Ticket-holders will be required to take a lateral flow test, which can produce a result within 30 minutes, at a local testing centre before entry, the Department for Digital Culture Media and Sport said. Attendees will also be asked to take a test after the concert - and will have to provide contact details to NHS Test and Trace to ensure they can be reached if someone who attended tests positive. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""We're one step closer to a summer of live events now our science-led programme is under way. ""Testing different settings and looking at different mitigations is key to getting crowds back safely."" ""I hope it won't be too much longer until gigs are back for good,"" he added. Announcing Blossoms as headliners, Claire McColgan, director of Culture Liverpool, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Breakfast it was nearly two years since the city had held outdoor mass-attendance events. She said scientists would assess how attendees move and respond during the gig, and voluntary tests taken afterwards will be used to identify any infections that might arise. ""The stuff you see on stage is just a tiny, tiny part of it,"" she said. ""It's loads of people's jobs - it's 60,000 jobs across our city region."" Blossoms are an indie-pop band from Stockport, Manchester Tom Ogden is the lead vocalist, Charlie Salt is on bass, Josh Dewhurst on lead guitar, Joe Donovan on drums and Myles Kellock on keyboards 2016 was a major breakthrough year for the band, when their self-titled debut album landed at number one on the official albums chart Their most-streamed songs on Spotify are Charlemagne, There's A Reason Why (I Never Returned Your Calls), and Your Girlfriend They were on a UK tour as the coronavirus pandemic struck in March 2020 - with their biggest gig at Manchester Arena cancelled during the first lockdown They are hoping to perform at the Victorious, TRNSMT and Kendal Calling festivals later this year Source: Official Charts, Spotify, and@BlossomsBand,external Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the results from the concert would ""inform our approach to ensuring future big events can take place safely"".

The government is trialling crowds at a series of events in England. The first of these - the World Snooker Championships -began on Saturday, with a reduced crowd of 213 watching at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre. Organisers hope the crowd will be at its full capacity of 980 by the final on 2 May. Other events planned as part of the pilot schemeinclude other events in Liverpool including an evening at an indoor nightclub, a business conference and a cinema screening. A mass-participation 6.2 mile (10km) run was scheduled for later this month at Hatfield Park in Hertfordshire buthas since been postponed,external. Under the government's roadmap for easing lockdown in England, large events can restart from 17 May at the earliest - but with limits on audience numbers - and nightclubs will be able to reopen no earlier than 21 June. The Welsh governmentis planning to hold a series of pilot events for audiences of up to 1,000 people after 12 April. A target date for the restart of large events in Scotland and Northern Ireland has not yet been set. Meanwhile, leaders of the UK's biggest hospitality businesses have signed an open letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson urging him to ""stick"" with England's roadmap to reopen the economy. The letterin the Sunday Telegraph,external, signed by the chief executives of Mitchells & Butlers, Fuller's, Young's, JD Wetherspoon, Pizza Hut and Alton Towers owner Merlin, said two-thirds of hospitality venues ""couldn't open outdoors from 12 April, and none is breaking even"". The signatories added: ""The prime minister set out the right path. He should stick to it and not let it be derailed by talk of vaccine passports in pubs and restaurants."" Sefton Park in Liverpool hosted capacity crowds the summer before the pandemic struck The Night Time Industries Association admitted the reopening of outdoor hospitality in England had led to a ""challenging"" weekend. The association's Michael Kill told BBC Breakfast: ""As you can appreciate it is a very challenging environment. It's great to be back - it's been a very busy weekend and the majority of customers have adhered to measures that have been put in place by the businesses."" ""I think there is going to be a bit of a bedding in period for people to get used to things and for things to settle - particularly over the first weekend,"" he added.
