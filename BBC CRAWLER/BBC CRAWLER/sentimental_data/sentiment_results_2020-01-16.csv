"Apple could be forced to abandon its Lightning connector cable if European lawmakers get their way. The cable is used to charge and sync many Apple devices, such as the iPhone. But members of the European Parliament urged the European Commission on Monday to force tech giants to adopt a single universal charging method. Two other charging cables - USB-C and micro-USB - are used on Android devices, and Apple has already stopped using Lightning on the 2018 iPad Pro. European regulators will vote on the matter on a yet to be determined date, but Apple says the proposed regulation would stifle innovation and be disruptive to consumers. If the regulator enforces its proposed regulation, Apple devices sold in Europe would be required to have a new charging method. It is likely Apple would then adopt USB-C, considering the company's 2018 iPad Pro ditched Lightning in favour of the technology. Another possible option would be to remove charging ports and cables entirely and use wireless charging instead. A new cable would mark the tech giant's third in 13 years. The majority of newly-manufactured Android phones already feature USB-C ports. Trump launches fresh attack on Apple over privacy Apple accused of crackdown on jailbreaking The European Commission has been campaigning for a single charging method for the past decade. There were more than 30 types of charger on the market in 2009, but that number has since been reduced to just three. The regulator is determined to cut down on electronic waste being created by obsolete cables, which it estimates generate more than 51,000 tonnes of waste per year. ""This is hugely detrimental for the environment,"" said European Parliament member Alex Agius Saliba. ""A common charger should fit all mobile phones, tablets, e-book readers and other portable devices."" Apple, along with 10 other leading tech giants such as Nokia and Samsung, signed a memorandum of understanding in 2009. They pledged to provide micro-USB compatible chargers for consumers. However, Apple took advantage of a loophole that allowed manufacturers to continue using their own chargers if they offered an adaptor. Then, in 2014, the EU passed the Radio Equipment Directive, which called for a ""renewed effort to develop a common charger"". Apple insisted that its slimmer devices would be unable to fit the then-new USB-C technology, and it claimed it would cost up to $2bn (Â£1.53bn) to meet the desired standard. Apple and many of its rivals, such as Huawei and Samsung, have already released products that charge their devices wirelessly. Although the technology is in its infancy, new developments have meant that it is now able to compete with traditional charging methods. Some analysts are even predicting thatApple could scrap its charging ports altogether,externalby releasing future iPhone and iPad models that rely solely on wireless charging.

"When Stacey reached the hospital, she found her sister Lucy (pictured) unrecognisable Stacey Jordan still wonders whether she could have done more to save her sister. Lucy White was just 24 when she died in hospital in summer 2018 after a line of cocaine triggered a heart attack and then a coma. Lucy, a student from Bristol, had been introduced to cocaine by her mother, a long-term drug user - butStacey had managed to get Lucy clean, before she relapsed, a few months before her death,external. When Stacey got to the hospital she found her sister, almost unrecognisable. ""I should have been more strict,"" she says 18-months on. ""You look back now and you're like, 'She was hiding from me. She was avoiding me for a reason.' ""But could I see it? Maybe not. Did I want to see it? That's maybe the question."" Figures compiled for BBC News by NHS Digital show Lucy's story is far from unusual, with record levels of cocaine use putting increasing pressure on the NHS in England. The figures indicate: a 76% increase in hospital admissions caused by cocaine since 2014-15 a 70% rise in admissions due to mental disorders linked to cocaine use people aged 30-39 have seen the largest increase in admissions the area with the highest admission rates is Merseyside Lewis, a 25-year-old from the Midlands, also suffered a heart attack after a line of cocaine. ""My friend's a nurse and she was taking my pulse and she's whispering, 'Call an ambulance.' My heart is pounding out of my chest."" Lewis was spending up to Â£300 a week on cocaine He had taken the drug numerous times before but on this occasion it reacted badly with his system and he needed medical treatment. He recovered fully and his cocaine use, which he admits once used to cost him Â£200 to Â£300 a week, has dramatically reduced in the past year. ""It wasn't making me happy at all,"" says Lewis of his drug habit. ""It's the worst paranoia I've had in my life. ""I'd be sat by my window, a car would pull up and I'd be looking over my shoulder. I'd fear my girlfriend was cheating on me."" Dealers are now marketing cocaine, once seen as mainly for rich people, more widely The increased need for the NHS to treat cocaine users comes as the number of people dying after taking the drug hits record levels. Since 2015, cocaine-related deaths have tripled in Scotland and doubled in England and Wales. Drug deaths at highest level on record Cocaine: The drug that is more than a middle-class problem Class A drug use 'at record levels due to young people' Cocaine in Britain is purer, more available and consumed more widely than ever before. Former professional footballer Colin McNair says addiction destroyed his career ""From the age of 15 we've supported people to try to help them address their cocaine use,"" says Eddie Buggy, a drugs worker in Hamilton, Lanarkshire, with the drug charity Addaction. ""It's easier to buy than alcohol, you don't have to go into a shop. ""You can use digital platforms to get it which young people are very familiar with - Snapchat, Whatsapp, stuff like that."" The increased availability is driven in part by dealers marketing more widely a drug once seen as mainly for rich people. Several strands with different levels of purity are now sold, costing anything from Â£100 a gram down to as little as Â£30 a gram. Scotland has highest drug death rate in EU 'I blew being a top footballer for drugs' The sheer amount of cocaine in Lanarkshire, indeed across Scotland, has led toHamilton Academical Football Club,externaltaking a leading role in warning teenagers of the dangers of drug abuse. The club's chief executive, Colin McGowan, himself a former drug and alcohol addict, has set up an anti-addiction charity, which goes into local schools educating youngsters. As part of his talk to teenagers, Colin McNair shows the effect on his body of two decades of drug use On a recent Friday, Colin gave a talk at Our Lady's High School in Motherwell accompanied by Colin McNair, a former professional footballer with Hearts, Falkirk and Motherwell whose life spiralled out of control and ended up in prison after he took a line of cocaine in his early 20s. ""People who are not into drugs can't understand it, 'You actually threw all that away?'"" he says. ""I didn't throw it away. When you are caught up in addiction, your choices are taken from you.

"This video can not be played The Red Rebel Brigade group took part in the climate protest in Aberdeen. Extinction Rebellion protesters have ended a blockade at the entrances to Shell's Aberdeen headquarters. Activists arrived at the Altens base at about 06:30 and remained at the site until 19:30 in a bid to ""hold Shell to account"". The group said the protest was part of its two-week long campaign targeting the fossil fuel industry. Shell said it was addressing its emissions and helping customers to reduce theirs. And industry body Oil and Gas UK (OGUK) said climate change would not be solved by ""stunts"". Extinction Rebellion also had its purple boat at the site. Attenborough warns of climate 'crisis moment' Seven in court after drilling rig 'occupation' The protesters were also in Aberdeen city centre on Thursday afternoon, including at the Union Square shopping centre. A statement from Extinction Rebellion Scotland said: ""Today's successful protest marked the final day of 10 days of action focused on the fossil fuel industry, and in particular Shell's role in driving the climate crisis. ""Thirty activists spent 13 hours blockading the entrances to Shell HQ all day, sending a message that we won't take their wilful avoidance in the face of the climate emergency any more."" The group vowed to continue taking action until governments and industry respond ""sensibly and appropriately"" to the warnings from scientists and public figures, such as broadcasterSir David Attenborough. It concluded: ""Anything other than a rapid winding down of the fossil fuel industry is irresponsible and reckless."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""I'm here today because as a parent I am ultimately responsible for the safety of my children whether today, tomorrow or in 30 years time."" The protest began early on Thursday A Shell spokesman said: ""The heightened awareness of climate change that we have seen over recent months is a good thing. ""As a company, we agree that urgent action is needed. What will really accelerate change is effective policy, investment in technology innovation and deployment, and changing customer behaviour. ""As we move to a lower-carbon future, we are committed to playing our part, by addressing our own emissions and helping customers to reduce theirs - because we all have a role to play."" OGUK communications director Gareth Wynn said: ""Climate change will be solved by practical actions not conspiracy theories and stunts. ""It's disappointing that this group is choosing to disrupt the normal working day of people in this industry, causing alarm rather than engage in meaningful discussion with key decision makers. ""Our industry is packed full of people with the engineering and environmental knowledge and skills to play a key part in reducing emissions and we are already taking action."" Ch Insp Davie Howieson, local area commander for Aberdeen South, said: ""Officers are currently in attendance at a peaceful protest in Wellington Road, Aberdeen, outside the Shell premises. ""The road was blocked from around 06:45, and road users are advised to avoid the area for the time being. We are liaising with both Shell and the protest organisers, Extinction Rebellion.""

"The number of UK pubs and bars increased for the first time in a decade during 2019,according to the Office for National Statistics,external(ONS). The total number rose by 315, or 0.8%, last year to 39,130, driven by food sales. The ONS said that the first increase seen since the financial crisis also saw a boost for smaller pubs. The British Beer & Pub Association (BBPA) said it ""cautiously welcomed"" the news. According to ONS data, the number of smaller venues with fewer than 10 employees increased by 85 in 2019. That follows on from more than 15 years of closures. High Stickland, senior statistician at the ONS, said: ""While smaller pubs have been struggling to survive in recent years, bigger pubs have been growing in number. ""We'll have to wait to see if this marks a revival for smaller 'locals'."" Why are micropubs succeeding? The ONS suggested that the overall boost was down to ""changing consumer habits"". New data shows that pubs and bars now employ more people to serve food, rather than drinks. In 2003, roughly four in 10 employees in the pub industry were bar workers, with about three working in the kitchen. The opposite is true today. Some 457,000 people now work in pubs and bars across the UK, with food staff making up 43.8% of employees in the sector. People are now spending more of their disposable income on eating out, rather than going for a pint. Meanwhile, overall consumption of alcohol has fallen by about 16% since 2004,according to the charity Alcohol Change UK,external. Despite this, and significant numbers of closures seen in recent years, the number of jobs added in the industry has generally been increasing. There were 7,000 more jobs in the sector in 2019 compared with 2018, an increase of 1.6%. The data received a mixed response from those in the trade. A spokesperson for the BBPA said that association ""cautiously welcomed any good news for pubs"". It added that its own data has consistently shown a higher total number of pubs in the UK, and a higher number of closures. It also said it hoped the upcoming Budget would see further respite for pubs and bars. ""Policy makers have a great opportunity in the March Budget to help pubs flourish, by easing the significant tax pressures they face from beer duty and business rates"", it said. How much do you spend on a night out? JD Wetherspoon 'to create 10,000 jobs over four years' Business rates: 'We might as well hand back the keys' Nik Antona, national chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), also called for a review of business rates. ""Unfortunately pubs continue to close across the country, particularly in small or rural communities. This means the loss of the social, cultural and economic benefits that come with a well-run local. ""To ensure pubs survive and thrive, they need a fair tax system and stability going forward. Camra continues to call on the Government for a review of the business rates system, as was promised in the Conservative general election manifesto."" Recent analysis by the BBC's Shared Data Unitshowed that councils are losing out on millions of pounds of potential business rates income because of a tax relief on empty properties.

"Greenland's massive ice sheet may have melted by a record amount this year, scientists have warned. During this year alone, it lost enough ice to raise the average global sea level by more than a millimetre. Researchers say they're ""astounded"" by the acceleration in melting and fear for the future of cities on coasts around the world. One glacier in southern Greenland has thinned by as much as 100 metres since I last filmed on it back in 2004. Essentially because its ice sheet is seven times the area of the UK and up to 2-3km thick in places. It stores so much frozen water that if the whole thing melted, it would raise sea levels worldwide by up to 7m. No one is suggesting that could happen for hundreds or even thousands of years but even a small increase in the rate of melting in coming decades could threaten millions of people living in low-lying areas. Bangladesh, Florida, and eastern England are among many areas known to be particularly vulnerable to rises in sea level over the course of the century. And although the island of Greenland is remote, stretching from the north of the Atlantic high into the Arctic, its fate could have major implications for the severity of future flooding and may even alter coastlines and force communities to move inland. The stark photo highlighting Greenlandâs ice loss Rain melts Greenland ice even in winter Mighty Greenland glacier slams on brakes This video can not be played A visit to the Sermilik glacier, which is rapidly melting One of the scientists studying the ice sheet, Dr Jason Box of the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS), says he's unnerved by the potential dangers and that coastal planners need to ""brace themselves"". ""Now that I'm starting to understand more of the consequences, it's actually keeping me awake at night because I realise the significance of this place around the world and the livelihoods that are already affected by sea level rise,"" he told me. Dr Jason Box, Geological Survey of Denmark Until recently, the ice sheet was generally in a state of balance - the amount of snow falling in winter was roughly equal to the amount of ice melting in summer. Last year, there was actually a gain in ice but that was relatively unusual. Over the last 30 years, decade-by-decade, Greenland has tended to shed more ice. Either the ice melts at the surface which sends torrents of water down to the surrounding seas or huge chunks of ice break off from the margins and float away as icebergs, gradually to melt. Recent years have seen hundreds of billions of tonnes of ice lost - and a rough guide to the effect on sea level is that 362 billion tonnes of melt raises the average ocean level by a millimetre. That doesn't sound a lot but in 2012 Greenland's loss totalled about 450 billion tonnes, and this year's melt is on course to produce about the same, or even slightly more, with some researchers suggesting it could raise sea levels by up to 2mm. And on top of that you have to factor in the ice melting in Antarctica plus the effect of water expanding as it warms. It all raises the level of the oceans. According to Dr Box, it's the recent increase in the average temperature that's being felt in Greenland's ice: ""Already effectively that's a death sentence for the Greenland ice sheet because also going forward in time we're expecting temperatures only to climb,"" he said. ""So, we're losing Greenland - it's really a question of how fast."" I've seen for myself what's happened to one corner of it. Sermilik glacier at the southern end is not one of Greenland's largest but it does rank as one of the fastest-shrinking streams of ice anywhere in the world. To reach it back in 2004, we flew past towering cliffs of ice, the front of the glacier an immense wall of pale grey and blue standing high above the sea. At that time, we accompanied a scientist who checked instruments positioned on the ice and he was stunned to see how the surface of the glacier was dropping by as much as a metre every month. And over the past 15 years, that rate of shrinking has continued so aggressively that now, on a return visit to the same glacier, the ice looks diminished, almost battered, and far less dominating in the landscape. Jason Box is with me and he gathers the latest readings which show that over this summer alone the glacier has shrunk by an estimated 9m. ""That's an astounding rate of loss,"" he said. Since my last visit, the surface of this margin of the ice sheet has lowered by an extraordinary 100m, more than halving in thickness, exposing the remaining ice to the relatively warmer temperatures of lower altitudes. While you might think of the Arctic as a pristine white landscape, the startling feature of the surface is how dirty it looks. Walking on it feels like arriving on the Moon. There are big areas of pale grey and smaller patches that are much darker, covered with what appears to be mud or silt - it's a grim and rather depressing sight. Algae growing on the Sermilik glacier It used to be thought that this darkness was mainly caused by a mix of dust and pollution particles carried on the winds from distant power stations and industrial centres. But since my last visit to Sermilik glacier, scientists have made an important breakthrough in understanding that a major cause of the darkening is in fact biological - algae,microscopically small plants that are flourishing in the melting ice. By turning the surface grey, or black, from its usual bright white, the algae make it less reflective, so it absorbs more of the Sun's rays. This accelerates the warming and in turn leads to even more melting. With the stakes so high for so many millions of people around the world, Greenland is the target of a major international research effort involving satellites, monitoring flights and expeditions on the ice itself. This video can not be played Nasa visualisation of the melting Greenland ice sheet The US space agency Nasa has for years run projects investigating exactly what's causing the ice to melt and what could happen to it in future. Back in 2005, I reported on a Nasa-funded team that made an important discovery about the movement of the ice sheet. Although the great mass of ice looks immobile, it's actually always inching down towards the coast and the team found that this movement doubles in speed in summer - as meltwater from the surface works its way to the bottom of the ice and helps it to slide along. Another revelation is that the ice is not only being melted by the air, as the atmosphere heats up, but also by warmer water reaching underneath the fronts of the glaciers. One Nasa scientist describes the ice as being under a hair-dryer and at the same time also on a cooker. And Jason Box and his colleagues at GEUS run a network of sensors on the ice to record details of the height of the surface and its reflectivity, and how they're changing. The hardest challenge for the scientific community is understanding enough of the mechanisms of the ice sheet to be able to offer reliable forecasts of sea level rise. Dr Masashi Niwano, a researcher with the Japan Meteorological Agency, is just back from a field trip to gather data to try to validate his computer simulations of the ice. ""The ice sheet mass is decreasing - that is very certain. And these results affect global sea-level rise - that is also very certain,"" he said. ""But maybe there are several physical processes that we don't understand, so developing future projections is very difficult."" There are only 56,000 Greenlanders, and they live in communities perched on the narrow band of land at the edge of the ice sheet which, though close, is usually out of sight. Inutsiaq Ibsen, 18, Naja-Theresia HÃ¸egh, 19, and Caroline Hartmann Hansen, 21, in Qaqortoq In the village of Narsaq, Christian Mortensen tells me a glacier that was visible when he was younger has since retreated and that icebergs seem to ""break more and more"" into the waters. Warmer conditions would allow more farming and, as we talk, cattle are grazing around us on pasture that's beside bright white chunks of ice bobbing in the sea. But for some young Greenlanders, climate change is becoming a big concern, partly because of the impact of ""their"" ice on other areas of the planet. Naja-Theresia HÃ¸egh, who's just finished school, was inspired by the Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg to lead a climate strike in her town of Qaqortoq, a pretty port of brightly painted houses. She describes a boat trip to the edge of the ice sheet where she found it ""astonishing and scary"" that so much water could flow out. ""All of that is ending up in our waters, into the sea, and to the rest of the world and, if this continues, it will someday just cover a whole country,"" Ms HÃ¸egh explained. Her friend Caroline Hartmann Hansen also talked about her fears over the uncontrolled nature of the melting. ""It's not our fault; it's everyone's,"" she said. If the calculations of Jason Box and his colleagues are right, the ice sheet is already crossing a threshold into an era in which there may still be years with net gains of ice - like last year - but the new normal will see more big losses. Even with a rapid move to cut emissions of warming gases - as outlined in the 2015 Paris climate agreement - Greenland could still see a growing rate of melting, though that could possibly be slowed. So, as with the young Greenland climate campaigners, the scientists feel the need to take action of their own. They have started a scheme to try to absorb some of the carbon dioxide emitted by the flights they take to conduct their research; Jason said he has been criticised for his high carbon footprint and ""feels guilty about it"". Dr Faezeh Nick plants tree saplings near Narsarsuaq Close to the airport at Narsarsuaq, which connects them to the glaciers of southern Greenland, the researchers are planting 6,000 saplings of Siberian larch, a type of tree known to do well in conditions here. They admit that 10 of the trees would need to grow for 60 years to absorb the carbon produced by a return flight from London to San Francisco, but they say it's a start and that if the project later leads to a much larger forest, it might ""make a dent"" in climate change. Meanwhile, as memories of last month's polar heatwave fade, the scientists are leaving ahead of the winter nights, to try to hone their predictions for what the scarred and darkened ice sheet is likely do next.

"Satya Nadella said that technology built without principles does more harm than good Microsoft has pledged to remove ""all of the carbon"" from the environment that it has emitted since the company was founded in 1975. Chief executive Satya Nadella said he wanted to achieve the goal by 2050 . To do so, the company aims to become ""carbon negative"" by 2030, removing more carbon from the environment than it emits. That goes beyond a pledge by its cloud-computing rival Amazon, which intends to go ""carbon neutral"" by 2040. ""When it comes to carbon, neutrality is not enough,"" said Microsoft president Brad Smith. ""The carbon in our atmosphere has created a blanket of gas that traps heat and is changing the world's climate,""he added in a blog,external. ""If we don't curb emissions, and temperatures continue to climb, science tells us that the results will be catastrophic."" The company also announced it was setting up a $1bn (Â£765m) climate innovation fund to develop carbon-tackling technologies. When a business says it iscarbon neutral, it aims to effectively add no carbon to the atmosphere. It can do this by: balancing its emissions, for example by removing a tonne of carbon from the atmosphere for every tonne it has produced offsetting its emissions, for example by investing in projects that reduce emissions elsewhere in the world not releasing greenhouse gases in the first place, for example by switching to renewable energy sources Until now, most companies have focused on offsetting emissions to achieve neutrality. This often involves funding projects in developing economies to reduce carbon emissions there, for example building hydroelectric power plants, encouraging families to stop using wood-based stoves, and helping businesses make use of solar power. These reductions are then deducted from the main company's own output. The result of this slows carbon emissions rather than reversing them. To becarbon negativea company must actually remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits. Microsoft says it will do this using a range of carbon capture and storage technologies. The announcement was largely welcomed by environmentalists, who said it showed Microsoft was thinking about the bigger climate change picture and not just its own role. ""It's a hat trick of sustainability leadership,"" said Elizabeth Sturcken from the Environmental Defence Fund. ""But to really shift the needle on climate change, we need 1,000 other [companies] to follow-suit and turn rhetoric into action."" However, Greenpeace warned that Microsoft still needed to address its ongoing relationship with oil and gas companies. ""While there is a lot to celebrate in Microsoft's announcement, a gaping hole remains unaddressed: Microsoft's expanding efforts to help fossil fuel companies drill more oil and gas with machine-learning and other AI technologies,"" said senior campaigner Elizabeth Jardim. British power plant promises to go carbon negative by 2030 Old oil rigs could become CO2 storage sites Turning carbon dioxide into cash Microsoft's plan is still more aggressive than those taken by other tech firms, including Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, which have not made ""carbon negative"" commitments. Microsoft has suggested a range of ways it could remove carbon from the atmosphere, including: seeding new forestsand expanding existing ones soil carbon sequestration- a process of putting carbon back into the ground.

Negative emissions become possible if the amount of CO2 stored as a result is greater than that emitted during production, transport and use Tech companies' manufacturing and data-processing centres create large amounts of carbon dioxide. By one estimate,external, the sector will account for up to 3.6% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions this year, more than double the level in 2007. And it has been forecast that in a worst-case scenario, this could grow to 14% by 2040. Microsoft has said it plans to halve emissions created directly by itself and those involved in its supply chain by 2030. One way the company intends to do this is by increasing the carbon fees it charges its internal business groups. Since 2012, Microsoft has forced its divisions to set budgets that take account of the cost of emissions created through electricity use, business travel and other activities. Now that charge will incorporate indirect emissions such as those created by customers using electricity to power the divisions' products. And since Microsoft cannot avoid producing CO2 altogether, it will invest in technologies to capture and store the gas to reduce the amount in the atmosphere. Mr Smith said this would involve tech ""that doesn't fully exist today"". The firm added that its data centres and other facilities would use 100% renewable energy by 2025.

"This video can not be played Sport should be part of everyone's life - Prince Harry The Duke of Sussex has met young rugby players at his first public event since he and the Duchess of Sussex said they would step back from royal life. Prince Harry laughed and joked as he met children in Buckingham Palace's gardens ahead of the Rugby League World Cup 2021 draw, which he hosted. He also met representatives of the 21 nations playing in the world cup. Meghan and the couple's son Archie are in Canada but the duke will reportedly stay in the UK for meetings next week. Queen agrees Harry and Meghan 'transition period' Why the 2021 Rugby League World Cup is different Talks involving the Queen, Prince Harry, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge to discuss the couple's future were held on Monday at the Queen's Sandringham estate. TheQueen released a statement,externalagreeing to their wish to step back as senior royals, become financially independent and to split their time between the UK and Canada. On Thursday, the prince appeared relaxed and at ease as he took part in the draw hosted at the palace - despite being questioned about his next move. BBC Sport journalistShamoon Hafez, who was at the event, saidPrince Harry gave ""a loud laugh"" when a reporter asked him how talks on his future were going. Prince Harry hosted the Rugby League World Cup draw at Buckingham Palace Children from St Vincent de Paul Catholic primary school are local tag rugby champions Prince Harry hosted the Rugby League World Cup draws for the men's, women's and wheelchair tournaments, as part of his role as patron of the Rugby Football League. Speaking to BBC News, Jon Dutton, the tournament's chief executive, praised the prince for being ""authentic"", ""engaged"" and taking his time to meet representatives from participating nations. The tournament runs from 23 October to 27 November 2021 in 17 cities across England, with 16 men's, eight women's and eight wheelchair teams taking part. England will play Samoain the opening match at St James' Park, Newcastle.

""The perception in rugby league is that you need to be tough,"" he said. ""You can't show your feelings, you have to grin and bear it. ""But something like the mental fitness charter will help us make real progress in getting rid of the stigma associated with mental illness, and remind people that it's not just about being physically fit, but more importantly mentally strong."" Mr Sinfield added: ""To have a real figurehead involved in it who's championing it left right and centre is only going to do good things."" Former rugby league England captain Kevin Sinfield, pictured left in 2017, said Prince Harry has been ""fantastic for the sport"" There has been speculation Prince Harry would travel to Canada after the draw but a source quoted by the Press Association said: ""The duke has some meetings here early next week."" Prince Harry's brother, the Duke of Cambridge, did not mention the talks between senior royals during his first official engagement of the year,on a visit to Bradford with the Duchess of Cambridge.

"Satya Nadella said that technology built without principles does more harm than good Microsoft has pledged to remove ""all of the carbon"" from the environment that it has emitted since the company was founded in 1975. Chief executive Satya Nadella said he wanted to achieve the goal by 2050 . To do so, the company aims to become ""carbon negative"" by 2030, removing more carbon from the environment than it emits. That goes beyond a pledge by its cloud-computing rival Amazon, which intends to go ""carbon neutral"" by 2040. ""When it comes to carbon, neutrality is not enough,"" said Microsoft president Brad Smith. ""The carbon in our atmosphere has created a blanket of gas that traps heat and is changing the world's climate,""he added in a blog,external. ""If we don't curb emissions, and temperatures continue to climb, science tells us that the results will be catastrophic."" The company also announced it was setting up a $1bn (Â£765m) climate innovation fund to develop carbon-tackling technologies. When a business says it iscarbon neutral, it aims to effectively add no carbon to the atmosphere. It can do this by: balancing its emissions, for example by removing a tonne of carbon from the atmosphere for every tonne it has produced offsetting its emissions, for example by investing in projects that reduce emissions elsewhere in the world not releasing greenhouse gases in the first place, for example by switching to renewable energy sources Until now, most companies have focused on offsetting emissions to achieve neutrality. This often involves funding projects in developing economies to reduce carbon emissions there, for example building hydroelectric power plants, encouraging families to stop using wood-based stoves, and helping businesses make use of solar power. These reductions are then deducted from the main company's own output. The result of this slows carbon emissions rather than reversing them. To becarbon negativea company must actually remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits. Microsoft says it will do this using a range of carbon capture and storage technologies. The announcement was largely welcomed by environmentalists, who said it showed Microsoft was thinking about the bigger climate change picture and not just its own role. ""It's a hat trick of sustainability leadership,"" said Elizabeth Sturcken from the Environmental Defence Fund. ""But to really shift the needle on climate change, we need 1,000 other [companies] to follow-suit and turn rhetoric into action."" However, Greenpeace warned that Microsoft still needed to address its ongoing relationship with oil and gas companies. ""While there is a lot to celebrate in Microsoft's announcement, a gaping hole remains unaddressed: Microsoft's expanding efforts to help fossil fuel companies drill more oil and gas with machine-learning and other AI technologies,"" said senior campaigner Elizabeth Jardim. British power plant promises to go carbon negative by 2030 Old oil rigs could become CO2 storage sites Turning carbon dioxide into cash Microsoft's plan is still more aggressive than those taken by other tech firms, including Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, which have not made ""carbon negative"" commitments. Microsoft has suggested a range of ways it could remove carbon from the atmosphere, including: seeding new forestsand expanding existing ones soil carbon sequestration- a process of putting carbon back into the ground. This could be achieved by adding microbes and nutrients to parched earth, which should have the added benefits of making the soil more fertile and less susceptible to erosion direct air capture- sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, possibly by using large fans to move air through a filter that can remove the gas bio-energy with carbon capture- growing crops and then capturing the CO2 they emit when, for example, they are burned to produce heat or fermented to make fuels such as bioethanol.

" The families still waiting for 'justice' By Caroline Gall Like many nine-year-old boys Lassana loved football. In the streets and parks near his home outside Barcelona he would spend hours kicking a ball around with his friends. But unlike the thousands of other boys hoping to become stars, Lassana’s natural talent had been noticed. An FC Barcelona scout had spotted him and wanted to sign him for the club’s famous youth academy, where stars such as Lionel Messi had cut their teeth. But Lassana’s father, Ousmane, was not there to celebrate with him. He had moved to Birmingham, England, months before in search of work. Despite living thousands of miles away, Ousmane still arranged lifts to training and games for Lassana or his older brother Mohammadu, who played for a different team. Before every match he would also call them and wish them luck. But one night, the phone call never came. Lassana joined FC Barcelona's famous La Masia youth academy Lassana joined FC Barcelona's famous La Masia youth academy It was 7 July 2016. Lassana and Mohammadu were settling down in front of the TV to watch France play Germany in Euro 2016. Mohammadu was due to play in a tournament the next day. WhatsApp showed their father had been online that morning. The boys watched the game, waiting for their father to call. Their mother, Aminata, tried not to worry. Ousmane had phoned his family every day since moving to the UK. She busied herself with the household chores and comforted her three-year-old daughter Fanta who, unusually, would not stop crying. The boys continued to wait. As the match neared its end, they were interrupted by a knock at the door. It was their great-uncle, Keemo. Keemo told Aminata he had found out about an accident at Ousmane’s workplace, a recycling centre in Birmingham where he sorted scrap metal. He told her no-one had heard from him since. Aminata knew straight away what this meant. “As soon as he came, I just knew something was not right,” she says. “I said 'This is the man I married. I can tell you he has never gone a whole day without calling us. So I can confirm it for you.'” Ousmane, her husband, was dead. Like many nine-year-old boys Lassana loved football.

I can tell you he has never gone a whole day without calling us. So I can confirm it for you.'” Ousmane, her husband, was dead.   One week later, Lassana signed for FC Barcelona’s youth academy. The next day he and his mother and siblings boarded a flight to the UK. Before he died, Ousmane had saved enough money for his family to visit him in Birmingham. It was intended in part as a celebration of Lassana’s success. Instead they were flying out to retrieve his body. At the airport, the family were met by police. Aminata found herself completely disorientated and rooted to the spot. “I found it so difficult, I couldn’t move forward,” she says. “The police had to actually move me and take me into the room. It felt like someone was holding my legs.” In a side room, Ousmane's brother, who lived in the UK, translated into their native language, Mandinka, as the police explained what had happened. They said Ousmane had been working at a metal recycling centre when a concrete wall toppled over and crushed him and four other men. The police offered to let Aminata see her husband’s body for the last time but, crying, she refused.  One week later, Lassana signed for FC Barcelona’s youth academy.

The police offered to let Aminata see her husband’s body for the last time but, crying, she refused. “My father was very, very happy when I was picked by Barcelona,” says Lassana, who is now aged 13. “I was so happy. If he was alive now, not only would he be encouraging me, he would be saying try harder because it’s so competitive to be a footballer.” Lassana scores an impressive solo goal for FC Barcelona's youth team But life for Lassana and his family has been a struggle since. Three years after his father's death they have still not received compensation. The family of five share a small apartment in the town of Parets del Valles, surviving on monthly benefits of about 1,000 euros (£880). There is no money for trips out and other treats for the children. Instead Aminata takes them to the park to play. On birthdays, she prepares a meal and bakes a cake but presents are another luxury the family cannot afford. “Apart from the emotional day-to-day struggle, it’s paying for books and school trips for the four children,” she says. “When did I last buy myself something? I have no consideration for that. I have bought myself nothing since Ousmane passed away. I can’t think of that. “It’s all for the children and just surviving.” Ousmane had left Senegal in search of work in the late 1990s. Like many west Africans, he settled in Spain, where he lived legally and worked as a security guard. But the Spanish economy was hit by the global economic crisis of 2008. Ousmane first found his hours reduced, then eventually lost his job. He struggled to find new work and moved to the UK in March 2016, leaving his family behind. Just four months later he was dead. Even when he had been alive, Aminata struggled to make ends meet. Ousmane had not just been supporting his wife and children but relatives back in Senegal too. Each month he would send between 150 and 200 euros to his widowed mother and six brothers and sisters. He was also expected to send occasional money to Aminata’s father as a sign of ""respect"". The men who died alongside Ousmane were from The Gambia - Senegal's smaller neighbour. Each was sending money back to family in Africa, despite only earning the UK minimum wage of just over £7 an hour. Their relatives depended on this money for survival in one of the world's poorest regions. The men's deaths left these families impoverished. Three-and-a-half years later, the men's families still have questions about how and why they died. An inquest jury found their deaths were accidental but Shredmet, the firm that ran the recycling centre, had failed to notice the wall's dangerous state. The inquest concluded this “caused or contributed” to the men’s deaths. A criminal investigation by the UK’s Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has still not concluded. The families say they have not been contacted by Shredmet since just after the wall collapsed. It has left them feeling bitter and ignored. “In my opinion it's very clear they [Shredmet] don't value human life,” says Aminata. “I came to England [to identify the body] and spent that time there and I never once saw the owners or heard from them. They don't seem to care about people.” This summer Lassana was dealt another blow - he was let go by FC Barcelona’s youth team. He is not too disappointed. He says he has been told if he works hard he can force his way back in. He is still determined to make it as a footballer, for his father’s memory. “It makes me work harder and if I do really well, I’ll dedicate it to him, to show what I can do from my hard work,” he says. But he has other matters on his mind. He wants to know why his father died at work. “The company needs to recognise the wrong it’s done,” he says. “It’s not just about money. We need to have justice.” Whenever her phone rang, Dado hoped it was her husband. She would answer it and the peace of her rural surroundings in the east of The Gambia would be shattered, replaced by the sound of lorries and machinery. Then she would hear Saibo’s voice say “hello”. They spoke several times each day, despite having lived thousands of miles apart for much of their long marriage. Wearing a headset under his hard hat, Saibo would talk to Dado and his children for hours. They discussed their family, their friends, and their plans for the future. Although their marriage had been arranged, it had been a love match too. As young newlyweds they would hold hands in public, defying the disapproval of their conservative neighbours. The Gambia’s Islamic culture permitted men up to four wives, but Saibo opted for just one - Dado. “He would buy me little things, hug and hold me,” she says. “Whatever he could do for me, he would - and me for him.” But poverty in The Gambia meant Saibo was always going to leave in search of work. The country is among Africa’s poorest. Situated on either bank of the Gambia River, Western tourists are drawn to its beautiful beaches and year-round sunshine. Most Gambians support themselves through tourism or subsistence farming. But more than a fifth of the country’s GDP consists of money sent back by Gambians working abroad, according to a2017 report by the International Fund for Agricultural Development. These migrants typically do the kind of physically tough, unpleasant and poorly paid jobs many Europeans do not want. It was the prospect of such work that persuaded Saibo to move from Spain to the UK in 2014. After many years living apart, Saibo was tantalisingly close to being reunited with his family in Europe. In Spain, where he had lived for 10 years, he had been unable to afford the visas. Before that he had mined diamonds in Sierra Leone, but the civil war there meant it was too dangerous for his family. Now, in the UK, he was earning more money. He submitted his family's immigration application to the Home Office and paid for expensive DNA checks to confirm he was the father of his four children. While he waited to hear news he carried on picking through the metal at the recycling centre. Saibo had called Dado as normal before he started work on 7 July 2016. He told her he was busier than usual because many workers were still celebrating Eid and had not come in. “It was early-morning prayers when we spoke and he said 'God willing, my family will be here soon,’” Dado says. He told her he would call later during his break. But that call never came. Saibo’s job was hard, dirty and noisy. Lorries would come and go all day, depositing large piles of waste material at the site in Nechells, near Birmingham city centre. The men would spend the day sorting through this pile and separating out the metal. At the end of each shift, they would go home caked in dirt. Poorly paid, their employment was also precarious - their jobs were in the “gig economy” and they did not know from one day to the next whether they would have work. It was also - unbeknown to them - incredibly dangerous. The men would stand next to a conveyor belt housed in a large steel-framed shed with the top of the belt jutting through the roof. The men were clearing metal from the right-hand side bay when the wall fell The men were clearing metal from the right-hand side bay when the wall fell If the belt stopped working, as it would from time to time, the men would be told to sweep out bays storing piles of metal. Bordering one of these bays was a towering wall consisting of concrete blocks. There was no mortar joining the blocks - they were designed to interlock - and the wall had no foundations. But the design was safe and legal if appropriately used. This wall, however, had been loaded on one side with 263 tonnes of metal briquettes. As the men cleared out the bay on the other side of the wall, the concrete blocks collapsed without warning. The men below stood no chance. After the wreckage was cleared, their broken bodies could only be identified by their fingerprints. Saibo had called Dado as normal before he started work on 7 July 2016. He told her he was busier than usual because many workers were still celebrating Eid and had not come in. “It was early-morning prayers when we spoke and he said 'God willing, my family will be here soon,’” Dado says.

Dado had been pregnant with twins the last time she saw her husband. Now those girls are six years old. She has decided not to tell them about their father’s death yet. She tells them Saibo is still working abroad. The rest of the family go along with the fiction. Home is her uncle’s cramped compound in Serrekunda, a bustling town close to the Gambian capital, Banjul. Dado and her children share the home with her sister, brothers and mother. After Saibo’s death she moved out of his family compound in the village of Garowol, where she had lived since they married in 2000. Saibo’s wages had indirectly supported about 50 people, including Dado and her children, but the loss of his income made it difficult for them to support her. No-one asked her to move out, but custom dictated she should. She is now desperately short of money. “Having no husband and four kids is hard,” she says. “I am obviously really struggling. “I have tried every avenue to get work - cooking, cleaning - but struggled and not found anything. Friends help out when they can. I don’t know what the future holds. “If I got some money then it would be so my children would have a better life and can achieve an education - that’s the only way it can happen. “I would not buy luxury things, I would save it for the children and a better life and their future. I have no idea what [compensation] we would get, if anything.”  Half a world away it has been difficult for her to find out more about what happened to her husband. The inquest into the men's deaths was in November 2018 - more than two years after the wall collapsed. Dado tried to attend but the UK did not grant her a visa in time. She arrived three days after the hearing concluded. She consoles herself remembering happier times, when Saibo would come to visit her in The Gambia from Spain. “He’d tell me about Europe and how different it was to Africa and how he lived. I think then that we were getting close to our dream [of living together in Europe]. “But I had to accept that in either three, four or five months he was going again. As a woman from The Gambia you expect this to happen, to be apart.” After years of dreaming, the family had been finally on the verge of reuniting. Then the accident happened. “My world changed that day,” says Dado. “We didn’t have long enough together as a couple. Clearly, this has destroyed our life.

Litter is scattered around the street. Almost every room of her home has black mould on the walls. She worries about the cough her four-year-old daughter Fatou has developed. The cough is so pronounced, concerned staff at her nursery have also tried to contact the landlord about the damp. Unaware, little Fatou chirps and giggles as she plays around the house, her boundless energy keeping her mother busy. Hatoumata tries to make her money last but it is hard. There is nothing spare after each cycle of benefits. She has no family living nearby and very few friends. She is lonely and depressed. It has been like this since her husband died. Like most Gambian women, Hatoumata had always been dependent on men. She was 10 years old when her family arranged her marriage to 37-year-old Mohammadou. She was his second wife but the age gap was not unusual - their marriage would not be consummated until she was an adult. Mohammadou was already working in Spain and flew back there almost immediately after the wedding. Meanwhile, Hatoumata went to live with Mohammadou’s family in their compound. She would see her husband infrequently over the next 12 years. Then, when she was 22, he asked her to live with him in Birmingham, where he had moved in search of work. She was soon mother to a baby girl. “I was very lonely at first because I was missing my family and I was here alone as Mohammadou was out working all day,” she says. “Over time, I began to settle. We planned to stay in Birmingham and this would be our life and to have more children. But then it changed.” The night before the accident they had celebrated Eid at their local mosque. Although Ramadan had ended, Mohammadou had chosen to fast for six more days. So Hatoumata rose before dawn to heat through his breakfast. After he left for work, she went back to bed with Fatou. They were asleep when she heard banging at the door. She opened it and was confronted by the sight of two police officers. “They were standing outside and I asked ‘How can I help you?’, but I didn’t understand the language,” she says. “Because of that, I said ‘Hold on, I will call my husband and he can talk to you’. So I called him and it was ringing and ringing and he wasn't picking it up.” As she waited for a friend to come over to translate, other Gambian men - friends of her husband - turned up at her house. Some asked if she had been in touch with Mohammadou. None mentioned to her what had happened. Eventually, her friend arrived and she learned, from the police, that her husband had died. “I could not believe it,” Hatoumata says. “I knew he worked with metals but I never thought it was a dangerous job.” Hatoumata’s house in Winson Green, Birmingham, is cold and damp. Outside, a cupboard has been left by someone to rot.

Eventually, her friend arrived and she learned, from the police, that her husband had died. “I could not believe it,” Hatoumata says. “I knew he worked with metals but I never thought it was a dangerous job.” Mohammadou’s death left Hatoumata isolated in a country where she knew few people and could not speak the language. Dependent since childhood on her husband and his family, this family support network was now reduced. Although she is supported by her fellow Soninke speakers in the area, she is less integrated within the Gambian community than when her husband was alive. Her lack of good English - she says the lessons clash with her childcare - has also made it hard to assimilate in the UK. “I honestly regret coming to this country,” she says. “Not that I could foresee this, but if I knew, I would never have come here. “I would like to work, I really would, but I can’t right now because of childcare. My daughter is at nursery. Who would pick her up every day? “I am just existing. There is a lot of thinking about the past, the present. It’s very depressing. I feel trapped here.” Despite the loneliness, she is reluctant to return to The Gambia. Fatou, her daughter, was born in Birmingham and she wants her to have the life opportunities a UK education offers. Hatoumata's home is only a few miles from the recycling centre where her husband and the other men lost their lives. Yet she knows as little as Aminata and Dado about the accident. She says she is “confused” about why she has had to wait so long for compensation, but would “rather have my husband here and have a happy life here”. Her anger is focused on Shredmet, the company that employed her husband through an agency and which, she believes, has not treated the men’s families properly since. “You cannot say they [Shredmet] are a good company,” she says. “Even to this day after the accident they have not come to see the families or given condolences. “This is very bad. They can't just leave us like this. They need to help. We need to be compensated and [not] just be left like this.” Mohammadou’s death left Hatoumata isolated in a country where she knew few people and could not speak the language.

While he was alive she would often see his bicycle outside the mosque near their home in Aston. After his death she found it too upsetting to walk past. She had been working as a cleaner at a Travelodge in Birmingham city centre when the accident happened. Despite being legally in the UK and having worked there for months, she panicked when the police arrived. Fearing she was to be deported, she ran to quickly gather her things. Instead the two police officers said her husband was dead. “The world did not really mean anything to me any more after that,” she says. “I was in a complete daze. But we did not know what had happened, no-one knew. “It took me over a year to get over it. I still now get lapses… and fall back.” Hawa is one of three widows, along with Hatoumata, still living in the UK. The other, Awa Dibba - wife of Almamo Jammeh - lives in Leeds. Like the others, Hawa has struggled financially. “I work about 16 hours a week and have a rented council house, but it is cold in the kitchen with a hole in the ceiling to the outside,” she says. “My son is at school here, but he doesn't like talking about his dad. It has really affected him. They were very, very close.” Hawa and her son had followed Bangally to the UK from Spain. She says she had stressed to her husband many times how insecure his work was and that he should find something else. “But he said ‘What can I do? I don’t speak English yet and if I leave this work, how am I going to look after us?’,” she says. “There are limited options available. He was going for English classes while he worked but did not know enough yet. “It was very difficult to leave Spain to come here as immigrants. Our objective was to work and look after family. But when he came here not only could he not get regular, stable work, he lost his life.” Following the accident, the families had to wait two years for the inquest to be held. Until this concluded they could not legally begin a compensation claim. An HSE report prepared ahead of the inquest was clear about why the wall fell. “The wall collapsed because it was not designed to withstand the lateral loads imposed by the steel briquettes and was therefore inherently unstable,” it said. “The loading increased from one side as material was removed from the bay the men were working in. The fact that the walls were not properly designed, in [the inspector's view], was the reason why it collapsed.” The report said Shredmet could have installed walls designed to withstand the loads. After the accident, other retaining walls at the site were inspected and also found to be defective. While Shredmet kept daily and monthly inspection records it had failed to recognise the walls were dangerous. The fatal accident was not Shredmet's first health and safety incident. In 2012 the firm was fined £50,000 over an accident in which an employee's arm was injured. The company subsequently employed a health and safety adviser, Michael White. But the inquest was told he had only spent a total of 12 hours at the Nechells site in the year before the men's deaths. The inquest heard conflicting accounts from Shredmet and Mr White about the wall. Although Shredmet said it had been in situ for about 18 months  prior to the collapse, Mr White said he could not recall seeing it and had never been asked to assess its safety. Just months before the accident, there was also a large fire at the site. West Midlands Fire Service says the cause was accidental and it subsequently gave the company advice. The families’ civil compensation claim began about a year ago. Their lawyer asked Shredmet for an initial payment to help the struggling families - without admitting liability - but the company refused. Shredmet has declined to comment, citing the ongoing HSE investigation.  But at the time of the inquest, managing director Wayne Hawkeswood said he was ""absolutely devastated"" by the deaths of the five men and constantly thought about ""the loss their family and friends have suffered"". Like the other widows, Hawa feels abandoned since the accident. They are angry at the lack of contact from Shredmet and the speed with which the company resumed operations after the men's deaths. “What has really shocked me is that the company got up and running so soon afterwards,” Hawa says. “They did not do what they should to protect the workers and they don't respect human beings. “This is part of their culture, they have no respect.” Hawa had urged her husband Bangally to find more secure work Hawa had urged her husband Bangally to find more secure work Hawa Kaba is at home in her terraced house in Leicester, where she has been living for the past two years with her son. She moved there from Birmingham following the accident, unable to cope with the constant reminders of her husband, Bangally.

He maintains the tragedy at Shredmet is only a small part of a wider problem. The men’s deaths, he warns, have implications for anyone employed in similar jobs. The industry the men were employed in - waste and recycling - is the second most dangerous in the UK. Between 2014 and 2018, almost eight in every 100,000 workers died. This rate is 17 times the national average,according to a 2019 HSE report. It is among the UK’s most lucrative industries, worth an estimated £7bn a year to the economy. In recent years it has enjoyed a boom. Demand has been driven by rising metal prices, a shortage of landfill sites and laws restricting the dumping of electronic equipment in them. Mr Cooper says the recycling industry “exploits migrant labour for enormous profits”. Daniel Lemberger Cooper said the men's deaths raised issues for every worker in Britain Daniel Lemberger Cooper said the men's deaths raised issues for every worker in Britain “There is a now huge demand for recycling and the industry is getting bigger and bigger, and these workers will be needed more and more,” he says. “The five men were honest, hardworking and decent human beings. “The conditions in which these workers were employed, of precarious employment, zero-hours contracts, temporary and agency work, the so-called gig economy and exploitation, and issues of low pay and long hours are spreading throughout the economy,” he adds. “This is an issue for every worker in Britain.” Leading safety experts say the standard of the UK’s health and safety enforcement has declined over the past decade. After years of cuts there are fewer inspectors carrying out fewer inspections, leaving many workplaces unsafe, they say. Shredmet had not been inspected by the HSE since the 2010 accident in which an employee injured their arm. Lawrence Waterman, chairman of the British Safety Council, says the HSE has been under-resourced since the days of the coalition government. In 2010 the government imposed 33% cuts on the HSE. Then, in 2012,  the Prime Minister David Cameron stated the UK's""excessive""health and safety culture was costing businesses billions and he intended to""kill""it off for good. After the Conservatives won the general election in 2015, further cuts followed in theSpending Reviewlater that year. Lawrence Waterman said more effort was needed to keep workplaces safe Lawrence Waterman said more effort was needed to keep workplaces safe “It’s not just resources that have had an impact,” says Mr Waterman. ""It’s the political hangover of now two prime ministers ago who wanted to kill health and safety, with a feeling that red tape ruled and we were being told how to live our lives. “Well, the other side of that is that five guys never came home to their families. “Hanging over businesses and the government is the need to be honest and place more value on looking after people at work.” Hilda Palmer, from the Hazards Campaign, which promotes workplace safety, says a disproportionately large number of those killed or injured at work are immigrants. “Unfortunately, if you look at the names of the people that are killed, they are mostly foreign-sounding names - eastern Europeans and now west African,” she says. “I also know of a case involving some Peruvians. It seems it’s the new wave of migrants that get drawn in - the most vulnerable.” She says legislation, enforcement and trade unions have all been “attacked through the cuts”. Laws restricting the dumping of electronic equipment in landfill have fuelled demand for recycling Laws restricting the dumping of electronic equipment in landfill have fuelled demand for recycling “That creates an environment for cowboys to flourish,” she added. “If employers see checks being done, prosecutions, fines and notices being issued, that reminds them to act.” The Conservatives declined to comment but Vince Cable, the former Liberal Democrat leader who was a member of the coalition cabinet, says the global financial crisis was to blame. “Austerity was going to happen whatever government came in,” he says. “The cuts [Labour chancellor] Alistair Darling had were the same as what the coalition did and this was as a result of the huge financial crisis and reduced revenue that the country found itself in.” The dead men's families remain bewildered that three years after the accident the HSE has still not decided whether or not to charge Shredmet. Mr Waterman says the slowness of the HSE investigation is due to its underfunding. The HSE aims to complete 80% of fatal investigations within one year but in 2018-19 just 65% were. “When you look at that, it’s not unreasonable for the families to feel that justice is being denied,” Mr Waterman says. “If the families of the five guys were plugged-in middle-class agitators, there may have been more pressure being felt to keep the HSE focused on finding out what happened.” The HSE says the families’ demand for a speedy conclusion is “understandable” but it needs to ensure its investigation is “thorough”. “As with many complex, challenging criminal investigations relating to multiple fatalities, following new lines of inquiry and forensically examining evidence can mean investigations take longer than families would understandably hope,” a spokesman says. “Since the inquests concluded... our time and energy has been fully focused on reviewing the case, bringing together evidence heard by the coroner and concluding the criminal investigation. “We are working hard to resolve any delays and have endeavoured to give regular updates to the families where possible.” The families' lawyer believes they are the victims of a legal system that does not treat deaths at work with the same seriousness as other fatalities. “The criminal justice system fails to treat deaths and injuries at work – unlike deaths in almost any other setting – as the possible outcome of serious crimes and this must urgently change,” he says. He wants the government to legislate to prevent the exploitation of workers. “A fitting tribute and legacy to those that died would be that immediate steps are taken by government to ensure that we learn the lessons of why these men died so that no-one else suffers like they have,” he says. “If immediate, legislative change is not enacted, there are going to be more injuries and further deaths. The government and employers will have blood on their hands.” “By any standard this is a profoundly shocking case - no-one should go to work and die in 21stCentury Britain.” Daniel Lemberger Cooper, the families’ lawyer, works for Imran Khan & Partners, the firm that represented the family of the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence.

Daniel Lemberger Cooper said the men's deaths raised issues for every worker in Britain Daniel Lemberger Cooper said the men's deaths raised issues for every worker in Britain “There is a now huge demand for recycling and the industry is getting bigger and bigger, and these workers will be needed more and more,” he says. “The five men were honest, hardworking and decent human beings. “The conditions in which these workers were employed, of precarious employment, zero-hours contracts, temporary and agency work, the so-called gig economy and exploitation, and issues of low pay and long hours are spreading throughout the economy,” he adds. “This is an issue for every worker in Britain.” Leading safety experts say the standard of the UK’s health and safety enforcement has declined over the past decade. After years of cuts there are fewer inspectors carrying out fewer inspections, leaving many workplaces unsafe, they say. Shredmet had not been inspected by the HSE since the 2010 accident in which an employee injured their arm. Lawrence Waterman, chairman of the British Safety Council, says the HSE has been under-resourced since the days of the coalition government. In 2010 the government imposed 33% cuts on the HSE. Then, in 2012,  the Prime Minister David Cameron stated the UK's""excessive""health and safety culture was costing businesses billions and he intended to""kill""it off for good. After the Conservatives won the general election in 2015, further cuts followed in the Spending Review later that year. Lawrence Waterman said more effort was needed to keep workplaces safe Lawrence Waterman said more effort was needed to keep workplaces safe “It’s not just resources that have had an impact,” says Mr Waterman. ""It’s the political hangover of now two prime ministers ago who wanted to kill health and safety, with a feeling that red tape ruled and we were being told how to live our lives. “Well, the other side of that is that five guys never came home to their families. “Hanging over businesses and the government is the need to be honest and place more value on looking after people at work.” Hilda Palmer, from the Hazards Campaign, which promotes workplace safety, says a disproportionately large number of those killed or injured at work are immigrants. “Unfortunately, if you look at the names of the people that are killed, they are mostly foreign-sounding names - eastern Europeans and now west African,” she says. “I also know of a case involving some Peruvians. It seems it’s the new wave of migrants that get drawn in - the most vulnerable.” Flowers left at the site of the accident in 2016 Flowers left at the site of the accident in 2016 She says legislation, enforcement and trade unions have all been “attacked through the cuts”. “That creates an environment for cowboys to flourish,” she added. “If employers see checks being done, prosecutions, fines and notices being issued, that reminds them to act.” The Conservatives declined to comment but Vince Cable, the former Liberal Democrat leader who was a member of the coalition cabinet, says the global financial crisis was to blame. “Austerity was going to happen whatever government came in,” he says. “The cuts [Labour chancellor] Alistair Darling had were the same as what the coalition did and this was as a result of the huge financial crisis and reduced revenue that the country found itself in.” Laws restricting the dumping of electronic equipment in landfill have fuelled demand for recycling Laws restricting the dumping of electronic equipment in landfill have fuelled demand for recycling The dead men's families remain bewildered that three years after the accident the HSE has still not decided whether or not to charge Shredmet. Mr Waterman says the slowness of the HSE investigation is due to its underfunding. The HSE aims to complete 80% of fatal investigations within one year but in 2018-19 just 65% were. “When you look at that, it’s not unreasonable for the families to feel that justice is being denied,” Mr Waterman says. “If the families of the five guys were plugged-in middle-class agitators, there may have been more pressure being felt to keep the HSE focused on finding out what happened.” The HSE says the families’ demand for a speedy conclusion is “understandable” but it needs to ensure its investigation is “thorough”. “As with many complex, challenging criminal investigations relating to multiple fatalities, following new lines of inquiry and forensically examining evidence can mean investigations take longer than families would understandably hope,” a spokesman says. “Since the inquests concluded... our time and energy has been fully focused on reviewing the case, bringing together evidence heard by the coroner and concluding the criminal investigation. “We are working hard to resolve any delays and have endeavoured to give regular updates to the families where possible.” The families' lawyer believes they are the victims of a legal system that does not treat deaths at work with the same seriousness as other fatalities. “The criminal justice system fails to treat deaths and injuries at work – unlike deaths in almost any other setting – as the possible outcome of serious crimes and this must urgently change,” Mr Cooper says. He wants the government to legislate to prevent the exploitation of workers. “A fitting tribute and legacy to those that died would be that immediate steps are taken by government to ensure that we learn the lessons of why these men died so that no-one else suffers like they have,” he says. “If immediate, legislative change is not enacted, there are going to be more injuries and further deaths. The government and employers will have blood on their hands.” Three years after the wall fell on him, Tombong still walks with a limp. The 55-year-old had been cleaning out the bay with the other men when he heard a sudden, loud rumble. He was knocked out by the concrete blocks and, when he came to amid the dust and debris, he discovered he was pinned to the ground by a 1.5-tonne concrete block on his legs. He drifted in and out of consciousness as rescuers scrambled to extract him. “I couldn't move, I could just hear noise and feel the pain in my leg,” he says. “I didn’t know what was going on.” When he woke up properly he was in hospital. He did not realise his colleagues had died until his friend Bassamba, who witnessed the accident, told him. It was devastating and not only on an emotional level. He had only been working at the site for two months and has been unemployed ever since. Standing can be painful while sitting down for too long also causes him discomfort. He relies on the charity of his local mosque in Smethwick to survive and says he has had difficulty claiming sickness benefit. He is haunted by the memories of what happened that summer’s day. “When I think about it sometimes I can’t get to sleep,” he says. “I lose my mind if I sit down and think about it all. I can’t move on. I can’t work. What can I do? “I’ve been going round in circles. I’m in limbo. I am suffering. “We are powerless. What can we do?” Reporting: Caroline Gall Additional reporting: Daniel Wainwright Translation: Ebrima Sillah Video: FC Barcelona Location photography: Parets del Valles:  Xavier Cervera Vallve (Panos) Serrekunda:  Sylvain Cherkaoui (Panos) Birmingham/Leicester: John Bray Other photography: Getty, Press Association, SWNS Editor & online production: Dave Green",Positive,0.9999808
"Flybe, the airline which has received government help to avert collapse, is planning to scrap its Newquay-Heathrow service in March. It will replace it with flights from Newquay to London's Gatwick airport. It comes just days after ministers said the airline should receive support because of its regional connectivity. The change is expected to anger businesses in the South West, who value the range of international destinations Heathrow provides. ""Heathrow puts you on the map when it comes to attracting inward investment,"" said one regional development official. Cornwall's links to London are considered important enough to make the route one of the few in the UK to be operated under a ""public service obligation"" contract. This means the government offers a subsidy for the route and invites tenders to operate it. Backlash against Flybe's government rescue grows Flybe: Three questions for the company The BBC understands that Flybe had been talking to Newquay airport about measures that might mitigate the effects of the change to Gatwick. Senior industry sources said the decision to move had now been made and the airline's website has for some time not been selling Newquay-Heathrow flights past the end of March. The route will, however, still qualify for public subsidy. Earlier this week, the government said it would conduct a review of regional connectivity as part of its ""levelling up"" drive to spread economic growth across the regions. The announcement was made at the same time as ministers approved help for Flybe, which is thought to centre on giving the airline time to pay about Â£100m of outstanding air passenger duty. Following the rescue deal, the Department for Transport said: ""In light of these discussions Flybe have confirmed they will continue to operate as normal, preserving flights to airports such as Southampton, Belfast and Birmingham."" Flybe said it was working closely with its ""partners across the network"" to finalise its full summer programme. ""Our future plans are business confidential and not yet ready for release,"" it said. Separately, the BBC has learned that Flybe will, also from the end of March, be free to divert many of the Heathrow runways slots it uses for domestic flights to other short-haul services. Flybe was awarded the slots in 2017 as part of ""remedy"" imposed by competition regulators on British Airways after it bought BMI British Midland. BA had to surrender the slots - which are highly prized, with pairs selling for Â£20m or more - as long as the new owner operated them on certain domestic routes. Flybe is, however, free to change to other short-haul routes from the end of March. Industry sources said it could use those slots for European flights currently operated by its partner airlines - leaving one of its shareholders, Virgin Atlantic, or its partner Delta Air Lines of America, the chance to start new long-haul services from Heathrow.

"This video can not be played The Red Rebel Brigade group took part in the climate protest in Aberdeen. Extinction Rebellion protesters have ended a blockade at the entrances to Shell's Aberdeen headquarters. Activists arrived at the Altens base at about 06:30 and remained at the site until 19:30 in a bid to ""hold Shell to account"". The group said the protest was part of its two-week long campaign targeting the fossil fuel industry. Shell said it was addressing its emissions and helping customers to reduce theirs. And industry body Oil and Gas UK (OGUK) said climate change would not be solved by ""stunts"". Extinction Rebellion also had its purple boat at the site.

A statement from Extinction Rebellion Scotland said: ""Today's successful protest marked the final day of 10 days of action focused on the fossil fuel industry, and in particular Shell's role in driving the climate crisis. ""Thirty activists spent 13 hours blockading the entrances to Shell HQ all day, sending a message that we won't take their wilful avoidance in the face of the climate emergency any more."" The group vowed to continue taking action until governments and industry respond ""sensibly and appropriately"" to the warnings from scientists and public figures, such as broadcasterSir David Attenborough.

"How much time has to elapse before there's a new Yes generation? Boris Johnson has rejected Nicola Sturgeon's call for a new independence referendum by insisting the 2014 vote was a ""once in a generation"" event. Why do people keep using this phrase, and what does it mean? The debate about a second independence referendum has echoed much of the debate about the first one, because both sides see it as setting a useful precedent. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wants the UK governmentto agree a transfer of powersto hold a vote, because that was the ""gold standard"" process used in 2014. Boris Johnson doesn't want another referendum, and is using some of Ms Sturgeon's own words from the original campaign as justification for saying no. The prime minister's letter rejecting Ms Sturgeon's request told her ""you and your predecessor made a personal promise that the 2014 independence referendum was a 'once in a generation' vote. The people of Scotland voted decisively on that promise to keep our United Kingdom together."" He has echoed this line whenever questioned about the matter, but the SNP insists times have changed and the party has an ""unarguable"" mandate for a new referendum. Johnson rejects Sturgeon's indyref2 demand Could Scotland still become independent? In Alex Salmond's foreword toScotland's Future,external, the white paper on independence ahead of the 2014 referendum, the then first minister said the vote would be a ""rare and precious moment in the history of Scotland - a once in a generation opportunity to chart a better way"". The document itself went on to state there was ""no arrangement in place for another referendum on independence"", and that ""only a majority vote for Yes would give certainty that Scotland will be independent"". Mr Salmond and his team used the phrase several times in interviews, includingone with Andrew Marrwhere he said that ""in my view this is a once in a generation, perhaps even a once in a lifetime opportunity"". His deputy Ms Sturgeon, used that ""lifetime"" phrase during thefinal Holyrood debate,externalbefore the referendum - as did three other SNP MSPs, before passing a motion which also called the ballot the ""opportunity of a lifetime"". This video can not be played Alex Salmond says the Scottish referendum is a ""once in a generation opportunity"" Independence supporters contend Mr Salmond was stating his own view - he told Mr Marr that ""it is just my opinion"" - and that the position of his government cannot bind that of its successors. The SNP also points to theSmith Commission report,externalon extra powers for Holyrood, published two months after the referendum, which stated that ""nothing in this report prevents Scotland becoming an independent country in the future should the people of Scotland so choose"". If you're an aphid of the rhopalosiphum prunifolia family, a generation is apparently 4.7 days. For humans, an essay for the International Society of Genetic Genealogy seems to have narrowed the length of the average generation down to somewhere in the range of29 to 34 years,external. But how long is apoliticalgeneration? This becomes a bit like speculating on the length of a piece of string. Scotland Office minister Douglas Ross took the scattergun approach of saying it should be ""30, 40, or 50 years"" in an interview with the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme on Wednesday. His boss Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, had earlier suggested a vote shouldn't take place during Ms Sturgeon's lifetime - which based on the average life expectancyfor women of her age,externalwould be at least another couple of decades yet. The Good Friday Agreement suggested seven years was a reasonable gap between referendums Are there any historical examples which might help? There were 18 years between the two referendums on Scottish devolution, in 1979 and 1997. Mr Salmond cited this gap in that Andrew Marr interview, saying ""that's what I mean by a political generation"". Meanwhile there were 41 years between the referendums on EU membership in 1975 and 2016, a stretch pointed to by interim Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw. But shifting to another constitutional setting, theGood Friday Agreement,externalstipulates that there should be seven years between border polls on Irish reunification. That figure is actually set out in legislation. Obviously the context of political history in Northern Ireland is quite different to that of Scotland, but the deal containing that seven-year provision was endorsed both by MPs and, obviously,in a referendum. The SNP contend that it was never their intention to shut the door on future votes - why would they? - and that the phrase was more a way of expressing how crucially important they thought the 2014 referendum was. They say it wasn't a ""personal promise"", as the prime minister claims, but the sort of rhetoric that politicians employ every day. Context can be key. For example, Mr Johnson said December's general election was a ""critical, once in a generation,external"" vote - but nobody really expected it to be the last Westminster poll for decades. There are few topics on which Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson look eye to eye The Tories say expectation levels are different for referenda - they are designed to settle binary questions, and happen far less frequently. The last thing we want, they say, is a ""neverendum"". Although on that latter point, there has been no shortage of referendums since the Conservatives came to power in 2010  - on the electoral system, on Scottish independence, on increased powers for the Welsh Assembly, and on Brexit. Brian Taylor: PM's move is not subtle, but it is predictable The chief argument employed by the SNP for a new referendum is that things have changed substantially since 2014. The party says the UK that was talked about at the time, which Scots voted to remain part of, no longer exists. The Brexit vote is the key driver of this, given the 62% backing for Remain in Scotland - and it was the No campaign who insisted in 2014 that ""Scotland enjoys membership of the EU because of our membership of the UK"".

The Conservative rebuttal to this would be that the UK as a whole voted to leave the EU - this was a change mandated by the people, and thus does not itself justify another change. Of course there have also been a slew of other votes since the referendum. In another interview in 2014 Mr Salmond said ""the only circumstances in which you could have another referendum would be if you got an extra mandate at a subsequent general election"". The SNP have come out on top in every election north of the border since then, most recently taking 45% of the Scottish vote in the general election - a bigger share than Mr Johnson's triumphant Conservatives got UK-wide. If that kind of form keeps up - particularly at the Holyrood election in 2021 - the prime minister may need to find a new catchphrase. Will there be another Scottish independence referendum?

Customers at a Leeds branch will be able to use refill stations for own brand rice and pasta, as well as Kellogg's cereals and PG Tips. Asda is the latest major grocer to launch an initiative to cut down on plastic packaging. UK supermarkets are responsible for 58 billion pieces of plastic a year, according to Greenpeace. Asda uses about 65,000 tonnes of plastic a year. Plastic packaging: How are supermarkets doing? Plastic waste rises as 1.5bn 'bags for life' sold Would you take containers to a store to do this? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external The ""sustainability store"" will open in May at the Asda Middleton site in Leeds. ""We will be testing and learning from the customers in Middleton to understand how we can reduce our environmental impacts,"" said Asda chief executive Roger Burnley. ""Our first priority will be to look at how we can reduce and remove plastic."" Daniel Webb, founder of campaign group Everyday Plastic, said the launch was also ""a big step"" for companies such as Kellogg's and Unilever whose products are included in the Asda trial. In-store trials will last for at least three months, with customers asked to give feedback. The store will house a ""naked florist"" selling plastic-free bouquets, and will also sell loose produce such as cucumbers or mushrooms without any plastic packaging. In addition, the branch will have a ""reverse vending machine"" for recycling plastic bottles. Asda recently committed to reducing plastic by 15% by February next year, as well as making all of its own brand packaging fully recyclable by 2025. Morrisons says it has the highest proportion of loose fruit and vegetable sales of any supermarket Single-use plastic has become a major topic for discussion after the BBC's Blue Planet IIhighlighted its effect on the oceans. Major supermarkets have since pledged to cut down on their plastic waste. The BBC has also announced plans for a year-long series of programmes and coverageon climate change, as part of the Our Planet Matters project. Waitrose has introduced refills for wine, beer, cleaning materials, and loose fruit and vegetables free from packaging across four stores after a trial at its Botley Road shop in Oxford. This video can not be played What did shoppers think about Waitrose's trial? It has also said it will remove all black plastic from its own label ranges, and stop selling single-use coffee cups. This is an eye catching experiment from Asda. It follows on from Waitrose and its trial which allows customers to fill their own containers with groceries. It received such a positive reaction from shoppers that its now being tested at three other stores. Asda is taking things even further by selling products from some of our biggest brands. There's clearly a growing demand for more sustainable shopping but the big question with both these schemes is it commercially viable to roll out nationwide? Other pledges made by major UK retailers include: Morrisons: Have 100% recyclable, reusable or compostable packaging by 2025 and offer paper carrier bags Tesco: Remove hard-to-recycle materials, including PVC, from its own brand products Sainsbury's: Remove lightweight loose product bags from store and replace plastic film on fruit and vegetables with a recyclable option Aldi: Get rid of plastic wrapping on cabbages and cauliflower in some stores, and trial cardboard packaging on steak Swiss-based global food giant Nestle also announced on Thursday it would invest up to Â£1.6bn in making packaging for its food products recyclable. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said that Asda was another retailer reacting to ""heightened consumer concerns about the environment"". He said: ""It's a step in the right direction but we are at an embryonic stage in what is likely to be a very long journey. It will be a huge learning curve and one that tests the gap between what consumers say they 'want' and what they 'do' in reality."" Previous research by the environmental charity Greenpeace,externalsuggested Asda might have further to go than other supermarkets. It was ranked ninth out of the UK's 10 biggest supermarkets for its plastic ""footprint"". Louise Edge, head of Greenpeace UK's ocean plastics campaign, said that Asda's action was ""encouraging"". But she argued that such schemes should be carried out more widely: ""We'll never recycle our way out of this crisis, so Asda and other UK supermarkets must urgently reduce plastic by switching to reusable and refillable packaging at scale.""

" The families still waiting for 'justice' By Caroline Gall Like many nine-year-old boys Lassana loved football. In the streets and parks near his home outside Barcelona he would spend hours kicking a ball around with his friends. But unlike the thousands of other boys hoping to become stars, Lassana’s natural talent had been noticed. An FC Barcelona scout had spotted him and wanted to sign him for the club’s famous youth academy, where stars such as Lionel Messi had cut their teeth. But Lassana’s father, Ousmane, was not there to celebrate with him. He had moved to Birmingham, England, months before in search of work. Despite living thousands of miles away, Ousmane still arranged lifts to training and games for Lassana or his older brother Mohammadu, who played for a different team. Before every match he would also call them and wish them luck. But one night, the phone call never came. Lassana joined FC Barcelona's famous La Masia youth academy Lassana joined FC Barcelona's famous La Masia youth academy It was 7 July 2016. Lassana and Mohammadu were settling down in front of the TV to watch France play Germany in Euro 2016. Mohammadu was due to play in a tournament the next day. WhatsApp showed their father had been online that morning. The boys watched the game, waiting for their father to call. Their mother, Aminata, tried not to worry. Ousmane had phoned his family every day since moving to the UK. She busied herself with the household chores and comforted her three-year-old daughter Fanta who, unusually, would not stop crying. The boys continued to wait. As the match neared its end, they were interrupted by a knock at the door. It was their great-uncle, Keemo. Keemo told Aminata he had found out about an accident at Ousmane’s workplace, a recycling centre in Birmingham where he sorted scrap metal. He told her no-one had heard from him since. Aminata knew straight away what this meant. “As soon as he came, I just knew something was not right,” she says. “I said 'This is the man I married. I can tell you he has never gone a whole day without calling us. So I can confirm it for you.'” Ousmane, her husband, was dead. Like many nine-year-old boys Lassana loved football.

The next day he and his mother and siblings boarded a flight to the UK. Before he died, Ousmane had saved enough money for his family to visit him in Birmingham. It was intended in part as a celebration of Lassana’s success. Instead they were flying out to retrieve his body. At the airport, the family were met by police. Aminata found herself completely disorientated and rooted to the spot. “I found it so difficult, I couldn’t move forward,” she says. “The police had to actually move me and take me into the room. It felt like someone was holding my legs.” In a side room, Ousmane's brother, who lived in the UK, translated into their native language, Mandinka, as the police explained what had happened. They said Ousmane had been working at a metal recycling centre when a concrete wall toppled over and crushed him and four other men. The police offered to let Aminata see her husband’s body for the last time but, crying, she refused.  One week later, Lassana signed for FC Barcelona’s youth academy.

The police offered to let Aminata see her husband’s body for the last time but, crying, she refused. “My father was very, very happy when I was picked by Barcelona,” says Lassana, who is now aged 13. “I was so happy. If he was alive now, not only would he be encouraging me, he would be saying try harder because it’s so competitive to be a footballer.” Lassana scores an impressive solo goal for FC Barcelona's youth team But life for Lassana and his family has been a struggle since. Three years after his father's death they have still not received compensation. The family of five share a small apartment in the town of Parets del Valles, surviving on monthly benefits of about 1,000 euros (£880). There is no money for trips out and other treats for the children. Instead Aminata takes them to the park to play. On birthdays, she prepares a meal and bakes a cake but presents are another luxury the family cannot afford. “Apart from the emotional day-to-day struggle, it’s paying for books and school trips for the four children,” she says. “When did I last buy myself something? I have no consideration for that. I have bought myself nothing since Ousmane passed away. I can’t think of that. “It’s all for the children and just surviving.” Ousmane had left Senegal in search of work in the late 1990s. Like many west Africans, he settled in Spain, where he lived legally and worked as a security guard. But the Spanish economy was hit by the global economic crisis of 2008. Ousmane first found his hours reduced, then eventually lost his job. He struggled to find new work and moved to the UK in March 2016, leaving his family behind. Just four months later he was dead. Even when he had been alive, Aminata struggled to make ends meet. Ousmane had not just been supporting his wife and children but relatives back in Senegal too. Each month he would send between 150 and 200 euros to his widowed mother and six brothers and sisters. He was also expected to send occasional money to Aminata’s father as a sign of ""respect"". The men who died alongside Ousmane were from The Gambia - Senegal's smaller neighbour. Each was sending money back to family in Africa, despite only earning the UK minimum wage of just over £7 an hour. Their relatives depended on this money for survival in one of the world's poorest regions. The men's deaths left these families impoverished. Three-and-a-half years later, the men's families still have questions about how and why they died. An inquest jury found their deaths were accidental but Shredmet, the firm that ran the recycling centre, had failed to notice the wall's dangerous state. The inquest concluded this “caused or contributed” to the men’s deaths. A criminal investigation by the UK’s Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has still not concluded. The families say they have not been contacted by Shredmet since just after the wall collapsed. It has left them feeling bitter and ignored. “In my opinion it's very clear they [Shredmet] don't value human life,” says Aminata. “I came to England [to identify the body] and spent that time there and I never once saw the owners or heard from them. They don't seem to care about people.” This summer Lassana was dealt another blow - he was let go by FC Barcelona’s youth team. He is not too disappointed. He says he has been told if he works hard he can force his way back in. He is still determined to make it as a footballer, for his father’s memory. “It makes me work harder and if I do really well, I’ll dedicate it to him, to show what I can do from my hard work,” he says. But he has other matters on his mind. He wants to know why his father died at work. “The company needs to recognise the wrong it’s done,” he says. “It’s not just about money. We need to have justice.” Whenever her phone rang, Dado hoped it was her husband. She would answer it and the peace of her rural surroundings in the east of The Gambia would be shattered, replaced by the sound of lorries and machinery. Then she would hear Saibo’s voice say “hello”. They spoke several times each day, despite having lived thousands of miles apart for much of their long marriage. Wearing a headset under his hard hat, Saibo would talk to Dado and his children for hours. They discussed their family, their friends, and their plans for the future. Although their marriage had been arranged, it had been a love match too. As young newlyweds they would hold hands in public, defying the disapproval of their conservative neighbours. The Gambia’s Islamic culture permitted men up to four wives, but Saibo opted for just one - Dado. “He would buy me little things, hug and hold me,” she says. “Whatever he could do for me, he would - and me for him.” But poverty in The Gambia meant Saibo was always going to leave in search of work. The country is among Africa’s poorest. Situated on either bank of the Gambia River, Western tourists are drawn to its beautiful beaches and year-round sunshine. Most Gambians support themselves through tourism or subsistence farming. But more than a fifth of the country’s GDP consists of money sent back by Gambians working abroad, according to a2017 report by the International Fund for Agricultural Development. These migrants typically do the kind of physically tough, unpleasant and poorly paid jobs many Europeans do not want. It was the prospect of such work that persuaded Saibo to move from Spain to the UK in 2014. After many years living apart, Saibo was tantalisingly close to being reunited with his family in Europe. In Spain, where he had lived for 10 years, he had been unable to afford the visas. Before that he had mined diamonds in Sierra Leone, but the civil war there meant it was too dangerous for his family. Now, in the UK, he was earning more money. He submitted his family's immigration application to the Home Office and paid for expensive DNA checks to confirm he was the father of his four children. While he waited to hear news he carried on picking through the metal at the recycling centre. Saibo had called Dado as normal before he started work on 7 July 2016. He told her he was busier than usual because many workers were still celebrating Eid and had not come in. “It was early-morning prayers when we spoke and he said 'God willing, my family will be here soon,’” Dado says. He told her he would call later during his break. But that call never came. Saibo’s job was hard, dirty and noisy. Lorries would come and go all day, depositing large piles of waste material at the site in Nechells, near Birmingham city centre. The men would spend the day sorting through this pile and separating out the metal. At the end of each shift, they would go home caked in dirt. Poorly paid, their employment was also precarious - their jobs were in the “gig economy” and they did not know from one day to the next whether they would have work. It was also - unbeknown to them - incredibly dangerous. The men would stand next to a conveyor belt housed in a large steel-framed shed with the top of the belt jutting through the roof. The men were clearing metal from the right-hand side bay when the wall fell The men were clearing metal from the right-hand side bay when the wall fell If the belt stopped working, as it would from time to time, the men would be told to sweep out bays storing piles of metal. Bordering one of these bays was a towering wall consisting of concrete blocks. There was no mortar joining the blocks - they were designed to interlock - and the wall had no foundations. But the design was safe and legal if appropriately used. This wall, however, had been loaded on one side with 263 tonnes of metal briquettes. As the men cleared out the bay on the other side of the wall, the concrete blocks collapsed without warning. The men below stood no chance. After the wreckage was cleared, their broken bodies could only be identified by their fingerprints.

Dado had been pregnant with twins the last time she saw her husband. Now those girls are six years old. She has decided not to tell them about their father’s death yet. She tells them Saibo is still working abroad. The rest of the family go along with the fiction. Home is her uncle’s cramped compound in Serrekunda, a bustling town close to the Gambian capital, Banjul. Dado and her children share the home with her sister, brothers and mother. After Saibo’s death she moved out of his family compound in the village of Garowol, where she had lived since they married in 2000. Saibo’s wages had indirectly supported about 50 people, including Dado and her children, but the loss of his income made it difficult for them to support her. No-one asked her to move out, but custom dictated she should. She is now desperately short of money. “Having no husband and four kids is hard,” she says. “I am obviously really struggling. “I have tried every avenue to get work - cooking, cleaning - but struggled and not found anything. Friends help out when they can. I don’t know what the future holds. “If I got some money then it would be so my children would have a better life and can achieve an education - that’s the only way it can happen. “I would not buy luxury things, I would save it for the children and a better life and their future. I have no idea what [compensation] we would get, if anything.”  Half a world away it has been difficult for her to find out more about what happened to her husband. The inquest into the men's deaths was in November 2018 - more than two years after the wall collapsed. Dado tried to attend but the UK did not grant her a visa in time. She arrived three days after the hearing concluded. She consoles herself remembering happier times, when Saibo would come to visit her in The Gambia from Spain. “He’d tell me about Europe and how different it was to Africa and how he lived. I think then that we were getting close to our dream [of living together in Europe]. “But I had to accept that in either three, four or five months he was going again. As a woman from The Gambia you expect this to happen, to be apart.” After years of dreaming, the family had been finally on the verge of reuniting. Then the accident happened. “My world changed that day,” says Dado. “We didn’t have long enough together as a couple. Clearly, this has destroyed our life. I don't know what to think about the future. “In our culture, the worst thing that can happen to you is for your husband to die.” Dado had been pregnant with twins the last time she saw her husband. Now those girls are six years old.

Litter is scattered around the street. Almost every room of her home has black mould on the walls. She worries about the cough her four-year-old daughter Fatou has developed. The cough is so pronounced, concerned staff at her nursery have also tried to contact the landlord about the damp. Unaware, little Fatou chirps and giggles as she plays around the house, her boundless energy keeping her mother busy. Hatoumata tries to make her money last but it is hard. There is nothing spare after each cycle of benefits. She has no family living nearby and very few friends. She is lonely and depressed. It has been like this since her husband died. Like most Gambian women, Hatoumata had always been dependent on men. She was 10 years old when her family arranged her marriage to 37-year-old Mohammadou. She was his second wife but the age gap was not unusual - their marriage would not be consummated until she was an adult. Mohammadou was already working in Spain and flew back there almost immediately after the wedding. Meanwhile, Hatoumata went to live with Mohammadou’s family in their compound. She would see her husband infrequently over the next 12 years. Then, when she was 22, he asked her to live with him in Birmingham, where he had moved in search of work. She was soon mother to a baby girl. “I was very lonely at first because I was missing my family and I was here alone as Mohammadou was out working all day,” she says. “Over time, I began to settle. We planned to stay in Birmingham and this would be our life and to have more children. But then it changed.” The night before the accident they had celebrated Eid at their local mosque. Although Ramadan had ended, Mohammadou had chosen to fast for six more days. So Hatoumata rose before dawn to heat through his breakfast. After he left for work, she went back to bed with Fatou. They were asleep when she heard banging at the door. She opened it and was confronted by the sight of two police officers. “They were standing outside and I asked ‘How can I help you?’, but I didn’t understand the language,” she says. “Because of that, I said ‘Hold on, I will call my husband and he can talk to you’. So I called him and it was ringing and ringing and he wasn't picking it up.” As she waited for a friend to come over to translate, other Gambian men - friends of her husband - turned up at her house. Some asked if she had been in touch with Mohammadou. None mentioned to her what had happened. Eventually, her friend arrived and she learned, from the police, that her husband had died. “I could not believe it,” Hatoumata says. “I knew he worked with metals but I never thought it was a dangerous job.” Hatoumata’s house in Winson Green, Birmingham, is cold and damp. Outside, a cupboard has been left by someone to rot.

Dependent since childhood on her husband and his family, this family support network was now reduced. Although she is supported by her fellow Soninke speakers in the area, she is less integrated within the Gambian community than when her husband was alive. Her lack of good English - she says the lessons clash with her childcare - has also made it hard to assimilate in the UK. “I honestly regret coming to this country,” she says. “Not that I could foresee this, but if I knew, I would never have come here. “I would like to work, I really would, but I can’t right now because of childcare. My daughter is at nursery. Who would pick her up every day? “I am just existing. There is a lot of thinking about the past, the present. It’s very depressing. I feel trapped here.” Despite the loneliness, she is reluctant to return to The Gambia. Fatou, her daughter, was born in Birmingham and she wants her to have the life opportunities a UK education offers. Hatoumata's home is only a few miles from the recycling centre where her husband and the other men lost their lives. Yet she knows as little as Aminata and Dado about the accident. She says she is “confused” about why she has had to wait so long for compensation, but would “rather have my husband here and have a happy life here”. Her anger is focused on Shredmet, the company that employed her husband through an agency and which, she believes, has not treated the men’s families properly since. “You cannot say they [Shredmet] are a good company,” she says. “Even to this day after the accident they have not come to see the families or given condolences. “This is very bad. They can't just leave us like this. They need to help. We need to be compensated and [not] just be left like this.” Mohammadou’s death left Hatoumata isolated in a country where she knew few people and could not speak the language. Dependent since childhood on her husband and his family, this family support network was now reduced. Although she is supported by her fellow Soninke speakers in the area, she is less integrated within the Gambian community than when her husband was alive. Her lack of good English - she says the lessons clash with her childcare - has also made it hard to assimilate in the UK. “I honestly regret coming to this country,” she says. “Not that I could foresee this, but if I knew, I would never have come here. “I would like to work, I really would, but I can’t right now because of childcare. My daughter is at nursery. Who would pick her up every day? “I am just existing. There is a lot of thinking about the past, the present. It’s very depressing. I feel trapped here.” Despite the loneliness, she is reluctant to return to The Gambia. Fatou, her daughter, was born in Birmingham and she wants her to have the life opportunities a UK education offers. Hatoumata's home is only a few miles from the recycling centre where her husband and the other men lost their lives. Yet she knows as little as Aminata and Dado about the accident. She says she is “confused” about why she has had to wait so long for compensation, but would “rather have my husband here and have a happy life here”. Her anger is focused on Shredmet, the company that employed her husband through an agency and which, she believes, has not treated the men’s families properly since. “You cannot say they [Shredmet] are a good company,” she says. “Even to this day after the accident they have not come to see the families or given condolences. “This is very bad. They cannot just leave us like this. They need to help. We need to be compensated and [not] just be left like this.” Hawa Kaba is at home in her terraced house in Leicester, where she has been living for the past two years with her son. She moved there from Birmingham following the accident, unable to cope with the constant reminders of her husband, Bangally. While he was alive she would often see his bicycle outside the mosque near their home in Aston. After his death she found it too upsetting to walk past. She had been working as a cleaner at a Travelodge in Birmingham city centre when the accident happened. Despite being legally in the UK and having worked there for months, she panicked when the police arrived. Fearing she was to be deported, she ran to quickly gather her things. Instead the two police officers said her husband was dead. “The world did not really mean anything to me any more after that,” she says. “I was in a complete daze. But we did not know what had happened, no-one knew. “It took me over a year to get over it. I still now get lapses… and fall back.” Hawa is one of three widows, along with Hatoumata, still living in the UK. The other, Awa Dibba - wife of Almamo Jammeh - lives in Leeds. Like the others, Hawa has struggled financially. “I work about 16 hours a week and have a rented council house, but it is cold in the kitchen with a hole in the ceiling to the outside,” she says. “My son is at school here, but he doesn't like talking about his dad. It has really affected him. They were very, very close.” Hawa and her son had followed Bangally to the UK from Spain. She says she had stressed to her husband many times how insecure his work was and that he should find something else. “But he said ‘What can I do? I don’t speak English yet and if I leave this work, how am I going to look after us?’,” she says. “There are limited options available. He was going for English classes while he worked but did not know enough yet. “It was very difficult to leave Spain to come here as immigrants. Our objective was to work and look after family. But when he came here not only could he not get regular, stable work, he lost his life.” Following the accident, the families had to wait two years for the inquest to be held. Until this concluded they could not legally begin a compensation claim. An HSE report prepared ahead of the inquest was clear about why the wall fell. “The wall collapsed because it was not designed to withstand the lateral loads imposed by the steel briquettes and was therefore inherently unstable,” it said. “The loading increased from one side as material was removed from the bay the men were working in. The fact that the walls were not properly designed, in [the inspector's view], was the reason why it collapsed.” The report said Shredmet could have installed walls designed to withstand the loads. After the accident, other retaining walls at the site were inspected and also found to be defective. While Shredmet kept daily and monthly inspection records it had failed to recognise the walls were dangerous. The fatal accident was not Shredmet's first health and safety incident. In 2012 the firm was fined £50,000 over an accident in which an employee's arm was injured. The company subsequently employed a health and safety adviser, Michael White. But the inquest was told he had only spent a total of 12 hours at the Nechells site in the year before the men's deaths. The inquest heard conflicting accounts from Shredmet and Mr White about the wall. Although Shredmet said it had been in situ for about 18 months  prior to the collapse, Mr White said he could not recall seeing it and had never been asked to assess its safety. Just months before the accident, there was also a large fire at the site. West Midlands Fire Service says the cause was accidental and it subsequently gave the company advice. The families’ civil compensation claim began about a year ago. Their lawyer asked Shredmet for an initial payment to help the struggling families - without admitting liability - but the company refused. Shredmet has declined to comment, citing the ongoing HSE investigation.  But at the time of the inquest, managing director Wayne Hawkeswood said he was ""absolutely devastated"" by the deaths of the five men and constantly thought about ""the loss their family and friends have suffered"". Like the other widows, Hawa feels abandoned since the accident. They are angry at the lack of contact from Shredmet and the speed with which the company resumed operations after the men's deaths. “What has really shocked me is that the company got up and running so soon afterwards,” Hawa says. “They did not do what they should to protect the workers and they don't respect human beings. “This is part of their culture, they have no respect.” Hawa had urged her husband Bangally to find more secure work Hawa had urged her husband Bangally to find more secure work Hawa Kaba is at home in her terraced house in Leicester, where she has been living for the past two years with her son. She moved there from Birmingham following the accident, unable to cope with the constant reminders of her husband, Bangally.

He maintains the tragedy at Shredmet is only a small part of a wider problem. The men’s deaths, he warns, have implications for anyone employed in similar jobs. The industry the men were employed in - waste and recycling - is the second most dangerous in the UK. Between 2014 and 2018, almost eight in every 100,000 workers died. This rate is 17 times the national average,according to a 2019 HSE report. It is among the UK’s most lucrative industries, worth an estimated £7bn a year to the economy. In recent years it has enjoyed a boom. Demand has been driven by rising metal prices, a shortage of landfill sites and laws restricting the dumping of electronic equipment in them. Mr Cooper says the recycling industry “exploits migrant labour for enormous profits”. Daniel Lemberger Cooper said the men's deaths raised issues for every worker in Britain Daniel Lemberger Cooper said the men's deaths raised issues for every worker in Britain “There is a now huge demand for recycling and the industry is getting bigger and bigger, and these workers will be needed more and more,” he says. “The five men were honest, hardworking and decent human beings. “The conditions in which these workers were employed, of precarious employment, zero-hours contracts, temporary and agency work, the so-called gig economy and exploitation, and issues of low pay and long hours are spreading throughout the economy,” he adds. “This is an issue for every worker in Britain.” Leading safety experts say the standard of the UK’s health and safety enforcement has declined over the past decade. After years of cuts there are fewer inspectors carrying out fewer inspections, leaving many workplaces unsafe, they say. Shredmet had not been inspected by the HSE since the 2010 accident in which an employee injured their arm. Lawrence Waterman, chairman of the British Safety Council, says the HSE has been under-resourced since the days of the coalition government. In 2010 the government imposed 33% cuts on the HSE. Then, in 2012,  the Prime Minister David Cameron stated the UK's""excessive""health and safety culture was costing businesses billions and he intended to""kill""it off for good. After the Conservatives won the general election in 2015, further cuts followed in theSpending Reviewlater that year. Lawrence Waterman said more effort was needed to keep workplaces safe Lawrence Waterman said more effort was needed to keep workplaces safe “It’s not just resources that have had an impact,” says Mr Waterman. ""It’s the political hangover of now two prime ministers ago who wanted to kill health and safety, with a feeling that red tape ruled and we were being told how to live our lives. “Well, the other side of that is that five guys never came home to their families. “Hanging over businesses and the government is the need to be honest and place more value on looking after people at work.” Hilda Palmer, from the Hazards Campaign, which promotes workplace safety, says a disproportionately large number of those killed or injured at work are immigrants. “Unfortunately, if you look at the names of the people that are killed, they are mostly foreign-sounding names - eastern Europeans and now west African,” she says. “I also know of a case involving some Peruvians. It seems it’s the new wave of migrants that get drawn in - the most vulnerable.” She says legislation, enforcement and trade unions have all been “attacked through the cuts”. Laws restricting the dumping of electronic equipment in landfill have fuelled demand for recycling Laws restricting the dumping of electronic equipment in landfill have fuelled demand for recycling “That creates an environment for cowboys to flourish,” she added. “If employers see checks being done, prosecutions, fines and notices being issued, that reminds them to act.” The Conservatives declined to comment but Vince Cable, the former Liberal Democrat leader who was a member of the coalition cabinet, says the global financial crisis was to blame. “Austerity was going to happen whatever government came in,” he says. “The cuts [Labour chancellor] Alistair Darling had were the same as what the coalition did and this was as a result of the huge financial crisis and reduced revenue that the country found itself in.” The dead men's families remain bewildered that three years after the accident the HSE has still not decided whether or not to charge Shredmet. Mr Waterman says the slowness of the HSE investigation is due to its underfunding. The HSE aims to complete 80% of fatal investigations within one year but in 2018-19 just 65% were. “When you look at that, it’s not unreasonable for the families to feel that justice is being denied,” Mr Waterman says. “If the families of the five guys were plugged-in middle-class agitators, there may have been more pressure being felt to keep the HSE focused on finding out what happened.” The HSE says the families’ demand for a speedy conclusion is “understandable” but it needs to ensure its investigation is “thorough”. “As with many complex, challenging criminal investigations relating to multiple fatalities, following new lines of inquiry and forensically examining evidence can mean investigations take longer than families would understandably hope,” a spokesman says. “Since the inquests concluded... our time and energy has been fully focused on reviewing the case, bringing together evidence heard by the coroner and concluding the criminal investigation. “We are working hard to resolve any delays and have endeavoured to give regular updates to the families where possible.” The families' lawyer believes they are the victims of a legal system that does not treat deaths at work with the same seriousness as other fatalities. “The criminal justice system fails to treat deaths and injuries at work – unlike deaths in almost any other setting – as the possible outcome of serious crimes and this must urgently change,” he says. He wants the government to legislate to prevent the exploitation of workers. “A fitting tribute and legacy to those that died would be that immediate steps are taken by government to ensure that we learn the lessons of why these men died so that no-one else suffers like they have,” he says. “If immediate, legislative change is not enacted, there are going to be more injuries and further deaths. The government and employers will have blood on their hands.” “By any standard this is a profoundly shocking case - no-one should go to work and die in 21stCentury Britain.” Daniel Lemberger Cooper, the families’ lawyer, works for Imran Khan & Partners, the firm that represented the family of the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence.

He was knocked out by the concrete blocks and, when he came to amid the dust and debris, he discovered he was pinned to the ground by a 1.5-tonne concrete block on his legs. He drifted in and out of consciousness as rescuers scrambled to extract him. “I couldn't move, I could just hear noise and feel the pain in my leg,” he says. “I didn’t know what was going on.” When he woke up properly he was in hospital. He did not realise his colleagues had died until his friend Bassamba, who witnessed the accident, told him. It was devastating and not only on an emotional level. He had only been working at the site for two months and has been unemployed ever since. Standing can be painful while sitting down for too long also causes him discomfort. He relies on the charity of his local mosque in Smethwick to survive and says he has had difficulty claiming sickness benefit. He is haunted by the memories of what happened that summer’s day. “When I think about it sometimes I can’t get to sleep,” he says. “I lose my mind if I sit down and think about it all. I can’t move on. I can’t work. What can I do? “I’ve been going round in circles. I’m in limbo. I am suffering. “We are powerless.

"The number of UK pubs and bars increased for the first time in a decade during 2019,according to the Office for National Statistics,external(ONS). The total number rose by 315, or 0.8%, last year to 39,130, driven by food sales. The ONS said that the first increase seen since the financial crisis also saw a boost for smaller pubs. The British Beer & Pub Association (BBPA) said it ""cautiously welcomed"" the news. According to ONS data, the number of smaller venues with fewer than 10 employees increased by 85 in 2019. That follows on from more than 15 years of closures. High Stickland, senior statistician at the ONS, said: ""While smaller pubs have been struggling to survive in recent years, bigger pubs have been growing in number. ""We'll have to wait to see if this marks a revival for smaller 'locals'."" Why are micropubs succeeding? The ONS suggested that the overall boost was down to ""changing consumer habits"". New data shows that pubs and bars now employ more people to serve food, rather than drinks. In 2003, roughly four in 10 employees in the pub industry were bar workers, with about three working in the kitchen. The opposite is true today. Some 457,000 people now work in pubs and bars across the UK, with food staff making up 43.8% of employees in the sector. People are now spending more of their disposable income on eating out, rather than going for a pint. Meanwhile, overall consumption of alcohol has fallen by about 16% since 2004,according to the charity Alcohol Change UK,external. Despite this, and significant numbers of closures seen in recent years, the number of jobs added in the industry has generally been increasing. There were 7,000 more jobs in the sector in 2019 compared with 2018, an increase of 1.6%. The data received a mixed response from those in the trade. A spokesperson for the BBPA said that association ""cautiously welcomed any good news for pubs"". It added that its own data has consistently shown a higher total number of pubs in the UK, and a higher number of closures. It also said it hoped the upcoming Budget would see further respite for pubs and bars. ""Policy makers have a great opportunity in the March Budget to help pubs flourish, by easing the significant tax pressures they face from beer duty and business rates"", it said. How much do you spend on a night out? JD Wetherspoon 'to create 10,000 jobs over four years' Business rates: 'We might as well hand back the keys' Nik Antona, national chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), also called for a review of business rates. ""Unfortunately pubs continue to close across the country, particularly in small or rural communities. This means the loss of the social, cultural and economic benefits that come with a well-run local. ""To ensure pubs survive and thrive, they need a fair tax system and stability going forward. Camra continues to call on the Government for a review of the business rates system, as was promised in the Conservative general election manifesto."" Recent analysis by the BBC's Shared Data Unitshowed that councils are losing out on millions of pounds of potential business rates income because of a tax relief on empty properties. The Treasury said it would announce a review of business rates ""in due course"".

"This video can not be played The Red Rebel Brigade group took part in the climate protest in Aberdeen. Extinction Rebellion protesters have ended a blockade at the entrances to Shell's Aberdeen headquarters. Activists arrived at the Altens base at about 06:30 and remained at the site until 19:30 in a bid to ""hold Shell to account"". The group said the protest was part of its two-week long campaign targeting the fossil fuel industry. Shell said it was addressing its emissions and helping customers to reduce theirs. And industry body Oil and Gas UK (OGUK) said climate change would not be solved by ""stunts"". Extinction Rebellion also had its purple boat at the site. Attenborough warns of climate 'crisis moment' Seven in court after drilling rig 'occupation' The protesters were also in Aberdeen city centre on Thursday afternoon, including at the Union Square shopping centre. A statement from Extinction Rebellion Scotland said: ""Today's successful protest marked the final day of 10 days of action focused on the fossil fuel industry, and in particular Shell's role in driving the climate crisis. ""Thirty activists spent 13 hours blockading the entrances to Shell HQ all day, sending a message that we won't take their wilful avoidance in the face of the climate emergency any more."" The group vowed to continue taking action until governments and industry respond ""sensibly and appropriately"" to the warnings from scientists and public figures, such as broadcasterSir David Attenborough. It concluded: ""Anything other than a rapid winding down of the fossil fuel industry is irresponsible and reckless."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

One of the protesters, Michael, a 57-year-old management consultant, said: ""Governments and corporations like Shell all agree that my children are facing a catastrophic climate and ecological collapse yet are doing next to nothing to prevent this. ""I'm here today because as a parent I am ultimately responsible for the safety of my children whether today, tomorrow or in 30 years time."" The protest began early on Thursday A Shell spokesman said: ""The heightened awareness of climate change that we have seen over recent months is a good thing. ""As a company, we agree that urgent action is needed. What will really accelerate change is effective policy, investment in technology innovation and deployment, and changing customer behaviour. ""As we move to a lower-carbon future, we are committed to playing our part, by addressing our own emissions and helping customers to reduce theirs - because we all have a role to play."" OGUK communications director Gareth Wynn said: ""Climate change will be solved by practical actions not conspiracy theories and stunts. ""It's disappointing that this group is choosing to disrupt the normal working day of people in this industry, causing alarm rather than engage in meaningful discussion with key decision makers. ""Our industry is packed full of people with the engineering and environmental knowledge and skills to play a key part in reducing emissions and we are already taking action."" Ch Insp Davie Howieson, local area commander for Aberdeen South, said: ""Officers are currently in attendance at a peaceful protest in Wellington Road, Aberdeen, outside the Shell premises. ""The road was blocked from around 06:45, and road users are advised to avoid the area for the time being. We are liaising with both Shell and the protest organisers, Extinction Rebellion.""

"Twitter has apologised for allowing adverts to be micro-targeted at certain users such as neo-Nazis, homophobes and other hate groups.

"A promise to do more to protect the soil will form part of a vision for the UK farm industry being unveiled by the government later. Ministers have accepted that farmers need incentives to farm in a way that leaves a healthy soil for future generations. Soil protection has become a core issue of the Agriculture Bill that is returning to Parliament. There is three times more carbon held in soil than in the atmosphere. But much has been lost thanks to intensive farming and deforestation. That is fuelling climate change  and compromising attempts to feed the world. Until recently soil has been a Cinderella subject, even though human life depends on the thin few inches above the rock. In its bill the government will promise to reward British farmers who protect the soil. 'Send in the drones' to protect soil To keep carbon emissions down, look underfoot Five ways farmers are tackling climate change Farmers seek food standards law after Brexit It is part of a radical shift in the grant system - previously announced â to move subsidies away from EU Common Agricultural Policy which basically pays farmers for owning land. Instead in post-Brexit Britain they will be rewarded for providing services for society like clean air, clean and plentiful water, flood protection and thriving wildlife. The grant changes will be phased in over seven years. Already there is disquiet from farmers and environmentalists alike that the government has not set in law its promise that UK food standards will not be lowered in any post-Brexit deal with the US. Minette Batters from the NFU said:  âThis bill is one of the most significant pieces of legislation for farmers in England for over 70 years. âHowever, farmers across the country will still want to see legislation underpinning government assurances that they won't allow imports of food produced to standards that would be illegal here. âWe'll continue to press the government to introduce a standards commission as a matter of priority to oversee and advise on future food trade policy and negotiations.â CPRE, the countryside charity, welcomed what it called  a generational opportunity to change the way England farms for the better. It said: âThis bill represents a radical rethink of farming practice and, most importantly, finally starts to recognise the need to regenerate soil - the fundamental building block of our entire agricultural system."" Although the bill has been applauded, the policies are still in embryonic stage, and as details emerge conflicts are sure to arise.

"No Time To Die will be Daniel Craig's final outing as James Bond The producer of the James Bond films has ruled out making the character female after Daniel Craig's departure. No Time To Die, which will be released in April, marks Craig's final outing as 007, and his replacement has not yet been announced. ""James Bond can be of any colour, but he is male,""producer Barbara Broccoli told Variety.,external ""I believe we should be creating new characters for women - strong female characters. ""I'm not particularly interested in taking a male character and having a woman play it. I think women are far more interesting than that.""

Lashana Lynch plays a new MI6 agent with a licence to kill Lynch was seen in character for the first time in the trailer, reigniting the conversation about whether James Bond himself could be re-cast as a woman for the next film. Broccoli oversees the franchise with her half-brother Michael G Wilson. ""For better or worse, we are the custodians of this character,"" she said. ""We take that responsibility seriously."" The pair reflected on how the Craig era has altered the direction of the franchise. What we learned from the No Time To Die trailer Billie Eilish to sing the new James Bond theme Pierce Brosnan's final Bond film, 2002's Die Another Day, was a financial success but was criticised for pushing the boundaries of realism. The film's plot involved a giant space laser and an invisible car. ""We got too fantastical,"" says Wilson, referring to the film. ""We had to come back to Earth."" Craig's era has, in contrast, more closely resembled the original character Ian Fleming wrote. Broccoli says she is a ""custodian"" of the Bond character Martin Campbell, the director of GoldenEye and Casino Royale, admitted he was not convinced Craig was the correct choice to begin with, but came around with Broccoli's persuasion. ""To be honest, it took me a little while to see it,"" he said. ""Daniel's acting was terrific, but he wasn't a pretty-boy. Barbara was adamantly in favour of him.""

"The US and China have finally - after almost two years of hostilities - signed a ""phase one"" deal. But it only covers the easier aspects of their difficult relationship, and only removes some of the tariffs. The biggest hurdles are still to come, and could stand in the way of a second phase agreement - one that would in theory remove all of the tariffs, bringing some much needed relief for the global economy, which is in the interests of all of us. What's not in the phase one deal tells us where the flashpoints are in the US-China relationship - and what could derail the second round of negotiations. So what didn't make it into the agreement? The deal doesn't address Beijing's ambitious 'Made in China 2025' programme, which is designed to help Chinese companies excel and become world-class leaders in emerging technologies. It also doesn't address the subsidies that China gives its state-owned enterprises, says Paul Triolo of the Eurasia Group. This video can not be played What is Beijing planning with its ""Made in China 2025"" programme? Washington sees ""Made in China 2025"" as a direct threat to its supremacy in tech, saying that Chinese companies have only caught up with American ones - at times outpacing them - because they get unfair and outsized assistance from the Chinese government in the form of subsidies. These were amongst the thorniest issues the Trump administration had with China, but they've been pushed to the phase two process Mr Triolo says, along with ""market access in sectors such as cloud services, cyber security and data governance issues"". Beijing maintains it doesn't unfairly subsidise these industries or companies, but the reality is China isn't going to give up dominance in these sectors so easily. The trade deal won't reduce US pressure on Huawei, the Chinese telecoms giant that has been caught in the crossfire of the trade war, with the US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin saying the company isn't a ""chess piece"" in the negotiations. That will disappoint both Huawei and the Chinese government which have been furious over how Washington has linked the company's fate to the relationship between the US and China. US-China trade deal: winners and losers The US-China trade war in charts A quick guide to the US-China trade war The Chinese firm became a symbol of the US-China tech rivalry and Washington has been lobbying its allies - including the UK - to not use Huawei's 5G technology services in critical communications infrastructure, alleging it could be used by Beijing to spy on customers. Huawei has denied this and had hoped that if the US-China relationship improved, its fortunes would too. Analysts tell me that's unlikely. With the signing of this agreement, there's a clear separation between national security and trade, and Huawei and other Chinese companies should still expect the pressure on them to continue. So expect more American export bans not just on Huawei, but on several more Chinese companies and increased US scrutiny on Chinese investments abroad. While the agreement does talk about opening up market access for financial services firms, some analysts have said it doesn't go far enough to ensure they have equal market access. China had already publicly said that it was opening up its financial services sector, and has recently allowed foreign companies to have a bigger stake in Chinese firms. But Beijing isn't giving up much by doing that, because China's financial services sector is now dominated by domestic digital payment players. Even if US payment firms do have greater market access to the Chinese market, it's hard to see how they might be able to compete. Whether China sincerely applies its commitments to treat foreign and domestic firms equally will also be watched closely by the Trump administration, and this could be a potential area where the rapprochement could be derailed. The deal has a dispute resolution mechanism in place,external, which basically requires China - once a complaint has been made - to begin consultations with the US, with the onus on Beijing to resolve it. But what the deal leaves out is ""how the US is going to monitor enforcement,"" says Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute. ""American firms don't like to report intellectual property theft,"" he told me.""So in the first instance what mechanism is the US using to gather information on this. All that is in the document is consultations."" This video can not be played How the US-China trade war has changed the world The deal also leaves out how the two sides will interpret these key aspects of the agreement. Already, there are signs of differences. Chinese state media has suggested the dispute resolution mechanism isn't dictated by the US - not entirely in keeping with Washington's messaging. This could indicate that even though there is an agreement in place, Beijing might ignore it, as Dan Harris of the China Law blog points out. ""The problem isn't the law,"" he says. ""It's that when something is important to China - some cutting edge technology that it wants - then those laws don't have any use at all."" The deal doesn't include a definitive timeline on when the tariffs that are still in place will go down. According to research from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, average tariffs on both sides are still up about 20% from pre-trade war levels - six times higher than when the dispute began.  That means companies and consumers are still paying more. This video can not be played Who really pays in a tariff war? Admittedly, the Trump administration has left the threat of tariffs in place as a stick to beat China with - in case Beijing doesn't keep to its commitments. And there's always that risk,as China's hard line Communist Party mouth-piece the Global Times points out,external: ""Can a preliminary trade agreement, reached during a period when China-US  strategic relations are clearly declining, really work? Will it be replaced by new conflicts or further progress as negotiations continue?"" The potential for trade tensions to resume on both sides is still a very big possibility.

"The Westminster government is to give the NI Executive an extra Â£1bn to support the Stormont deal. A further Â£1bn will be added to Stormont's budget as an automatic result of spending plans for the entire UK. The government said,externalthere will be ""a rapid injection of Â£550m to put the executive's finances on a sustainable footing"". That will include Â£200m to resolve the nurses' pay dispute. The government said the financial package will ""be accompanied by stringent conditions"" contained within the Stormont deal, around ""accountability for public spending"" and the development of ""sustainable public services"". It added that the deal includes strict financial conditions, such as the establishment of an independent fiscal council. However, the government added there are no stipulations for extra revenue-raising by the executive. The Stormont parties are likely to be unhappy both about the size of the packageand how it was announced. On Wednesday night, Finance Minister Conor Murphy described the offer as an ""act of bad faith"", saying it ""makes our job much more difficult"". ""The bottom line is with this proposed package, our public services face a shortfall of at least Â£1bn next year alone,"" he said. Mr Murphy said departmental officials would examine the figures He said the the proposed package adds Â£100m to the Â£150m previously committed for legacy institutions. ""This falls at least Â£50m short of the projected cost of Â£300-Â£400m,"" he said. The Sinn FÃ©in MLA suggested that the announcement from Westminster was made ""against the request"" of the first and deputy first ministers. He hopes to meet the Chancellor next week for further talks. The SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, was equally unimpressed: ""The gulf between the ambition of the deal and the money on the table is substantial and will cause serious public finance difficulties for the executive. ""This is not, and cannot be, the end of the matter,"" he said. ""I am, however, pleased to see earmarked and ring-fenced allocations for the expansion of Magee and a new addiction centre for the north west."" This video can not be played What does a billion pounds look like... and what can it buy? However, in a tweet on Wednesday night, Secretary of State Julian Smith defended the funding and urged politicians to ""get on with it"". He posted: ""Let's remember MLAs have been off work three years at a cost of [more than] Â£15m in salaries. ""There will be a new deal for NI as it leaves the EU. There is also a UK budget in spring. Â£2bn is biggest ever NI talks settlement and it addresses a number of key issues.""

"This video can not be played The Red Rebel Brigade group took part in the climate protest in Aberdeen. Extinction Rebellion protesters have ended a blockade at the entrances to Shell's Aberdeen headquarters. Activists arrived at the Altens base at about 06:30 and remained at the site until 19:30 in a bid to ""hold Shell to account"". The group said the protest was part of its two-week long campaign targeting the fossil fuel industry. Shell said it was addressing its emissions and helping customers to reduce theirs. And industry body Oil and Gas UK (OGUK) said climate change would not be solved by ""stunts"". Extinction Rebellion also had its purple boat at the site. Attenborough warns of climate 'crisis moment' Seven in court after drilling rig 'occupation' The protesters were also in Aberdeen city centre on Thursday afternoon, including at the Union Square shopping centre. A statement from Extinction Rebellion Scotland said: ""Today's successful protest marked the final day of 10 days of action focused on the fossil fuel industry, and in particular Shell's role in driving the climate crisis. ""Thirty activists spent 13 hours blockading the entrances to Shell HQ all day, sending a message that we won't take their wilful avoidance in the face of the climate emergency any more."" The group vowed to continue taking action until governments and industry respond ""sensibly and appropriately"" to the warnings from scientists and public figures, such as broadcasterSir David Attenborough. It concluded: ""Anything other than a rapid winding down of the fossil fuel industry is irresponsible and reckless."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

One of the protesters, Michael, a 57-year-old management consultant, said: ""Governments and corporations like Shell all agree that my children are facing a catastrophic climate and ecological collapse yet are doing next to nothing to prevent this. ""I'm here today because as a parent I am ultimately responsible for the safety of my children whether today, tomorrow or in 30 years time."" The protest began early on Thursday A Shell spokesman said: ""The heightened awareness of climate change that we have seen over recent months is a good thing. ""As a company, we agree that urgent action is needed. What will really accelerate change is effective policy, investment in technology innovation and deployment, and changing customer behaviour. ""As we move to a lower-carbon future, we are committed to playing our part, by addressing our own emissions and helping customers to reduce theirs - because we all have a role to play."" OGUK communications director Gareth Wynn said: ""Climate change will be solved by practical actions not conspiracy theories and stunts. ""It's disappointing that this group is choosing to disrupt the normal working day of people in this industry, causing alarm rather than engage in meaningful discussion with key decision makers. ""Our industry is packed full of people with the engineering and environmental knowledge and skills to play a key part in reducing emissions and we are already taking action."" Ch Insp Davie Howieson, local area commander for Aberdeen South, said: ""Officers are currently in attendance at a peaceful protest in Wellington Road, Aberdeen, outside the Shell premises. ""The road was blocked from around 06:45, and road users are advised to avoid the area for the time being. We are liaising with both Shell and the protest organisers, Extinction Rebellion.""

" The families still waiting for 'justice' By Caroline Gall Like many nine-year-old boys Lassana loved football. In the streets and parks near his home outside Barcelona he would spend hours kicking a ball around with his friends. But unlike the thousands of other boys hoping to become stars, Lassana’s natural talent had been noticed. An FC Barcelona scout had spotted him and wanted to sign him for the club’s famous youth academy, where stars such as Lionel Messi had cut their teeth. But Lassana’s father, Ousmane, was not there to celebrate with him. He had moved to Birmingham, England, months before in search of work. Despite living thousands of miles away, Ousmane still arranged lifts to training and games for Lassana or his older brother Mohammadu, who played for a different team. Before every match he would also call them and wish them luck. But one night, the phone call never came. Lassana joined FC Barcelona's famous La Masia youth academy Lassana joined FC Barcelona's famous La Masia youth academy It was 7 July 2016. Lassana and Mohammadu were settling down in front of the TV to watch France play Germany in Euro 2016. Mohammadu was due to play in a tournament the next day. WhatsApp showed their father had been online that morning. The boys watched the game, waiting for their father to call. Their mother, Aminata, tried not to worry. Ousmane had phoned his family every day since moving to the UK. She busied herself with the household chores and comforted her three-year-old daughter Fanta who, unusually, would not stop crying. The boys continued to wait. As the match neared its end, they were interrupted by a knock at the door. It was their great-uncle, Keemo. Keemo told Aminata he had found out about an accident at Ousmane’s workplace, a recycling centre in Birmingham where he sorted scrap metal. He told her no-one had heard from him since. Aminata knew straight away what this meant. “As soon as he came, I just knew something was not right,” she says. “I said 'This is the man I married. I can tell you he has never gone a whole day without calling us. So I can confirm it for you.'” Ousmane, her husband, was dead. Like many nine-year-old boys Lassana loved football.

The next day he and his mother and siblings boarded a flight to the UK. Before he died, Ousmane had saved enough money for his family to visit him in Birmingham. It was intended in part as a celebration of Lassana’s success. Instead they were flying out to retrieve his body. At the airport, the family were met by police. Aminata found herself completely disorientated and rooted to the spot. “I found it so difficult, I couldn’t move forward,” she says. “The police had to actually move me and take me into the room. It felt like someone was holding my legs.” In a side room, Ousmane's brother, who lived in the UK, translated into their native language, Mandinka, as the police explained what had happened. They said Ousmane had been working at a metal recycling centre when a concrete wall toppled over and crushed him and four other men. The police offered to let Aminata see her husband’s body for the last time but, crying, she refused.  One week later, Lassana signed for FC Barcelona’s youth academy.

The police offered to let Aminata see her husband’s body for the last time but, crying, she refused. “My father was very, very happy when I was picked by Barcelona,” says Lassana, who is now aged 13. “I was so happy. If he was alive now, not only would he be encouraging me, he would be saying try harder because it’s so competitive to be a footballer.” Lassana scores an impressive solo goal for FC Barcelona's youth team But life for Lassana and his family has been a struggle since. Three years after his father's death they have still not received compensation. The family of five share a small apartment in the town of Parets del Valles, surviving on monthly benefits of about 1,000 euros (£880). There is no money for trips out and other treats for the children. Instead Aminata takes them to the park to play. On birthdays, she prepares a meal and bakes a cake but presents are another luxury the family cannot afford. “Apart from the emotional day-to-day struggle, it’s paying for books and school trips for the four children,” she says. “When did I last buy myself something? I have no consideration for that. I have bought myself nothing since Ousmane passed away. I can’t think of that. “It’s all for the children and just surviving.” Ousmane had left Senegal in search of work in the late 1990s. Like many west Africans, he settled in Spain, where he lived legally and worked as a security guard. But the Spanish economy was hit by the global economic crisis of 2008. Ousmane first found his hours reduced, then eventually lost his job. He struggled to find new work and moved to the UK in March 2016, leaving his family behind. Just four months later he was dead. Even when he had been alive, Aminata struggled to make ends meet. Ousmane had not just been supporting his wife and children but relatives back in Senegal too. Each month he would send between 150 and 200 euros to his widowed mother and six brothers and sisters. He was also expected to send occasional money to Aminata’s father as a sign of ""respect"". The men who died alongside Ousmane were from The Gambia - Senegal's smaller neighbour. Each was sending money back to family in Africa, despite only earning the UK minimum wage of just over £7 an hour. Their relatives depended on this money for survival in one of the world's poorest regions. The men's deaths left these families impoverished. Three-and-a-half years later, the men's families still have questions about how and why they died. An inquest jury found their deaths were accidental but Shredmet, the firm that ran the recycling centre, had failed to notice the wall's dangerous state. The inquest concluded this “caused or contributed” to the men’s deaths. A criminal investigation by the UK’s Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has still not concluded. The families say they have not been contacted by Shredmet since just after the wall collapsed. It has left them feeling bitter and ignored. “In my opinion it's very clear they [Shredmet] don't value human life,” says Aminata. “I came to England [to identify the body] and spent that time there and I never once saw the owners or heard from them. They don't seem to care about people.” This summer Lassana was dealt another blow - he was let go by FC Barcelona’s youth team. He is not too disappointed. He says he has been told if he works hard he can force his way back in. He is still determined to make it as a footballer, for his father’s memory. “It makes me work harder and if I do really well, I’ll dedicate it to him, to show what I can do from my hard work,” he says. But he has other matters on his mind. He wants to know why his father died at work. “The company needs to recognise the wrong it’s done,” he says. “It’s not just about money. We need to have justice.” Whenever her phone rang, Dado hoped it was her husband. She would answer it and the peace of her rural surroundings in the east of The Gambia would be shattered, replaced by the sound of lorries and machinery. Then she would hear Saibo’s voice say “hello”. They spoke several times each day, despite having lived thousands of miles apart for much of their long marriage. Wearing a headset under his hard hat, Saibo would talk to Dado and his children for hours. They discussed their family, their friends, and their plans for the future. Although their marriage had been arranged, it had been a love match too. As young newlyweds they would hold hands in public, defying the disapproval of their conservative neighbours. The Gambia’s Islamic culture permitted men up to four wives, but Saibo opted for just one - Dado. “He would buy me little things, hug and hold me,” she says. “Whatever he could do for me, he would - and me for him.” But poverty in The Gambia meant Saibo was always going to leave in search of work. The country is among Africa’s poorest. Situated on either bank of the Gambia River, Western tourists are drawn to its beautiful beaches and year-round sunshine. Most Gambians support themselves through tourism or subsistence farming. But more than a fifth of the country’s GDP consists of money sent back by Gambians working abroad, according to a2017 report by the International Fund for Agricultural Development. These migrants typically do the kind of physically tough, unpleasant and poorly paid jobs many Europeans do not want. It was the prospect of such work that persuaded Saibo to move from Spain to the UK in 2014. After many years living apart, Saibo was tantalisingly close to being reunited with his family in Europe. In Spain, where he had lived for 10 years, he had been unable to afford the visas. Before that he had mined diamonds in Sierra Leone, but the civil war there meant it was too dangerous for his family. Now, in the UK, he was earning more money. He submitted his family's immigration application to the Home Office and paid for expensive DNA checks to confirm he was the father of his four children. While he waited to hear news he carried on picking through the metal at the recycling centre. Saibo had called Dado as normal before he started work on 7 July 2016. He told her he was busier than usual because many workers were still celebrating Eid and had not come in. “It was early-morning prayers when we spoke and he said 'God willing, my family will be here soon,’” Dado says. He told her he would call later during his break. But that call never came. Saibo’s job was hard, dirty and noisy. Lorries would come and go all day, depositing large piles of waste material at the site in Nechells, near Birmingham city centre. The men would spend the day sorting through this pile and separating out the metal. At the end of each shift, they would go home caked in dirt. Poorly paid, their employment was also precarious - their jobs were in the “gig economy” and they did not know from one day to the next whether they would have work. It was also - unbeknown to them - incredibly dangerous. The men would stand next to a conveyor belt housed in a large steel-framed shed with the top of the belt jutting through the roof. The men were clearing metal from the right-hand side bay when the wall fell The men were clearing metal from the right-hand side bay when the wall fell If the belt stopped working, as it would from time to time, the men would be told to sweep out bays storing piles of metal. Bordering one of these bays was a towering wall consisting of concrete blocks. There was no mortar joining the blocks - they were designed to interlock - and the wall had no foundations. But the design was safe and legal if appropriately used. This wall, however, had been loaded on one side with 263 tonnes of metal briquettes. As the men cleared out the bay on the other side of the wall, the concrete blocks collapsed without warning. The men below stood no chance. After the wreckage was cleared, their broken bodies could only be identified by their fingerprints.

Dado had been pregnant with twins the last time she saw her husband. Now those girls are six years old. She has decided not to tell them about their father’s death yet. She tells them Saibo is still working abroad. The rest of the family go along with the fiction. Home is her uncle’s cramped compound in Serrekunda, a bustling town close to the Gambian capital, Banjul. Dado and her children share the home with her sister, brothers and mother. After Saibo’s death she moved out of his family compound in the village of Garowol, where she had lived since they married in 2000. Saibo’s wages had indirectly supported about 50 people, including Dado and her children, but the loss of his income made it difficult for them to support her. No-one asked her to move out, but custom dictated she should. She is now desperately short of money. “Having no husband and four kids is hard,” she says. “I am obviously really struggling. “I have tried every avenue to get work - cooking, cleaning - but struggled and not found anything. Friends help out when they can. I don’t know what the future holds. “If I got some money then it would be so my children would have a better life and can achieve an education - that’s the only way it can happen. “I would not buy luxury things, I would save it for the children and a better life and their future. I have no idea what [compensation] we would get, if anything.”  Half a world away it has been difficult for her to find out more about what happened to her husband. The inquest into the men's deaths was in November 2018 - more than two years after the wall collapsed. Dado tried to attend but the UK did not grant her a visa in time. She arrived three days after the hearing concluded. She consoles herself remembering happier times, when Saibo would come to visit her in The Gambia from Spain. “He’d tell me about Europe and how different it was to Africa and how he lived. I think then that we were getting close to our dream [of living together in Europe]. “But I had to accept that in either three, four or five months he was going again. As a woman from The Gambia you expect this to happen, to be apart.” After years of dreaming, the family had been finally on the verge of reuniting. Then the accident happened. “My world changed that day,” says Dado. “We didn’t have long enough together as a couple. Clearly, this has destroyed our life. I don't know what to think about the future. “In our culture, the worst thing that can happen to you is for your husband to die.” Dado had been pregnant with twins the last time she saw her husband. Now those girls are six years old.

Litter is scattered around the street. Almost every room of her home has black mould on the walls. She worries about the cough her four-year-old daughter Fatou has developed. The cough is so pronounced, concerned staff at her nursery have also tried to contact the landlord about the damp. Unaware, little Fatou chirps and giggles as she plays around the house, her boundless energy keeping her mother busy. Hatoumata tries to make her money last but it is hard. There is nothing spare after each cycle of benefits. She has no family living nearby and very few friends. She is lonely and depressed. It has been like this since her husband died. Like most Gambian women, Hatoumata had always been dependent on men. She was 10 years old when her family arranged her marriage to 37-year-old Mohammadou. She was his second wife but the age gap was not unusual - their marriage would not be consummated until she was an adult. Mohammadou was already working in Spain and flew back there almost immediately after the wedding. Meanwhile, Hatoumata went to live with Mohammadou’s family in their compound. She would see her husband infrequently over the next 12 years. Then, when she was 22, he asked her to live with him in Birmingham, where he had moved in search of work. She was soon mother to a baby girl. “I was very lonely at first because I was missing my family and I was here alone as Mohammadou was out working all day,” she says. “Over time, I began to settle. We planned to stay in Birmingham and this would be our life and to have more children. But then it changed.” The night before the accident they had celebrated Eid at their local mosque. Although Ramadan had ended, Mohammadou had chosen to fast for six more days. So Hatoumata rose before dawn to heat through his breakfast. After he left for work, she went back to bed with Fatou. They were asleep when she heard banging at the door. She opened it and was confronted by the sight of two police officers. “They were standing outside and I asked ‘How can I help you?’, but I didn’t understand the language,” she says. “Because of that, I said ‘Hold on, I will call my husband and he can talk to you’. So I called him and it was ringing and ringing and he wasn't picking it up.” As she waited for a friend to come over to translate, other Gambian men - friends of her husband - turned up at her house. Some asked if she had been in touch with Mohammadou. None mentioned to her what had happened. Eventually, her friend arrived and she learned, from the police, that her husband had died. “I could not believe it,” Hatoumata says. “I knew he worked with metals but I never thought it was a dangerous job.” Hatoumata’s house in Winson Green, Birmingham, is cold and damp. Outside, a cupboard has been left by someone to rot.

Dependent since childhood on her husband and his family, this family support network was now reduced. Although she is supported by her fellow Soninke speakers in the area, she is less integrated within the Gambian community than when her husband was alive. Her lack of good English - she says the lessons clash with her childcare - has also made it hard to assimilate in the UK. “I honestly regret coming to this country,” she says. “Not that I could foresee this, but if I knew, I would never have come here. “I would like to work, I really would, but I can’t right now because of childcare. My daughter is at nursery. Who would pick her up every day? “I am just existing. There is a lot of thinking about the past, the present. It’s very depressing. I feel trapped here.” Despite the loneliness, she is reluctant to return to The Gambia. Fatou, her daughter, was born in Birmingham and she wants her to have the life opportunities a UK education offers. Hatoumata's home is only a few miles from the recycling centre where her husband and the other men lost their lives. Yet she knows as little as Aminata and Dado about the accident. She says she is “confused” about why she has had to wait so long for compensation, but would “rather have my husband here and have a happy life here”. Her anger is focused on Shredmet, the company that employed her husband through an agency and which, she believes, has not treated the men’s families properly since. “You cannot say they [Shredmet] are a good company,” she says. “Even to this day after the accident they have not come to see the families or given condolences. “This is very bad. They can't just leave us like this. They need to help. We need to be compensated and [not] just be left like this.” Mohammadou’s death left Hatoumata isolated in a country where she knew few people and could not speak the language.

We need to be compensated and [not] just be left like this.” Hawa Kaba is at home in her terraced house in Leicester, where she has been living for the past two years with her son. She moved there from Birmingham following the accident, unable to cope with the constant reminders of her husband, Bangally. While he was alive she would often see his bicycle outside the mosque near their home in Aston. After his death she found it too upsetting to walk past. She had been working as a cleaner at a Travelodge in Birmingham city centre when the accident happened. Despite being legally in the UK and having worked there for months, she panicked when the police arrived. Fearing she was to be deported, she ran to quickly gather her things. Instead the two police officers said her husband was dead. “The world did not really mean anything to me any more after that,” she says. “I was in a complete daze. But we did not know what had happened, no-one knew. “It took me over a year to get over it. I still now get lapses… and fall back.” Hawa is one of three widows, along with Hatoumata, still living in the UK. The other, Awa Dibba - wife of Almamo Jammeh - lives in Leeds. Like the others, Hawa has struggled financially. “I work about 16 hours a week and have a rented council house, but it is cold in the kitchen with a hole in the ceiling to the outside,” she says. “My son is at school here, but he doesn't like talking about his dad. It has really affected him. They were very, very close.” Hawa and her son had followed Bangally to the UK from Spain. She says she had stressed to her husband many times how insecure his work was and that he should find something else. “But he said ‘What can I do? I don’t speak English yet and if I leave this work, how am I going to look after us?’,” she says. “There are limited options available. He was going for English classes while he worked but did not know enough yet. “It was very difficult to leave Spain to come here as immigrants. Our objective was to work and look after family. But when he came here not only could he not get regular, stable work, he lost his life.” Following the accident, the families had to wait two years for the inquest to be held. Until this concluded they could not legally begin a compensation claim. An HSE report prepared ahead of the inquest was clear about why the wall fell. “The wall collapsed because it was not designed to withstand the lateral loads imposed by the steel briquettes and was therefore inherently unstable,” it said. “The loading increased from one side as material was removed from the bay the men were working in. The fact that the walls were not properly designed, in [the inspector's view], was the reason why it collapsed.” The report said Shredmet could have installed walls designed to withstand the loads. After the accident, other retaining walls at the site were inspected and also found to be defective. While Shredmet kept daily and monthly inspection records it had failed to recognise the walls were dangerous. The fatal accident was not Shredmet's first health and safety incident. In 2012 the firm was fined £50,000 over an accident in which an employee's arm was injured. The company subsequently employed a health and safety adviser, Michael White. But the inquest was told he had only spent a total of 12 hours at the Nechells site in the year before the men's deaths. The inquest heard conflicting accounts from Shredmet and Mr White about the wall. Although Shredmet said it had been in situ for about 18 months  prior to the collapse, Mr White said he could not recall seeing it and had never been asked to assess its safety. Just months before the accident, there was also a large fire at the site. West Midlands Fire Service says the cause was accidental and it subsequently gave the company advice. The families’ civil compensation claim began about a year ago. Their lawyer asked Shredmet for an initial payment to help the struggling families - without admitting liability - but the company refused. Shredmet has declined to comment, citing the ongoing HSE investigation.  But at the time of the inquest, managing director Wayne Hawkeswood said he was ""absolutely devastated"" by the deaths of the five men and constantly thought about ""the loss their family and friends have suffered"". Like the other widows, Hawa feels abandoned since the accident. They are angry at the lack of contact from Shredmet and the speed with which the company resumed operations after the men's deaths. “What has really shocked me is that the company got up and running so soon afterwards,” Hawa says. “They did not do what they should to protect the workers and they don't respect human beings. “This is part of their culture, they have no respect.” Hawa had urged her husband Bangally to find more secure work Hawa had urged her husband Bangally to find more secure work Hawa Kaba is at home in her terraced house in Leicester, where she has been living for the past two years with her son. She moved there from Birmingham following the accident, unable to cope with the constant reminders of her husband, Bangally.

He maintains the tragedy at Shredmet is only a small part of a wider problem. The men’s deaths, he warns, have implications for anyone employed in similar jobs. The industry the men were employed in - waste and recycling - is the second most dangerous in the UK. Between 2014 and 2018, almost eight in every 100,000 workers died. This rate is 17 times the national average,according to a 2019 HSE report. It is among the UK’s most lucrative industries, worth an estimated £7bn a year to the economy. In recent years it has enjoyed a boom. Demand has been driven by rising metal prices, a shortage of landfill sites and laws restricting the dumping of electronic equipment in them. Mr Cooper says the recycling industry “exploits migrant labour for enormous profits”. Daniel Lemberger Cooper said the men's deaths raised issues for every worker in Britain Daniel Lemberger Cooper said the men's deaths raised issues for every worker in Britain “There is a now huge demand for recycling and the industry is getting bigger and bigger, and these workers will be needed more and more,” he says. “The five men were honest, hardworking and decent human beings. “The conditions in which these workers were employed, of precarious employment, zero-hours contracts, temporary and agency work, the so-called gig economy and exploitation, and issues of low pay and long hours are spreading throughout the economy,” he adds. “This is an issue for every worker in Britain.” Leading safety experts say the standard of the UK’s health and safety enforcement has declined over the past decade. After years of cuts there are fewer inspectors carrying out fewer inspections, leaving many workplaces unsafe, they say. Shredmet had not been inspected by the HSE since the 2010 accident in which an employee injured their arm. Lawrence Waterman, chairman of the British Safety Council, says the HSE has been under-resourced since the days of the coalition government. In 2010 the government imposed 33% cuts on the HSE. Then, in 2012,  the Prime Minister David Cameron stated the UK's""excessive""health and safety culture was costing businesses billions and he intended to""kill""it off for good. After the Conservatives won the general election in 2015, further cuts followed in theSpending Reviewlater that year. Lawrence Waterman said more effort was needed to keep workplaces safe Lawrence Waterman said more effort was needed to keep workplaces safe “It’s not just resources that have had an impact,” says Mr Waterman. ""It’s the political hangover of now two prime ministers ago who wanted to kill health and safety, with a feeling that red tape ruled and we were being told how to live our lives. “Well, the other side of that is that five guys never came home to their families. “Hanging over businesses and the government is the need to be honest and place more value on looking after people at work.” Hilda Palmer, from the Hazards Campaign, which promotes workplace safety, says a disproportionately large number of those killed or injured at work are immigrants. “Unfortunately, if you look at the names of the people that are killed, they are mostly foreign-sounding names - eastern Europeans and now west African,” she says. “I also know of a case involving some Peruvians. It seems it’s the new wave of migrants that get drawn in - the most vulnerable.” She says legislation, enforcement and trade unions have all been “attacked through the cuts”. Laws restricting the dumping of electronic equipment in landfill have fuelled demand for recycling Laws restricting the dumping of electronic equipment in landfill have fuelled demand for recycling “That creates an environment for cowboys to flourish,” she added. “If employers see checks being done, prosecutions, fines and notices being issued, that reminds them to act.” The Conservatives declined to comment but Vince Cable, the former Liberal Democrat leader who was a member of the coalition cabinet, says the global financial crisis was to blame. “Austerity was going to happen whatever government came in,” he says. “The cuts [Labour chancellor] Alistair Darling had were the same as what the coalition did and this was as a result of the huge financial crisis and reduced revenue that the country found itself in.” The dead men's families remain bewildered that three years after the accident the HSE has still not decided whether or not to charge Shredmet. Mr Waterman says the slowness of the HSE investigation is due to its underfunding. The HSE aims to complete 80% of fatal investigations within one year but in 2018-19 just 65% were. “When you look at that, it’s not unreasonable for the families to feel that justice is being denied,” Mr Waterman says. “If the families of the five guys were plugged-in middle-class agitators, there may have been more pressure being felt to keep the HSE focused on finding out what happened.” The HSE says the families’ demand for a speedy conclusion is “understandable” but it needs to ensure its investigation is “thorough”. “As with many complex, challenging criminal investigations relating to multiple fatalities, following new lines of inquiry and forensically examining evidence can mean investigations take longer than families would understandably hope,” a spokesman says. “Since the inquests concluded... our time and energy has been fully focused on reviewing the case, bringing together evidence heard by the coroner and concluding the criminal investigation. “We are working hard to resolve any delays and have endeavoured to give regular updates to the families where possible.” The families' lawyer believes they are the victims of a legal system that does not treat deaths at work with the same seriousness as other fatalities. “The criminal justice system fails to treat deaths and injuries at work – unlike deaths in almost any other setting – as the possible outcome of serious crimes and this must urgently change,” he says. He wants the government to legislate to prevent the exploitation of workers. “A fitting tribute and legacy to those that died would be that immediate steps are taken by government to ensure that we learn the lessons of why these men died so that no-one else suffers like they have,” he says. “If immediate, legislative change is not enacted, there are going to be more injuries and further deaths. The government and employers will have blood on their hands.” “By any standard this is a profoundly shocking case - no-one should go to work and die in 21stCentury Britain.” Daniel Lemberger Cooper, the families’ lawyer, works for Imran Khan & Partners, the firm that represented the family of the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence.

He was knocked out by the concrete blocks and, when he came to amid the dust and debris, he discovered he was pinned to the ground by a 1.5-tonne concrete block on his legs. He drifted in and out of consciousness as rescuers scrambled to extract him. “I couldn't move, I could just hear noise and feel the pain in my leg,” he says. “I didn’t know what was going on.” When he woke up properly he was in hospital. He did not realise his colleagues had died until his friend Bassamba, who witnessed the accident, told him. It was devastating and not only on an emotional level. He had only been working at the site for two months and has been unemployed ever since. Standing can be painful while sitting down for too long also causes him discomfort. He relies on the charity of his local mosque in Smethwick to survive and says he has had difficulty claiming sickness benefit. He is haunted by the memories of what happened that summer’s day. “When I think about it sometimes I can’t get to sleep,” he says. “I lose my mind if I sit down and think about it all. I can’t move on. I can’t work. What can I do? “I’ve been going round in circles. I’m in limbo. I am suffering. “We are powerless.

"The US and China have finally - after almost two years of hostilities - signed a ""phase one"" deal. But it only covers the easier aspects of their difficult relationship, and only removes some of the tariffs. The biggest hurdles are still to come, and could stand in the way of a second phase agreement - one that would in theory remove all of the tariffs, bringing some much needed relief for the global economy, which is in the interests of all of us. What's not in the phase one deal tells us where the flashpoints are in the US-China relationship - and what could derail the second round of negotiations. So what didn't make it into the agreement? The deal doesn't address Beijing's ambitious 'Made in China 2025' programme, which is designed to help Chinese companies excel and become world-class leaders in emerging technologies. It also doesn't address the subsidies that China gives its state-owned enterprises, says Paul Triolo of the Eurasia Group. This video can not be played What is Beijing planning with its ""Made in China 2025"" programme? Washington sees ""Made in China 2025"" as a direct threat to its supremacy in tech, saying that Chinese companies have only caught up with American ones - at times outpacing them - because they get unfair and outsized assistance from the Chinese government in the form of subsidies. These were amongst the thorniest issues the Trump administration had with China, but they've been pushed to the phase two process Mr Triolo says, along with ""market access in sectors such as cloud services, cyber security and data governance issues"". Beijing maintains it doesn't unfairly subsidise these industries or companies, but the reality is China isn't going to give up dominance in these sectors so easily. The trade deal won't reduce US pressure on Huawei, the Chinese telecoms giant that has been caught in the crossfire of the trade war, with the US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin saying the company isn't a ""chess piece"" in the negotiations. That will disappoint both Huawei and the Chinese government which have been furious over how Washington has linked the company's fate to the relationship between the US and China. US-China trade deal: winners and losers The US-China trade war in charts A quick guide to the US-China trade war The Chinese firm became a symbol of the US-China tech rivalry and Washington has been lobbying its allies - including the UK - to not use Huawei's 5G technology services in critical communications infrastructure, alleging it could be used by Beijing to spy on customers. Huawei has denied this and had hoped that if the US-China relationship improved, its fortunes would too. Analysts tell me that's unlikely. With the signing of this agreement, there's a clear separation between national security and trade, and Huawei and other Chinese companies should still expect the pressure on them to continue. So expect more American export bans not just on Huawei, but on several more Chinese companies and increased US scrutiny on Chinese investments abroad. While the agreement does talk about opening up market access for financial services firms, some analysts have said it doesn't go far enough to ensure they have equal market access. China had already publicly said that it was opening up its financial services sector, and has recently allowed foreign companies to have a bigger stake in Chinese firms. But Beijing isn't giving up much by doing that, because China's financial services sector is now dominated by domestic digital payment players. Even if US payment firms do have greater market access to the Chinese market, it's hard to see how they might be able to compete. Whether China sincerely applies its commitments to treat foreign and domestic firms equally will also be watched closely by the Trump administration, and this could be a potential area where the rapprochement could be derailed. The deal has a dispute resolution mechanism in place,external, which basically requires China - once a complaint has been made - to begin consultations with the US, with the onus on Beijing to resolve it. But what the deal leaves out is ""how the US is going to monitor enforcement,"" says Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute. ""American firms don't like to report intellectual property theft,"" he told me.""So in the first instance what mechanism is the US using to gather information on this. All that is in the document is consultations."" This video can not be played How the US-China trade war has changed the world The deal also leaves out how the two sides will interpret these key aspects of the agreement. Already, there are signs of differences. Chinese state media has suggested the dispute resolution mechanism isn't dictated by the US - not entirely in keeping with Washington's messaging. This could indicate that even though there is an agreement in place, Beijing might ignore it, as Dan Harris of the China Law blog points out. ""The problem isn't the law,"" he says. ""It's that when something is important to China - some cutting edge technology that it wants - then those laws don't have any use at all."" The deal doesn't include a definitive timeline on when the tariffs that are still in place will go down. According to research from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, average tariffs on both sides are still up about 20% from pre-trade war levels - six times higher than when the dispute began.  That means companies and consumers are still paying more. This video can not be played Who really pays in a tariff war? Admittedly, the Trump administration has left the threat of tariffs in place as a stick to beat China with - in case Beijing doesn't keep to its commitments. And there's always that risk,as China's hard line Communist Party mouth-piece the Global Times points out,external: ""Can a preliminary trade agreement, reached during a period when China-US  strategic relations are clearly declining, really work? Will it be replaced by new conflicts or further progress as negotiations continue?"" The potential for trade tensions to resume on both sides is still a very big possibility.

"Julie Fletcher, who founded Middlesbrough shop Pie Jackers, is concerned about the high level of her rates bill Empty businesses cost UK taxpayers Â£1bn a year, prompting calls for urgent reform of the system. Some councils lose out on millions of pounds of potential business rates income through a tax relief on empty properties, BBC analysis shows. A local authority mayor in northern England said the money ""added up to a lot"" and the system was unfair. The Treasury said it would announce a review of business rates ""in due course"". Experts say the current system pits local authorities - which want stable income - against businesses. What are business rates? Business rates are similar to council tax for business properties.  They are paid by businesses, or landlords if a property is empty. Councils currently keep around 50% of business rates in their area but are expected to keep 75% from 2021. The revised scheme will see local authorities ""take on the risk of decline as well as the reward for any growth,external"". Rates do not have to be paid on empty businesses for three months, such as when shops close down or move. Andy Preston said business rates were unfair Andy Preston, independent Mayor of Middlesbrough, said: ""There's a window where we lose money and that adds up to a lot, so we're doing everything we can to help make sure we can sustain businesses. ""We're trying to bring people into town to live here, for leisure, to work, but it's a big battle, and what's worse, an unfair battle. ""We need to get a much fairer system from central government."" David Rhodes, Political Correspondent Councils across the country are caught between a rock and a hard place. The rock is that many local high streets are ""dying"" and business rates are just one of the reasons why retailers are struggling. But the hard place - is that business rates generate some Â£25bn a year for local government to spend. Whilst some councils would like to see business rates reformed or even abolished, many also fear a major overhaul of the business rates system that could see them lose a vital source of income to fund local services. 'We need more support' Julie Fletcher fears she may have to close Pie Jackers Some smaller businesses argue the rates system should be reformed to bring down costs. Pie Jackers owner in Middlesbrough Julie Fletcher said she had put her ""heart and soul"" into the business but may have to close due to an ""astronomical"" rates bill. ""It will have a massive impact, it will stop us employing another person and we just feel like there should be more support,"" she said. Dr Kevin Muldoon-Smith, a lecturer in public sector finance and property development at Northumbria University, said: ""Unfortunately, we have this perverse situation where local government needs tax to go up and the business community are lobbying very hard for it to go down."" Elsewhere, the collapse of larger businesses can significantly reduce local authorities' income through empty premises relief. The collapse of the SSI steelworks in Redcar and Cleveland in 2015 led to a loss in business rates of around Â£10m. Around Â£3m was given to the council as part of a government ""safety net"" bailout but the local authority was still faced with millions of pounds of lost income and no rates on the site going forward. The local council has estimated the closure will see itunderfunded by Â£12.5m,externalto 2025. The former steelworks in Redcar closed in 2015, costing Â£10m in lost business rates Rules around business rates are different in Scotland and Wales. Empty premises cost an estimated Â£26m in Wales. In Scotland, up to one in 10 business premises receive empty premises relief, which totals Â£82m across the country.

School to fine late parents Our analysis of business rates in England found: Relief for landlords on empty business premises reached Â£996m last year, the highest the figure has been since the recession, not accounting for inflation. Empty property relief sees some councils lose out on up to 6% of their business rates income, though only around half that amount would be retained locally. North-east and north-west England lose the highest proportion of business rates income to empty units. Professor Paul Greenhalgh, who researches real estate and regeneration at Northumbria University, said short-term relief could also show some businesses were expanding into different premises.

"Julie Fletcher, who founded Middlesbrough shop Pie Jackers, is concerned about the high level of her rates bill Empty businesses cost UK taxpayers Â£1bn a year, prompting calls for urgent reform of the system. Some councils lose out on millions of pounds of potential business rates income through a tax relief on empty properties, BBC analysis shows. A local authority mayor in northern England said the money ""added up to a lot"" and the system was unfair. The Treasury said it would announce a review of business rates ""in due course"". Experts say the current system pits local authorities - which want stable income - against businesses. What are business rates? Business rates are similar to council tax for business properties.  They are paid by businesses, or landlords if a property is empty. Councils currently keep around 50% of business rates in their area but are expected to keep 75% from 2021. The revised scheme will see local authorities ""take on the risk of decline as well as the reward for any growth,external"". Rates do not have to be paid on empty businesses for three months, such as when shops close down or move. Andy Preston said business rates were unfair Andy Preston, independent Mayor of Middlesbrough, said: ""There's a window where we lose money and that adds up to a lot, so we're doing everything we can to help make sure we can sustain businesses. ""We're trying to bring people into town to live here, for leisure, to work, but it's a big battle, and what's worse, an unfair battle. ""We need to get a much fairer system from central government."" David Rhodes, Political Correspondent Councils across the country are caught between a rock and a hard place. The rock is that many local high streets are ""dying"" and business rates are just one of the reasons why retailers are struggling. But the hard place - is that business rates generate some Â£25bn a year for local government to spend. Whilst some councils would like to see business rates reformed or even abolished, many also fear a major overhaul of the business rates system that could see them lose a vital source of income to fund local services. 'We need more support' Julie Fletcher fears she may have to close Pie Jackers Some smaller businesses argue the rates system should be reformed to bring down costs. Pie Jackers owner in Middlesbrough Julie Fletcher said she had put her ""heart and soul"" into the business but may have to close due to an ""astronomical"" rates bill. ""It will have a massive impact, it will stop us employing another person and we just feel like there should be more support,"" she said. Dr Kevin Muldoon-Smith, a lecturer in public sector finance and property development at Northumbria University, said: ""Unfortunately, we have this perverse situation where local government needs tax to go up and the business community are lobbying very hard for it to go down."" Elsewhere, the collapse of larger businesses can significantly reduce local authorities' income through empty premises relief. The collapse of the SSI steelworks in Redcar and Cleveland in 2015 led to a loss in business rates of around Â£10m. Around Â£3m was given to the council as part of a government ""safety net"" bailout but the local authority was still faced with millions of pounds of lost income and no rates on the site going forward. The local council has estimated the closure will see itunderfunded by Â£12.5m,externalto 2025. The former steelworks in Redcar closed in 2015, costing Â£10m in lost business rates Rules around business rates are different in Scotland and Wales. Empty premises cost an estimated Â£26m in Wales. In Scotland, up to one in 10 business premises receive empty premises relief, which totals Â£82m across the country.

"This video can not be played Sport should be part of everyone's life - Prince Harry The Duke of Sussex has met young rugby players at his first public event since he and the Duchess of Sussex said they would step back from royal life. Prince Harry laughed and joked as he met children in Buckingham Palace's gardens ahead of the Rugby League World Cup 2021 draw, which he hosted. He also met representatives of the 21 nations playing in the world cup. Meghan and the couple's son Archie are in Canada but the duke will reportedly stay in the UK for meetings next week. Queen agrees Harry and Meghan 'transition period' Why the 2021 Rugby League World Cup is different Talks involving the Queen, Prince Harry, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge to discuss the couple's future were held on Monday at the Queen's Sandringham estate. TheQueen released a statement,externalagreeing to their wish to step back as senior royals, become financially independent and to split their time between the UK and Canada. On Thursday, the prince appeared relaxed and at ease as he took part in the draw hosted at the palace - despite being questioned about his next move. BBC Sport journalistShamoon Hafez, who was at the event, saidPrince Harry gave ""a loud laugh"" when a reporter asked him how talks on his future were going. Prince Harry hosted the Rugby League World Cup draw at Buckingham Palace Children from St Vincent de Paul Catholic primary school are local tag rugby champions Prince Harry hosted the Rugby League World Cup draws for the men's, women's and wheelchair tournaments, as part of his role as patron of the Rugby Football League. Speaking to BBC News, Jon Dutton, the tournament's chief executive, praised the prince for being ""authentic"", ""engaged"" and taking his time to meet representatives from participating nations. The tournament runs from 23 October to 27 November 2021 in 17 cities across England, with 16 men's, eight women's and eight wheelchair teams taking part. England will play Samoain the opening match at St James' Park, Newcastle. The prince met ambassadors for the global tournament in the gardens of the palace Prince Harry has enjoyed rugby since his school days and was a house games captain at Eton. The duke was joined by ex-England player Jason Robinson and Dame Katherine Grainger for the draw in the throne room of Buckingham Palace. ""Not only do I continue to see sport actually changing lives, but it's saving lives as well,"" the prince said at the event. ""Whether it's rugby league or sport in general... it needs to be in everybody's life."" Jason Robinson and Dame Katherine Grainger joined Prince Harry in the throne room The prince helped with the draw to determine the group stages of the tournament Before the draw, he met two ambassadors for the global tournament - James Simpson, England and Leeds Rhinos wheelchair rugby league star, and Jodie Cunningham, a rugby league player in the Women's Super League for St Helens. He then spoke to 12 young rugby players from St Vincent de Paul Catholic primary school, who are tag rugby champions in Westminster for the third year running. Prince Harry joked with the youngsters, telling them to look after the palace grass or he would get in trouble. Posing for a team picture, he teased them, saying: ""Some of you are really warm. Some of you haven't been running around."" This video can not be played Prince Harry shakes children's hands in the gardens of Buckingham Palace Kevin Sinfield, former rugby league England captain and Leeds Rhinos director of rugby, said on Thursday that Prince Harry had been ""fantastic for the sport"". ""His enthusiasm, his energy, his engagement with young people in particular, has been outstanding,"" he toldBBC Breakfast. Mr Sinfield said the Royal Family had helped to ""massively"" improve openness about mental health in rugby league, adding that Prince Harry had ""really driven this"". The duke hosted the event as part of his role as patron of the Rugby Football League Prince Harry attended last year's Rugby League Challenge Cup Final at Wembley In a video message,externalposted on Instagram on Thursday the prince said he was ""proud"" to support the tournament's decision to adopt a mental fitness charter - a programme including workshops for 8,000 young players and their families. ""The perception in rugby league is that you need to be tough,"" he said. ""You can't show your feelings, you have to grin and bear it. ""But something like the mental fitness charter will help us make real progress in getting rid of the stigma associated with mental illness, and remind people that it's not just about being physically fit, but more importantly mentally strong."" Mr Sinfield added: ""To have a real figurehead involved in it who's championing it left right and centre is only going to do good things."" Former rugby league England captain Kevin Sinfield, pictured left in 2017, said Prince Harry has been ""fantastic for the sport"" There has been speculation Prince Harry would travel to Canada after the draw but a source quoted by the Press Association said: ""The duke has some meetings here early next week."" Prince Harry's brother, the Duke of Cambridge, did not mention the talks between senior royals during his first official engagement of the year,on a visit to Bradford with the Duchess of Cambridge. Meghan flew to Canada to join eight-month-old Archie ahead of the meeting. On Tuesday she visited a charity in Vancouver which campaigns for teenage girls living in poverty. Justice for Girls said Meghan visited to ""discuss climate justice for girls and the rights of indigenous peoples"". The Duchess of Sussex discussed ""the power of young women's leadership"" on a visit in Vancouver, Justice for Girls said Meghan also visited the Downtown Eastside Women's Centre in Vancouver. The centreposted a photograph on Facebook,externalof the duchess with staff and visitors, with a caption which said they had talked about ""issues affecting women in the community"". It came as a legal document was submitted to the High Court in London by the Mail on Sunday, outlining its response to Meghan's legal action over its publication of extracts from a private letter she wrote to her father. Meghan's father 'would testify in privacy case' Why the Royal Family rarely go to court On Wednesday evening, Prince Harry launched the next leg of his Invictus Games, for wounded and injured service personnel and veterans, with anInstagram video,external.

"Climate change is seen as the biggest challenge to the future of human life on Earth,  and understanding the scientific language used to describe it can sometimes feel just as difficult. But help is at hand. Use our translator tool to find out what some of the words and phrases relating to climate change mean. 1.5 degrees Keeping the rise in global average temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius will avoid the worst impacts of climate change, scientists say. Thatâs compared with âpre-industrialâ times. The world has already warmed about 1C since then. 2 degrees The original target for limiting the rise in global average temperature. Recent research points to 1.5 degrees being a far safer limit. 3 degrees The current likely rise in average global temperature by the year 2100 if countries keep their promises to cut emissions of greenhouse gases, which are driving climate change. 4 degrees A prediction of the likely rise in average temperature by 2100 if no further action is taken. This would see major sea-level rise, with many coastal areas becoming uninhabitable, as well as regular severe heatwaves and massive disruption to agriculture. Adaptation An action that helps cope with the effects of climate change - for example building houses on stilts to protect from flooding, constructing barriers to hold back rising sea levels or growing crops which can survive high temperatures and drought. AGW Stands for 'Anthropogenic Global Warming', which means the rise in temperatures caused by human activity like the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil. This produces carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to become warmer. This is in addition to changes in the climate which happen because of natural processes. Arctic ice The Arctic Ocean freezes in winter and much of it then thaws in summer, and the area thawing has increased by 40% over the past few decades. The Arctic region is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet. Attribution Attribution is the process by which scientists try to explain whether climate change has made a particular weather event - like a heatwave - more likely. Average temperature The average temperature of the world is calculated with the help of temperature readings taken from weather stations, satellites and ships and buoys at sea. Currently it stands at 14.9C. BECCS Stands for 'Bio Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage'. It's the name for a system in which crops are grown (which draws in carbon dioxide from the air) and when they are burned to make electricity, carbon emissions are captured and then stored. Scientists see this is a key way to keep the lights on while not adding to global warming, but the technology is in its infancy. Biofuel A fuel derived from renewable, biological sources, including crops such as maize, palm oil and sugar cane, and some forms of agricultural waste. Biomass Biomass is plant or animal material used to produce energy or as raw materials for other products. The simplest example is cow dung; another is compressed wood pellets, which are now used in some power stations. Carbon Carbon is a chemical element which is sometimes described as a building block for all life on Earth because it is found in most plant and animal life. It is also found in fuels like petrol, coal and natural gas, and when burned, is emitted as a gas called carbon dioxide. Carbon capture The trapping and removal of carbon dioxide gas from the air. The gas can then be reused, or injected into deep underground reservoirs. Carbon capture is sometimes referred to as geological sequestration. The technology is currently in its infancy. Carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide is a gas in the Earth's atmosphere. It occurs naturally and is also a by-product of human activities such as burning fossil fuels. It is the principal greenhouse gas produced by human activity. Carbon footprint The amount of carbon emitted by an individual or organisation in a given period of time, or the amount of carbon emitted during the manufacture of a product. Carbon neutral A process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be carbon neutral if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve carbon neutrality by means of carbon offsetting. The phrase 'net zero' has the same meaning. Carbon offsetting Carbon offsetting is most commonly used in relation to air travel. It allows passengers to pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flight. The money is then invested in environmental projects - like planting trees or installing solar panels - which reduce the carbon dioxide in the air by the same amount. Some activists have criticised carbon offsetting as an excuse to continue polluting, arguing that it does little to change behaviour. Carbon sink Anything which absorbs more carbon dioxide than it emits. In nature, the main carbon sinks are rainforests, oceans and soil. CCU Stands for âCarbon Capture and Utilisationâ. This consists of using technology to draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and turn it into products like biofuels and plastics. Climate change A pattern of change affecting global or regional climate, as measured by average temperature and rainfall, and how often extreme weather events like heatwaves or heavy rains happen. This variation may be caused by both natural processes and by humans. Global warming is an informal term used to describe climate change caused by humans. Climate model Climate models are computer simulations of how the atmosphere, oceans, land, plants and ice behave under various levels of greenhouse gases. This helps scientists come up with projections for what Earth will be like as global warming continues. The models do not produce exact predictions, but instead suggest ranges of possible outcomes. Climate negotiations Climate negotiations take place every year as the United Nations brings governments together to discuss action to stop climate change. The goal is usually a collective agreement to reduce carbon emissions by certain dates. The latest of these is the Paris Agreement of 2015 which set the targets of limiting warming to 2C or 1.5C if possible. Negotiations are always difficult because many countries are heavily dependent on fossil fuels and worry about the effects of any change on their economies. CO2 Means carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring gas which is also a major product of human activity such as burning fossil fuels. Increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means more heat is retained, causing the planet to warm up. COP Stands for 'Conference of the Parties'. It is the name for the annual UN negotiations on climate change under what is called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (see UNFCCC). The aim is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate. Copenhagen A UN climate summit was held in Copenhagen in 2009 which descended into acrimony and ended with countries only agreeing a non-binding accord that climate change was ""one of the greatest challenges of the present day"". The event is widely regarded as one of the least productive since climate negotiations began. Coral bleaching Coral bleaching refers the change in colour of coral reefs when the ocean temperature rises above a certain level, forcing the corals to eject the algae they normally co-exist with - this turns them white. Coral can recover if the water cools, but lasting damage can be done if it remains too hot. Deforestation The clearing of forests to make way for farming such as soy crops to feed livestock or palm oil for consumer products. This releases significant levels of carbon dioxide as trees are burned. Deniers Climate deniers believe that climate change is only taking place because of natural processes and that human activity has no role. They dispute the work of many thousands of experts around the world, whose research has been peer-reviewed and published and is based on research stretching back more than a century. Emissions Emissions are any release of gases such as carbon dioxide which cause global warming, a major cause of climate change. They can be small scale in the form of exhaust from a car or methane from a cow, or larger-scale such as those from coal-burning power stations and heavy industries. Extreme weather Extreme weather is any type of unusual, severe or unseasonal weather. Examples could be major heat waves, with temperature records broken, extended droughts as well as cold spells and heavier than usual rainfall. Scientists predict that extreme weather will become more common as the world becomes warmer. Feedback loop In a feedback loop, rising temperatures change the environment in ways that affect the rate of warming. Feedback loops can add to the rate of warming or reduce it. As the Arctic sea-ice melts, the surface changes from being a bright reflective white to a darker blue or green, which allows more of the Sunâs rays to be absorbed. So less ice means more warming and more melting. Fossil fuels Fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas were formed when tiny plants and animals flourished in the ancient past, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere, before dying and being crushed over millions of years. When burned, they release carbon dioxide. Geo-engineering Geo-engineering is any technology which could be used to halt or even reverse climate change. Examples range from extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it underground, to more far-fetched ideas such as deploying vast mirrors in space to deflect the Sun's rays. Some scientists say geo-engineering may prove essential because not enough is being done to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Others warn that the technologies are unproven and could have unforeseen consequences. Global temperature Usually a reference to temperature averaged across the entire planet. Global warming The steady rise in global average temperature in recent decades, which experts say is mostly caused by human-produced greenhouse gas emissions. The long-term trend continues upwards with 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 being the warmest years on record. Green energy Green energy, sometimes called renewable energy, is generated from natural, replenishable sources. Examples are wind and solar power as well as biomass, made from compressed wood pellets. Greenhouse gases Natural and human-produced gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the surface. The Kyoto Protocol restricts emissions of six greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, perfluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, and sulphur hexafluoride. Gulf Stream The Gulf Stream is a warm ocean current which originates in the Gulf of Mexico and flows up the east coast of the United States and across the Atlantic Ocean. Scientists believe Europe would be significantly cooler without it. There is a fear that the stream could be disrupted if rising temperatures melt more polar ice, bringing an influx of freshwater. Hydrocarbon A hydrocarbon is a substance consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon. The major fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - are hydrocarbons and as such, are the main source of emissions linked to climate change. IPCC The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a scientific body established by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization. Its role is to examine and assess the latest scientific research into climate change. Its report in 2018 warned that the rise in global temperatures should be limited to 1.5C to avoid dangerous impacts. Jetstream A jetstream is a narrow band of fast-flowing air at high altitude which acts as major influence on the weather. Jetstreams could be disrupted by warming in polar regions, and this may make extreme weather like Europeâs hot summer of 2018 more common. Kyoto Protocol A set of rules agreed at Kyoto in Japan in 1997, in which 84 developed countries agreed to reduce their combined emissions by 5.2% of their level in 1990. Lukewarmers A term used to describe people who believe that climate change is real, and being driven by human activity, but that its effects will not be as bad as predicted by scientists. Methane Methane is a gas which traps about 30 times more heat than carbon dioxide. It is produced by human activity from agriculture â cows emit large amounts â as well as waste dumps and leaks from coal mining. Methane is also emitted naturally from wetlands, termites and wildfires. One big concern is that carbon held in frozen ground in arctic regions will be released as methane as temperatures rise and the ground thaws. This could cause extra, unpredictable global warming. Mitigation Action that will reduce human-driven climate change. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions by switching to renewable power, or capturing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by planting forests. Net zero A term used to describe any process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be net zero if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve net zero by means of carbon offsetting. Net zero processes or manufactured items are sometimes also describbed as being 'carbon neutral'. Ocean acidification The ocean absorbs approximately a quarter of human produced carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, which helps to reduce the effect of climate change. However, when the CO2 dissolves in seawater, carbonic acid is formed. Carbon emissions from industry in the last 200 years have already begun to alter the chemistry of the worldâs oceans. If this trend continues, marine creatures will find it harder to build their shells and skeletal structures, and coral reefs will be killed off. This would have serious consequences for people who rely on them as fishing grounds. Ozone layer The ozone layer is part of Earth's high atmosphere which contains a large concentration of gas molecules comprising three oxygen atoms called ozone. Ozone helps filter out harmful ultraviolet light from the Sun, which can increase the risk of skin cancer. In the 1980s and 1990s, industrial gases called chlorofluorocarbons (or CFCs) were banned because they damaged the ozone layer. These gases are also potent greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming. PPM / ppm An abbreviation for 'parts per million', used to describe the concentration of a gas such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested in 2007 that the world should aim to stabilise greenhouse gas levels at 450 ppm CO2 equivalent in order to avert dangerous climate change. Some scientists, and many of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, argue that the safe upper limit is 350ppm. Modern levels of CO2 broke through 400ppm (at the Mauna Loa Laboratory in Hawaii) in 2013, and continue to climb at about 2-3ppm per year. Pre-industrial Scientists use a baseline with which to compare the modern rise in temperatures on Earth. The baseline often quoted is 1850-1900, and global temperatures have risen by about 1C since then. The reality, of course, is that industry actually got going much earlier, but there is nonetheless a perceptible uptick in the levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by 1850-1900 and the period is deemed therefore to be a useful marker. Renewable energy Normally refers to energy sources such as biomass (such as wood and biogas), the flow of water, geothermal (heat from within the earth), wind, and solar. Runaway climate change Describes how the climate change may suddenly change after passing a 'tipping point', making it even harder to stop or reverse. In 2018, the IPCC said that global emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030, and to net zero by 2050 to have 50% chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C this century. Sea ice Sea-ice is found in polar regions. It grows in extent and thickness in autumn and winter, and melts in spring and summer. The amount of sea-ice in the Arctic is seen as a key indicator of climate trends because the region is warming faster than most other locations on Earth. The smallest ever extent (in the satellite era) of Arctic sea-ice was recorded in September 2012. The 3.41 million square kilometers was 44% below the 1981-2010 average. Sea level rises Rising sea levels are predicted to be one of the most drastic impacts of climate change. In this context, there are two main causes for sea-level rise: (1) the expansion of seawater as the oceans warm; and (2) the run-off into the ocean of water from melting ice sheet and glaciers. Current sea levels are about 20cm higher on average than they were in 1900. Year on year, sea levels are presently going up by just over 3mm. Sustainability Sustainability means consuming the planet's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished. It's sometimes known as 'sustainable development'. Types of renewable energy such as solar or wind power are described as sustainable, while using wood from managed forests where trees are replanted according to how many are cut down is another example. Tipping point Describes how the climate may suddenly change after passing a âtipping pointâ, making it even harder to stop or reverse. Scientists say it is urgent that policy-makers halve global carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 or risk triggering changes that could be irreversible. UNFCCC Stands for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This is an international treaty, signed at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, which stated that countries should work to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to avoid dangerous climate change.  Keeping the rise in global average temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius will avoid the worst impacts of climate change, scientists say That's compared with ""pre-industrial times"". The world has already warmed about 1C since then A pattern of change affecting global or regional climate, as measured by average temperature and rainfall, and how often extreme weather events like heatwaves or heavy rains happen. This variation may be caused by both natural processes and by humans. Global warming is an informal term used to describe climate change caused by humans. The amount of carbon emitted by an individual or organisation in a given period of time, or the amount of carbon emitted during the manufacture of a product A process where there is no net release of CO2. For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again The process would be carbon neutral if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve carbon neutrality by means of carbon offsetting Emissions are any release of gases such as carbon dioxide which cause global warming, a major cause of climate change They can be small-scale in the form of exhaust from a car or methane from a cow, or larger-scale such as those from coal-burning power stations and heavy industries In a feedback loop, rising temperatures on the Earth change the environment in ways that affect the rate of warming Feedback loops can be positive (adding to the rate of warming), or negative (reducing it) As the Arctic sea-ice melts, the surface changes from being a bright reflective white to a darker blue or green which allows more of the Sun's rays to be absorbed. So less ice means more warming and more melting The steady rise in global average temperature in recent decades, which experts believe is largely caused by human-produced greenhouse gas emissions The long-term trend continues upwards, scientists say, even though the warmest year on record, according to the UK's Met Office, is 2016 Geo-engineering is any technology that could be used to halt or even reverse climate change Examples range from extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it underground to more far-fetched ideas such as deploying vast mirrors in space to deflect the Sun's rays Some scientists say geo-engineering may prove essential because not enough is being done to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases Others warn that the technologies are unproven and could have unforeseen consequences The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a scientific body established by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization Its role is to examine and assess the latest scientific research into climate change. Its report in 2018 warned that the rise in global temperatures should be limited to 1.5C to avoid dangerous impacts Describes how climate change may suddenly get worse after passing a ""tipping point"", making it even harder to stop or reverse In 2018, the IPCC said that global emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030, and to net zero by 2050 to have a 50% chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C this century What is climate change?

"Greenland's massive ice sheet may have melted by a record amount this year, scientists have warned. During this year alone, it lost enough ice to raise the average global sea level by more than a millimetre. Researchers say they're ""astounded"" by the acceleration in melting and fear for the future of cities on coasts around the world. One glacier in southern Greenland has thinned by as much as 100 metres since I last filmed on it back in 2004. Essentially because its ice sheet is seven times the area of the UK and up to 2-3km thick in places. It stores so much frozen water that if the whole thing melted, it would raise sea levels worldwide by up to 7m. No one is suggesting that could happen for hundreds or even thousands of years but even a small increase in the rate of melting in coming decades could threaten millions of people living in low-lying areas. Bangladesh, Florida, and eastern England are among many areas known to be particularly vulnerable to rises in sea level over the course of the century. And although the island of Greenland is remote, stretching from the north of the Atlantic high into the Arctic, its fate could have major implications for the severity of future flooding and may even alter coastlines and force communities to move inland. The stark photo highlighting Greenlandâs ice loss Rain melts Greenland ice even in winter Mighty Greenland glacier slams on brakes This video can not be played A visit to the Sermilik glacier, which is rapidly melting One of the scientists studying the ice sheet, Dr Jason Box of the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS), says he's unnerved by the potential dangers and that coastal planners need to ""brace themselves"". ""Now that I'm starting to understand more of the consequences, it's actually keeping me awake at night because I realise the significance of this place around the world and the livelihoods that are already affected by sea level rise,"" he told me. Dr Jason Box, Geological Survey of Denmark Until recently, the ice sheet was generally in a state of balance - the amount of snow falling in winter was roughly equal to the amount of ice melting in summer. Last year, there was actually a gain in ice but that was relatively unusual. Over the last 30 years, decade-by-decade, Greenland has tended to shed more ice. Either the ice melts at the surface which sends torrents of water down to the surrounding seas or huge chunks of ice break off from the margins and float away as icebergs, gradually to melt. Recent years have seen hundreds of billions of tonnes of ice lost - and a rough guide to the effect on sea level is that 362 billion tonnes of melt raises the average ocean level by a millimetre. That doesn't sound a lot but in 2012 Greenland's loss totalled about 450 billion tonnes, and this year's melt is on course to produce about the same, or even slightly more, with some researchers suggesting it could raise sea levels by up to 2mm. And on top of that you have to factor in the ice melting in Antarctica plus the effect of water expanding as it warms. It all raises the level of the oceans. According to Dr Box, it's the recent increase in the average temperature that's being felt in Greenland's ice: ""Already effectively that's a death sentence for the Greenland ice sheet because also going forward in time we're expecting temperatures only to climb,"" he said. ""So, we're losing Greenland - it's really a question of how fast."" I've seen for myself what's happened to one corner of it. Sermilik glacier at the southern end is not one of Greenland's largest but it does rank as one of the fastest-shrinking streams of ice anywhere in the world. To reach it back in 2004, we flew past towering cliffs of ice, the front of the glacier an immense wall of pale grey and blue standing high above the sea. At that time, we accompanied a scientist who checked instruments positioned on the ice and he was stunned to see how the surface of the glacier was dropping by as much as a metre every month. And over the past 15 years, that rate of shrinking has continued so aggressively that now, on a return visit to the same glacier, the ice looks diminished, almost battered, and far less dominating in the landscape. Jason Box is with me and he gathers the latest readings which show that over this summer alone the glacier has shrunk by an estimated 9m. ""That's an astounding rate of loss,"" he said. Since my last visit, the surface of this margin of the ice sheet has lowered by an extraordinary 100m, more than halving in thickness, exposing the remaining ice to the relatively warmer temperatures of lower altitudes. While you might think of the Arctic as a pristine white landscape, the startling feature of the surface is how dirty it looks. Walking on it feels like arriving on the Moon. There are big areas of pale grey and smaller patches that are much darker, covered with what appears to be mud or silt - it's a grim and rather depressing sight. Algae growing on the Sermilik glacier It used to be thought that this darkness was mainly caused by a mix of dust and pollution particles carried on the winds from distant power stations and industrial centres. But since my last visit to Sermilik glacier, scientists have made an important breakthrough in understanding that a major cause of the darkening is in fact biological - algae,microscopically small plants that are flourishing in the melting ice. By turning the surface grey, or black, from its usual bright white, the algae make it less reflective, so it absorbs more of the Sun's rays. This accelerates the warming and in turn leads to even more melting. With the stakes so high for so many millions of people around the world, Greenland is the target of a major international research effort involving satellites, monitoring flights and expeditions on the ice itself. This video can not be played Nasa visualisation of the melting Greenland ice sheet The US space agency Nasa has for years run projects investigating exactly what's causing the ice to melt and what could happen to it in future. Back in 2005, I reported on a Nasa-funded team that made an important discovery about the movement of the ice sheet. Although the great mass of ice looks immobile, it's actually always inching down towards the coast and the team found that this movement doubles in speed in summer - as meltwater from the surface works its way to the bottom of the ice and helps it to slide along. Another revelation is that the ice is not only being melted by the air, as the atmosphere heats up, but also by warmer water reaching underneath the fronts of the glaciers. One Nasa scientist describes the ice as being under a hair-dryer and at the same time also on a cooker. And Jason Box and his colleagues at GEUS run a network of sensors on the ice to record details of the height of the surface and its reflectivity, and how they're changing. The hardest challenge for the scientific community is understanding enough of the mechanisms of the ice sheet to be able to offer reliable forecasts of sea level rise. Dr Masashi Niwano, a researcher with the Japan Meteorological Agency, is just back from a field trip to gather data to try to validate his computer simulations of the ice. ""The ice sheet mass is decreasing - that is very certain. And these results affect global sea-level rise - that is also very certain,"" he said. ""But maybe there are several physical processes that we don't understand, so developing future projections is very difficult."" There are only 56,000 Greenlanders, and they live in communities perched on the narrow band of land at the edge of the ice sheet which, though close, is usually out of sight. Inutsiaq Ibsen, 18, Naja-Theresia HÃ¸egh, 19, and Caroline Hartmann Hansen, 21, in Qaqortoq In the village of Narsaq, Christian Mortensen tells me a glacier that was visible when he was younger has since retreated and that icebergs seem to ""break more and more"" into the waters. Warmer conditions would allow more farming and, as we talk, cattle are grazing around us on pasture that's beside bright white chunks of ice bobbing in the sea. But for some young Greenlanders, climate change is becoming a big concern, partly because of the impact of ""their"" ice on other areas of the planet. Naja-Theresia HÃ¸egh, who's just finished school, was inspired by the Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg to lead a climate strike in her town of Qaqortoq, a pretty port of brightly painted houses. She describes a boat trip to the edge of the ice sheet where she found it ""astonishing and scary"" that so much water could flow out. ""All of that is ending up in our waters, into the sea, and to the rest of the world and, if this continues, it will someday just cover a whole country,"" Ms HÃ¸egh explained. Her friend Caroline Hartmann Hansen also talked about her fears over the uncontrolled nature of the melting. ""It's not our fault; it's everyone's,"" she said. If the calculations of Jason Box and his colleagues are right, the ice sheet is already crossing a threshold into an era in which there may still be years with net gains of ice - like last year - but the new normal will see more big losses. Even with a rapid move to cut emissions of warming gases - as outlined in the 2015 Paris climate agreement - Greenland could still see a growing rate of melting, though that could possibly be slowed. So, as with the young Greenland climate campaigners, the scientists feel the need to take action of their own. They have started a scheme to try to absorb some of the carbon dioxide emitted by the flights they take to conduct their research; Jason said he has been criticised for his high carbon footprint and ""feels guilty about it"". Dr Faezeh Nick plants tree saplings near Narsarsuaq Close to the airport at Narsarsuaq, which connects them to the glaciers of southern Greenland, the researchers are planting 6,000 saplings of Siberian larch, a type of tree known to do well in conditions here. They admit that 10 of the trees would need to grow for 60 years to absorb the carbon produced by a return flight from London to San Francisco, but they say it's a start and that if the project later leads to a much larger forest, it might ""make a dent"" in climate change. Meanwhile, as memories of last month's polar heatwave fade, the scientists are leaving ahead of the winter nights, to try to hone their predictions for what the scarred and darkened ice sheet is likely do next.

"This video can not be played Alan can no longer walk after being diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2017 It's been described as one of the few remaining illnesses that is still largely a mystery - and yet it claims hundreds of lives in the UK each year. Motor neurone disease (MND) sees muscles waste away after a loss of nerve cells that control movement, speech and breathing. There is no effective treatment or cure and half of the 1,500 people diagnosed each year die within 24 months. But now, the largest clinical trial in a generation, led by a team of researchers based in Edinburgh, may offer some hope. It will test potential new treatments for MND as well as looking at whether existing treatments for other conditions could have some benefit. These are the stories of some of those involved. Alan Gray is excited by the prospect of the trial. A manager in IT with three grown-up children, Alan was diagnosed with MND in January 2017, when he was 54. The early symptoms were innocuous enough - he kept clipping the pavement as he walked, as though his foot had dropped. Three years on, Alan can no longer walk. And his home, in Denny, Stirlingshire, has had to be specially adapted for him. Alan admits the diagnosis was devastating but he remains relentlessly optimistic. ""Initially I looked at it all and it's just too overwhelming,"" he says. ""So you have to come back and say, 'Right - where are we today? What's the plan for tomorrow?' and maybe look a little bit ahead. ""I go to the gym three times a week, I get massage therapy regularly to keep the body moving, follow the physio guidance. ""Energy is a real problem because the muscles are weaker, so I have to try and manage my energy each day. ""We'll do one thing, maybe two things but not anything more."" Alan has survived so long he is no longer eligible for most clinical trials. But this new project,known as MND-Smart,external, is different - and Alan is going to be part of it. ""Hope is something that's a real positive,"" he says. ""With having a trial now, we can see something that we can get some hope and strength from. ""As participants, we can help move science forward."" At present there is only one treatment for MND that can extend life for two or three months. The new clinical trial will allow hundreds of people living with MND in the UK to take part in tests of potential treatments. While most trials focus on a single drug or treatment, the MND-Smart trial will test several at the same time. Patients taking different treatments will be compared with a single group who receive a dummy drug called a placebo. They are more likely to receive an active treatment but the trial is also designed to be flexible so researchers can change the drugs being tested as results emerge. New drugs can be added and medicines that are not effective can be dropped. It's an approach that has not been used before in MND research anywhere in the world. They will test new drugs but also medications already licensed for other conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease or anxiety and depression. Repurposing drugs like this can dramatically speed up the time it takes for effective treatments to become more widely available. Euan MacDonald is one of the longest living people with MND The trial has been developed by people with MND working with clinical-trial experts from across the UK, including University College London, the University of Warwick - and the Euan MacDonald Centre for MND Research, at the University of Edinburgh. The man the centre was named after was working as an investment banker in London when he was diagnosed with MND, in October 2003. Now, Mr MacDonald is one of the people who have lived longest with MND, and he has used that time to raise money as well as awareness of the disease. Like Stephen Hawking, another famously long-lived MND survivor, he uses a voice synthesiser to speak. His enthusiasm for the new project being developed by the centre that carries his name is obvious, particularly the hope offered by repurposing existing drugs. He says: ""We're all impatient to see results from the research that's happening. ""There are no guarantees but repurposing has worked for other conditions like cancer. ""Crucially, the drugs have already been approved as safe to use, so the process is shorter. ""Time is of the essence, so anything that can speed up the research process is very welcome."" This video can not be played Dr Pal will be overseeing the MND-SMART trial For those doctors, nurses and bio-medical researchers who specialise in MND, the illness must at times feel like a frustrating target. About 5,000 people are living with MND in the UK today - but with long term survival rates so low, there is a limited window in which to study why it develops and how it progresses. Consultant neurologist Dr Suvankar Pal works at Edinburgh University's Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic, founded by the author J K Rowling in memory of her mother. Dr Pal, who will be overseeing the MND-Smart trial, admits it has been a challenge to find effective treatments up until now. ""That's partly because the mechanism by which the brain cells don't work properly isn't fully understood,"" he says. ""And this condition progresses very quickly, so actually trying to encourage people to participate in trials and following them through until later stages of the illness is very difficult."" Dr Pal says other studies have also been hampered by having too few people involved, meaning it has not been possible to obtain meaningful results. But the new study offers new hope. ""There here has been a lack of progress so far with discovering new therapies for motor neurone disease and I think anything that we can do to improve the quality of life and the survival of people with MND is a step forward for this condition,"" he says. Back in Denny, Alan Gray is sitting up at the breakfast bar in his kitchen with his wife, Beverley. Alan and Beverley have been focusing on making memories that will last - taking 10 holidays in the year after Alan's diagnosis. He says: ""I'm quite a strong-willed person. I've got a lot of family and friends and support, so that all helps. ""But I've also got a kind of mental toughness anyway to say, 'You know, there's no point of just kind of saying, 'Well, why me?' or any kind of denial.' ""This is the reality.

Back in Denny, Alan Gray is sitting up at the breakfast bar in his kitchen with his wife, Beverley. Alan and Beverley have been focusing on making memories that will last - taking 10 holidays in the year after Alan's diagnosis. He says: ""I'm quite a strong-willed person. I've got a lot of family and friends and support, so that all helps. ""But I've also got a kind of mental toughness anyway to say, 'You know, there's no point of just kind of saying, 'Well, why me?' or any kind of denial.' ""This is the reality.

"A promise to do more to protect the soil will form part of a vision for the UK farm industry being unveiled by the government later. Ministers have accepted that farmers need incentives to farm in a way that leaves a healthy soil for future generations. Soil protection has become a core issue of the Agriculture Bill that is returning to Parliament. There is three times more carbon held in soil than in the atmosphere. But much has been lost thanks to intensive farming and deforestation. That is fuelling climate change  and compromising attempts to feed the world. Until recently soil has been a Cinderella subject, even though human life depends on the thin few inches above the rock. In its bill the government will promise to reward British farmers who protect the soil. 'Send in the drones' to protect soil To keep carbon emissions down, look underfoot Five ways farmers are tackling climate change Farmers seek food standards law after Brexit It is part of a radical shift in the grant system - previously announced â to move subsidies away from EU Common Agricultural Policy which basically pays farmers for owning land. Instead in post-Brexit Britain they will be rewarded for providing services for society like clean air, clean and plentiful water, flood protection and thriving wildlife. The grant changes will be phased in over seven years. Already there is disquiet from farmers and environmentalists alike that the government has not set in law its promise that UK food standards will not be lowered in any post-Brexit deal with the US. Minette Batters from the NFU said:  âThis bill is one of the most significant pieces of legislation for farmers in England for over 70 years. âHowever, farmers across the country will still want to see legislation underpinning government assurances that they won't allow imports of food produced to standards that would be illegal here. âWe'll continue to press the government to introduce a standards commission as a matter of priority to oversee and advise on future food trade policy and negotiations.â CPRE, the countryside charity, welcomed what it called  a generational opportunity to change the way England farms for the better. It said: âThis bill represents a radical rethink of farming practice and, most importantly, finally starts to recognise the need to regenerate soil - the fundamental building block of our entire agricultural system."" Although the bill has been applauded, the policies are still in embryonic stage, and as details emerge conflicts are sure to arise.

"There is no application form for the Royal Family. No interview, no appeal, few in the way of entrances or exits. It is that strange lottery, an accident of birth. But to stay royal you have to do two things. Serve, and survive. You have to do some service. Some of it ceremonial, and often dull.  Some of it - if it involves celebrities or travel - less dull. A lot of it is woven into the civic life of the UK - openings, namings, lunches and dinners. You have to survive. You have to aid - and certainly not threaten - the survival of the House of Windsor and the British monarchy. It's not a bad life. It is a constrained life, often unchosen. In exchange for a pretty comfortable standard of living in perpetuity, you lose a lot of choice. But you must do these two things if you want to remain a royal. And it's not clear that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex really want to do either. Queen and Prince Harry to hold talks over Sussexes' future 'You can't just be a royal then decide not to be' Your questions answered on Harry and Meghan statement How could the Sussexes make money? In Sandringham later the players will receive a series of options, a range of possibilities. These will be based on the stated aim of Prince Harry and Meghan that they want financial independence, to take paid employment, to spend a lot more time outside the UK, to exclude the media from their lives at their discretion and to continue at least in part, a royal life, service to the Queen. Leaving aside the heady brew of contradictions detailed elsewhere, the balancing of these different aims and demands is hard enough.  Money is a big issue. But so will be the status of the court of Prince Harry and Meghan that emerges. Will it be entirely independent of the palace, of the monarchy? Will the palace retain any veto on direction or projects for the couple? Much, says one official, depends on how much royal work the prince and Meghan intend to do, and where. Meghan will be in Canada with her eight-month-old son Archie during Monday's meeting To watch Prince Harry for not very long, as I have, is to observe a man who comes alive with crowds, with love, with those who need him. But also to see a man entirely unhappy with his lot. A man who desperately wants to get away from cameras, observers, outsiders, looking and filming and exploiting him. Now the prince, who has worn the nation's uniform in combat and amongst death and injury, is openly sneered at across pages and feeds and memes. It is hardly a great national moment. Prince Harry has had a hard time, from when his mother was taken from him, a boy aged 12. It is important to remember also because it demolishes the Meghan Myth - that somehow she is the root of all today's turmoil. The Meghan Myth is nonsense, with a generous sprinkling of spite, misogyny and some racism. The prince always wanted out. And together, with her brains and understanding and love, they think they have a way. Maybe a deal comes on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. But what are not up for negotiation are service and survival. Both must be observed by Prince Harry and Meghan if they are to remain royals. Perhaps Prince Harry's allergy to media coverage can be managed at those royal events and duties he attends.  Perhaps the couple will make themselves available to a significant and visible degree of service. But the style of their departure from familial obligation, their declaration of independence last week, was so abrupt and so disrespectful. The duke has gone beyond rebellious prince. Meghan, the enabler, is in Canada, with child and dogs. That degree of going rogue looks quite a lot like a direct threat to the survival of the monarchy. That is why today's meeting is hard. Maybe the two sides can strike a deal over the next day, two days, invent a new structure that officials say might be emulated for a new royal generation. But will the couple really agree to the restrictions that service and survival demand? A deal will probably be crafted - however the direction of travel is one way.
