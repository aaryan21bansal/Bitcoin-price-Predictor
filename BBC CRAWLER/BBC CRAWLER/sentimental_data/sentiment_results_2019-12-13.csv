It's the first Christmas election in almost a century. And it's the dawn of a political world: gone are the days of hung parliaments, of knife-edge votes, and of unstable, wafer-thin majorities. Whatever your political stripes, there's undeniably a more stable situation here in Westminster. But Parliament still faces huge challenges in the weeks and months to come. So what happened? The exit poll dropped. It predicted a Conservative majority (correct) and suggested the Tories would get 368 MPs (only three out). As results poured in through the night, the electoral map began re-forming. It took until just before 15:00 for all the votes to be counted. The result? An 80-seat Conservative majority - the party's largest since 1987. Here's how things shaped up:  If you're looking for a quick catch-up:  Who said what today?  What's next for...  The best of the day's analysis:  And if youstillcan't get enough, don't worry, we'll be back tomorrow morning for more from the live page. Thanks for joining us. The Daily Telegraph celebrates the Conservative win and columnist Allison Pearson rebukes those who she says sought to dismiss Leave voters While the Guardian has chosen a far less festive picture of the prime minister for its front page Just over 24 hours ago, we had no idea what the political advent calendar would look like. But now the election is finally over, Boris Johnson has a huge majority of more than 80 seats to work with. So what could be in store for the first few weeks of his new premiership? TomorrowThe prime minister is expected to travel to meet his newly-elected Tory MPs. SundayExpect more drama, fall-out, and grilling during the first Sunday political shows since the election. Monday 16 DecemberMr Johnson is expected to announce a new-look team next week and his re-shuffle could start as soon as Monday - though we've heard there won't be any seismic movements. But those who had an impressive election campaign could be in line for promotion and others who struggled may be demoted as a result. Tuesday 17 DecemberMPs return to Westminster and begin the process of swearing in, where they take an oath of allegiance. Usually, the process lasts a few days, but it'll be rushed through in two days to make time for a Queen's Speech before Christmas. Thursday 19DecemberThe Queen will formally open Parliament, but with ""reduced ceremonial elements"".
The last State Opening was only a few weeks ago - on 14 October - just 10 days before Mr Johnson called the general election. Friday 20 DecemberThe Conservatives have promised to re-introduce Mr Johnson's Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which would ratify the deal with Brussels, in December in what they describe as an ""early Christmas present"" for voters.
Thiscouldmean MPs unusually sitting on a Friday in order for the bill to be introduced at first reading. Then we're all going to have a couple of weeks off for Christmas (at least we hope we are). January 2020If Parliament rises for its usual Christmas recess, MPs would be back in Westminster in early January to pass the Brexit bill.
They would only have a few weeks to get the legislation through both houses before the 31 January deadline. And beyond that?We're not being fooled into speculating that far ahead - a month is a long time in politics. But, Mr Johnson has repeatedly said he wants to ""get Brexit done"" so he can focus his party's other manifesto pledges. And with an 80-seat majority, he shouldn't struggle to pass legislation. The Times leads on the prime minister's ""healing"" message from Downing Street While the i focuses on the future of the United Kingdom after the SNP strengthened its hand in Scotland And the Financial Times looks ahead to the possible ramifications of the PM's election victory on Brexit negotiations with the EU An upbeat front cover from the Daily Mail praising Boris Johnson for lifting ""Britain's spirits"" But it's a more sombre offering from the Mirror, which looks at the fallout from Labour's defeat BBC News Channel Former Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Opik says the lack of leadership and policy flaws are to blame for the party's poor performance in the election. He describes Jo Swinson - who lost her seat and then resigned as leader earlier today - as a ""great MP"" but not a great leader: ""There's no substitute for experience. You've either got it, or you haven't - and she didn't."" Mr Opik, who lost his seat in 2010, says the Lib Dem's manifesto pledge of scrapping Brexit was ""crazy"" and ""not even slightly democratic"". ""That would be like me going back to Montgomeryshire, my old seat, and saying 'well actually I've changed my mind, I'm just going to carry on being the MP even though I marginally lost the seat'."" Lots of Remain supporters weren't happy with the policy, he says. ""It just wasn't credible."" What will the party need in the next leader? ""A very clear Liberal Democrat narrative,"" he says. ""I'm sad to say it, but it's been said privately anyway, number two: there has to be an ability to really reach out and communicate in a way that's got more gravitas than with Jo."" Mr Opik says he hopes the party will take a ""cold, hard look at what the Liberal Democrat core vote actually is, and rebuild from that."" Asked who he hopes will take up the mantle, he names Layla Moran, saying she has the ""charisma"" and the ""narrative"". BBC Radio 4 Labour MP Barry Gardiner is asked on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions what went wrong for the party and how does it recover from the outcome of the election. ""I think there were many factors in the result yesterday and we need the time to reflect what was wrong in the offer we put to the country and what it was people did not feel confident about in our manifesto,"" says Mr Gardiner. ""Was it that we offered too much? Certainly I believe it was offered in good faith. ""Yes, Brexit played a role in this and that is a difficult divide but I do think what we need to do is reflect on what we got wrong, move on fast and try and regain the trust of the people in this country and I think one of the ways we can do that is by holding this government to account, make sure there is proper scrutiny and make sure the government is transparent in all that it does."" Asked whether Jeremy Corbyn was to blame for the election outcome, Mr Gardiner adds: ""I think Jeremy Corbyn has been a decent, honourable man. ""He is a kind man, he is a very sincere man and I think people will look back to this election and will see some of things said about him over the last two years and come to see he has been vilified as well."" It's been a day of full-on drama - and there's been some good photo opportunities along the way. We've rounded up the day's best pictures here. We're here with a Question Time election special in Wandsworth, south-west London. The first question is from Daniel, who asks: ""Did Jeremy Corbyn lose the general election or did Boris Johnson win it?"" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says ""the truth of the matter is people vote for a whole combination of reasons"" but ""people wanted to vote to unblock the country, to get things moving again. And I think that's the explanation for a surprisingly large majority in the end."" Asked about his surprise at the size of the Conservative majority, he says: ""In fact the PM called me at 10 to 10 - I'm famous for my spreadsheets and trying to make a prediction on this - and I thought that he'd have a majority but I have to say it took me by surprise in terms of the size,"" adding he thought it'd be about half of the 80-seat majority he ended up with. Over to Labour's Stephen Kinnock, who says: ""It is absolutely clear this is not a Tory victory, this is a Labour failure. How could the Labour Party not defeat a government like this? ""After nine years of Tory failure, they've turned our country into an international laughing stock... they're tearing our communities apart and yet they could not beat them. ""And that is a damning indictment of Labour's failure, I'm afraid to say."" Mr Kinnock says he received the same three messages on the doorstep. The first, he says, was an aversion to Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. On Brexit, he says voters did not understand why Labour was not prepared to ""respect the result of the referendum"", and when it came to the economy he says there was a feeling  there was a ""scatter-gun approach"" with ""too many promises"".  Stuart Garner says he's relieved about the election result Our business correspondent Rob Young has been visiting
businesses in Derbyshire to find out what they think the election result will
mean. Norton Motorcycles is near Donington Park - they export most of the bikes they
design and manufacture on site. Chief executive Stuart Garner says
he's relieved about the election result. ""If we want to go to India, China or
South America, huge motorbike markets, we face 60% tariffs. It makes us
uneconomic in these territories. The tantalising prospect for us is that
we manage to get some free trade agreements."" A few miles away in Derby are the offices of Work Wallet, a
health and safety app for employers. Boss Adam Civall would have preferred to
remain in the European Union but says he is happy with the result. ""There will
be some positives to pushing on with Brexit. As a business we have to adapt to
change and keep ahead. But any path towards hard or no-deal Brexit is
still the potential worst outcome."" Listen to Rob's full report on World Business Report on the BBC World Service. Nicholas WattPolitical editor, BBC Newsnight Loyalty and a ruthless ability to adapt were the twin weapons that once guaranteed the Tories a place as Britain's natural party of government. In recent years, however, rebellion against successive leaders from both sides on the Europe divide has been the party's default position. Internal squabbling came first, banishing memories of the collective Tory survival instinct that once served the party so well. The emphatic nature of Boris Johnson's win in the country means he is the unequivocal victor in the Conservatives' 30-year civil war over Europe. ""In the end the Leavers will win because they care more,"" one cabinet minister once told me. But how will loyalty and ruthless adaptation apply under Mr Johnson's premiership? Read the analysis in full here. BBC Radio 4 Plenty to talk about on Any Questions on BBC Radio 4 today with Conservative MP Therese Coffey, Labour MP Barry Gardiner and Liberal Democrats MP Layla Moran on the programme. First question from the audience: ""Do you think yesterday's result in the election has proved to be a good day for democracy."" Layla Moran starts by saying: ""I think it would be odd for me to say I am pleased with the result but we have a precious democracy and I have lived in paces that don't do what we do and every general election makes me proud to be in this country. ""But I am deeply, deeply concerned for the future of our country. The Liberal Democrats did stand on that stop Brexit platform because we felt it was the best future for our country."" Barry Gardiner adds: ""Every election is a good day for democracy because it forces politicians to remember that we are there to serve the public and not to dictate to them without their consent what we think ought to happen. ""Having said that, I also think yesterday has also brought dangers, dangers that the division in this country will not be healed and dangers that the poverty and inequality will increase."" Therese Coffey concludes: ""It was a good day for democracy. There were a lot of people that voted Conservative for the first time yesterday in seats that had been Labour for decades. They were fed up that leading parties who had said they would respect the referendum turned their back on those voters. ""We are very conscious that in our broad manifesto there are a lot of things we can do and will do to unite the country in a way that perhaps is unprecedented."" The US government has congratulated Boris Johnson on winning the election. In a statement, US official Morgan Ortagus said: ""The United States and United Kingdom share a unique partnership and essential alliance, based on a strong foundation of shared values and democratic principles. ""We look forward to continuing our critical work together with prime minister Johnson and his government to further strengthen our enduring special relationship, address mutual challenges, and build on the progress and prosperity we have made on so many fronts. ""The United States is committed to the US-UK shared global agenda, including expanding our robust economic relationship by reaching a comprehensive free trade agreement with the UK once it formally withdraws from the European Union."" It was a result not many people predicted: the Conservatives won their largest majority since 1987, and Labour lost seats in its northern heartlands - despite social media suggesting there would be a so-called youthquake at the polls. So, what exactly happened last night? Listen to Matthew Price dissect it all on Beyond Today on BBC Sounds. The newly victorious prime minister, Boris Johnson, has spoken with Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and Irish Premier Leo Varadkar tonight. Both leaders congratulated him on his election victory. In a statement, the Irish government said: ""The Taoiseach and the prime minister spoke by phone this evening. ""They agreed there is now a significant opportunity to restore the Good Friday Agreement institutions, and pledged to work with the Northern Ireland parties to achieve this. ""They also discussed how to strengthen the bilateral relationship between Ireland and the UK.
Both looked forward to the smooth passage of the withdrawal agreement.
They agreed to stay in close contact in the period ahead."" Meanwhile, Mrs Merkel ""spoke about the importance of maintaining the strong relationship between Germany and the UK"" during her phone call with Mr Johnson, No 10 said. Radio 4 PM Former Conservative MP Dominic Grieve, who lost his seat in Buckinghamshire after running as an independent, says he has no regrets about the decisions he made that led to the end of his career in Parliament. Staunchly pro-remain, Mr Grieve was ejected from the Conservative Party earlier this year after he backed a bill to try to stop a no-deal Brexit. ""I don't regret what I did,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. ""I could not stay in a Conservative Party led by Boris Johnson. Quite apart from Brexit I'm afraid my own assessment of his character is that he is someone I cannot trust. ""Interestingly, it was something that came up on the doorstep over and over again. The problem for many constituents was that they felt they were between the devil and the deep blue sea. The fear of Jeremy Corbyn was so strong and constituents said 'I would like to vote for you but I just can't, I must vote Conservative because there lies safety'. ""Whether it does or not, time will tell."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Youâre also going to hear Boris Johnson talking a lot about one
nation conservatism in the next few months. But what is it? Well, in some ways thatâs down to whoever is defining it. There is no strict definition by which we can judge Boris Johnson over the next
few years. Itâs an idea which has been around in Tory circles for some time. But broadly, it refers to the idea the Conservative Party
should act for everybody in the UK. That means policies that work for people
from different economic backgrounds, from different regions and from the
different nations of the UK. There was a one nation group in the last parliament â which
was in part seen as a counterbalance to the pro-Brexit ERG who had been pulling
their weight when Theresa May was PM. This is how they defined what they were fighting for: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Johnsonâs focus on the one nation pitch suggests he will seek to offer policies to people beyond the Tory heartlands â more public spending for example after years of austerity. More focus on infrastructure outside London. A lot more talk about the north of England. That has become even more important now that a number of his MPs are from former Labour strongholds â sometimes with very different experiences of the British economy. It might not be easy though â especially when it comes to the idea the UK is indeed one nation. Last nightâs result puts Scottish independence firmly back on the agenda â and the electoral maps in England and Scotland look very different indeed. Protesters in central London on Friday evening Several hundred protesters have joined a rally in Glasgow city centre against Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Crowds have gathered on Buchanan Street to express their anger at the Conservative leader after his victory at the election. Campaigners are holding placards and chanting as anti-racist speakers address the crowds. Meanwhile, in central London, protesters are also on the march, including on Whitehall and near Leicester Square. The campaign group leading the push for a so-called people's vote has conceded a second referendum on EU membership is no longer on the cards. Open Britain, the organisation that succeeded the official Remain campaign of the 2016 referendum, says it will ""rebrand"" in the new year to push for a ""fair deal for Britain"" as the UK leaves the EU. Tom Baldwin, communications director of the People's Vote campaign, says he doesn't think there is ""much chance"" of the public having a vote on Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement. In a statement, Open Britain says: ""The People's Vote will now refocus its campaign to concentrate on vital social issues that this government must urgently prioritise in its Brexit. It urges the government to ""avoid a hard Brexit"" which it says would be ""a disaster for our country"". ""The poorest and most vulnerable will be further marginalised if Boris Johnson's government crashes us out of the EU with no deal,"" it continues. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The proposed tariffs would have hit a wide range of electronics, including all of Apple's major products The US and China have announced a preliminary trade agreement. The so-called phase one deal will see billions of dollars in tariffs removed or delayed. US stocks hit a fresh record on hopes there will be a continued softening of trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. A fresh wave of US tariffs on Chinese imports was due to take effect on Sunday. However, this has been cancelled for now. ""We will begin negotiations on the phase two deal immediately, rather than waiting until after the 2020 Election,"" US President Donald Trump said in a tweet. ""This is an amazing deal for all."" If the new, higher tariffs had gone ahead, Chinese-made goods such as smartphones, clothing and toys would have become more expensive for Americans just ahead of Christmas. US negotiators are reportedly offering to significantly reduce existing tariffs on about $360bn (Â£270bn) worth of Chinese imports. In return, China has promised to buy large quantities of US soybeans, poultry and other agricultural products. The agreement is a deal in principle, which means if China breaks any part of the agreement, the Trump administration has the ability to re-implement tariffs. There's some festive cheer for American shoppers and businesses as the Christmas decorations, game consoles and iphones that were due to be hit with a 15% tariff are now off the hook. The share of these goods coming from China is around 85%, according to Bloomberg analysis, which would have made it difficult for companies to source them from elsewhere. America's business lobby group - the influential Business Roundtable has long been lobbying against the tariffs, saying they would be very damaging to the US economy. As the boss of JP Morgan Jamie Dimon put it ""it's what happens to people's psyche and confidence and businesses"". The International Monetary Fund estimates that the US-China trade war could shave almost a percentage point off of global growth this year. But there has been push back from others, such as Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro, who feel the US should keep the pressure on what are widely accepted as China's unfair business practices. Replacing 'trade' with 'aid' (subsidies) for the American farmers who have suffered since China put reciprocal taxes on the likes of soybeans. It's worth noting that this 'phase one' deal is just the beginning of the end. America imports $550bn dollars worth of products from China - and tariffs will remain on $370bn dollars of that.

"The pound and shares have surged after the Conservatives won a clear majority in the UK general election. Sterling rose above $1.35 at one point - its highest level since May last year - on hopes that the big majority would remove uncertainty over Brexit. The pound also jumped to a three-and-a-half-year high against the euro. On the stock market, the FTSE 100 share index rose 1.1%, while the FTSE 250 - which includes more UK-focused shares - briefly hit record highs. It closed 3.4% higher, while at the same time the pound traded at $1.33 and â¬1.20 Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the election result meant that the Conservative government ""has been given a powerful new mandate, to get Brexit done"". Mr Johnson has pledged to take the UK out of the European Union by 31 January. Businesses urge Johnson to secure trade deals Live: Market reaction to election result Why has the value of the pound jumped? Politically sensitive shares saw sharp rises on UK markets. Shares in water companies such as Severn Trent, which faced the possibility of nationalisation under a Labour government, rose 9%, while UK housebuilders also saw big gains, with Barratt up 14% and Persimmon 12% higher. Shares in banks exposed to the UK economy rose sharply. Barclays, RBS and Lloyds were up 6%, 8% and 5% respectively. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said housebuilders had been undervalued and rose ""on hopes that construction will benefit from the Conservative victory"". ""We should also consider the potential risk that a Labour government could have posed to their profits being removed,"" Mr Wilson said. While many FTSE 100 shares saw big gains, this was offset slightly by the rise in the value of the pound, which affected companies with big international operations. A rise in sterling cuts the value of companies' overseas earnings when they are brought back to the UK and converted back into pounds. In contrast, the FTSE 250 index - which generally contains firms with more exposure to the domestic economy - jumped more than 5% at one point, before slipping back slightly. The financial bookies had already installed Boris Johnson as the favourite but did not expect him to romp home by such a distance. The pound moved sharply higher as soon as the exit poll was published and went on to post one of its biggest one-day gains against the dollar in years as Johnson's thumping victory removed one layer of political uncertainty. Shares in politically-sensitive sectors such as house building and banking rocketed, as did water, rail and energy companies, as the threat of nationalisation under a Corbyn government evaporated. Markets have given the prospect of a government with a functioning majority a round of applause but the euphoria may be short-lived. Traders are already talking about the formidable challenge of completing a trade deal with the EU by this time next year, along with the prospect of a new Scottish independence referendum. The election may be settled, but there are big political questions that are not. Guy Foster, head of research at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin, said that ""the potential for a smooth Brexit removes some of the downside risk for the UK economy"". ""This should be positive for both business and consumer confidence, at least in the short term, with a gradual acceleration in GDP growth and confidence. ""However, a lot can change over the coming months as the finer detail of the UK's future trade relationship with the EU is negotiated. ""This is still, after all, just the beginning of the exit process. Even with the passing of the withdrawal agreement, the UK could still leave the EU without a deal at the end of 2020 if trade negotiations don't proceed successfully."" Sterling hit a 19-month high of $1.3516 at one point overnight, but then gave up some of its gains. Andy Scott, associate director at financial risk adviser JCRA, said: ""What will be interesting to see - assuming that Brexit will now follow a set course, at least [until] 31 January - is if economic data is given a significant boost from the perceived certainty, and [whether it] starts to influence sterling again. ""In recent months, the market has almost completely ignored the slowdown in the economy and the potential for monetary stimulus from the Bank of England, with election and Brexit expectations driving fluctuations in sterling's value. ""The performance of the economy is likely to be key to whether we see a further recovery in 2020.""

"Money may go further for those on Christmas holidays overseas this year As the country contemplates the election results, people's thoughts will turn to the potential effect on their finances. Money matters are often to the fore at this, expensive, time of year. The December election is likely to mean some changes to the pound in your pocket before the winter is out, with other changes more long-term. Here are some of the key issues, based on the Conservative Party's manifesto, its plans before the campaign and its promises during it. Those who are heading abroad for Christmas will see their holiday money go a little further. Thevalue of the pound improvedagainst the US dollar and the euro when the Conservative victory became clear, and this will now have fed through to the rates at bureaux de change. However, travelling overseas at this time of year can be very expensive, so this will only bring a little relief. Exchange rates: Why has the value of the pound jumped? Election results 2019: Analysis in maps and charts The big set-piece financial event of the year had been planned for November, but was postponed as the prime minister pushed for an election. During the campaign, Boris Johnson promised a Budget within 100 days of the polling day if the Conservatives were elected. This is likely to mean a Budget in February or March, setting any changes to taxes, benefits and allowances in time for the start of the new financial year in April. Mr Johnson promised that a tax break for workers, through a change to National Insurance, would be confirmed in that first Budget. The current threshold sees workers paying National Insurance contributions once they earn Â£8,628 a year. The Conservatives said this would rise to Â£9,500. Economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) calculated this would be worth about Â£85 a year for all those with earnings above Â£9,500 a year. This Budget - and any subsequent ones during this five-year Parliament - will see no income tax or VAT rises (nor any National Insurance rises), according to a promise in the Conservative Party's manifesto. However, this was described as ""ill-advised"" by the IFS owing to the potential lack of room for financial manoeuvre it creates. SCROLL AND SEE:The results that sealed it,external ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW:The night's key points LAURA KUENSSBERG:Same PM, new map BREXIT:What happens now? WHO WON IN MY CONSTITUENCY?Check your result,external The Budget is likely to confirm the biggest increase in the state pension since 2012, with pensioners expected to receive a 3.9% boost. The full, new state pension is expected to go up from Â£168.60 a week to about Â£175.20 in April. However, most pensioners get the older basic state pension, which is likely to go up from Â£129.20 to Â£134.25 per week. They may also get a Pension Credit top-up. The rise is the result of the triple-lock system, which means that the state pension rises in line with inflation, earnings or 2.5% - whichever is the highest. The Conservatives have pledged to keep this in place, as it has with the winter fuel payment and free bus passes for older people. A Pensions Bill is, to use one of Mr Johnson's phrases, oven-ready. It had been prepared before the election was called and includes new protection for those with workplace pensions, and reforms to allow a new type of shared-risk pension scheme to be made available. There is also a longer-term promise in the manifesto to look at a pension ""loophole"" that has seen workers, disproportionately women, who earn between Â£10,000 and Â£12,500 missing out on pension benefits. Despite a number of pension changes in the offing, it is hard to see how they will include any compensation for women born in the 1950s who believe they unfairly missed out on the state pension. Women's state pension protestors outside court There have been no promises made to the so-called Waspi (Women Against State Pension Inequality), although they will continue to put pressure on the government to address the issue. The separate Backto60 group, which campaigns on the same issue, recently losta high-profile court case. At the Conservative Party conference in September, Chancellor Sajid Javid pledged to raise the National Living Wage to Â£10.50 an hour within the next five years. The current rate for over 25s is Â£8.21. The age at which workers qualify for the National Living Wage - the highest level of minimum wage - is set to drop from 25 to 21 within five years. Commentators have suggested that there is pent-up demand in the UK housing market - particularly in London. Buyers and sellers have been put off making such a big financial commitment owing to political and economic uncertainty. Now the first of those is off the table, to a degree, given the size of the Conservative majority, there may be more transactions. More demand could push up prices - which is good for sellers, but bad for first-time buyers. However, one commentator says it may be a short-term phenomenon. ""We suggest only modest price growth in 2020 on the basis that, despite domestic political uncertainty receding, some economic uncertainty will remain until a trade deal is agreed with the EU,"" says Lucian Cook, director of residential research at Savills. ""This could mean a bounce in demand in the first part of 2020 proves difficult to sustain through the summer months and into the autumn market."" There is a promise in the manifesto to look carefully at the ""thoughtful"" suggestions in the review into student finance and university and college funding, led by Philip Augar. In the short term, this suggests the current freeze of tuition fees in England at their current level of Â£9,250 will continue. Universal Credit has been one of the most controversial benefit reforms of a generation. A Conservative victory means the roll-out across the country will now continue. Universal Credit is a benefit for working-age people, replacing six benefits including Income Support and Housing Benefit and merging them into one payment. The Department for Work and Pensions announced in November that working-age benefits such as Universal Credit and Jobseeker's Allowance would rise by 1.7% from April. It ends former chancellor George Osborne's decision to introduce a freeze which, according to the IFS, has cut an average of Â£560 per year from the income of the country's poorest seven million families since 2016. The Conservative manifesto promised free parking at hospitals for people with disabilities, those who attend outpatient departments frequently, parents of sick children staying overnight and staff working night shifts. It also promises to pave the way for longer-term mortgages, more similar to a US system, although there will be some regulatory and practical hurdles to clear before that becomes reality. There are questions too over whether there would be demand for such products among people who may wish to move more frequently. Mr Johnson also spoke a during the campaign, and prior to it, of a plan to abolish the 5% VAT rate on sanitary products once the UK has left the EU, which he called the ""tampon tax"".

"New MP James Grundy admitted he had expected ""to lose with dignity"". Leigh has been a fearsome Labour stronghold for nearly 100 years and even Conservative candidate James Grundy expected to ""lose with dignity"". Now he's the local MP. Are his constituents as shocked as he is? It's been Labour since 1922 and was Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham's constituency for 16 years, the man many preferred ahead of Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour leadership. Numbering a lowly 132 on the Conservatives' list of targets, Leigh was one of the strongest bricks in thethe so-called ""red wall"" of Labour safe seats. It's fair to say no-one really predicted Leigh turning blue. However,Mr Grundy became the constituency's new MPafter securing a 1,965 majority, with a 12% swing to the party. There was little expectation of such a seismic switch, so trying to make sense of why the former mill town has turned Tory has been a puzzle for commentators - and even for Mr Grundy. ""I came here tonight expecting to lose with dignity, rather than head down to London tomorrow,"" he said. ""I suppose I'm going to have to think on my feet about what I'm going to do."" Yet, for most of the town's residents, the result was less of a surprise. Dave West supported the Conservatives despite voting to remain in the EU Greengrocer Dave West voted Conservative, despite voting remain in the referendum and expecting his business costs to rise if Britain leaves the EU. However, he wants to see more local investment and said he felt ""ignored"" by the previous MP, Labour's Jo Platt. ""I never even saw [her]. People have had enough. I've never seen so many people going in to vote in my life. ""I don't want to leave the EU because my lorry drivers will be in queues and much of my produce is from Spain and France, but I still voted Conservative because of everything else. ""My decision was based on local issues."" Gail Robinson said the town's last MP ""talked a lot of gibberish"" Gail Robinson, who runs a delicatessen stall, was also influenced by local issues and said she was proud to have ticked the Tory box for the first time. The 46-year-old said she ""didn't want Labour in anymore"". ""All the funding just goes to Wigan. The MP talked a lot of gibberish. ""Andy Burnham did a lot for Leigh and I had more confidence in him, but not since then. ""I'm really hoping that there's going to be a big change. ""I think that many people have just got to a point where they want to get things moving."" Julie Riding said she thought voters ""trust Boris more with business"" Fifty-five-year-old Julie Riding, who runs a gift card stall in the town's market, was on the fence as she approached the polling station and ended up spoiling her ballot paper.

"Wilde said her opinions ""may differ from others involved with the film"" Olivia Wilde has broken ranks with the makers of her new film, which sparked anger by suggesting the late reporter she plays traded sex for information. The ex-House star plays Kathy Scruggs in Richard Jewell, Clint Eastwood's drama about a media frenzy following the 1996 Atlanta Olympic bombing. The actress said she did not believe Scruggs ""traded sex for tips"", and did not mean to suggest that was the case. But she ""did not have a say in how the film was ultimately crafted"", she said. According to reviews, including inThe Hollywood Reporter,external,the LA Times,externalandthe Associated Press,external, the film strongly implies that Scruggs had sex with an FBI agent played by John Hamm in return for information about a suspect. Scruggs died in 2001 and her old paper, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, has threatened to sue Eastwood and Warner Bros, saying the paper and its staff were ""portrayed in a false and defamatory manner"". Richard Jewell's attorney holding a copy of the Atlanta Journal at a press conference in 1996 Wilde directed this year's acclaimed teen comedy Booksmart as well acting in medical TV drama House and films including Tron: Legacy. In a Twitter thread, she said a director could ""control the voice and message of the film"", but for an actor ""it's more complicated"". Allow Twitter content?

She concluded: ""I realise my opinions about Kathy, based on my own independent research, may differ from others involved with the film, but it was important to me to my my [sic] own position clear.""

That led him to be hounded by the press before the FBI eventually cleared his name after 88 days. Warner Bros has not responded to Wilde's tweets but has responded to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution letter with a statement insisting the film is based on ""a wide range of highly credible source material"". The studio said it was ""unfortunate and the ultimate irony that the Atlanta Journal Constitution, having been a part of the rush to judgment of Richard Jewell, is now trying to malign our filmmakers and cast"".

"Swift was presented with her award by actress and broadcaster Jameela Jamil Taylor Swift was named Billboard's woman of the decade on Thursday night - but her speech contained none of the usual award show platitudes. Instead, the star criticised ""toxic male privilege"" in the music industry, championed fellow female artists and escalated her feud with Scooter Braun. ""Women in music are not allowed to coast,"" she observed. ""We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible-feeling, standard."" ""I've seen a lot,"" she added. Allow YouTube content?

You may want to readGoogleâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Swift, who turned 30 on Friday, opened her 15-minute speech by reflecting on the last decade of her career, and the struggles she had faced. She said that in her early days, critics had speculated that ""a male producer or co-writer"" was the real reason for her success; or that a ""savvy record label"" was responsible for making her a star. ""It wasn't,"" she said pointedly. ""People want to explain away a woman's success in this industry"". ""In the last 10 years, I have watched as women in this industry are criticised and measured up to each other and picked at for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion,"" she continued. ""Have you ever heard someone say about a male artist, 'I really like his songs, but I don't know what it is - there's just something abouthimI don't like?' ""No - that criticism is reserved for us."" But Swift noted that female artists were thriving anyway, listing contemporaries like Lana Del Rey, Billie Eilish and Lizzo as examples of women who ""have taken this challenge, and they have accepted it"". ""It seems like the pressure that could've crushed us made us into diamonds instead."" Taylor Swift and Scooter Braun are at loggerheads over the ownership of the star's first six albums Swift also continued her war of words with music mogul Scooter Braun, who snapped up the rights to her first six albums in June, through a private equity deal. The star said Braun's defenders, many of whom were in the room, were guilty of propping up ""toxic male privilege"" in the music industry as she vowed to fight for control of her music, saying: ""I'm obviously not going willingly"". Here are the highlights of her speech. ""Lately, there's been a new shift that has affected me personally, and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident loud person, I feel the need to bring it up: And that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in, and buying up our music, as if it is real estate, as if it's an app, or a shoe line. ""This just happened to me without my approval, consultation, or consent. After I was denied the chance to purchase my music outright, my entire catalogue was sold to Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings in a deal that I'm told was funded by the Soros family, 23 Capital and the Carlyle Group. ""Yet, to this day, none of these investors have ever bothered to contact me or my team directly, to perform their due diligence on their investment, on their investment in me, to ask how I might feel about the new owner of my art - the music I wrote, the videos I created, photos of me, my handwriting, my album designs. And of course Scooter never contacted me or my team to discuss it prior to the sale, or even when it was announced. ""I'm fairly certain he knew how I would feel about it, though, and let me just say that the definition of the toxic male privilege in our industry is people saying, 'But he's always been nice to me!' when I'm raising valid concerns about artists and their right to own their music. ""Of course he's nice to you. If you're in this room, you have something he needs. ""The fact is that private equity is what enabled this man to think, according to his own social media post, that he could 'buy me,' but I'm obviously not going willingly."" ""When Fearless [won] album of the year at the Grammys... with that win, came criticism and backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before as a young, new artist. ""All of a sudden, people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was I a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden, they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past I had had co-writers in the room. ""At that time, I couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was 'A Swift Backlash,' which is clever - you gotta give it to them. ""And now I realise that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieves success or power beyond people's comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news comes some sort of pushback, but I didn't know that then."" ""[After the backlash] I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album, Speak Now, and that I would tour constantly, work on my vocals every day, and perfect my stamina in a live show. ""I decided I would be what they said I couldn't be. ""I didn't know then that, soon enough, people would decide on something else I wasn't quite doing right, and then the circle would keep going on and on, and rolling along, and I would keep accommodating, over-correcting, in an effort to appease my critics. ""They're saying I'm dating too much in my 20s? OK, I'll stop. I'll just be single... for years. ""Now they're saying my album Red is filled with too many break-up songs? OK, I'll make one about moving to New York, and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. ""Oh, they're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music? Alright, OK, here's an entire genre shift, and a entire pop album called 1989. Oh, you heard it? Sick!"" ""I've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this: Who lets that scrutiny break them, and who just keeps making art. ""I've watched as one of my favourite artists of this decade, Lana Del Rey, was ruthlessly criticised in her early career, and then slowly but surely, she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics. They've been echoed and repurposed in every corner of music, and this year, her incredible album is nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammys because she just kept making art. ""And that example should inspire all of us, that the only way forward is forward motion. That we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us."" ""I see [a] fire in the newer faces in our music industry, whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizzo, RosalÃ­a, Tayla Parx, Hayley Kiyoko, King Princess, Camila Cabello, Halsey, Megan Thee Stallion, Princess Nokia, Nina Nesbitt, Sigrid, Normani, H.E.R., Maggie Rogers, Becky G, Dua Lipa, Ella Mai, Billie Eilish, and so many other amazing women who are making music right now. ""Female artists in music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record and ticket sales, and critical acclaim. So why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast, we have to work this hard, we have to prove that we deserve this, and we have to top our last achievements. ""Women in music, onstage, or behind the scenes, are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible-feeling standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge, and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that could've crushed us made us into diamonds instead."" ""Lately I've been focusing less on doing what they say I can't do and more on doing whatever the hell I want. Thank you for a magnificent, happy, free, confused, sometimes lonely, but mostly golden decade. I'm honoured to be here tonight, I feel very lucky to be with you, thank you so much.""

"EU leaders hope for more UK clarity on Brexit now after Boris Johnson's triumph ""Friday the 13th really has lived up to its hype,"" an EU diplomat texted me this morning. The same diplomat who mournfully noted as soon as the first exit polls were published: ""This means bye-bye to our British friends."" There was a heaviness of heart about Europe's leaders as they gathered in Brussels for the second day of an EU summit. They have never hidden their sadness at the UK vote to leave. But at the same time there was a distinct sense of European relief. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte noted the election result meant ""on the British side they can speed up the process (of Brexit)"". Three years of Brexit uncertainty has been corrosive - not just in the UK, but in the EU too. It has overshadowed the workings of the bloc and been costly for European business. This video can not be played EU Council President Charles Michel comments on the UK election EU leaders' sigh of relief at a comfortable majority for Boris Johnson has nothing to do with their political affiliations and a lot to do with ""getting Brexit done"", as the prime minister has so loved to repeat on a loop. Except that - as Brussels is all too aware - Mr Johnson's intention to ratify the Brexit divorce deal in parliament next month, legally ending the UK's EU membership, only means getting Phase One of Brexit done. Phase Two will see the arduous task of agreeing the future relationship between the two sides. Something Boris Johnson promised voters would be signed, sealed and delivered by this time next year. What just happened in UK election - and what next? Election results 2019: The key points you need How soon will Brexit happen? EU leaders were expected to call later on Friday for a broad, ambitious, comprehensive trade deal with post-Brexit UK. But I've not met anyone in EU circles who believes that that will be possible by December 2020. Boris Johnson won the biggest Conservative majority since the days of Margaret Thatcher The hope in Europe is that Boris Johnson's strong majority in parliament will allow him room to manoeuvre. He will no longer be beholden to any particular faction of his party, including hardline Brexiteers, so fingers are crossed in Brussels that Mr Johnson will use that political freedom to work towards a softer Brexit - a closer relationship with the EU - carefully negotiated over time, rather than in haste over the next few months. WHO WON IN MY CONSTITUENCY?Check your result,external NATIONAL PICTURE:The result in full,external ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW:The night's key points MAPS AND CHARTS:The election in graphics,external LAURA KUENSSBERG:Same PM, new map BREXIT:What happens now? But the truth is no-one knows if that might be an attractive prospect for the prime minister. ""Which Boris Johnson is Europe going to get?"" asks one prominent headline in Germany's Die Welt newspaper. Whichever direction the new UK government chooses, EU leaders' main message today will be ""We are ready"". If Boris Johnson sticks to his December 2020 timetable, the EU is preparing to offer him a bare-bones Free Trade Agreement (FTA). It says that is the most both sides could aspire to in a matter of a few months. But plain sailing this is unlikely to be. Brussels plans to insist that in order to get that ""quick and dirty"" deal, the prime minister would have to sign up to EU conditions: alignment with EU environmental, state aid and tax regulations for example. On Friday, European Council President Charles Michel reiterated that these so-called level playing field rules are an absolute priority for the EU. Would Boris Johnson be willing to countenance that? If he did, voters could well ask him about the post-Brexit national sovereignty and taking back of control from the EU that he promised them. There would also be the real risk of no deal being agreed at all. Meaning that after December 2020, the EU and UK would be trading under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, meaning eye-watering tariffs for both sides and no agreement in place on services (which make up 80% of the UK economy), or on security co-operation (which the EU dearly hopes for). When it comes to trade, as was the case during the divorce talks, EU leaders believe they hold most of the cards. The UK market is important, of course, but it is less of a priority for Brussels than the sum total of their single market. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. EU leaders will not want to break rules in trade negotiations with the UK that could lead to the untangling or devaluing of their single market, or set an unfavourable precedent for them in trade talks with other countries. That said, the EU members, and Germany in particular, are anxious that UK-EU relations should not turn sour. Chancellor Angela Merkel is focused on the bigger picture. She too does not want to harm the single market - Germany is a huge beneficiary - but she is also keen not to alienate the UK. The EU will be undeniably weaker after it loses one of its biggest and most influential members. With an unpredictable Donald Trump in the White House, relations volatile with Russia and a growing EU wariness vis-a-vis an ambitious, autocratic China, Mrs Merkel and other EU leaders hope the UK will remain onside on the world stage, even after Brexit.

"Nicola Sturgeon celebrates the results in Glasgow Nicola Sturgeon maintained throughout the election campaign that she did not want to see Boris Johnson returned to Downing Street as prime minister. But the SNP leader knows that a majority Tory government in Westminster, while Scotland voted very differently, is the result most likely to advance her greatest ambition - independence for Scotland. The party which dominates Scotland is now set on a constitutional collision course with the UK government. The SNP's strongest argument is that Scotland and the rest of UK are moving in different political directions. And that's been vividly demonstrated as England embraces the Tories whilst they have lost votes and lost seats north of the border. After 59 of 59 seats After 59 of 59 seats The UK will now move on to leaving the EU at the same time as the two parties who campaigned to stop Brexit, the SNP and the Lib Dems, increased their vote share in Scotland. The SNP took a gamble by making their demand for a second independence referendum central to their campaign. That's a policy that can enthuse their voters, but runs the risk of galvanizing people who don't want to leave the UK to turn out and vote against the SNP. The Scottish Conservatives campaigned on a slogan of ""Tell her again, say no to indyref2"". But that's not what happened. The Tories lost seven of their 13 Scottish seats and the SNP won 13. They now hold48 of 59 MPs in Scotland, with onesitting as an independent. Boris Johnson will refuse to grant the legal power to hold an independence vote This result cannot be interpreted as an outright demand for Scottish independence. But the SNP will vigorously argue that it does mean Scotland must be allowed to make a choice about its future - inside or outside the UK. Nicola Sturgeon says she won't pretend that every single person who voted SNP necessarily supports independence. But she will insist this result is a thumping endorsement of her demand for a second referendum. She will make an official request in the next few days to be granted the legal power to hold an independence vote. And we know that Boris Johnson will refuse, sparking a huge debate about whether the Conservatives are ignoring the democratic choice of Scottish voters. It's a debate that can only escalate as we leave the EU - and one which may fuel support for independence itself.

"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

"This video can not be played John Finucane pays tribute to his murdered father after his victory in North Belfast The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) suffered a bruising night of general election results, losing two MPs including its Westminster leader. Nigel Dodds lost his North Belfast seat to Sinn FÃ©in's John Finucane while Emma Little-Pengelly was defeated by Claire Hanna of the SDLP in South Belfast. SDLP party leader Colum Eastwood won Foyle with a thumping majority, while the Alliance Party took North Down. A total of 803,367 votes were cast in Northern Ireland - a turnout of 62.09%. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in both saw their share of the vote drop significantly compared with the 2017 general election - by 5.4% and 6.7% respectively. The cross-community Alliance Party is set to come third in terms of vote share, with about 17%. North Down's new MP Stephen Farry was congratulated by his party leader Naomi Long Its deputy leader Stephen Farry won North Down, the first result declared in Northern Ireland. In Fermanagh and South Tyrone, Michelle Gildernew of Sinn FÃ©in retained her seat after a recount, holding off Tom Elliott of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) by just 57 votes. The graph below shows the vote share change inNorth Belfast. If you can't see itclick here,external. Mr Dodds' defeat in North Belfast, a seat he had held since 2001, was symbolic of a torrid election for the DUP. The party's deputy leader - a high-profile supporter of Brexit - will not be returning to Westminster. The DUP also had high hopes of winning North Down for the first time but the constituency elected its first ever non-unionist MP with Mr Farry's victory for Alliance. He defeated Alex Easton of the DUP by just under 3,000 votes. This video can not be played Nigel Dodds says his defeat leaves North Belfast unrepresented in the Commons Later, Ms Little-Pengelly's loss to the SDLP in South Belfast capped a disappointing night for the party. She had won the seat from the SDLP two years ago by 1,996 votes but Ms Hanna took it off her this time with a big swing and a majority of 15,401. The DUP propped up a minority Conservative government after the 2017 general election but has not been rewarded by voters. DUP leader Arlene Foster said Mr Dodds' defeat was down to a ""pan-nationalist front"" after the SDLP opted to stand aside in the constituency. It was noticeable that the DUP MPs who retained their seats used their victory speeches to urge the return of power-sharing in Northern Ireland. After the last general election the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in were riding respective waves of success at Westminster and felt no need to go back to Stormont. Two and a half years on, with devolution still not back in place, perhaps some voters used their ballot to punish the big two parties this time. Another round of talks aimed at kick-starting Stormont is due to begin shortly - the government has insisted a new Northern Ireland Assembly election will be called if that fails. Given the latest results the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in might not be keen on facing the wrath of some voters at the ballot box again so soon. Read more from Jayne:'Some bruising defeats for DUP and Sinn FÃ©in',external There was better news for the DUP in East Antrim, East Belfast, East Londonderry, Lagan Valley, South Antrim and Strangford where its candidates were all re-elected. In Upper Bann Carla Lockhart won, retaining the seat for the DUP after its previous MP David Simpson stepped down. Ian Paisley won in North Antrim but saw his majority cut from 20,643 to 12,000. Mr Finucane's victory was a high point for the party - he secured a majority of 1,943 votes and it is the first time a nationalist has ever held the constituency - but it was a mixed picture elsewhere. The SDLP won Foyle, which it lost to Sinn FÃ©in in 2017, with a huge majority while Sinn FÃ©in's majorities in South Down and West Belfast were cut. Ãrfhlaith Begley and Francie Molloy were re-elected for Sinn FÃ©in in West Tyrone and Mid Ulster respectively and their party colleague Mickey Brady held Newry and Armagh. Claire Hanna celebrated with her husband Donal Lyons after she took the South Belfast seat Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald said she was confident her party would compete to win Foyle in the future. Mr Finucane is Lord Mayor of Belfast and his father Pat was a solicitor who was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries in 1989. He said: ""We have taken the opportunity to say North Belfast rejects Brexit, North Belfast is a remain constituency and wants a future as part of the European Union."" The Alliance Party had a strong performance this year in the council elections in Northern Ireland and then at the European Parliamentary elections when it won a seat for the first time. The party last won a Westminster seat in 2010 before losing it five years later but it will once again have representation in the House of Commons after Mr Farry's victory. He won 18,358 votes to Mr Easton's 15,390 to take the seat formerly held by independent MP Lady Hermon. North Down was represented by Lady Hermon from 2001 until she stepped down this year. Count staff in Fermanagh and South Tyrone had a long night that included a recount of the votes In his victory speech, Mr Farry said ""voters had sent out a clear message that North Down wanted to remain [in the EU]"". He said there was no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit and that ""all forms of Brexit are damaging for Britain"". The party came second in the DUP safe seat of Lagan Valley. Sorcha Eastwood won 13,087 votes, slashing Sir Jeffrey Donaldson's majority from 19,229 to just over 6,000. You can use the feature below to search for your constituency and see results. If you can't see itclick here,external. The SDLP went into the night hopeful of taking South Belfast and Foyle but the scale of their victories in those seats was unexpected. In Foyle, the seat once held by Nobel Peace Prize winner John Hume, Mr Eastwood won by 17,000 votes. The graph below shows the vote share change inFoyle. If you can't see itclick here,external. Sinn FÃ©in won the seat two years ago but the party's vote halved from 18,256 to 9,771 this time. Mr Eastwood said Foyle voters had returned ""someone to go to Westminster to fight your case and to stand up to Boris Johnson"". In South Belfast Ms Hanna overturned a DUP majority of 1,996 to win by more than 15,000 votes. With one constituency left to declare, the Conservative Party has secured a majority of 78 at Westminster. As a result the party will not require the DUP to help it achieve a working majority as it did in 2017. But the DUP's Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said as Prime Minister Boris Johnson sought a trade deal with the EU there would still be opportunities to influence proceedings. Votes ahoy - a ballot box from Rathlin Island was taken by boat to Ballycastle harbour Sinn FÃ©in's Alex Maskey said the result would take the ""dead hand"" of the Tory-DUP relationship away from the political process in Northern Ireland. He predicted it would make it more likely that the DUP would do a deal with his party to restore devolved government. The power-sharing executive at Stormont collapsed in January 2017 after a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in over a flawed green energy scheme. New talks aimed at restoring the executive are due to start on Monday.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he will work ""night and day, flat out"" to prove his backers right Boris Johnson has promised to deliver Brexit and repay the trust of voters after he led the Conservatives to an ""historic"" general election win. The PM, who has met the Queen to ask to form a new government, has a majority of 80 in the House of Commons - the party's largest since 1987. He said he would work ""flat out"" and lead a ""people's government"". Jeremy Corbyn said he would not fight another election as Labour leader, amid recriminations over the party's defeat. He said he was ""very sad"" about the result, adding that he had received ""more personal abuse"" from the media during the campaign than any previous prime ministerial candidate. Labour was swept aside by the Conservatives in its traditional heartlands in the Midlands and north-eastern England, and lost six seats in Wales.

Corbyn: I will not lead Labour at next election Sturgeon: PM has 'no right' to block Indyref2 The Conservatives' victory in the 650th and final contest of the election - the seat of St Ives, in Cornwall - took their total number of MPs up to 365 MPs. Labour finished on 203, the SNP 48, Liberal Democrats 11 and the DUP eight. Sinn Fein has seven MPs, Plaid Cymru four and the SDLP has two. The Green Party and Alliance Party have one each. The Brexit Party - which triumphed in the summer's European Parliament elections - failed to win any Westminster seats. Boris Johnson went to Buckingham Palace to ask the Queen's permission to form a new government The Conservative Party's Commons majority is its largest since Margaret Thatcher won a third term in 1987.

He said: ""We will get Brexit done on time by 31 January - no ifs, no buts, not maybe."" Johnson's gamble pays off The same prime minister. But a new map. A victory bigger than the Tories, haunted by 2017, had dreamt of. As the hours ticked by, red flipped to blue, familiar faces forced out of their seats. Boris Johnson gambled that he could win an election with support from towns and communities where voting Conservative might almost have seemed a sin. And he won. The Conservatives' majority will have an almost immediate effect on the country - unless something strange happens we will leave the European Union next month because behind him on the green benches will be new Tory MPs who will vote through his Brexit bill, his position strong enough to subdue any opposition. Read Laura's full analysis At 33%, Labour's share of the vote is down around eight points on the 2017 general election and is lower than that achieved by former leader Neil Kinnock in 1992. Some traditional Labour constituencies, such as Darlington, Sedgefield and Workington, in the north of England, will have a Conservative MP for the first time in decades - or, in the case of Bishop Auckland and Blyth Valley, for the first time since the seat was created. Mr Corbyn said his party had put forward a ""manifesto of hope"" but ""Brexit has so polarised debate it has overridden so much of normal political debate"". Jo Swinson was the highest-profile casualty of the night Some within Labour have blamed the party's support for another Brexit referendum and the long-running anti-Semitism row for the election result. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer, regarded as one of the frontrunners to succeed Mr Corbyn, said the result was ""devastating"" and the process of rebuilding the party was a ""very big task"". Jo Swinson has quit as Liberal Democrat leader after losing her Dunbartonshire East seat to the SNP by 149 votes. While she admitted her ""unapologetic"" pro-Remain strategy had not worked, she said she did not regret standing up for her ""liberal values"" and urged the party to ""regroup and refresh"" itself in the face of a ""nationalist surge"" in British politics.

Scottish National Party leader and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it had been an ""exceptional"" result for her party. She said Scotland had sent a ""very clear message"" that it did not want a Boris Johnson Conservative government and the prime minister did not have a mandate to take Scotland out of the EU. It was also a ""strong endorsement"" for Scotland having a choice over its own future in another independence referendum, she added. US President Donald Trump congratulated Mr Johnson on a ""great win"" and the EU's top official, Charles Michel said he hoped Parliament would approve the Brexit withdrawal treaty agreed in October as ""soon as possible"".

A more thorough reshaping is likely to be put on hold until February, after the UK has left the EU, with a Budget statement in March. What is your question about the election results?

"Loyalty and a ruthless ability to adapt were the twin weapons that once guaranteed the Tories a place as Britain's natural party of government. In recent years, however, rebellion against successive leaders from both sides on the Europe divide has been the party's default position. Internal squabbling came first, banishing memories of the collective Tory survival instinct that once served the party so well. The emphatic nature of Boris Johnson's win in the country means he is the unequivocal victor in the Conservatives' 30-year civil war over Europe. ""In the end the Leavers will win because they care more,"" one cabinet minister once told me. Sir John Curtice: What's behind the Conservative victory? Corbyn: I will not lead Labour at next election Sturgeon: PM has 'no right' to block Indyref2 The prime minister achieved those victories and will hope to sustain his new electoral coalition in the country by harnessing the power of those old and formidable Tory weapons - loyalty and a knack for evolving in new times. Loyalty, for now, is guaranteed after all 635 Conservative candidates signed a pledge to support his Brexit deal. And the prime minister's pitch in Labour's ""Red Wall"" - an end to austerity and support for public services - marked a return to ruthlessly adapting to changed political circumstances. While Boris Johnson has re-enlisted those two old Tory weapons, there is one historic element of the party's mission that has a less certain future: the Union. The SNP - led by Nicola Sturgeon - won 48 seats in Scotland On two fronts the United Kingdom is possibly entering its most perilous phase in modern times. The SNP's landslide in Scotland sets up a constitutional clash between Holyrood and Westminster. Nicola Sturgeon will use the SNP's success to demand a section 30 order from Westminster - the ability to hold a legally binding referendum on independence. Boris Johnson is highly likely to refuse such a request, on the grounds that the last section 30 order was granted by David Cameron on the understanding by all sides that the first independence referendum would settle the issue. The SNP will say circumstances have changed. They will hope that if Westminster is seen to thwart what they claim is the current will of the people, that may increase support for independence. Across the water, the prime minister is planning to take the UK out of the EU on the basis of a deal that is rejected by all the main parties in Northern Ireland. The loss of confidence is so great that during the election the DUP leader Arlene Foster said that in future she would have to check whether what Boris Johnson says is ""factually correct"". WHO WON IN MY CONSTITUENCY?Check your result,external NATIONAL PICTURE:The result in full,external ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW:The night's key points MAPS AND CHARTS:The election in graphics,external LAURA KUENSSBERG:Same PM, new map BREXIT:What happens now? IN PICTURES:Binface, a baby and Boris Johnson The prime minister insists that under his Brexit deal there will be no checks on good travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The DUP says that HMRC have told them there will be checks. In the last 45 years, there have been two salutary reminders of the perils of introducing substantial governance changes in Northern Ireland without the support of the majority Unionist community. In 1974, loyalists brought down the Sunningdale Agreement - an early version of the Good Friday Agreement - in protest at its provisions for power sharing in Northern Ireland and a proposed cross-border body. The loyalists closed the Ballylumford power station, the largest in Northern Ireland, which stands next to the port of Larne where some of the Great Britain - Northern Ireland checks may have to take place. A decade later Margaret Thatcher failed to consult Unionists when she gave Dublin a formal consultative role in Northern Ireland in the 1985 Anglo Irish Agreement. Unionist protests, under the banner of Ulster Says No, brought parts of Northern Ireland to a standstill. But Thursday's fall in the vote share for the two main parties - Sinn Fein and the DUP - may change the dynamics in Northern Ireland. It could strengthen the hand of those pressing for a return of the assembly and the executive. And Boris Johnson's deal gives the Stormont institutions a say in Northern Ireland's future relationship with the EU. For so long written off by some in his own party as a lightweight showman, Boris Johnson has secured an historic win that redefines the electoral map in England and Wales.

"Dominic Cummings, whose portrayal in a Channel 4 drama helped build a certain mysticism around Facebook's influence There is still a vast amount we simply don't know about how the election campaign played out digitally. This includes how much was spent by the main parties on targeted Facebook ads in the final few days; how much was spent advertising on other platforms; and whether foreign actors were behind any of the most controversial activity. Nevertheless, based on a huge amount of collective data and the combined efforts of journalists and analysts across many institutions, we can now make some firm conclusions, in addition to those made already by my excellent colleagues at BBC Trending. The Conservatives used banner advertising on YouTube A certain mysticism has grown around the issue of targeted ads on Facebook, in part because of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of Dominic Cummings in a Channel 4 drama. It has become a burning issue, fuelled by the fact Facebook went significantly further than other platforms in improving the transparency of their political ads - though there is still a great deal that we don't know - including who is ultimately funding them. Fascinating analysis byWho Targets Me,externalshows - against expectations - the Conservatives actually spent significantly less than Labour or the Lib Dems on targeted ads on Facebook. This despite having probably raised more money overall. We can't scientifically prove the effect ads have on persuading voters; but it is striking that the Lib Dems, who had a bad election, spent more than the Conservatives, who had a great one. At the same time, the Conservatives paid for a banner ad on newspaper websites and YouTube, meaning at one point anyone in the UK who visited YouTube saw their advert. We don't know how much this cost. But it is a more conventional, broadcast approach to advertising, rather than the hyper-targeted, constituency level ads you get on Facebook. Why might this be? Local Facebook groups have been the battleground for bitter political debate One reason might be that Tories have intuited that people are spending more time within open or closed group discussions - including on Facebook-owned WhatsApp - than scrolling through news feeds. In April, Mark Zuckerberg gave a landmark speech in which he said the internet was moving into a new era where private groups rather than public discussions dominated. And the thing about private groups is that they may be more likely to contain persuadable voters - particularly if the groups weren't set up for explicitly political reasons. Compare with Twitter. Very broadly speaking, Twitter is a news stream proliferated by people of strong opinions who already have a political world view and are likely to know how they'll vote. But a local Facebook group in Morpeth, or Hastings, or some other marginal, which may have been set up to talk about local issues, is more likely to have people who aren't political, and could be swayed. Some of these groups contain several tens of thousands of people - huge numbers in a marginal constituency. And while many journalists wrongly think of Facebook as a rolling news feed above all else, news is in fact a tiny part of Facebook: group discussions are where most of the activity on Facebook happens. Put that together with changes Facebook has made to de-prioritise news and prioritise ""meaningful interactions"" - that is, stuff from friends and family - and you can see why these groups are key to understanding that platform. Extensive reporting by my colleagues at BBC Trending and BBC Monitoring suggests that, during this election, a huge proportion of the national conversation was happening in these often more localised groups, far from public scrutiny. Getting inside these groups may become a priority for the MPs of the future. Sir John Curtice: What's behind the Conservative victory? What were people talking about online? 15 things you may have missed from election night No two Twitter users have the same experience, because all follow different people. But I think Piers Morgan was correct to say ""Twitter loses another election"" last night, though perhaps for more complex reasons than he implied. What he and others believe is that Twitter has a liberal bias, and that it can too often be a chat room for the metropolitan elite. That is my experience too, despite my best and constant attempts to follow people outside - and I use the phrase after long consideration - the London media bubble. If Twitter does seem like it's dominated by journalists from Remain-ish titles, or Corbyn supporters, well, both had a bad night. The main reason that Twitter had a bad election, however, is that it continues to be a handmaiden to appalling abuse and the proliferation of fake news. As a stream, Twitter is great for real-time updates. But so much of what you see is digital sewage, with trolls directing unconscionable abuse at innocent or vulnerable people, and a detection and reporting system that is wholly inadequate. Moreover, when the Conservative Party press account re-branded itself a fact-checking service early in the campaign - a dystopian tactic that was repeated last night - it is striking that it took to Twitter to, in effect, disseminate confusion. Sadly, it is a matter of fact in 2019 that the British party of government looks to Twitter to dupe people. We know that the leaked US-UK trade documents about the NHS appear to have been put into the public domain by accounts originating in Russia - though possibly before the election campaign began. We know that some of the attempts to spread disinformation,for instance around the picture of a four-year-old boy on the floor of a Leeds hospital,came from highly anonymised accounts that bear a discomforting resemblance to previous foreign operations that leant on bots. But it is hard to trace this stuff. A comprehensive audit of digital foreign interference in this election is going to take several months yet. The moment an ITV reporter confronted Boris Johnson with a photo of a sick child on a hospital floor Election campaigns always strain relations between the BBC and the government of the day. The consequences of that are for another blog and day. It is very interesting that many of the most viral clips on social media from the past few weeks were initially broadcast on traditional media. Andrew Neil's monologue about Boris Johnson's refusal to be interviewed by him, followed by an image of an empty chair, is one; Nicky Morgan's difficult interview about nursing numbers on Good Morning Britain, which really took off on Facebook and has had close to 14 million views, is another. And then there was Mr Johnson's interview with an ITV journalist who tried to show him that picture of a boy on a hospital floor. It may be that, for all the talk of linear decline, traditional broadcast media still carries an authority and weight that makes clips from news bulletins or studio programmes more likely to go viral.

"The 2019 election is over, and the Conservatives have won a majority of 80 seats. Here, we answer a selection of readers' questions about the results. About32 million votes were cast in this election.The turnout was 67.3% of registered voters, which represents a 1.5% drop on the 2017 general election. The Conservatives won the most seats - 365 - and also the biggest share of votes, 45%, or about 13.9 million. Labour, who are in second place, have won 203 seats and a 32.2% share, or about 10.3 million votes. The UK's first-past-the-post voting system means the parties with the most votes may not win the most seats. That's because the candidate who gets the most votes in their local constituency wins a seat in the House of Commons. Coming a good second, for example, makes no difference to a party's success nationally. There have been attempts to move the UK to other electoral systems. They include the alternative vote - in which voters rank candidates by order of preference instead of just voting for one. This wasrejected by referendum in 2011. After the UK leaves the European Union (EU), European citizens living in the UK might be asked to prove their right to work or study here, or use the NHS. They'll need to do this by showing they have ""pre-settled status"" or ""settled status"" under the EU settlement scheme, or British citizenship. If you've lived in the UK for less than five years, you'll usually get pre-settled status. You must have started living in the UK by 31 December 2020 (or by the date the UK leaves the EU without a deal). You can ask to change this to settled status once you've got five years' ""continuous residence"". Both mean you can work in the UK, travel in and out of the country and access things like benefits if you're eligible for them. In October, the Home Office said that1.8 million people had applied to the scheme.Currently, EU nationals - and their families,external- are able to apply to the settlement scheme only if they are already living in the UK before it leaves the EU. A total of21 MPs were expelled from the Conservative Partyin early September after rebelling against the prime minister in a bid to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Shortly before the general election was agreed at the end of October,10 of them were readmitted. Six of these stepped down or retired. The other four stood in the election, and all retained their seats. Greg Clark was successful in Tunbridge Wells with a majority of 14,645; Stephen Hammond gained a majority of 628 to win in Wimbledon; Caroline Nokes had a majority of 10,872 as she was re-elected in Romsey and Southampton North; and Steve Brine retained Winchester by 985 votes. Of the 11 who were not readmitted, six stepped down, three stood as independents and two stood for the Lib Dems, but none of them won their seats. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says the timescale for an independent Scotland joining the EU would be ârelatively quick"". As things stand, Scotland is part of the UK, which is due to leave the EU on 31 January. Scotland can't prevent that happening, so it will have to leave, along with Wales, Northern Ireland and England. If Scotland were to hold a second independence referendum in the future - and it chose to leave the union - then the newly independent country could apply to join the EU. However, while it would not be given a place automatically, any application would be ""very seriously"" considered, according to former European Council president Herman Van Rompuy. He told the BBC that Brexit had altered European attitudesto Scottish independence. He said: ""I think there is a change, yes, because for a lot of people they are looking at what Scottish people are in favour of. They want to stay in the European Union and at the same time they are prevented to stay in the European Union."" Last month, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she believed it could be ""relatively quick"" for an independent Scotland to rejoin the EU, although she knew there would be conditions to meet. After several elections where the polls as a whole were not a good guide to the election result, this time they got it right. The final figures in the BBC poll tracker were 43% for the Conservatives, 33% for Labour, 12% for the Lib Dems, 4% for the SNP and 3% each for the Greens and Brexit Party. The actual result across the UK was 44% for the Conservatives, 32% for Labour, 12% for the Lib Dems, 4% for the SNP, 3% for the Greens and 2% for the Brexit Party. That's a very good performance - just a small underestimate of the Conservative share and a slight overestimate of the Labour and Brexit Party shares, with the other parties on the nose. Many of the polling companies had individual polls that were close to the result. But probably first prize goes jointly to Opinium and Ipsos Mori, whose final published polls were almost exactly correct. Furthermore, the polls were also consistently right to point to Conservative strength with Leave-supporting voters.

It repeats Mr Johnson's previous announcement that he would invest ""over Â£14bn in primary and secondary education between now and 2022-23"". However, this figure has been described as ""misleading"", given that it adds up several years of spending increases, and doesn't account for inflation, the change in how much costs increase over time. By 2022-23, spending on schools in England will be Â£7.1bn higher than 2019-20.  This largely reverses the 8% real-terms cuts in spending per pupil that have happened since 2010. The Conservative Party also pledged to create 250,000 extra childcare places in the holidays for primary-school-age children by 2023-24. Those places would cover about 5% of that age group. For those in further and higher education, the manifesto promises to look carefully at the ""thoughtful"" suggestions in the review into student finance and university and college funding. The detailed breakdown of how people voted won't be available until the British Election Study publishes the results of its face-to-face survey in a few months' time. We do know that more than 270,000 people under 35 registered to vote in the first few days after the 2019 election was called.

We also know that in 2017, older people were more likely to vote Conservative.

""With this election I think we put an end to all those miserable threats of a second referendum,"" he said. ""You may only have lent us your vote and you may not think of yourself as a natural Tory... your hand may have quivered over the ballot paper and you may intend to return to Labour next time around and if that is the case, I am humbled that you have put your trust in me and you have put your trust in us, and I and we will never take your support for granted.""

Conservative supporters celebrate victories at the count in Builth Wells The Liberal Democrats were left without a seat after Jane Dodds was ousted by the Conservative Ms Jones, who won the Brecon and Radnorshire seat back for her party just four months after it was lost in a by-election. Ms Jones, who won by 7,131 votes, said she was ""honoured"". Ms Dodds wrote on Twitter: ""I'm not going to lie, last night was a really rough night - not just for me, but for the Liberal Democrats across the UK."" Plaid Cymru's Ben Lake celebrates with his supporters in Ceredigion after increasing his majority Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price defended his party's decision to form a remain pact with others who wanted to stay in the EU. He also attacked Labour for the ""horrendous and indefensible error of trying to sit on the fence"" on Brexit.

Labour's Stephen Kinnock, who held on to his Aberavon seat, said it was a ""disastrous night"" for his party and he was ""shell-shocked and heartbroken"". He blamed Mr Corbyn's ""weak leadership"" and ""deeply damaging decision to back a second referendum"". He added: ""We've had nine long years of the Tories gutting our public services, causing a huge rise in homelessness, and triggering an explosion in child poverty and yet we have suffered a crushing defeat."" Following Labour's poor performance across the UK,Mr Corbyn said he intended to step down as leader. Labour's Tonia Antoniazzi was cheered and heckled during her Gower acceptance speech when she said Brexit voters were ""taken advantage of"". She said the people of Gower had been ""disastrously served by a political shambles that has served to bring the UK into disrepute"". Chris Bryant, who held on to his Labour Rhondda seat, called it the ""worst night for Labour since 1935"". He said his party was now looking at ""being out in the wilderness for even longer"" unless there was ""some serious soul-searching"". Stephen Doughty, who has held the Cardiff South and Penarth seat for seven years, tweeted: ""I fear the future for our younger generation. I fear for the public institutions and integrity of our country. Dark times. Some of us must offer new hope amidst despair."" This video can not be played Chris Bryant said the night was a ""catastrophe"" for the Labour Party Mr Drakeford said that despite Labour's losses in Wales, the results did not change some fundamental issues. ""People in north east Wales need jobs and will need a Welsh Labour Government to defend those jobs and help them with it,"" he said. ""But we will be investing in things which provide housing for people, services for people - those things are important and we have to work harder to communicate those things to people."" But he said although it had been a disappointing night for the party, he did not believe it had alienated voters and Welsh Labour had held a ""whole swathe"" of valleys seats. On the future, he said: ""Brexit is going to happen, I don't think there's any denying that - we will have to work hard to make sure that they [Westminster Government] understand the implications of that for Wales. ""And where there are bad implications - which there will be - they take those into account and take the necessary actions to mitigate the adverse impacts that Brexit will bring to Wales."" The political map of Wales has changed enormously. Aside from the single seat of Alyn & Deeside, Labour has been vanquished from north Wales. The Conservatives are celebrating a return to their high watermark of 1983 when they held 14 seats in Wales, Boris Johnson's Brexit message resonated among Welsh Labour leave voters. But many Welsh Labour sources say Jeremy Corbyn was a major factor in turning off the party's traditional supporters. They will also question the approach of their Welsh leader Mark Drakeford. Should he have done more to ""Welshify"" this election and distinguish Welsh Labour from the UK party? Was that even achievable given the dominance of the two characters of Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson? The Liberal Democrats will rue the day they pushed for this election - their hubris has been mercilessly punished. And Plaid will breathe a big sigh of relief that they hung on to two ultra marginals, and were let off the hook by a split leave vote in Carmarthen East. Coming third in their target seat of Ynys Mon is a blow that leaves them at the status quo of four seats. If you cannot see the graphic clickhere,external.

"Wilde said her opinions ""may differ from others involved with the film"" Olivia Wilde has broken ranks with the makers of her new film, which sparked anger by suggesting the late reporter she plays traded sex for information. The ex-House star plays Kathy Scruggs in Richard Jewell, Clint Eastwood's drama about a media frenzy following the 1996 Atlanta Olympic bombing. The actress said she did not believe Scruggs ""traded sex for tips"", and did not mean to suggest that was the case. But she ""did not have a say in how the film was ultimately crafted"", she said. According to reviews, including inThe Hollywood Reporter,external,the LA Times,externalandthe Associated Press,external, the film strongly implies that Scruggs had sex with an FBI agent played by John Hamm in return for information about a suspect. Scruggs died in 2001 and her old paper, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, has threatened to sue Eastwood and Warner Bros, saying the paper and its staff were ""portrayed in a false and defamatory manner"". Richard Jewell's attorney holding a copy of the Atlanta Journal at a press conference in 1996 Wilde directed this year's acclaimed teen comedy Booksmart as well acting in medical TV drama House and films including Tron: Legacy. In a Twitter thread, she said a director could ""control the voice and message of the film"", but for an actor ""it's more complicated"". Allow Twitter content?

Warner Bros has not responded to Wilde's tweets but has responded to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution letter with a statement insisting the film is based on ""a wide range of highly credible source material"". The studio said it was ""unfortunate and the ultimate irony that the Atlanta Journal Constitution, having been a part of the rush to judgment of Richard Jewell, is now trying to malign our filmmakers and cast"".

"European Council President Charles Michel said member states had different starting points European Union leaders meeting in Brussels have agreed to make the currently 28-member bloc carbon neutral by 2050. However Poland, which is heavily reliant on coal, remains opposed and has been exempted for the time being. European Council President Charles Michel admitted that it was more difficult for some countries and regions to adapt. He said the EU would continue to work to convince Poland to support the deal. Several eastern European countries wanted financial and other guarantees before they agreed to the EU cutting to zero its net amount of greenhouse gas emissions. The Czech Republic and Hungary were brought on board after assurances that nuclear energy could be included in the final mix. Anger as protesters barred from UN climate talks EU aims to be 'climate neutral' by 2050 On Thursday,the EU's new executive unveiled a â¬100bn (Â£84bn; $110bn) European Green Deal,externalfor the net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described it as Europe's ""man on the Moon"" moment. The EU summit came as UN climate talks in Madrid, COP25, were due to wrap up on Friday. There are fears that a final statement of ambition from COP25 may be watered down, with major decisions put off until a key meeting in Glasgow at the end of 2020. After 10 hours of debate, a joint statement from the summit said that the European Council endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050. Greta Thunberg addresses COP25 summit in Madrid Negotiators 'playing politics' amid climate crisis Without naming Poland it said that ""one member state, at this stage, cannot commit to implement this objective"" but said the European Council would return to the issue next June.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he will work ""night and day, flat out"" to prove his backers right Boris Johnson has promised to deliver Brexit and repay the trust of voters after he led the Conservatives to an ""historic"" general election win. The PM, who has met the Queen to ask to form a new government, has a majority of 80 in the House of Commons - the party's largest since 1987. He said he would work ""flat out"" and lead a ""people's government"". Jeremy Corbyn said he would not fight another election as Labour leader, amid recriminations over the party's defeat. He said he was ""very sad"" about the result, adding that he had received ""more personal abuse"" from the media during the campaign than any previous prime ministerial candidate. Labour was swept aside by the Conservatives in its traditional heartlands in the Midlands and north-eastern England, and lost six seats in Wales. LIVE: Updates and reaction as results come in Sir John Curtice: What's behind the Conservative victory? Corbyn: I will not lead Labour at next election Sturgeon: PM has 'no right' to block Indyref2 The Conservatives' victory in the 650th and final contest of the election - the seat of St Ives, in Cornwall - took their total number of MPs up to 365 MPs. Labour finished on 203, the SNP 48, Liberal Democrats 11 and the DUP eight. Sinn Fein has seven MPs, Plaid Cymru four and the SDLP has two. The Green Party and Alliance Party have one each. The Brexit Party - which triumphed in the summer's European Parliament elections - failed to win any Westminster seats. Boris Johnson went to Buckingham Palace to ask the Queen's permission to form a new government The Conservative Party's Commons majority is its largest since Margaret Thatcher won a third term in 1987. Mr Johnson has returned to Downing Street, having visited Buckingham Palace, and is expected to make a statement outside Number 10 this afternoon. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson to step down Full text: Boris Johnson's victory speech Pound and shares surge on election result In his victory speech earlier, he told activists the election result represented a ""new dawn"" for the country.

He said: ""We will get Brexit done on time by 31 January - no ifs, no buts, not maybe."" Johnson's gamble pays off The same prime minister. But a new map. A victory bigger than the Tories, haunted by 2017, had dreamt of. As the hours ticked by, red flipped to blue, familiar faces forced out of their seats. Boris Johnson gambled that he could win an election with support from towns and communities where voting Conservative might almost have seemed a sin. And he won. The Conservatives' majority will have an almost immediate effect on the country - unless something strange happens we will leave the European Union next month because behind him on the green benches will be new Tory MPs who will vote through his Brexit bill, his position strong enough to subdue any opposition. Read Laura's full analysis At 33%, Labour's share of the vote is down around eight points on the 2017 general election and is lower than that achieved by former leader Neil Kinnock in 1992. Some traditional Labour constituencies, such as Darlington, Sedgefield and Workington, in the north of England, will have a Conservative MP for the first time in decades - or, in the case of Bishop Auckland and Blyth Valley, for the first time since the seat was created. Mr Corbyn said his party had put forward a ""manifesto of hope"" but ""Brexit has so polarised debate it has overridden so much of normal political debate"". Jo Swinson was the highest-profile casualty of the night Some within Labour have blamed the party's support for another Brexit referendum and the long-running anti-Semitism row for the election result. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer, regarded as one of the frontrunners to succeed Mr Corbyn, said the result was ""devastating"" and the process of rebuilding the party was a ""very big task"". Jo Swinson has quit as Liberal Democrat leader after losing her Dunbartonshire East seat to the SNP by 149 votes. While she admitted her ""unapologetic"" pro-Remain strategy had not worked, she said she did not regret standing up for her ""liberal values"" and urged the party to ""regroup and refresh"" itself in the face of a ""nationalist surge"" in British politics. In other developments: Sir Ed Davey and Lib Dem president Sal Brinton are taking over as interim leaders of the Lib Dems The Lib Dems took Richmond Park, in south-west London, from Conservative minister Zac Goldsmith, but high-profile former Tory and Labour recruits Chuka Umunna, Luciana Berger and Sam Gyimah all fell short Nigel Dodds, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Partyat Westminster, lost his Belfast North seat to Sinn Fein Labour's Caroline Flint - who backed the Tory Brexit deal in defiance of her party - and the party's longest-serving MP, Dennis Skinner, were among high-profile opposition figures to be defeated Remain-backing former Tory minister Dominic Grieve came second to the Conservative candidate in Beaconsfield Anna Soubry, who quit the Tories to form a pro-Remain group of MPs, lost her Nottinghamshire seat to the Tories, as did the other members of The Independent Group for Change Nigel Farage said his Brexit Partyhad taken votes from Labour in Tory target seats, although he himself had spoiled his ballot paper ""as I could not bring myself to vote Conservative"". Scottish National Party leader and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it had been an ""exceptional"" result for her party. She said Scotland had sent a ""very clear message"" that it did not want a Boris Johnson Conservative government and the prime minister did not have a mandate to take Scotland out of the EU. It was also a ""strong endorsement"" for Scotland having a choice over its own future in another independence referendum, she added. US President Donald Trump congratulated Mr Johnson on a ""great win"" and the EU's top official, Charles Michel said he hoped Parliament would approve the Brexit withdrawal treaty agreed in October as ""soon as possible"". Katya Adler: EU prepares for Brexit hardball after Johnson win The legislation paving the way for Brexit on 31 January is due to come before the new Parliament for the first time next Friday. There is expected to be a minor cabinet reshuffle on Monday, to fill vacant positions such as Welsh and culture secretaries. A more thorough reshaping is likely to be put on hold until February, after the UK has left the EU, with a Budget statement in March. What is your question about the election results?

"This video can not be played ""We are going to unite and level up"" - Boris Johnson speaks outside Downing Street Boris Johnson has said he hopes his party's ""extraordinary"" election win will bring ""closure"" to the Brexit debate and ""let the healing begin"". Speaking in Downing Street, he said he would seek to repay the trust placed in him by Labour supporters who had voted Conservative for the first time. He said he would not ignore those who opposed Brexit as he builds with Europe a partnership ""of sovereign equals"". The Tories have won a Commons majority of 80, the party's largest since 1987. It means the UK is heading out of the EU at the end of next month, the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said, with Mr Johnson's ""thumping"" majority allowing him to get the laws required through Parliament ""in a matter of weeks"". The Conservatives' victory in the 650th and final contest of the election - the seat of St Ives, in Cornwall - took their total number of MPs up to 365. Labour finished on 203, the SNP 48, Liberal Democrats 11 and the DUP eight. Live: Reaction to Tory election victory Sir John Curtice: What's behind the Conservative victory? Corbyn: 'I did everything I could' Sturgeon: PM has 'no right' to block Indyref2 Sinn Fein has seven MPs, Plaid Cymru four and Northern Ireland's SDLP has two. The Green Party and NI's Alliance Party have one each. The Brexit Party - which triumphed in the summer's European Parliament elections - failed to win any Westminster seats. The Conservatives swept aside Labour in its traditional heartlands in the Midlands and the north of England and picked up seats across Wales, while holding off the Lib Dem challenge in many seats in the south of England. Voter turnout overall, on a cold and damp polling day, was 67.3%, which is down by 1.5% on the 2017 total. Speaking outside No 10, Mr Johnson thanked lifelong Labour supporters who deserted Jeremy Corbyn's party and turned to the Conservatives, saying he would fulfil his pledge to take the UK out of the EU on 31 January. ""I say thank you for the trust you have placed in us and in me and we will work round the clock to repay your trust and to deliver on your priorities with a Parliament that works for you"". This video can not be played Election 2019: The story of the night as the results came in Mr Johnson, who earlier accepted the Queen's invitation to form a government, also addressed those who did not vote for the Conservatives and still want to remain in the EU. ""We in this One Nation Conservative government will never ignore your good and positive feelings of warmth and sympathy towards the other nations of Europe,"" he said. Mr Johnson's focus on the one nation pitch suggests he will seek to offer policies to people beyond the Tory heartlands - more public spending, for example, after years of austerity, the BBC's political correspondent Nick Eardley said. He added that there is no strict definition of one nation conservatism, ""but broadly, it refers to the idea the Conservative Party should act for everybody in the UK. That means policies that work for people from different economic backgrounds, from different regions and from the different nations of the UK."" When they return to Westminster next week, MPs are due to begin the process of considering legislation paving the way for the UK to leave on 31 January. Talks about a future trade and security relationship will begin almost immediately. Nevertheless, Mr Johnson said the UK ""deserves a break from wrangling, a break from politics and a permanent break from talking about Brexit"".

Senior Labour figures have sought to defend the party's strategy, arguing that many of its policies were popular but that Brexit had crowded out all other issues for many voters. Wes Streeting, the newly elected MP for Ilford North, said the party's ""far left"" manifesto had jarred with the electorate and blaming Brexit was an attempt to ""kneecap"" credible centrist candidates such as Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry. Meanwhile, Jo Swinson has quit as Liberal Democrat leaderafter losing her Dunbartonshire East seat to the SNP by 149 votes. While she admitted her ""unapologetic"" pro-Remain strategy had not worked, she said she did not regret standing up for her ""liberal values"" and urged the party to ""regroup and refresh"" itself in the face of a ""nationalist surge"" in British politics. After the SNP's ""overwhelming"" election victory, which saw the party win 48 of Scotland's 59 seats, Nicola Sturgeon said Mr Johnson had ""no right"" to stand in the way of another Scottish independence referendum. However, the prime minister later spoke to the first minister by phone on Friday evening, with Downing Street saying he had told her he ""remained opposed"" to a second vote. Mr Johnson was also said to have insisted that the result of the 2014 referendum ""should be respected"" after ""reiterating his unwavering commitment"" to the union.

"Boris Johnson has delivered his first speech after his Conservative party won a landslide majority in the December 2019 general election, at the Queen Elizabeth II Centre in central London. You can read the full text of the speech below. Well my friends, good morning everybody. My friends, well we did it. We did it. We pulled it off didn't we - we pulled it off, we broke the deadlock, we ended the gridlock, we smashed the roadblock. In this glorious, glorious pre-breakfast moment, before a new dawn rises on a new day and a new government, I want first of all to pay tribute to good colleagues who lost their seats through no fault of their own in the elections just gone by. And I of course want to congratulate absolutely everybody involved in securing the biggest Conservative majority since the 1980s. This was literally, literally, as I look around, literally before many of you were born. And with this mandate and this majority, we will at last be able to do - what? (Audience: ""Get Brexit done"".) You were paying attention. This election means that getting Brexit done is now the irrefutable, irresistible, unarguable decision of the British people. With this election I think we've put an end to all those miserable threats of a second referendum. And I say respectfully to our stentorian friend in the blue, 12-star hat - that's it. Time to put a sock in the megaphone, and give everybody some peace. This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he will work ""night and day, flat out"" to prove his backers right I have a message to all those who voted for us yesterday, especially for those who voted for us Conservatives for the first time. You may only have lent us your vote, you may not think of yourself as a natural Tory. As I think I said 11 years ago to the people of London, when I was elected in what was thought of as a Labour city - your hand may have quivered over the ballot paper before you put your cross in the Conservative box, and you may intend to return to Labour next time round. If that is the case, I am humbled that you have put your trust in me and you have put your trust in us. I, and we, will never take your support for granted. I will make it my mission to work night and day, to work flat-out to prove you right in voting for me this time, and to earn your support in the future. I say to you that in this election your voice has been heard - and about time too. Because we politicians have squandered the last three-and-a-half years in squabbles about Brexit, we have even been arguing about arguing, about the tone of our arguments. I will put an end to all that nonsense and we will get Brexit done on time by the 31 January. No ifs, no buts, no maybes - leaving the European Union as one United Kingdom, taking back control of our laws, borders, money, our trade, immigration system, delivering on the democratic mandate of the people. At the same time, this one nation Conservative government will massively increase our investment in the NHS. The health service that represents the very best of our country with a single beautiful idea, that whoever we are - rich, poor, young, old - the NHS is there for us when we are sick. And everyday that service performs miracles. That is why the NHS is this one nation Conservative government's top priority. So we will deliver 50,000 more nurses, and 50 million more GP surgery appointments. And how many new hospitals? (Audience: ""40"".) We will deliver a long-term NHS budget enshrined in law, Â£650m extra every week. And all the other priorities that you, the people of this country, voted for. Record spending on schools. An Australian-style points-based immigration system. More police - how many? (Audience: ""20,000"".) Colossal new investments in infrastructure and science, using our technological advantages to make this country the cleanest, greenest on earth, with the most far-reaching environmental programme. And you the people of this country voted to be carbon-neutral in this election - you voted to be carbon-neutral by 2050. And we'll do it. You also voted to be Corbyn-neutral by Christmas by the way, and we'll do that too. You voted for all these things, and it is now this government, this people's government, it is now our solemn duty to deliver on each and every one of those commitments. It is a great and heavy responsibility, a sacred trust, for me, for every newly-elected Conservative MP, for everyone in this room and everyone in this party. And I repeat that in winning this election we have won the votes and trust of people who have never voted Conservative before, and people who have always voted for other parties. Those people want change. We cannot, must not - must not - let them down. In delivering change we must change too. We must recognise the incredible reality that we now speak as a One Nation Conservative party literally for everyone from Woking to Workington; from Kensington, I'm proud to say, to Clwyd South; from Surrey Heath to Sedgefield; from Wimbledon to Wolverhampton. As the nation hands us this historic mandate, we must rise to the challenge and to the level of expectations. Parliament must change so that we in parliament are working for you, the British people. That is what we will now do, isn't it? That is what we will now do. Let's get out and get on with it. Let's unite this country. Let's spread opportunity to every corner of the UK with superb education, superb infrastructure, and technology. Let's get Brexit done. But first, my friends, let's get breakfast done. Thank you all very much for coming. Thank you all very much. Johnson: I will repay the trust of voters Johnson 'humbled' by support of electorate.

""The United Kingdom and the EU should be relieved that the turmoil of a minority government and a parliamentary blockade are finally over.

First is there will be an election in the Republic of Ireland in February or early Marchâ¦ Second is that the Democratic Unionist Party is surplus to requirements. They must join Sinn FÃ©in in getting over themselves to make power-sharing in Belfast work again after three years of shameful idleness."" Once the EU-UK draft divorce deal agreed in October becomes law in London and Brussels, he says, talks will open on a new post-Brexit trade deal. ""Every time the UK talks about abandoning EU standards, they risk being penalised by quotas and tariffs. That would be really bad news for Ireland which does a cumulative east-west trade worth â¬1.5bn (Â£1.25bn; $1.68bn) per week.

"This video can not be played Jo Swinson lost her seat in Dunbartonshire East to the SNP Jo Swinson will step down as Liberal Democrat leader after losing her seat to the SNP by 149 votes. Ms Swinson, who started the campaign saying she could become the next prime minister, gained 19,523 votes compared with 19,672 for the SNP's Amy Callaghan in Dunbartonshire East. Sir Ed Davey and Baroness Sal Brinton will be acting co-leaders for the party, now she is no longer an MP. Ms Swinson said the election results would bring ""dismay"" for many. She said she was ""proud that Liberal Democrats were the unapologetic voice of Remain"" in the election, adding that she did ""not regret trying everything"" to avoid Brexit.

News of Ms Swinson's defeat was cheered by Nicola Sturgeon, who was caught on camera celebrating the SNP's victory in Dunbartonshire East. The SNP leader, who was waiting to speak to Sky News when the election result was read out, could be seen cheering as she found out that Ms Callaghan had won the seat. Ms Sturgeon later offered her commiserations to Ms Swinson on a personal level, but said she was delighted by the SNP's performance. Nicola Sturgeon celebrates the SNP's win in Dunbartonshire East Baroness Brinton, president of the Liberal Democrats and the new co-leader, said it was a ""disappointing night"" for the party. ""The voices of nationalism and populism both north and south of the border beat both her [Ms Swinson] in her seat and nationally as well."" She said there were some ""nuggets of gold"" the party could take from the election, such as increasing its share of the vote by 4.2% and getting ""some good new MPs"". ""All is not lost,"" she added, pledging that the party's MPs would ""continue to fight, if not for our place in Europe, then for the best deal possible"". Earlier, Baroness Brinton thanked Ms Swinson, who only became Lib Dem leader in July, for what she called her honest and fearless leadership of their party. This video can not be played Government minister Zac Goldsmith loses Richmond Park to Lib Dems The Liberal Democrats entered this election buoyed by a revival in the polls and the addition to their ranks of numerous MPs who defected from other parties, including Chuka Umunna and Luciana Berger from Labour, and the former Tory minister Sam Gyimah. All three, however, were defeated. Earlier, Sir John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, said the polls suggested the party's support declined during the election and indicated that the strongly anti-Brexit party did not make any progress at all among Leave voters. On the night, the Conservatives won a big majority and the SNP took 48 of Scotland's 59 seats, as Labour suffered heavy losses.

The SNP's Ms Callaghan told BBC Scotland she was ""delighted"" to have unseated the Liberal Democrat leader.

She had served as a minister in the coalition government and was among the party's MPs who paid the price for the tie-up with David Cameron's Tories in the 2015 election - which saw the Lib Dems reduced to a rump of just eight in the Commons. Ms Swinson fought back when then Prime Minister Theresa May called another election in 2017, and she regained her Scottish seat from the SNP. She attracted criticism from some quarters for her policy to revoke Article 50 and cancel Brexit, and for her previous record in the coalition government. TheLib Dems backed Boris Johnson's call in October for an early election, arguing it was the best way of stopping Brexit.

A number of commentators had called 32-year-old Laura Pidcock a future leader of the Labour Party. But she lost her seat of Durham North West to the Conservatives. In 2017, her majority was more than 8,000. But this time around, the Tory candidate, Richard Holden, won the vote by 1,144. Ms Pidcock, who previously worked for campaign group Show Racism The Red Card, was recently tipped as a successor to deputy Labour leader Tom Watson and is a long-term ally to Jeremy Corbyn. Her maiden speech criticising Commons traditions and hitting out at inequality was widely shared, while she has also spoken out about the environment - particularly since she became a mother in 2018. David Gauke - justice secretary and work and pensions secretary in Mrs May's government - is another big name to lose his seat overnight. He played a major role in both David Cameron and Mrs May's Conservative governments. Like Mr Grieve, Mr Gauke was kicked out by Mr Johnson for trying to stop a no-deal Brexit in the Commons earlier this year. He ran as an independent in his seat of Hertfordshire South West and gained a lot of praise for his amusing Twitter videos throughout the campaign. However, it wasn't enough, and while he secured almost 16,000 votes, his Tory successor, Gagan Mohindra, took more than 30,000. Veteran Labour MP Dennis Skinnerlost the seat of Bolsover to the Conservatives- with a swing of 11.5% away from Labour. Mr Skinner had held the Derbyshire constituency since 1970. Following Ken Clarke's decision to step down as an MP at this election, Mr Skinner was in line to become the Father of the House - but that mantle now falls to Tory MP Peter Bottomley. Former Conservative MPAnna Soubry, now leader of the Independent Group for Change, lost her Broxtowe seat in Nottinghamshire. She mustered only 4,668 votes and did not come close to challenging her Conservative successor, Darren Henry. Ex-Labour shadow cabinet ministerChuka Umunna, who was standing for the Lib Dems in the Cities of London and Westminster seat (where Boris Johnson cast his vote) also lost. He had been an MP since 2010. Luciana Bergertook a similar pre-election path to Mr Umunna - quitting Labour, joining the Independent Group for Change, before joining the Lib Dems. However, the Conservative's Mike Freer defeated her in Finchley and Golders Green. Elsewhere, former Labour ministerCaroline Flintwas defeated by the Conservative's Nick Fletcher in Don Valley, South Yorkshire, a seat Ms Flint held since 1997. AndAnne Milton- one of the 11 Tory MPs who had the Tory whip withdrawn by Boris Johnson and never returned - also lost.

"This video can not be played Election 2019: Corbyn 'will not lead party in future campaign' Jeremy Corbyn has said he will not lead Labour into the next election, following a ""very disappointing night"". With one seat left to declare, the party has won 203 seats. Mr Corbyn said he would stay on as leader during a ""process of reflection"", and said Brexit had ""polarised"" politics which had ""overridden normal political debate"". But others within Labour, including former MPs who lost their seats, blamed Mr Corbyn's leadership. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Corbyn was not intending to resign and it could take until April for a leadership contest to take place. On the night, the Conservatives won a big majority, sweeping aside Labour strongholds across northern England, the Midlands and Wales in areas which backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum. Some traditional Labour constituencies, such as Darlington, Sedgefield and Workington, in the north of England, will have a Conservative MP for the first time in decades - or in the case of Bishop Auckland and Blyth Valley - for the first time since the seat was created. At 33%, Labour's share of the vote is down around eight points on the 2017 general election and is lower than that achieved by Neil Kinnock in 1992. LIVE: Updates and reaction as results come in,external Tories take Labour seats as they head for majority Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson loses seat Speaking at his election count in Islington North, where he was re-elected with a reduced majority, Mr Corbyn said Labour had put forward a ""manifesto of hope"" and criticised the ""way the media behaved"" towards his party during the campaign. But he added: ""Brexit has so polarised and divided debate in this country, it has overridden so much of a normal political debate."" ""I recognise that has contributed to the results that the Labour Party has received this evening all across this country."" Labour primarily campaigned on a promise to end austerity by increasing spending on public services. The party also promised to renegotiate Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit deal, and then put it to a referendum vote alongside the option of remaining in the EU. That strategy was criticised by party chairman Ian Lavery, who said it had led voters in traditional Labour seats to believe it was ""a Remain party"". ""They believe they should have been listened to - and they think that the Labour party have totally reneged on the result,"" he said. But he added the strategy was not ""Jeremy Corbyn's decision"", as it had beenapproved by delegatesat the party's September conference. Former Labour MP John Mann said the leader's unpopularity on the doorstep was palpable and Mr Corbyn should have ""gone already"". Others have blamed the party's support for another Brexit referendum and the long-running anti-Semitism row. Margaret Hodge, MP for Barking, said Labour had become the ""nasty party"". Given the result, you might assume Jeremy Corbyn would swiftly fall on his sword - but he has instead called for a period of quiet reflection. Party rules make it difficult to oust him, but already senior figures are asking how long this period will last. Senior figures at Westminster and in local government feel delaying an inevitable leadership contest will lead to a similar result in May's council elections. Mr Corbyn seems intent on staying in place until someone from his wing of the party is ready to take over - but the defeat of shadow minister Laura Pidcock has eliminated one of the potential left-wing leadership challengers. Those who would prefer shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer are keen that a new leader is in place soon to challenge Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit policy. The battle to establish the reasons for the defeat has already begun. The narrative from the leadership that Brexit was to blame will be challenged robustly by those who want the party to change direction. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell, a key ally of Mr Corbyn, said he was ""heartbroken"" at the result and insisted he would not take on the party leadership temporarily. ""At some stage we'll go into a leadership election,"" he said. ""Jeremy wants to ensure there is a period of reflection."" Earlier, he said he did not think the Labour leader had been ""the big issue"" of the campaign. But former Labour justice secretary Lord Falconer called for the party to move quickly to replace Mr Corbyn as leader by March or April.

Elsewhere in the city, Ruth Smeeth, who lost her Stoke-on-Trent North seat to the Conservatives, described the election result as ""devastating"". ""For me, this is about whether the Labour Party has any right to exist [and] whether we have anything left to say,"" she said. Another Labour MP to lose her seat, Caroline Flint in Don Valley, said: ""So many of my voters could not and did not want to support Jeremy Corbyn to be prime minister."" She added: ""There are moderate MPs who have driven us into a dead-end regarding Brexit and they have put the pursuit of Remain at the expense of our working-class heartlands and I feel annoyed, to say the least, about that."" This video can not be played Labour candidate Gareth Snell calls for Jeremy Corbyn to step down Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, speaking after holding his Holborn and St Pancras seat, said: ""As a whole movement, we need to reflect on this result and understand it together, but we also have a duty to rebuild, starting now."" Yvette Cooper, who unsuccessfully challenged Mr Corbyn for her party's leadership in 2015, said the results showed Labour has ""to change as a party"". She said Brexit had played a ""significant part"" in her party's performance, but the election ""was not just about Brexit"". ""It was about their perceptions of the party, their perceptions of the leadership,"" she added. Speaking after an earlier exit poll predicted heavy losses for Labour, former Labour home secretary Alan Johnson told ITV News that Mr Corbyn had been ""incapable of leading"" and ""worse than useless at all the qualities you need to lead a political party."" Polling expert Professor Sir John Curtice said: ""It was clear that lots of Remain voters had doubts about Jeremy Corbyn's ability to handle Brexit and indeed, more broadly to handle anything."" In a statement, the Jewish Labour Movement - affiliated to the party for a century and representing about 2,500 members - said Labour's failure ""lies squarely with the party's leadership"". ""Because of the public's rejection of Corbyn as prime minister, the confused position on Brexit, or its total failure to tackle anti-Jewish racism, the party must truly listen,"" the statement said.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""There is no such thing as Corbynism"" Jeremy Corbyn says he did ""everything he could"" to get Labour into power and will not ""walk away"" until another leader is elected. The Labour leader said the election, which saw the Conservatives sweep aside his party in its traditional heartlands, was ""taken over by Brexit"". Mr Corbyn said he was ""obviously very sad"" but also had ""pride"" in themanifestohis party put forward. Some people within Labour have blamed Mr Corbyn's leadership for the defeat. Former Labour MP John Mann said the leader's unpopularity on the doorstep was palpable and Mr Corbyn should have ""gone already"" after presiding over his party's worst election performance since the 1930s. Lord Blunkett, a former Labour cabinet minister, called for the party leadership to apologise for the defeat, adding that they were ""lacking in any contrite belief that they made a mistake"". At 33%, Labour's share of the vote was down around eight points on the 2017 general election and is lower than that achieved by Neil Kinnock in 1992. LIVE: Updates and reaction as Tories win majority,external Let the healing begin, urges PM after poll win Does Labour need a new direction after Corbyn? Mr Corbyn said it was up to the National Executive, the ruling body of the party, to decide when he would go, adding it was likely a new leader would be selected in the early part of next year. He said he would not step down as leader yet because the ""responsible thing to do is not to walk away from the whole thing"". Asked whether he was part of the problem, he said: ""I've done everything I could to lead this partyâ¦ and since I became leader the membership has more than doubled and the party has developed a very serious, radical yes, but serious and fully-costed manifesto"". Keir Starmer, one of the favourites to be the new leader, says it's ""a big task"" to rebuild Labour Keir Starmer, one of the favourites to replace Mr Corbyn as leader, said there was ""no hiding"" from the election result which was ""devastating for our party"". He said it was the party's duty to ""rebuild"" which was going to be ""a very big task"". Asked if he wanted to be the next leader, he said: ""I think this is the time for reflecting and understanding the result. I don't underestimate the size of the task ahead."" Unite union boss Len McCluskey, an influential Labour ally, said the result was ""deeply, deeply disappointing"" and the party had ""failed"" because it had tried ""to go beyond Brexit"". In an article for theHuffington Post,external, he blamed Labour's poor election performance on Jeremy Corbyn's ""failure to apologise for anti-Semitism"" and an ""incontinent rush of policies which appeared to offer everything to everyone immediately"". He did praise Mr Corbyn's ""right and honourable"" decision to adopt a neutral stance in a future Brexit referendum, but said the strategy was ""fatally undermined from the outset by leading members of the shadow cabinet rushing to the TV cameras to pledge that they would support Remain"". This video can not be played Stephen Kinnock: Election was a Labour loss, not a Tory win Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, meanwhile, was adamant it was ""not a Tory victory"" but ""a damning indictment of Labour's failure"". Speaking on BBC's Question Time, he said the party's loosening ties to its working class heartlands had been ""turbo charged by Brexit"". Shadow cabinet member Barry Gardiner said his party needed to reflect on ""what was wrong in the offer that we put forward to the country and what it was people did not feel confident about in our manifesto"". He told BBC Radio 4's Any Questions that Labour needed to move fast to regain the trust of the country.

IN PICTURES:Binface, a baby and Boris Johnson The Conservatives took Labour strongholds across northern England, the Midlands and Wales in areas which backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum. Some traditional Labour constituencies, such as Darlington, Sedgefield and Workington, in the north of England, have a Conservative MP for the first time in decades - or in the case of Bishop Auckland and Blyth Valley - for the first time since the seat was created. Mr Corbyn was re-elected with a reduced majority of 26,188 as the MP for Islington North. A brutal leadership battle is almost inevitable. The likely candidates are keeping their powder dry, but skirmishes have begun over the reasons for Labour's lowest tally of seats since the 1930s. Those close to Jeremy Corbyn blamed Brexit, media hostilityâ¦ even the weather. The party chairman Ian Lavery singled out the party's commitment to a second referendum. And Laura Parker from the left-wing grassroots group, Momentum, insisted Jeremy Corbyn was the victim of unfortunate political timing. Read more analysis from the BBC's political correspondent. Reflecting on his party's defeat, My Corbyn said: ""My whole strategy was to reach out beyond the Brexit divide to try and bring people together because ultimately the country has to come together."" The party promised to renegotiate Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit deal, and put it to a referendum vote alongside the option of remaining in the EU. Asked what went wrong for the party, he said: ""Those in Leave areas, in some numbers, voted for Brexit or Conservative candidates which meant that we lost a number of seats and we didn't make the gains that I'd hoped we could have done"". Asked whether ""Corbynism"" is now dead, he said: ""There is no such thing as Corbyninsmâ¦ there is socialism."" He added: ""I don't think [socialist ideas] are unelectable."" Mr Corbyn said his party's policies were individually ""very popular"" and there was no ""huge debate"" about them within the party.

Speaking about his party's handling of the issue, the Labour leader said: ""I inherited a system that didn't work in the Labour party on anti-Semitism, I introduced the rule changes necessary to deal with it and they're in operation. ""Anti-Semitism is an absolute evil curse within our society and I will always condemn it and also do and always will"".

"Boris Johnson has delivered his first speech after his Conservative party won a landslide majority in the December 2019 general election, at the Queen Elizabeth II Centre in central London. You can read the full text of the speech below. Well my friends, good morning everybody. My friends, well we did it. We did it. We pulled it off didn't we - we pulled it off, we broke the deadlock, we ended the gridlock, we smashed the roadblock. In this glorious, glorious pre-breakfast moment, before a new dawn rises on a new day and a new government, I want first of all to pay tribute to good colleagues who lost their seats through no fault of their own in the elections just gone by. And I of course want to congratulate absolutely everybody involved in securing the biggest Conservative majority since the 1980s. This was literally, literally, as I look around, literally before many of you were born. And with this mandate and this majority, we will at last be able to do - what? (Audience: ""Get Brexit done"".) You were paying attention. This election means that getting Brexit done is now the irrefutable, irresistible, unarguable decision of the British people. With this election I think we've put an end to all those miserable threats of a second referendum. And I say respectfully to our stentorian friend in the blue, 12-star hat - that's it. Time to put a sock in the megaphone, and give everybody some peace. This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he will work ""night and day, flat out"" to prove his backers right I have a message to all those who voted for us yesterday, especially for those who voted for us Conservatives for the first time. You may only have lent us your vote, you may not think of yourself as a natural Tory. As I think I said 11 years ago to the people of London, when I was elected in what was thought of as a Labour city - your hand may have quivered over the ballot paper before you put your cross in the Conservative box, and you may intend to return to Labour next time round. If that is the case, I am humbled that you have put your trust in me and you have put your trust in us. I, and we, will never take your support for granted. I will make it my mission to work night and day, to work flat-out to prove you right in voting for me this time, and to earn your support in the future. I say to you that in this election your voice has been heard - and about time too. Because we politicians have squandered the last three-and-a-half years in squabbles about Brexit, we have even been arguing about arguing, about the tone of our arguments. I will put an end to all that nonsense and we will get Brexit done on time by the 31 January. No ifs, no buts, no maybes - leaving the European Union as one United Kingdom, taking back control of our laws, borders, money, our trade, immigration system, delivering on the democratic mandate of the people. At the same time, this one nation Conservative government will massively increase our investment in the NHS. The health service that represents the very best of our country with a single beautiful idea, that whoever we are - rich, poor, young, old - the NHS is there for us when we are sick. And everyday that service performs miracles. That is why the NHS is this one nation Conservative government's top priority. So we will deliver 50,000 more nurses, and 50 million more GP surgery appointments. And how many new hospitals? (Audience: ""40"".) We will deliver a long-term NHS budget enshrined in law, Â£650m extra every week. And all the other priorities that you, the people of this country, voted for. Record spending on schools. An Australian-style points-based immigration system. More police - how many? (Audience: ""20,000"".) Colossal new investments in infrastructure and science, using our technological advantages to make this country the cleanest, greenest on earth, with the most far-reaching environmental programme. And you the people of this country voted to be carbon-neutral in this election - you voted to be carbon-neutral by 2050. And we'll do it. You also voted to be Corbyn-neutral by Christmas by the way, and we'll do that too. You voted for all these things, and it is now this government, this people's government, it is now our solemn duty to deliver on each and every one of those commitments. It is a great and heavy responsibility, a sacred trust, for me, for every newly-elected Conservative MP, for everyone in this room and everyone in this party. And I repeat that in winning this election we have won the votes and trust of people who have never voted Conservative before, and people who have always voted for other parties. Those people want change. We cannot, must not - must not - let them down. In delivering change we must change too. We must recognise the incredible reality that we now speak as a One Nation Conservative party literally for everyone from Woking to Workington; from Kensington, I'm proud to say, to Clwyd South; from Surrey Heath to Sedgefield; from Wimbledon to Wolverhampton. As the nation hands us this historic mandate, we must rise to the challenge and to the level of expectations. Parliament must change so that we in parliament are working for you, the British people. That is what we will now do, isn't it? That is what we will now do. Let's get out and get on with it. Let's unite this country. Let's spread opportunity to every corner of the UK with superb education, superb infrastructure, and technology. Let's get Brexit done. But first, my friends, let's get breakfast done. Thank you all very much for coming. Thank you all very much. Johnson: I will repay the trust of voters Johnson 'humbled' by support of electorate.

"SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon was in buoyant mood as she arrived at the Glasgow count The SNP has made big gains across Scotland, with Nicola Sturgeon saying the country had sent a ""clear message"" on a second independence referendum. The party won 48 seats after securing 45% of the vote -  8.1% more than in the last general election in 2017, when it won 35 seats. The SNP alsodefeated Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinsonin East Dunbartonshire. Ms Sturgeon said the result had exceeded her expectations. The Conservatives have won six seats, the Liberal Democrats four and Labour one. Neale Hanvey'svictory in Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeathis counted as an SNP gain from Labour because he was on the ballot paper as an SNP candidate. Mr Hanvey had been suspended by the party over allegations he made anti-Semitic posts on social media, and will sit as an independent MP. After 59 of 59 seats The Conservatives and Prime Minister Boris Johnson havewon an overall majority across the UKafter taking a string of former Labour strongholds in England and Wales. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was a ""very disappointing night for the Labour Party"" and confirmed he would not lead the party into the next election. The other main developments from Scotland's election night include: Liberal Democrat leaderJo Swinson narrowly lost her Dunbartonshire East seatto the SNP by just 149 votes Scottish Labour'sIan Murray held on to his seat in Edinburgh Southas his party lost all of its other MPs. TheSNP's Stephen Gethins lost to the Liberal Democratsin the UK's narrowest marginal seat, Fife North East. After 59 of 59 seats After 59 of 59 seats Ms Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, had already pledged to send a letter to the prime minister before Christmas requesting that Holyrood be given the power to hold indyref2. Speaking at the Glasgow count, she said she would not pretend that everyone who voted for her party will necessarily support independence. But she said it was a ""clear endorsement Scotland should get to decide our future and not have it decided for us"". Live updates on the Scottish general election results Tories win overall majority in general election Corbyn: I will not lead Labour at next election Ms Sturgeon added: ""Scotland has sent a very clear message - we don't want a Boris Johnson government, we don't want to leave the EU. ""The results across the rest of the UK are grim but underlines the importance of Scotland having a choice. ""Boris Johnson has a mandate to take England out of the EU but he must accept that I have a mandate to give Scotland a choice for an alternative future."" Nicola Sturgeon says she won't pretend that every single person who voted SNP necessarily supports independence. But she will insist this result is a thumping endorsement of her demand for a second referendum. She will make an official request in the next few days to be granted the legal power to hold an independence vote. And we know that Boris Johnson will refuse, sparking a huge debate about whether the Conservatives are ignoring the democratic choice of Scottish voters. It's a debate that can only escalate as we leave the EU - and one which may fuel support for independence itself. Scotland on a constitutional collision course Scottish Secretary Alister Jack, who held Dumfries and Galloway for the Conservatives, said more people cast votes for unionist parties in Scotland than for the SNP. And he was adamant the prime minister should continue to block Ms Sturgeon's calls for power to hold an independence ballot. The Conservative vote had fallen by 3.5% to 25.1% across Scotland, while the Labour vote was down by 8.5% to 18.6%. The Liberal Democrat vote actually increased by 2.8% to 9.5% despite the loss of the party's leader. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""I have a mandate to offer that choice"" Rutherglen and Hamilton West was the first Scottish constituency to declare its result at 01:25, with Margaret Ferrier - who previously held the seat between 2015 and 2017 - polling 23,775 votes, giving her a majority of 5,230 over her Labour rival Ged Killen. That early success was quickly followed by the SNP's David Doogan defeating Conservative Kirstene Hair in Angus. John Nicolson won the Ochil and South Perthshire seat after defeating Luke Graham of the Conservatives, while the SNP also won back Midlothian from Labour's Danielle Rowley, The SNP's Mhairi Black comfortably held her Paisley and Renfrewshire South seat with a greatly increased majority, while Kenny MacAskill, the former Scottish justice secretary, won the East Lothian seat from Labour. This video can not be played Jo Swinson lost her seat in Dunbartonshire East to the SNP SNP MEP Alyn Smith won Stirling from Stephen Kerr of the Conservatives, but Scottish Secretary Alister Jack held Dumfries and Galloway for the Tories. Douglas Ross also held his Moray seat for the Conservatives, while his colleague David Mundell held Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale. The SNP's Stephen Gethins lost by 1,316 votes to Wendy Chamberlain of the Liberal Democrats in Fife North East. Mr Gethins had won the seat by just two votes in 2017. And Labour's Ian Murray held on in Edinburgh South, meaning he is the party's only MP in Scotland. Mr Murray, a longstanding critic of Mr Corbyn, warned that his party's ideology must change or else it will ""die"" and said voters he spoke to on the doorsteps during this campaign did not see Mr Corbyn as prime minister and could not see Labour as a credible alternative government.

The SNP are once again the undoubted winners of the night, taking a slew of seats from their opponents including a big scalp in the form of Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson. The party haven't had it all their own way - running up against Tory resistance in a few seats and losing North East Fife to the Lib Dems - but Nicola Sturgeon's team have piled on thousands of votes in every seat and have already secured a landslide. Labour, meanwhile, have collapsed across Scotland, with their share of the vote down sharply. They even lost the shadow Scottish secretary, Lesley Laird, to a candidate disowned by the SNP and who will sit as an independent. The Conservatives have clinched victory UK-wide, but have lost a clutch of Scottish seats to the SNP - and will be wondering what this means for their campaign to ""stop indyref2"". The Lib Dem vote share is up in most places, but any progress will be massively overshadowed by the loss of Ms Swinson. The party's leader has just gone from touting herself as a future prime minister to losing her seat for the second time in four years.

Leave-voting former mining towns like Workington, which wasseen as representative of the votersparties needed to win over, backed the Tories. Tony Blair's former constituency of Sedgefield went blue, as did West Bromwich East, vacated by former Labour deputy leader Tom Watson. The Conservatives carved a path from Greater Manchester to Lincolnshire, the Black Country to Northumberland, as Labour strongholds fell. Some of these seats have not had a Tory MP in decades, and in the case of Burnley it had been more than a century. Bolsover inDerbyshire, which has been Labour since it was created in 1950 and Dennis Skinner's seat since 1970, confirmed Boris Johnson's Commons majority at just after 05:00 GMT. Can't see the map?Click here,external By David Pittam, BBC News Dennis Skinner was not present at the overnight count in his Derbyshire constituency, having recently undergone hip surgery. His absence held a sad irony, given that he has been very much an ever-present in British politics for the best part of five decades. Like him or loathe him, his memorable public image - the famous finger, the voice raised above the Commons cacophony - struck a chord with many. So what changed? Read how the Beast of Bolsover was beaten. Things began to unravel at about 23:30 withBlyth Valley,external, a Labour seat since 1950. Across the night and into the following morning, the Conservatives seized 54 seats from Labour, and although some of these have been marginal in recent years, many were considered to be safe by the party. In theNorth East, Redcar, a seat that had never before voted in a Conservative, picked Jacob Young over Labour's Anna Turley by 3,527 votes Meanwhile in theNorth West, Leigh, in Greater Manchester, turned away from Labour for the first time since 1922; one of several losses in the area In theEast Midlandsthe Conservatives took Bassetlaw, long seen as a Labour heartland in Nottinghamshire, with a majority of more than 14,000 Similarly, Dudley North in theWest Midlandssaw the second largest swing Labour to the Conservatives, securing the Tory candidate a majority of 11,533 TheEastof England saw only marginal seats of Ipswich and Peterborough move back into Tory hands, Ipswich with a reasonable swing away from Labour While in theWest, one marginal seat, Stroud in Gloucestershire, was lost to the Conservatives Labour'sLondonseats largely held their ground for Labour, with only Kensington narrowly slipping into Tory control This video can not be played Promises from the new Tory MPs Shadow justice secretary Lord Falconer said Labour had lost ""our most heartland support"" with long-term supporters no longer feeling connected to the party. ""The big question is what do we do to start having a conversation again, both with the people in the marginals, the floating voters that could be one or the other, but also our heartland,"" he said. ""If we don't do it quickly, it will be too late to put it together again."" Some blamed Brexit, others Jeremy Corbyn. Phil Wilson, who stood for Labour in Mr Blair's old constituency of Sedgefield in County Durham, said the Labour leader went down ""like a lead balloon"" with voters on the doorstep. ""For Labour leadership to blame Brexit for the result is mendacious nonsense. Jeremy Corbyn's leadership was a bigger problem. To say otherwise is delusional,"" he tweeted. One of Mr Corbyn's closest allies - the former Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone - said it ""looked like the end"" for the Labour leader, and he would probably ""have to resign"". But Labour chairman Ian Lavery, who retained his Wansbeck seat in Northumberland by 814 votes, said the party had suffered a lot of ""hostility"", ""resentment"" and ""nastiness"" because of its position on Brexit. ""People feel let down, that's the reality of it,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, citing Labour's support for a second EU referendum having previously said it would accept the result of the first. ""We lost trust and we cannot as a party continue to promise one thing and do another."" Tories win overall majority in general election Conservatives take Tom Watson's former seat Who are the major election casualties? Caroline Flint said she was fighting on ""two fronts"" Losing her Don Valley seat in South Yorkshire, Caroline Flint - never a fan of Mr Corbyn and Leave supporter - blamed Mr Corbyn's leadership and Remain-backing MPs for the party's performance. The former Labour minister's former seat has existed since 1918 and had never before had a Conservative MP. She claimed she had been ""fighting on"" two fronts; the first being voters not wanting to support Mr Corbyn as Prime Minister and the second of Labour ""being more like a 'stop Brexit' Remain party."" By Tom Mullen, BBC News Leigh has been a fearsome Labour stronghold for nearly 100 years and even Conservative candidate James Grundy expected to ""lose with dignity"". Now he's the local MP after securing a 1,965 majority, with a 12% swing to the party. Are his constituents as shocked as he is? As the Conservatives took Stoke-on-Trent Central, defeated Labour candidate Gareth Snell described the loss of seats such as his as ""the start of 20 years of Tory rule"". Even in the seats that Labour retained, the party's majority and vote share were severely dented. In Halton, Cheshire, Derek Twigg won a majority of 18,975, down from 25,405 at the last election, with the Brexit Party winning more than 8% of the vote. Tom Watson stood down as West Bromwich East MP ahead of the election The red wall did not crumble on Merseyside or in London, however. Labour saw Liverpool's first black MP, Kim Johnson, elected in Riverside, while the party also held Wirral West, despite forecasts that it would be a close-run contest. In London, Labour secured a victory over the Tories in Putney, the seat vacated by former education secretary Justine Greening, with Fleur Anderson defeating Conservative candidate Will Sweet. Labour retained 39 other seats in the capital but lost Kensington, which it had won by 20 votes in 2017, back to the Conservatives. Labour's Chi Onwurah was the first MP to be declared when her Newcastle Central results were revealed at 23:28 on Thursday. Conservative Derek Thomas was the last with his St Ives seat declared at about 14:40 on Friday after bad weather on the Isles of Scillydelayed the collection of ballot boxes.

"Boris Johnson has won a decisive majority, on the back of a big swing from Labour to the Conservatives in Leave-voting Britain. Yet north of the border the SNP dramatically almost swept the board. With all results now declared, the prime minister has won a majority of 80 seats - the biggest Tory majority since 1987. Meanwhile, at 44%, the party's share of the vote is set to be at its highest since 1979, when Margaret Thatcher became prime minister. Labour, in contrast, finds itself with little more than 200 seats, even fewer than the party won in its previous worst post-war result in 1983. However, the swing in the Tories' favour varied dramatically across the country. In those seats where more than 60% of voters backed Leave inthe 2016 EU referendum, the increase in Conservative support on average was 6%. However, in those seats where more than 60% voted Remain, the party's vote actually fell by three points. In contrast, Labour's vote fell on average by more than 10 points in the most pro-Leave areas. Its vote fell by more than six points in the most pro-Remain ones. This pattern had a clear impact on the geography of the election. Support for the Conservatives rose by four points in the Midlands, the North East and Yorkshire - the regions of England that voted most heavily in favour of Leave. In contrast, the party's vote fell back by a point in London and the South East. And in Scotland, the party's vote fell by as much as four points. Conversely, Labour saw its vote fall by 12 to 13 points in the North East and Yorkshire, while it fell by only six or seven points in London and the South of England. The result also saw Labour lose ground heavily in its traditional working-class heartlands. Support for the party fell by 11 points in those constituencies with most voters in working-class jobs. Its share of the vote fell by only seven points in those with most middle-class voters. The bond between Labour and its traditional working-class base is now badly strained. In the EU referendum working-class voters voted heavily to leave the EU. These voters had already swung quite strongly to the Conservatives in 2017. Labour tried to retain their support - remaining ambiguous about whether it was a pro-Remain or a pro-Leave party. But this election simply saw the pro-Conservative trend continue yet further. As a result, Labour dramatically lost many a seat in the North of England and the Midlands - places such as Ashfield, Bishop Auckland, and Workington - that had never previously elected a Conservative MP in a general election. The success of the Conservatives in England and Wales was matched by that of the SNP in Scotland. The party has won 48 of the 59 seats north of the border, and 45% of the vote across Scotland as a whole. It is a result almost as good as the party's historic performance in the 2015 election. After 59 of 59 seats After 59 of 59 seats And, in a country that voted in favour of Remain, it is likely to embolden the SNP in its pursuit of a second independence referendum. That is a ballot to which the Conservatives are strongly opposed. So, a constitutional clash between the Scottish and UK governments seems likely. One of the SNP's biggest scalps was theDunbartonshire East seat of Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson- a defeat that capped a miserable night for the Liberal Democrats. Despite advancing more strongly in pro-Remain areas, the party seems likely to end up with only 11 or 12 seats. This will be no more than the number they won in 2017, even though their share of the vote is up by four points. None of the many MPs who defected to the party during the last Parliament have been able to retain their seats. More from Sir John Curtice Five things to watch for in the election Is Brexit the most important issue for voters? Do people still vote according to class? The issues voters care about most The announcement of the election was greeted with concern about the level of turnout, for a ballot held just a fortnight before Christmas. In the event, about 67% of voters made it to the polls - just two points down on 2017. Turnout fell most markedly in seats where Labour are relatively strong, suggesting that some of those who usually support the party opted to stay at home. The Conservatives' success means that Britain will now leave the EU at the end of January. However, it seems unlikely to end the debate about Britain's relationship with the EU. The country's divisions over Brexit were exposed in the very different swings across the country. Meanwhile, at 47%, fewer than half of voters backed the Conservatives or the Brexit Party - the parties in favour of leaving the EU without another referendum. This is a point to which opponents of Brexit are likely to point in the weeks and months to come. But for now at least, the day clearly belongs to Mr Johnson.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives have a majority of 80 seats. They have made gains in Labour heartlands across northern England and Wales. The SNP have made gains across Scotland. Labour have had their worst return of seats in any general election since 1935. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats now have more female than male MPs. The interactive map below shows all the seats that have changed from one party to another. Select the ""results"" tab to see what has happened in the rest of the UK. If you can't see the map click here.,external The Conservatives increased their vote share in many areas that voted Leave in the 2016 EU referendum. By contrast they lost votes in strong Remain constituencies such as those in Scotland and London. But Labour lost votes in both strong Remain and strong Leave areas. Strong Leave and strong Remain constituencies are those where an estimated 60% or more of the electorate voted for that option at the EU referendum. These estimates of constituency Brexit votes were modelled by Professor Chris Hanretty, as the 2016 referendum result was only recorded by local authority and not by Westminster constituency. The Conservatives were clear winners in constituencies estimated to have voted majority Leave in 2016. They won almost three quarters of all these seats. By contrast, there was no clear winner among Remain backing constituencies, with a crowded field of parties all winning substantial numbers of seats. Labour did best of all those parties but only took 40% of the constituencies that backed Remain. Labour also straddled the Brexit divide taking a roughly equal number of Leave (106) and Remain (96) seats. Most other parties had a clearer Brexit divide. Overall, the Conservatives broke new ground, moving into many traditional Labour heartlands. In 2017, Labour held 72 of the 100 constituencies with the most working class households (defined asC2DE,externalusing data from the 2011 census). In 2019, this figure fell to 53 and the Conservatives increased their share from 13 to 31. The nations and regions In every nation and region of Britain, the scale of Labour's losses outweighed any gains made by the Conservatives. The Conservatives did lose votes in the south of England and Scotland, but these were balanced by gains in the rest of England and Wales. The Lib Dems increased their share of the vote across the UK, but failed to translate these gains into more seats. In Scotland, the SNP made 14 gains, and lost just one seat, while the Conservatives lost seven and Labour lost six seats. In Wales, the Conservatives gained six seats and Labour lost six, mostly in the north east. Overall, Labour's share of the vote was down to 41% from 49% in 2017. The Conservatives polled consistently well across England and most of Wales, reflecting their overall 44% share of the UK vote. You can use the interactive map below to show the vote share for other parties as well as the turnout. Labour's strength was concentrated in London and areas around cities in south Wales, the North East and North West. At 32%, Labour's share of the vote is down around eight points on the 2017 general election. Overall, they lost 60 seats and gained only one,Putney,externalin London. A total of 220 female MPs have been elected. This is 12 more than the previous high of 208 in 2017. For the first time, both the Liberal Democrats and Labour have more women MPs than men. Of Labour's 202 MPs (excluding Speaker Lindsay Hoyle), 104 are women and of the Liberal Democrats' 11 MPs, seven are women. Turnout, on what was a cold and damp polling day, was 67.3%. slightly lower than the last election in June 2017.

"Delegates at the climate talks in Madrid are concerned that divisions between rich and poor are re-emerging UN climate talks in Madrid enter their final scheduled day with divisions emerging between major emitting countries and small island states. Negotiators are attempting to agree a deal in the Spanish capital that would see countries commit to make new climate pledges by the end of 2020. But serious disagreements have emerged over how much carbon-cutting the major emitters should undertake. The talks have also become bogged down in rows over key technical issues. Download the BBC Energy Briefing, from October 2019 (10.7MB),external Anger as protesters barred from UN climate talks Methane pulse detected from South Sudan wetlands Greenland ice melt 'is accelerating' Negotiators arrived in Madrid two weeks ago with the words of the UN secretary general ringing in their ears - AntÃ³nio Guterres told delegates that ""the point of no return is no longer over the horizon"". Protests led by young delegates saw up to 200 protestors ejected from the talks Despite his pleas, the conference has become enmeshed in deep, technical arguments about a number of issues including the role of carbon markets and the financing of loss and damage caused by rising temperatures. The key question of raising ambition has also been to the forefront of the discussions. Responding to the messages from science and from school strikers, the countries running this COP are keen to have a final decision here that would see countries put new, ambitious plans to cut carbon on the table. According to the UN, 84 countries have promised to enhance their national plans by the end of next year. Some 73 have said they will set a long-term target of net zero by the middle of the century. In a rare move, negotiators from the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) pointed the finger of blame at countries including Australia, the United States, Canada, Russia, India, China and Brazil. They had failed to submit revised plans that would help the world keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century. As well as naming names, AOSIS members were angry at the pressure being put on the island nations to compromise on key questions. ""We are appalled at the state of negotiations - at this stage we are being cornered, we fear having to concede on too many issues that would undermine the very integrity of the Paris agreement,"" said Carlos Fuller, AOSIS chief negotiator. ""What's before us is a level of compromise so profound that it underscores a lack of ambition, seriousness about the climate emergency and the urgent need to secure the fate of our islands."" Reinforcing the sense of division, India, supported by China, Saudi Arabia and Brazil, is taking a hard line on the promises made by richer countries in previous agreements before the Paris pact was signed in 2015. They are insisting that the pledges to cut carbon in the years up to 2020 be examined and if the countries haven't met their targets, these should be carried over to the post-2020 era. Signed in 2015, the Paris climate pact saw every country, India included, sign up to take actions. This was a key concession to the richer nations who insisted that the deal would only work if everyone pledged to cut carbon, unlike previous agreements in which only the better off had to limit their CO2. India now wants to see evidence that in the years up to 2020, the developed world has lived up to past promises. ""The Paris agreement talks about the leadership of the developed countries, it talks about the peaking of greenhouse gases earlier in these countries, so we need to see these things,"" said Ravi Shankar Prasad, India's chief negotiator. ""You have to honour what you agreed."" The developed world see the Indian stance as a tactic, where they are trying to go back to the way things were before Paris, with the richer countries doing the most of the heavy lifting while China, India and others do less. Some politicians in attendance at this meeting believe there's too much self interest and not enough countries looking at the bigger picture. Some visitors have other things to do at the COP ""Frankly, I'm tired of hearing major emitters excuse inaction in cutting their own emissions on the basis they are 'just a fraction' of the world's total,"" said the prime minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama. ""The truth is, in a family of nearly 200 nations, collective efforts are key. We all must take responsibility for ourselves, and we all must play our part to achieve net zero. ""As I like to say, we're all in the same canoe. But currently, that canoe is taking on water with nearly 200 holes - and there are too few of us trying to patch them,"" Mr Bainimarama said.

"This video can not be played Election 2019: The story of the night as the results came in Boris Johnson will return to Downing Street with a big majority after the Conservatives swept aside Labour in its traditional heartlands. With just a handful of seats left to declare in the general election, the BBC forecasts a Tory majority of 78. The prime minister said it would give him a mandate to ""get Brexit done"" and take the UK out of the EU next month. Jeremy Corbyn said Labour had a ""very disappointing night"" and he would not fight a future election. The BBC forecast suggests the Tories will get 364 MPs, Labour 203, the SNP 48, the Lib Dems 12, Plaid Cymru four, the Greens one, and the Brexit Party none. That means the Conservatives will have their biggest majority at Westminster since Margaret Thatcher's 1987 election victory. Labour, which has lost seats across the North, Midlands and Wales in places which backed Brexit in 2016, is facing its worst defeat since 1935.

Speaking earlier at his count in Uxbridge, west London, where he was elected with a slightly higher majority, Mr Johnson said: ""It does look as though this One Nation Conservative government has been given a powerful new mandate to get Brexit done."" He added: ""Above all I want to thank the people of this country for turning out to vote in a December election that we didn't want to call but which I think has turned out to be a historic election that gives us now, in this new government, the chance to respect the democratic will of the British people to change this country for the better and to unleash the potential of the entire people of this country."" Mr Johnson became prime minister in July without a general election, after the Conservative Party elected him as leader to replace Theresa May. Speaking at his election count in Islington North, where he was re-elected with a reduced majority, Mr Corbyn said Labour had put forward a ""manifesto of hope"" but ""Brexit has so polarised debate it has overridden so much of normal political debate"". Labour's vote is down around 8% on the 2017 general election, with the Tories up by just over 1% and the smaller parties having a better night.

They have won a majority which will allow Boris Johnson to make sure Brexit happens next month. There were some astonishing results, with a number of historic Labour heartlands falling to the Conservatives. Labour, by contrast, could hardly be in a worse position. Jeremy Corbyn has made it clear he will go before the next election - but he wants to stay for a period of reflection. Many in his party want him to go immediately. In Scotland, the picture is quite different. The SNP have come close to sweeping the board - gaining seats from all their rivals. A Tory majority at Westminster means one constitutional quarrel - Brexit - might be over, but another - on Scottish independence - will be back with a vengeance. Scottish National Party leader and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it had been an ""exceptional night"" for her party. She said Scotland had sent a ""very clear message"" that it did not want a Boris Johnson Conservative government and the prime minister did not have a mandate to take Scotland out of the EU. It was also a ""strong endorsement"" for Scotland having a choice over its own future in an another independence referendum, she added. Labour looks set for one of its worst election results since World War Two. Some traditional Labour constituencies, such as Darlington, Sedgefield and Workington, in the north of England, will have a Conservative MP for the first time in decades - or in the case of Bishop Auckland and Blyth Valley - for the first time since the seat was created. Labour took Putney, in south-west London, from the Tories, in a rare bright spot for Jeremy Corbyn's party. This video can not be played John McDonnell: ""I think most people thought the polls were narrowing"" A row has already broken out at the top of the Labour Party, with some candidates blaming Jeremy Corbyn's unpopularity on the doorstep and others blaming the party's policy of holding another Brexit referendum. Leave-supporting Labour chairman Ian Lavery, who held his seat with a reduced majority, said he was ""desperately disappointed"", adding that voters in Labour's ""heartlands"" were ""aggrieved"" at the party's Brexit stance. Downing Street said earlier that if Mr Johnson was returned to Downing Street, there would be a minor cabinet reshuffle on Monday. The Withdrawal Agreement Bill, paving the way for Brexit on 31 January, would have its second Commons reading on Friday, 20 December. A major reshuffle would take place in February, after the UK has left the EU, No 10 added, with a Budget statement in March.

"This video can not be played Conservative win announced in Blyth Valley, breaking Labour's 50-year hold in the former mining constituency Labour's ""red wall"" across the Midlands and the north of England - the bedrock of the party's support for generations - crumbled as the Conservatives claimed key marginal seats. Leave-voting former mining towns like Workington, which wasseen as representative of the votersparties needed to win over, backed the Tories. Tony Blair's former constituency of Sedgefield went blue, as did West Bromwich East, vacated by former Labour deputy leader Tom Watson. The Conservatives carved a path from Greater Manchester to Lincolnshire, the Black Country to Northumberland, as Labour strongholds fell. Some of these seats have not had a Tory MP in decades, and in the case of Burnley it had been more than a century. Bolsover inDerbyshire, which has been Labour since it was created in 1950 and Dennis Skinner's seat since 1970, confirmed Boris Johnson's Commons majority at just after 05:00 GMT. Can't see the map?Click here,external By David Pittam, BBC News Dennis Skinner was not present at the overnight count in his Derbyshire constituency, having recently undergone hip surgery. His absence held a sad irony, given that he has been very much an ever-present in British politics for the best part of five decades. Like him or loathe him, his memorable public image - the famous finger, the voice raised above the Commons cacophony - struck a chord with many. So what changed? Read how the Beast of Bolsover was beaten. Things began to unravel at about 23:30 withBlyth Valley,external, a Labour seat since 1950. Across the night and into the following morning, the Conservatives seized 54 seats from Labour, and although some of these have been marginal in recent years, many were considered to be safe by the party. In theNorth East, Redcar, a seat that had never before voted in a Conservative, picked Jacob Young over Labour's Anna Turley by 3,527 votes Meanwhile in theNorth West, Leigh, in Greater Manchester, turned away from Labour for the first time since 1922; one of several losses in the area In theEast Midlandsthe Conservatives took Bassetlaw, long seen as a Labour heartland in Nottinghamshire, with a majority of more than 14,000 Similarly, Dudley North in theWest Midlandssaw the second largest swing Labour to the Conservatives, securing the Tory candidate a majority of 11,533 TheEastof England saw only marginal seats of Ipswich and Peterborough move back into Tory hands, Ipswich with a reasonable swing away from Labour While in theWest, one marginal seat, Stroud in Gloucestershire, was lost to the Conservatives Labour'sLondonseats largely held their ground for Labour, with only Kensington narrowly slipping into Tory control This video can not be played Promises from the new Tory MPs Shadow justice secretary Lord Falconer said Labour had lost ""our most heartland support"" with long-term supporters no longer feeling connected to the party. ""The big question is what do we do to start having a conversation again, both with the people in the marginals, the floating voters that could be one or the other, but also our heartland,"" he said. ""If we don't do it quickly, it will be too late to put it together again."" Some blamed Brexit, others Jeremy Corbyn. Phil Wilson, who stood for Labour in Mr Blair's old constituency of Sedgefield in County Durham, said the Labour leader went down ""like a lead balloon"" with voters on the doorstep. ""For Labour leadership to blame Brexit for the result is mendacious nonsense. Jeremy Corbyn's leadership was a bigger problem. To say otherwise is delusional,"" he tweeted. One of Mr Corbyn's closest allies - the former Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone - said it ""looked like the end"" for the Labour leader, and he would probably ""have to resign"". But Labour chairman Ian Lavery, who retained his Wansbeck seat in Northumberland by 814 votes, said the party had suffered a lot of ""hostility"", ""resentment"" and ""nastiness"" because of its position on Brexit. ""People feel let down, that's the reality of it,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, citing Labour's support for a second EU referendum having previously said it would accept the result of the first. ""We lost trust and we cannot as a party continue to promise one thing and do another."" Tories win overall majority in general election Conservatives take Tom Watson's former seat Who are the major election casualties? Caroline Flint said she was fighting on ""two fronts"" Losing her Don Valley seat in South Yorkshire, Caroline Flint - never a fan of Mr Corbyn and Leave supporter - blamed Mr Corbyn's leadership and Remain-backing MPs for the party's performance. The former Labour minister's former seat has existed since 1918 and had never before had a Conservative MP. She claimed she had been ""fighting on"" two fronts; the first being voters not wanting to support Mr Corbyn as Prime Minister and the second of Labour ""being more like a 'stop Brexit' Remain party."" By Tom Mullen, BBC News Leigh has been a fearsome Labour stronghold for nearly 100 years and even Conservative candidate James Grundy expected to ""lose with dignity"". Now he's the local MP after securing a 1,965 majority, with a 12% swing to the party. Are his constituents as shocked as he is? As the Conservatives took Stoke-on-Trent Central, defeated Labour candidate Gareth Snell described the loss of seats such as his as ""the start of 20 years of Tory rule"". Even in the seats that Labour retained, the party's majority and vote share were severely dented. In Halton, Cheshire, Derek Twigg won a majority of 18,975, down from 25,405 at the last election, with the Brexit Party winning more than 8% of the vote. Tom Watson stood down as West Bromwich East MP ahead of the election The red wall did not crumble on Merseyside or in London, however. Labour saw Liverpool's first black MP, Kim Johnson, elected in Riverside, while the party also held Wirral West, despite forecasts that it would be a close-run contest. In London, Labour secured a victory over the Tories in Putney, the seat vacated by former education secretary Justine Greening, with Fleur Anderson defeating Conservative candidate Will Sweet. Labour retained 39 other seats in the capital but lost Kensington, which it had won by 20 votes in 2017, back to the Conservatives. Labour's Chi Onwurah was the first MP to be declared when her Newcastle Central results were revealed at 23:28 on Thursday. Conservative Derek Thomas was the last with his St Ives seat declared at about 14:40 on Friday after bad weather on the Isles of Scillydelayed the collection of ballot boxes.

"Fay Jones, Virginia Crosbie and Sarah Atherton will represent the Conservatives in Westminster Wales' first three female Conservative MPs have been elected as the party claimed six key seats from Labour. Sarah Atherton's 2,131 majority win in Wrexham was followed by Virginia Crosbie taking Ynys Mon and Fay Jones winning Brecon and Radnorshire. The Tories also turned Bridgend, Vale of Clwyd, Clwyd South and Delyn from red to blue in other targeted seats. Labour remained the biggest party while Plaid Cymru held their four seats, but the Liberal Democrats were wiped out. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and First Minister Mark Drakeford spoke on Friday evening, a Downing Street spokeswoman said. ""They talked about their shared commitment to the union and to growth and prosperity for Wales within a strengthened United Kingdom,"" she said. Â ""The prime minister made clear how the UK is strongest when all four nations unite and all work together to unleash the potential of the entire country.""

""With this election I think we put an end to all those miserable threats of a second referendum,"" he said. ""You may only have lent us your vote and you may not think of yourself as a natural Tory... your hand may have quivered over the ballot paper and you may intend to return to Labour next time around and if that is the case, I am humbled that you have put your trust in me and you have put your trust in us, and I and we will never take your support for granted.""

Tory David TC Davies, who held on to his Monmouth seat with 52% of the votes, said his party needed to move towards the centre in order to win the next general election. ""There is going to be a huge expectation on us, I'm very well aware a lot of people voted Conservative for the first time in this election so I don't see this as a mandate for some sort of extreme government, I see this as a mandate for a government on the centre political ground.""

Former Tory MP Glyn Davies said he was ""absolutely astonished"" by the party's performance. Paul Davies, the Conservative leader in the Welsh assembly, said: ""After winning seats like Delyn and Clwyd South we now have the joint largest number of Welsh Conservative MPs in Parliament, to help ensure that a positive voice for Wales is heard loud and clear in Parliament. ""We now need to refocus ahead of the Welsh Parliamentary elections in 2021 and ensure that this failing Welsh Labour government, who have been running our health service for the last 20 years, are held to account and the people of Wales get the services they deserve.""

Ms McMorrin blamed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for the party's defeat nationally and said it needed to rebuild without him in charge.

""We've obviously suffered a very bad defeat and I've lost many colleagues, I've just about hung on,"" he said. It was a bad night for Labour in Wales, especially in the north east ""There are a number of issues - Brexit was an issue, the leadership of the party was an issue and we really have to look at ourselves and decide which way we go forwards. ""I think our policy on Brexit was, well... if you stand in the middle of the road, you get run over.

Plaid Cymru was forecast to take three seats, down one, but held on to all four - Carmarthen East, Ceredigion, Dwyfor Meirionnydd, and Arfon, where Hywel Williams increased his slender majority of 92 to 2,781. Conservative supporters celebrate victories at the count in Builth Wells The Liberal Democrats were left without a seat after Jane Dodds was ousted by the Conservative Ms Jones, who won the Brecon and Radnorshire seat back for her party just four months after it was lost in a by-election. Ms Jones, who won by 7,131 votes, said she was ""honoured"". Ms Dodds wrote on Twitter: ""I'm not going to lie, last night was a really rough night - not just for me, but for the Liberal Democrats across the UK."" Plaid Cymru's Ben Lake celebrates with his supporters in Ceredigion after increasing his majority Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price defended his party's decision to form a remain pact with others who wanted to stay in the EU.

He said his party was now looking at ""being out in the wilderness for even longer"" unless there was ""some serious soul-searching"".

This video can not be played Chris Bryant said the night was a ""catastrophe"" for the Labour Party Mr Drakeford said that despite Labour's losses in Wales, the results did not change some fundamental issues. ""People in north east Wales need jobs and will need a Welsh Labour Government to defend those jobs and help them with it,"" he said. ""But we will be investing in things which provide housing for people, services for people - those things are important and we have to work harder to communicate those things to people."" But he said although it had been a disappointing night for the party, he did not believe it had alienated voters and Welsh Labour had held a ""whole swathe"" of valleys seats. On the future, he said: ""Brexit is going to happen, I don't think there's any denying that - we will have to work hard to make sure that they [Westminster Government] understand the implications of that for Wales. ""And where there are bad implications - which there will be - they take those into account and take the necessary actions to mitigate the adverse impacts that Brexit will bring to Wales."" The political map of Wales has changed enormously. Aside from the single seat of Alyn & Deeside, Labour has been vanquished from north Wales. The Conservatives are celebrating a return to their high watermark of 1983 when they held 14 seats in Wales, Boris Johnson's Brexit message resonated among Welsh Labour leave voters. But many Welsh Labour sources say Jeremy Corbyn was a major factor in turning off the party's traditional supporters. They will also question the approach of their Welsh leader Mark Drakeford. Should he have done more to ""Welshify"" this election and distinguish Welsh Labour from the UK party? Was that even achievable given the dominance of the two characters of Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson? The Liberal Democrats will rue the day they pushed for this election - their hubris has been mercilessly punished. And Plaid will breathe a big sigh of relief that they hung on to two ultra marginals, and were let off the hook by a split leave vote in Carmarthen East. Coming third in their target seat of Ynys Mon is a blow that leaves them at the status quo of four seats. If you cannot see the graphic clickhere,external.

"Boris Johnson has won a decisive majority, on the back of a big swing from Labour to the Conservatives in Leave-voting Britain. Yet north of the border the SNP dramatically almost swept the board. With all results now declared, the prime minister has won a majority of 80 seats - the biggest Tory majority since 1987. Meanwhile, at 44%, the party's share of the vote is set to be at its highest since 1979, when Margaret Thatcher became prime minister. Labour, in contrast, finds itself with little more than 200 seats, even fewer than the party won in its previous worst post-war result in 1983. However, the swing in the Tories' favour varied dramatically across the country. In those seats where more than 60% of voters backed Leave inthe 2016 EU referendum, the increase in Conservative support on average was 6%. However, in those seats where more than 60% voted Remain, the party's vote actually fell by three points. In contrast, Labour's vote fell on average by more than 10 points in the most pro-Leave areas. Its vote fell by more than six points in the most pro-Remain ones. This pattern had a clear impact on the geography of the election. Support for the Conservatives rose by four points in the Midlands, the North East and Yorkshire - the regions of England that voted most heavily in favour of Leave. In contrast, the party's vote fell back by a point in London and the South East. And in Scotland, the party's vote fell by as much as four points. Conversely, Labour saw its vote fall by 12 to 13 points in the North East and Yorkshire, while it fell by only six or seven points in London and the South of England. The result also saw Labour lose ground heavily in its traditional working-class heartlands. Support for the party fell by 11 points in those constituencies with most voters in working-class jobs. Its share of the vote fell by only seven points in those with most middle-class voters. The bond between Labour and its traditional working-class base is now badly strained. In the EU referendum working-class voters voted heavily to leave the EU. These voters had already swung quite strongly to the Conservatives in 2017. Labour tried to retain their support - remaining ambiguous about whether it was a pro-Remain or a pro-Leave party. But this election simply saw the pro-Conservative trend continue yet further. As a result, Labour dramatically lost many a seat in the North of England and the Midlands - places such as Ashfield, Bishop Auckland, and Workington - that had never previously elected a Conservative MP in a general election. The success of the Conservatives in England and Wales was matched by that of the SNP in Scotland. The party has won 48 of the 59 seats north of the border, and 45% of the vote across Scotland as a whole. It is a result almost as good as the party's historic performance in the 2015 election. After 59 of 59 seats After 59 of 59 seats And, in a country that voted in favour of Remain, it is likely to embolden the SNP in its pursuit of a second independence referendum. That is a ballot to which the Conservatives are strongly opposed. So, a constitutional clash between the Scottish and UK governments seems likely. One of the SNP's biggest scalps was theDunbartonshire East seat of Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson- a defeat that capped a miserable night for the Liberal Democrats. Despite advancing more strongly in pro-Remain areas, the party seems likely to end up with only 11 or 12 seats. This will be no more than the number they won in 2017, even though their share of the vote is up by four points. None of the many MPs who defected to the party during the last Parliament have been able to retain their seats. More from Sir John Curtice Five things to watch for in the election Is Brexit the most important issue for voters? Do people still vote according to class? The issues voters care about most The announcement of the election was greeted with concern about the level of turnout, for a ballot held just a fortnight before Christmas. In the event, about 67% of voters made it to the polls - just two points down on 2017. Turnout fell most markedly in seats where Labour are relatively strong, suggesting that some of those who usually support the party opted to stay at home. The Conservatives' success means that Britain will now leave the EU at the end of January. However, it seems unlikely to end the debate about Britain's relationship with the EU. The country's divisions over Brexit were exposed in the very different swings across the country. Meanwhile, at 47%, fewer than half of voters backed the Conservatives or the Brexit Party - the parties in favour of leaving the EU without another referendum. This is a point to which opponents of Brexit are likely to point in the weeks and months to come. But for now at least, the day clearly belongs to Mr Johnson.

Ms Swinson, who started the campaign saying she could become the next prime minister, gained 19,523 votes compared with 19,672 for the SNP's Amy Callaghan in Dunbartonshire East. Sir Ed Davey and Baroness Sal Brinton will be acting co-leaders for the party, now she is no longer an MP. Ms Swinson said the election results would bring ""dismay"" for many. She said she was ""proud that Liberal Democrats were the unapologetic voice of Remain"" in the election, adding that she did ""not regret trying everything"" to avoid Brexit.

""The voices of nationalism and populism both north and south of the border beat both her [Ms Swinson] in her seat and nationally as well."" She said there were some ""nuggets of gold"" the party could take from the election, such as increasing its share of the vote by 4.2% and getting ""some good new MPs"". ""All is not lost,"" she added, pledging that the party's MPs would ""continue to fight, if not for our place in Europe, then for the best deal possible"". Earlier, Baroness Brinton thanked Ms Swinson, who only became Lib Dem leader in July, for what she called her honest and fearless leadership of their party. This video can not be played Government minister Zac Goldsmith loses Richmond Park to Lib Dems The Liberal Democrats entered this election buoyed by a revival in the polls and the addition to their ranks of numerous MPs who defected from other parties, including Chuka Umunna and Luciana Berger from Labour, and the former Tory minister Sam Gyimah. All three, however, were defeated. Earlier, Sir John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, said the polls suggested the party's support declined during the election and indicated that the strongly anti-Brexit party did not make any progress at all among Leave voters. On the night, the Conservatives won a big majority and the SNP took 48 of Scotland's 59 seats, as Labour suffered heavy losses. One highlight for the Lib Dems was the party's candidate in Richmond Park, Sarah Olney, winning the seat from the Conservatives' Zac Goldsmith.

""For millions of people in our country these results will bring dread and dismay and people are looking for hope. ""I still believe we, as a country, can be warm and generous, inclusive and open and that by working together with our nearest neighbours we can achieve so much more. ""Liberal Democrats will continue to stand up for these values that guide our Liberal movement - openness, fairness, inclusivity. We will stand up for hope."" The SNP's Ms Callaghan told BBC Scotland she was ""delighted"" to have unseated the Liberal Democrat leader.

She had served as a minister in the coalition government and was among the party's MPs who paid the price for the tie-up with David Cameron's Tories in the 2015 election - which saw the Lib Dems reduced to a rump of just eight in the Commons. Ms Swinson fought back when then Prime Minister Theresa May called another election in 2017, and she regained her Scottish seat from the SNP. She attracted criticism from some quarters for her policy to revoke Article 50 and cancel Brexit, and for her previous record in the coalition government. TheLib Dems backed Boris Johnson's call in October for an early election, arguing it was the best way of stopping Brexit. Mr Johnson focused relentlessly on a single message - ""get Brexit done"" - promising to take the UK out of the EU by 31 January 2020 if he got a majority.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives have a majority of 80 seats. They have made gains in Labour heartlands across northern England and Wales. The SNP have made gains across Scotland. Labour have had their worst return of seats in any general election since 1935. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats now have more female than male MPs. The interactive map below shows all the seats that have changed from one party to another. Select the ""results"" tab to see what has happened in the rest of the UK. If you can't see the map click here.,external The Conservatives increased their vote share in many areas that voted Leave in the 2016 EU referendum. By contrast they lost votes in strong Remain constituencies such as those in Scotland and London. But Labour lost votes in both strong Remain and strong Leave areas. Strong Leave and strong Remain constituencies are those where an estimated 60% or more of the electorate voted for that option at the EU referendum. These estimates of constituency Brexit votes were modelled by Professor Chris Hanretty, as the 2016 referendum result was only recorded by local authority and not by Westminster constituency. The Conservatives were clear winners in constituencies estimated to have voted majority Leave in 2016. They won almost three quarters of all these seats. By contrast, there was no clear winner among Remain backing constituencies, with a crowded field of parties all winning substantial numbers of seats. Labour did best of all those parties but only took 40% of the constituencies that backed Remain. Labour also straddled the Brexit divide taking a roughly equal number of Leave (106) and Remain (96) seats. Most other parties had a clearer Brexit divide. Overall, the Conservatives broke new ground, moving into many traditional Labour heartlands. In 2017, Labour held 72 of the 100 constituencies with the most working class households (defined asC2DE,externalusing data from the 2011 census). In 2019, this figure fell to 53 and the Conservatives increased their share from 13 to 31. The nations and regions In every nation and region of Britain, the scale of Labour's losses outweighed any gains made by the Conservatives. The Conservatives did lose votes in the south of England and Scotland, but these were balanced by gains in the rest of England and Wales. The Lib Dems increased their share of the vote across the UK, but failed to translate these gains into more seats. In Scotland, the SNP made 14 gains, and lost just one seat, while the Conservatives lost seven and Labour lost six seats. In Wales, the Conservatives gained six seats and Labour lost six, mostly in the north east. Overall, Labour's share of the vote was down to 41% from 49% in 2017. The Conservatives polled consistently well across England and most of Wales, reflecting their overall 44% share of the UK vote. You can use the interactive map below to show the vote share for other parties as well as the turnout. Labour's strength was concentrated in London and areas around cities in south Wales, the North East and North West. At 32%, Labour's share of the vote is down around eight points on the 2017 general election. Overall, they lost 60 seats and gained only one,Putney,externalin London. A total of 220 female MPs have been elected. This is 12 more than the previous high of 208 in 2017. For the first time, both the Liberal Democrats and Labour have more women MPs than men. Of Labour's 202 MPs (excluding Speaker Lindsay Hoyle), 104 are women and of the Liberal Democrats' 11 MPs, seven are women.

The Conservatives won 365 seats in the 2019 general election - up 47 from before the vote. Labour won 203 seats (down 59), the SNP 48 (up 13) and the Lib Dems 11 (down by one). The Brexit Party did not win any. But Mr Farage said the party took thousands of votes from Tory opponents and he was happy with its ""influence"". Speaking to the BBC after the announcement of the exit poll results, he said the Conservatives would win or come close in dozens of seats where they otherwise would not have done without the Brexit Party's  help. He added: ""I killed the Liberal Democrats and I hurt the Labour Party."" He said the party had killed off hopes of another referendum. Meanwhile, Brexit Party chairman Richard Tice failed in his bid to win the constituency of Hartlepool. MEP Mr Tice received 10,603 votes - around a thousand fewer than the Conservative candidate and nearly 5,000 fewer than Labour's Mike Hill, who won the seat. The election delivered a Commons majority of 80 for Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Mr Farage claimed that Tory majority would not exist if his party had not withdrawn from fielding candidates in317 Conservative-held seats.

"Delegates at the climate talks in Madrid are concerned that divisions between rich and poor are re-emerging UN climate talks in Madrid enter their final scheduled day with divisions emerging between major emitting countries and small island states. Negotiators are attempting to agree a deal in the Spanish capital that would see countries commit to make new climate pledges by the end of 2020. But serious disagreements have emerged over how much carbon-cutting the major emitters should undertake. The talks have also become bogged down in rows over key technical issues. Download the BBC Energy Briefing, from October 2019 (10.7MB),external Anger as protesters barred from UN climate talks Methane pulse detected from South Sudan wetlands Greenland ice melt 'is accelerating' Negotiators arrived in Madrid two weeks ago with the words of the UN secretary general ringing in their ears - AntÃ³nio Guterres told delegates that ""the point of no return is no longer over the horizon"". Protests led by young delegates saw up to 200 protestors ejected from the talks Despite his pleas, the conference has become enmeshed in deep, technical arguments about a number of issues including the role of carbon markets and the financing of loss and damage caused by rising temperatures. The key question of raising ambition has also been to the forefront of the discussions. Responding to the messages from science and from school strikers, the countries running this COP are keen to have a final decision here that would see countries put new, ambitious plans to cut carbon on the table. According to the UN, 84 countries have promised to enhance their national plans by the end of next year. Some 73 have said they will set a long-term target of net zero by the middle of the century. In a rare move, negotiators from the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) pointed the finger of blame at countries including Australia, the United States, Canada, Russia, India, China and Brazil. They had failed to submit revised plans that would help the world keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century. As well as naming names, AOSIS members were angry at the pressure being put on the island nations to compromise on key questions. ""We are appalled at the state of negotiations - at this stage we are being cornered, we fear having to concede on too many issues that would undermine the very integrity of the Paris agreement,"" said Carlos Fuller, AOSIS chief negotiator. ""What's before us is a level of compromise so profound that it underscores a lack of ambition, seriousness about the climate emergency and the urgent need to secure the fate of our islands."" Reinforcing the sense of division, India, supported by China, Saudi Arabia and Brazil, is taking a hard line on the promises made by richer countries in previous agreements before the Paris pact was signed in 2015. They are insisting that the pledges to cut carbon in the years up to 2020 be examined and if the countries haven't met their targets, these should be carried over to the post-2020 era. Signed in 2015, the Paris climate pact saw every country, India included, sign up to take actions. This was a key concession to the richer nations who insisted that the deal would only work if everyone pledged to cut carbon, unlike previous agreements in which only the better off had to limit their CO2. India now wants to see evidence that in the years up to 2020, the developed world has lived up to past promises. ""The Paris agreement talks about the leadership of the developed countries, it talks about the peaking of greenhouse gases earlier in these countries, so we need to see these things,"" said Ravi Shankar Prasad, India's chief negotiator. ""You have to honour what you agreed."" The developed world see the Indian stance as a tactic, where they are trying to go back to the way things were before Paris, with the richer countries doing the most of the heavy lifting while China, India and others do less. Some politicians in attendance at this meeting believe there's too much self interest and not enough countries looking at the bigger picture. Some visitors have other things to do at the COP ""Frankly, I'm tired of hearing major emitters excuse inaction in cutting their own emissions on the basis they are 'just a fraction' of the world's total,"" said the prime minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama. ""The truth is, in a family of nearly 200 nations, collective efforts are key. We all must take responsibility for ourselves, and we all must play our part to achieve net zero. ""As I like to say, we're all in the same canoe. But currently, that canoe is taking on water with nearly 200 holes - and there are too few of us trying to patch them,"" Mr Bainimarama said.

"SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon was in buoyant mood as she arrived at the Glasgow count The SNP has made big gains across Scotland, with Nicola Sturgeon saying the country had sent a ""clear message"" on a second independence referendum. The party won 48 seats after securing 45% of the vote -  8.1% more than in the last general election in 2017, when it won 35 seats. The SNP alsodefeated Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinsonin East Dunbartonshire. Ms Sturgeon said the result had exceeded her expectations. The Conservatives have won six seats, the Liberal Democrats four and Labour one. Neale Hanvey'svictory in Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeathis counted as an SNP gain from Labour because he was on the ballot paper as an SNP candidate. Mr Hanvey had been suspended by the party over allegations he made anti-Semitic posts on social media, and will sit as an independent MP. After 59 of 59 seats The Conservatives and Prime Minister Boris Johnson havewon an overall majority across the UKafter taking a string of former Labour strongholds in England and Wales. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was a ""very disappointing night for the Labour Party"" and confirmed he would not lead the party into the next election. The other main developments from Scotland's election night include: Liberal Democrat leaderJo Swinson narrowly lost her Dunbartonshire East seatto the SNP by just 149 votes Scottish Labour'sIan Murray held on to his seat in Edinburgh Southas his party lost all of its other MPs. TheSNP's Stephen Gethins lost to the Liberal Democratsin the UK's narrowest marginal seat, Fife North East. After 59 of 59 seats After 59 of 59 seats Ms Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, had already pledged to send a letter to the prime minister before Christmas requesting that Holyrood be given the power to hold indyref2. Speaking at the Glasgow count, she said she would not pretend that everyone who voted for her party will necessarily support independence. But she said it was a ""clear endorsement Scotland should get to decide our future and not have it decided for us"". Live updates on the Scottish general election results Tories win overall majority in general election Corbyn: I will not lead Labour at next election Ms Sturgeon added: ""Scotland has sent a very clear message - we don't want a Boris Johnson government, we don't want to leave the EU. ""The results across the rest of the UK are grim but underlines the importance of Scotland having a choice. ""Boris Johnson has a mandate to take England out of the EU but he must accept that I have a mandate to give Scotland a choice for an alternative future."" Nicola Sturgeon says she won't pretend that every single person who voted SNP necessarily supports independence. But she will insist this result is a thumping endorsement of her demand for a second referendum. She will make an official request in the next few days to be granted the legal power to hold an independence vote. And we know that Boris Johnson will refuse, sparking a huge debate about whether the Conservatives are ignoring the democratic choice of Scottish voters. It's a debate that can only escalate as we leave the EU - and one which may fuel support for independence itself. Scotland on a constitutional collision course Scottish Secretary Alister Jack, who held Dumfries and Galloway for the Conservatives, said more people cast votes for unionist parties in Scotland than for the SNP. And he was adamant the prime minister should continue to block Ms Sturgeon's calls for power to hold an independence ballot. The Conservative vote had fallen by 3.5% to 25.1% across Scotland, while the Labour vote was down by 8.5% to 18.6%. The Liberal Democrat vote actually increased by 2.8% to 9.5% despite the loss of the party's leader. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""I have a mandate to offer that choice"" Rutherglen and Hamilton West was the first Scottish constituency to declare its result at 01:25, with Margaret Ferrier - who previously held the seat between 2015 and 2017 - polling 23,775 votes, giving her a majority of 5,230 over her Labour rival Ged Killen. That early success was quickly followed by the SNP's David Doogan defeating Conservative Kirstene Hair in Angus. John Nicolson won the Ochil and South Perthshire seat after defeating Luke Graham of the Conservatives, while the SNP also won back Midlothian from Labour's Danielle Rowley, The SNP's Mhairi Black comfortably held her Paisley and Renfrewshire South seat with a greatly increased majority, while Kenny MacAskill, the former Scottish justice secretary, won the East Lothian seat from Labour. This video can not be played Jo Swinson lost her seat in Dunbartonshire East to the SNP SNP MEP Alyn Smith won Stirling from Stephen Kerr of the Conservatives, but Scottish Secretary Alister Jack held Dumfries and Galloway for the Tories. Douglas Ross also held his Moray seat for the Conservatives, while his colleague David Mundell held Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale. The SNP's Stephen Gethins lost by 1,316 votes to Wendy Chamberlain of the Liberal Democrats in Fife North East. Mr Gethins had won the seat by just two votes in 2017. And Labour's Ian Murray held on in Edinburgh South, meaning he is the party's only MP in Scotland. Mr Murray, a longstanding critic of Mr Corbyn, warned that his party's ideology must change or else it will ""die"" and said voters he spoke to on the doorsteps during this campaign did not see Mr Corbyn as prime minister and could not see Labour as a credible alternative government.

The SNP are once again the undoubted winners of the night, taking a slew of seats from their opponents including a big scalp in the form of Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson. The party haven't had it all their own way - running up against Tory resistance in a few seats and losing North East Fife to the Lib Dems - but Nicola Sturgeon's team have piled on thousands of votes in every seat and have already secured a landslide. Labour, meanwhile, have collapsed across Scotland, with their share of the vote down sharply. They even lost the shadow Scottish secretary, Lesley Laird, to a candidate disowned by the SNP and who will sit as an independent. The Conservatives have clinched victory UK-wide, but have lost a clutch of Scottish seats to the SNP - and will be wondering what this means for their campaign to ""stop indyref2"". The Lib Dem vote share is up in most places, but any progress will be massively overshadowed by the loss of Ms Swinson. The party's leader has just gone from touting herself as a future prime minister to losing her seat for the second time in four years.

"Brian Taylor gives his analysis of the 2019 general election in Scotland as the results unfold. 06:30 The Lib Dems say Ed Davey and Baroness Sal Brinton will act as joint leaders of the party, given Jo Swinson's constituency defeat.  A leadership contest will take place in the New Year. 06:03 Alistair Carmichael (third left) retains his Orkney and Shetland seat And so Alistair Carmichael wins Orkney and Shetland. The Lib Dems end up with net four in Scotland. Gained one, North East Fife. Lost one. The snag is the one they lost was held by their federal leader. 06:00 Talking mandates. When it comes to governance, these involve victory for a manifesto in an election. But, when it comes to issues such as referendums, especially when their possibility is disputed, they are partly about momentum. In which regard, the Tories entered this election in Scotland, declaring their aim to stop indyref2. They lost seats. The SNP entered this election saying, in part, that they wanted a referendum by the end of 2020. They gained seats. The momentum is with the SNP.  Consider it the other way round. What if the SNP had lost seats? Their opponents would have declared the end of indyref2. 05:50 Ian Blackford, the SNP Commons leader in the last Parliament, retains his seat - and immediately demands indyref2. He is not prepared, he says, to see Scotland out of the EU against her will. He states: ""We will have our referendum"". And adds: Scotland will become an independent member of the European Union. 05:28 Nessie can rest undisturbed without Ruth Davidson skinny dipping in Loch Ness Jamie Stone squeaks home in Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross. Victory for the Lib Dems over an SNP advance. This means the SNP cannot make 50. Nessie can rest undisturbed. 05:16 Massive victory for the SNP in Gordon. The seat was previously held by Alex Salmond. 05:12 Ruth Davidson previously said she would skinny dip in Loch Ness if the SNP won 50 seats Five Scottish seats to go. The SNP need them all to oblige Ruth Davidson to take to the waters. It's not looking likely, given relative Lib Dem performance. 04:55 Christine Jardine holds Edinburgh West for the Lib Dems. Could Jo Swinson be the only Scottish casualty for her party? That phrase again. ""Nationalism both sides of the border."" Used by Christine Jardine. But used repeatedly by other Lib Dem speakers. 04:50 Just glancing again at the UK voting share. Tories up a bit. Labour down fairly steeply. But LibDems up four points. The leader who helped deliver that is out of Parliament. 04:34 Ian Murray says Labour must listen and respond - or die. 04:25 Ian Murray retains Edinburgh South. He is the only Scottish Labour MP. And a sharp critic of the now departing leader, Jeremy Corbyn. 04:18 Nicola Sturgeon says the results have exceeded even her expectations. She wants Scotland's future in Scotland's hands. She reluctantly accepts that Boris Johnson has a mandate to take England out of  the EU - but not Scotland. She insists she has a mandate to offer Scotland the choice of independence. She will send a formal demand before Christmas and says the Tories must recognise democracy. 04:06 Quite a way to go yet. But still looking likely that the SNP could win more than 50 seats. Stand by for Loch Ness, Ruth. 03:52 She smiles. She congratulates her victorious opponent. But this must be heart-rending for Jo Swinson. Defeated in her home patch, while battling around Great Britain as a whole. Democracy, however, means little without political change, without political churn.  It doesn't make it easy for those affected. 03:47 Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson lost her East Dunbartonshire seat to the SNP And so Jo Swinson has lost East Dunbartonshire by a tiny margin. She led her party but lost her seat. The SNP have taken the constituency. 03:45 Will Boris Johnson heed the Brexiteers in his party? Boris Johnson, set to be returned as PM, once again declares himself a One Nation Tory. Intriguing this is the tone his administration will adopt. Yes, it will be ""Get Brexit done"". No doubt he will now pursue a trade deal with vigour. But will he heed the Brexiteers in his party who say no extension to transition. Or will he - again - seek an extension, perhaps deploying his majority? And that applies to economic policy too. How to define One Nation? 03:35 Wendy Chamberlain takes Fife North East for the LibDems. A gain from the SNP. Stephen Gethins can do no more than applaud politely. This was Ming Campbell's seat for many years. Before that, Tory. Now back in Lib Dem hands. Perhaps bearing out the signs across Scotland of a generic rise, albeit slight, in Lib Dem Scottish vote. On to East Dunbartonshire..... 03:27 Jeremy Corbyn is standing down as Labour leader Corbyn standing down. He will not lead in the next general election. But he will stay to allow discussion. 03:25 Tories hold a seat - their first in Scotland. Douglas Ross hangs on in Moray. 03:19 And he's back. Alyn Smith elected as MP for Stirling. Strictly, he hasn't yet given up as an MEP. But that doesn't now look like a long-term prospect. An excellent victory for the SNP. Setback for the Tories. 03:15 Nicola Sturgeon arrives at the count in Glasgow with her party having won every seat so far in Scotland. She says it is still her intention to urge for an independence  referendum in an approach to the new PM before Christmas. 03:00 Mhairi Black trenchant as always. Asked whether the SNP simply submit to a Boris Johnson victory, she replies:  ""No chance!"" 02:48 Richard Leonard says Labour failed to get through the ""din"" of Brexit and other constitutional issues Richard Leonard says Labour failed to get through the ""din"" of Brexit and other constitutional issues. Which is another way of saying folk were unsure about Labour's position. The Scottish Labour leader says he tried to talk about poverty but couldn't be held. I understand his point - but parties cannot choose the agenda, especially when it is completely dominated by Brexit and independence. These are not constitutional distractions from the truth. They are fundamental. Labour's stance was uncertain. Mr Leonard says cast iron positions might not have helped. Owen Thompson back in Midlothian. That pattern again. 02:45 And so John Nicolson triumphs for the SNP in Ochil. Congrats to him. The irony is that he might have won in his old constituency of East Dunbartonshire. But a very good victory for him tonight. 02:38 East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow. Another big win for the SNP.  Anyone detect a pattern.....?  Those LibDem seats still going to be fascinating. 02:33 A glance at the Scottish voting share. SNP well up. Tories down. Labour well down. But the LibDems are slightly up. Does that add to caveats over the exit poll, or at least their place in it? 02:28 Tories had high hopes in Lanark and Hamilton East. Another victory for the SNP, with an increased majority. 02:21 Derek Mackay, Scotland's finance secretary, says it is scarcely the SNP's fault that Labour is rubbish. He notes that tonight is an argument for independence. Scotland is not getting the government she voted for. 02:15 More than half the electorate backed Mhairi Black in Paisley More than half the electorate backed Mhairi Black in Paisley. And we have the result from West Dunbartonshire. Another good victory for SNP. We are now awaiting East Dunbartonshire. Is Jo Swinson out, defeated by the SNP? 02:05 Ian Murray, hoping to be returned as Labour MP in Edinburgh South, says the results tonight are ""an absolute disaster"" for Labour. He says reflection is needed. And there is a need for a credible alternative opposition. 01:58 We've had the declaration of Arbroath. And now we have the Kilmarnock edition. The verdict in both cases? SNP victories. They are well on course for an excellent night. 01:50 Will Jeremy Corbyn stand down as leader of the Labour Party? Ged Killen, the defeated Labour candidate in Rutherglen, points to two problems for his party. No clarity on Brexit and indyref2. And Jeremy Corbyn. He anticipates that Mr Corbyn will now stand down as leader. 01:41 More about Rutherglen. The SNP vote is not as high as the exit poll suggests. The Labour vote is not as dire. So yet more caveats about that exit poll. But still, an excellent result for the SNP. Many congratulations to the returning MP Margaret Ferrier. 01:30 The SNP's Margaret Ferrier has won the Rutherglen and Hamilton West seat First Scottish result. Rutherglen and Hamilton West. SNP have taken it back from Labour, having won it in 2015. That concept of regaining seats could become a pattern.  If that exit poll is correct.... 01:11 Ian Davidson, former Labour MP, says there will be a discussion within the Labour Party. But he plays down the need for an immediate change of leadership. Labour, he says, will have a continuing job to do to oppose austerity. 00:10 Ian Blackford of the SNP recalling that the people of Scotland were told in 2014 that the way to keep Scotland in the EU was to retain the Union. Not, Mr Blackford notes, how things turned out. Douglas Alexander arguing for a fundamental conversation about the future of Labour, if the exit poll proves to be correct. The first three results in the north east of England are broadly in line, especially that remarkable outcome in Blyth. 23:47 Back in the middle ages, I was a lobby correspondent at Westminster for a group of papers including the Newcastle Journal. From that distant perspective, that is a remarkable result in Blyth Valley. The Tories have taken a seat which used to be held by ex-miner Ronnie Campbell for Labour. Truly, Brexit is driving outcomes. In England. And perhaps, in a different way, in Scotland. 23:07 The Lib Dems are casting big doubt on the exit poll. They say it does not reflect their experience in key seats. Remember those caveats. 22:43 Plan B in action for the SNP. If they have failed to lock Boris Johnson out of Downing Street, they will now argue that Scotland's distinctive standpoint must be respected. Not least with a referendum on independence - that point made by Angus Robertson, former SNP Westminster leader. 22:40 Douglas Alexander, former Labour Foreign Secretary, says Corbynism has been tested to destruction.  Ambiguity the road to ruin. 22:30 The Exit Poll for Scotland suggests that the Liberal Democrats would lose their Scottish seats - including Jo Swinson's in East Dunbartonshire. Ming Campbell reckons that's wrong. Caveats, caveats. This exit poll is beyond trend for the opinion polls of the campaign, increasing the Tory lead.  It also goes beyond the percentage allocated to the SNP in the few Scottish polls. And there's more. The last couple of exit polls have been pretty accurate. But others have not, including 1992 (I still bear the scars). And more again. Around three quarters of Scottish seats are marginal - some highly marginal, some three-way marginal. Difficult to drill down from one poll to individual seats. Keep watching!!! If this poll is correct - IF - then Labour would require a rethink.  Is it about Leave voters asserting their view in England, against Labour's relative vacillation? Or is it about the leader? To underline, let's await more figures. 22:20 Astonishing exit poll as it affects the UK - and Scotland. Ruth Davidson said in advance she'd skinny dip in Loch Ness if the  SNP won 50 seats. Stand by Nessie. Our exit poll reckons 55 for the SNP - almost back to the apex of 2015. If this poll is correct - IF - then stand by for three big elements.  Brexit will  happen.  Labour will rethink.  And the SNP will exercise plan B.  They will argue that Scotland's voting pattern is again being overturned.

"Fay Jones, Virginia Crosbie and Sarah Atherton will represent the Conservatives in Westminster Wales' first three female Conservative MPs have been elected as the party claimed six key seats from Labour. Sarah Atherton's 2,131 majority win in Wrexham was followed by Virginia Crosbie taking Ynys Mon and Fay Jones winning Brecon and Radnorshire. The Tories also turned Bridgend, Vale of Clwyd, Clwyd South and Delyn from red to blue in other targeted seats. Labour remained the biggest party while Plaid Cymru held their four seats, but the Liberal Democrats were wiped out. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and First Minister Mark Drakeford spoke on Friday evening, a Downing Street spokeswoman said. ""They talked about their shared commitment to the union and to growth and prosperity for Wales within a strengthened United Kingdom,"" she said. Â ""The prime minister made clear how the UK is strongest when all four nations unite and all work together to unleash the potential of the entire country.""

Turnout in Wales was 66.6%, down from the 2017 election by 2%. Speaking after securing a majority, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his party would now be able to ""get Brexit done"". ""With this election I think we put an end to all those miserable threats of a second referendum,"" he said. ""You may only have lent us your vote and you may not think of yourself as a natural Tory... your hand may have quivered over the ballot paper and you may intend to return to Labour next time around and if that is the case, I am humbled that you have put your trust in me and you have put your trust in us, and I and we will never take your support for granted.""

Tory David TC Davies, who held on to his Monmouth seat with 52% of the votes, said his party needed to move towards the centre in order to win the next general election. ""There is going to be a huge expectation on us, I'm very well aware a lot of people voted Conservative for the first time in this election so I don't see this as a mandate for some sort of extreme government, I see this as a mandate for a government on the centre political ground.""

Ms McMorrin blamed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for the party's defeat nationally and said it needed to rebuild without him in charge.

Following Labour's poor performance across the UK,Mr Corbyn said he intended to step down as leader. Labour's Tonia Antoniazzi was cheered and heckled during her Gower acceptance speech when she said Brexit voters were ""taken advantage of"". She said the people of Gower had been ""disastrously served by a political shambles that has served to bring the UK into disrepute"". Chris Bryant, who held on to his Labour Rhondda seat, called it the ""worst night for Labour since 1935"". He said his party was now looking at ""being out in the wilderness for even longer"" unless there was ""some serious soul-searching"". Stephen Doughty, who has held the Cardiff South and Penarth seat for seven years, tweeted: ""I fear the future for our younger generation. I fear for the public institutions and integrity of our country. Dark times. Some of us must offer new hope amidst despair."" This video can not be played Chris Bryant said the night was a ""catastrophe"" for the Labour Party Mr Drakeford said that despite Labour's losses in Wales, the results did not change some fundamental issues. ""People in north east Wales need jobs and will need a Welsh Labour Government to defend those jobs and help them with it,"" he said. ""But we will be investing in things which provide housing for people, services for people - those things are important and we have to work harder to communicate those things to people."" But he said although it had been a disappointing night for the party, he did not believe it had alienated voters and Welsh Labour had held a ""whole swathe"" of valleys seats. On the future, he said: ""Brexit is going to happen, I don't think there's any denying that - we will have to work hard to make sure that they [Westminster Government] understand the implications of that for Wales. ""And where there are bad implications - which there will be - they take those into account and take the necessary actions to mitigate the adverse impacts that Brexit will bring to Wales."" The political map of Wales has changed enormously. Aside from the single seat of Alyn & Deeside, Labour has been vanquished from north Wales. The Conservatives are celebrating a return to their high watermark of 1983 when they held 14 seats in Wales, Boris Johnson's Brexit message resonated among Welsh Labour leave voters. But many Welsh Labour sources say Jeremy Corbyn was a major factor in turning off the party's traditional supporters. They will also question the approach of their Welsh leader Mark Drakeford. Should he have done more to ""Welshify"" this election and distinguish Welsh Labour from the UK party? Was that even achievable given the dominance of the two characters of Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson? The Liberal Democrats will rue the day they pushed for this election - their hubris has been mercilessly punished. And Plaid will breathe a big sigh of relief that they hung on to two ultra marginals, and were let off the hook by a split leave vote in Carmarthen East. Coming third in their target seat of Ynys Mon is a blow that leaves them at the status quo of four seats. If you cannot see the graphic clickhere,external.

News of Ms Swinson's defeat was cheered by Nicola Sturgeon, who was caught on camera celebrating the SNP's victory in Dunbartonshire East. The SNP leader, who was waiting to speak to Sky News when the election result was read out, could be seen cheering as she found out that Ms Callaghan had won the seat.

She said there were some ""nuggets of gold"" the party could take from the election, such as increasing its share of the vote by 4.2% and getting ""some good new MPs"". ""All is not lost,"" she added, pledging that the party's MPs would ""continue to fight, if not for our place in Europe, then for the best deal possible"". Earlier, Baroness Brinton thanked Ms Swinson, who only became Lib Dem leader in July, for what she called her honest and fearless leadership of their party.

All three, however, were defeated. Earlier, Sir John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, said the polls suggested the party's support declined during the election and indicated that the strongly anti-Brexit party did not make any progress at all among Leave voters. On the night, the Conservatives won a big majority and the SNP took 48 of Scotland's 59 seats, as Labour suffered heavy losses.

The SNP's Ms Callaghan told BBC Scotland she was ""delighted"" to have unseated the Liberal Democrat leader.

She had served as a minister in the coalition government and was among the party's MPs who paid the price for the tie-up with David Cameron's Tories in the 2015 election - which saw the Lib Dems reduced to a rump of just eight in the Commons. Ms Swinson fought back when then Prime Minister Theresa May called another election in 2017, and she regained her Scottish seat from the SNP. She attracted criticism from some quarters for her policy to revoke Article 50 and cancel Brexit, and for her previous record in the coalition government. TheLib Dems backed Boris Johnson's call in October for an early election, arguing it was the best way of stopping Brexit.

"This video can not be played Election 2019: Corbyn 'will not lead party in future campaign' Jeremy Corbyn has said he will not lead Labour into the next election, following a ""very disappointing night"". With one seat left to declare, the party has won 203 seats. Mr Corbyn said he would stay on as leader during a ""process of reflection"", and said Brexit had ""polarised"" politics which had ""overridden normal political debate"". But others within Labour, including former MPs who lost their seats, blamed Mr Corbyn's leadership. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Corbyn was not intending to resign and it could take until April for a leadership contest to take place. On the night, the Conservatives won a big majority, sweeping aside Labour strongholds across northern England, the Midlands and Wales in areas which backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum. Some traditional Labour constituencies, such as Darlington, Sedgefield and Workington, in the north of England, will have a Conservative MP for the first time in decades - or in the case of Bishop Auckland and Blyth Valley - for the first time since the seat was created. At 33%, Labour's share of the vote is down around eight points on the 2017 general election and is lower than that achieved by Neil Kinnock in 1992. LIVE: Updates and reaction as results come in,external Tories take Labour seats as they head for majority Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson loses seat Speaking at his election count in Islington North, where he was re-elected with a reduced majority, Mr Corbyn said Labour had put forward a ""manifesto of hope"" and criticised the ""way the media behaved"" towards his party during the campaign. But he added: ""Brexit has so polarised and divided debate in this country, it has overridden so much of a normal political debate."" ""I recognise that has contributed to the results that the Labour Party has received this evening all across this country."" Labour primarily campaigned on a promise to end austerity by increasing spending on public services. The party also promised to renegotiate Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit deal, and then put it to a referendum vote alongside the option of remaining in the EU. That strategy was criticised by party chairman Ian Lavery, who said it had led voters in traditional Labour seats to believe it was ""a Remain party"". ""They believe they should have been listened to - and they think that the Labour party have totally reneged on the result,"" he said. But he added the strategy was not ""Jeremy Corbyn's decision"", as it had beenapproved by delegatesat the party's September conference. Former Labour MP John Mann said the leader's unpopularity on the doorstep was palpable and Mr Corbyn should have ""gone already"". Others have blamed the party's support for another Brexit referendum and the long-running anti-Semitism row. Margaret Hodge, MP for Barking, said Labour had become the ""nasty party"". Given the result, you might assume Jeremy Corbyn would swiftly fall on his sword - but he has instead called for a period of quiet reflection. Party rules make it difficult to oust him, but already senior figures are asking how long this period will last. Senior figures at Westminster and in local government feel delaying an inevitable leadership contest will lead to a similar result in May's council elections. Mr Corbyn seems intent on staying in place until someone from his wing of the party is ready to take over - but the defeat of shadow minister Laura Pidcock has eliminated one of the potential left-wing leadership challengers. Those who would prefer shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer are keen that a new leader is in place soon to challenge Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit policy. The battle to establish the reasons for the defeat has already begun. The narrative from the leadership that Brexit was to blame will be challenged robustly by those who want the party to change direction. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell, a key ally of Mr Corbyn, said he was ""heartbroken"" at the result and insisted he would not take on the party leadership temporarily. ""At some stage we'll go into a leadership election,"" he said. ""Jeremy wants to ensure there is a period of reflection."" Earlier, he said he did not think the Labour leader had been ""the big issue"" of the campaign. But former Labour justice secretary Lord Falconer called for the party to move quickly to replace Mr Corbyn as leader by March or April.

Elsewhere in the city, Ruth Smeeth, who lost her Stoke-on-Trent North seat to the Conservatives, described the election result as ""devastating"".

Yvette Cooper, who unsuccessfully challenged Mr Corbyn for her party's leadership in 2015, said the results showed Labour has ""to change as a party"". She said Brexit had played a ""significant part"" in her party's performance, but the election ""was not just about Brexit"". ""It was about their perceptions of the party, their perceptions of the leadership,"" she added. Speaking after an earlier exit poll predicted heavy losses for Labour, former Labour home secretary Alan Johnson told ITV News that Mr Corbyn had been ""incapable of leading"" and ""worse than useless at all the qualities you need to lead a political party."" Polling expert Professor Sir John Curtice said: ""It was clear that lots of Remain voters had doubts about Jeremy Corbyn's ability to handle Brexit and indeed, more broadly to handle anything."" In a statement, the Jewish Labour Movement - affiliated to the party for a century and representing about 2,500 members - said Labour's failure ""lies squarely with the party's leadership"".

"Election night could be a long one for financial market traders. The most sensitive market to political events is almost always the value of the pound. And, given the political stakes could scarcely be higher, it could be very volatile as exit polls and results begin to come in. Markets care A LOT about the outcome of the election, but why should we even discuss them - and what do we even mean when we say ""markets""? Markets is shorthand for the collective confidence that investors (individuals, pension funds, hedge funds) have in the financial prospects of a company, a country, a commodity, a currency, etc. When it comes to politics, markets react to the effect they think political events will have on the economic prospects of the UK. But markets are not always right. Markets - and most economists - think Brexit is overall a bad thing for the UK economy because it makes doing business with our largest and closest trading partner, the EU, more difficult and more expensive. The harder the Brexit, the worse for the economy and the currency. Markets also think Labour proposals - to nationalise industries, force big firms to hand over a tenth of the company to workers and government, plus a plan to borrow hundreds of billions of pounds -  is bad for business confidence, the economy and the pound. Also, markets don't like surprises. Markets do matter because a fall in the pound tends to push up the cost of living, while falls in company share prices affect the value of pensions. With these rough principles in mind, let's take a look at the potential market reaction to the most probable outcomes. A Conservative majority: The pound goes up, but by how much and for how long depends on size of majority. This is the outcome the markets are currently predicting. The value of the pound has risen significantly since the summer, rising from $1.19 to over $1.32 as the majority of polls have pointed to a Tory majority and a functioning government. That lead in the polls has also reduced the chance of an outright labour victory, a result markets dislike more than Brexit. However, even if markets get the Tory majority they expect, it doesn't mean that markets will be calm. A great deal depends on the size of that majority. A very small majority, some argue, would give hard line Brexiters more influence over negotiations with the EU and prevent the PM from extending the transition period, thereby increasing the likelihood of leaving the EU without a deal in December 2020 - an outcome that investors consider bad for the UK economy and consequently the value of the pound. Others argue that the Tory party is a lot more stable than it was. Rebel MPs have been crushed and all have signed up to Johnson's deal in blood as the price of standing in the election. Whatever you think, it seems uncontroversial to say that the bigger the majority, the more short-term certainty for the direction of travel. Based on soundings from foreign exchange traders a solid majority (say 25-plus) see pound rise a bit ($1.33). A big win could see it rise a bit more ($1.35-$1.40) while a slim majority or falling short altogether would potentially see a sharp fall in the pound back towards $1.20-$1.25. A Labour-led coalition: Short term fall for pound but supported by potential path to reversing Brexit. The process of assembling a coalition, choosing a leader, the possibility of a second referendum - with a potentially different result - would create uncertainty in the short term and stall business investment further. The pound would probably fall in value in the short term. However, markets have consistently delivered the message: the closer the UK is to the EU, the better for the economy - and therefore the pound might find some support after an initial dip. A Labour Party in coalition with other parties would probably have to ditch some of the more radical proposals (mass nationalisations, etc) that the markets don't like. No radical overhaul of capitalism and a potential route to a softer or non-existent Brexit would probably create a bit of a short term shock, but it wouldn't lead to a bloodbath. However, some say the price of the SNP joining a Labour-led coalition would be a promise for a second Scottish referendum. A possible fracture in the UK could add another whole level of uncertainty and political angst, which would offset any hopes for a softer Brexit. An outright labour majority: The most radical overhaul of the way business and the economy is run in decades. Pound falls very sharply. This would come as a big surprise to markets - and they hate those. It's not just the element of surprise - markets fear Labour's plans to nationalise large swathes of the economy and change the ownership of companies, etc, would spook investors. Traders expect that would lead to a sharp fall in the pound and the price of shares in the companies they want to nationalise, which would hit savers and workers' pensions. In summary, markets know they are not oracles but they don't react well to being wrong and can act with a violent jerk of the knee when that happens. The markets right now are balanced between fears and desires. A desire for the certainty of a functioning government, while fearing both a hard Brexit on one side and a makeover of capitalism on the other.

"This video can not be played Election 2019: The story of the night as the results came in Boris Johnson will return to Downing Street with a big majority after the Conservatives swept aside Labour in its traditional heartlands. With just a handful of seats left to declare in the general election, the BBC forecasts a Tory majority of 78. The prime minister said it would give him a mandate to ""get Brexit done"" and take the UK out of the EU next month. Jeremy Corbyn said Labour had a ""very disappointing night"" and he would not fight a future election. The BBC forecast suggests the Tories will get 364 MPs, Labour 203, the SNP 48, the Lib Dems 12, Plaid Cymru four, the Greens one, and the Brexit Party none. That means the Conservatives will have their biggest majority at Westminster since Margaret Thatcher's 1987 election victory. Labour, which has lost seats across the North, Midlands and Wales in places which backed Brexit in 2016, is facing its worst defeat since 1935.

Speaking earlier at his count in Uxbridge, west London, where he was elected with a slightly higher majority, Mr Johnson said: ""It does look as though this One Nation Conservative government has been given a powerful new mandate to get Brexit done."" He added: ""Above all I want to thank the people of this country for turning out to vote in a December election that we didn't want to call but which I think has turned out to be a historic election that gives us now, in this new government, the chance to respect the democratic will of the British people to change this country for the better and to unleash the potential of the entire people of this country."" Mr Johnson became prime minister in July without a general election, after the Conservative Party elected him as leader to replace Theresa May. Speaking at his election count in Islington North, where he was re-elected with a reduced majority, Mr Corbyn said Labour had put forward a ""manifesto of hope"" but ""Brexit has so polarised debate it has overridden so much of normal political debate"". Labour's vote is down around 8% on the 2017 general election, with the Tories up by just over 1% and the smaller parties having a better night.

They have won a majority which will allow Boris Johnson to make sure Brexit happens next month. There were some astonishing results, with a number of historic Labour heartlands falling to the Conservatives. Labour, by contrast, could hardly be in a worse position. Jeremy Corbyn has made it clear he will go before the next election - but he wants to stay for a period of reflection. Many in his party want him to go immediately. In Scotland, the picture is quite different. The SNP have come close to sweeping the board - gaining seats from all their rivals. A Tory majority at Westminster means one constitutional quarrel - Brexit - might be over, but another - on Scottish independence - will be back with a vengeance. Scottish National Party leader and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it had been an ""exceptional night"" for her party. She said Scotland had sent a ""very clear message"" that it did not want a Boris Johnson Conservative government and the prime minister did not have a mandate to take Scotland out of the EU. It was also a ""strong endorsement"" for Scotland having a choice over its own future in an another independence referendum, she added. Labour looks set for one of its worst election results since World War Two. Some traditional Labour constituencies, such as Darlington, Sedgefield and Workington, in the north of England, will have a Conservative MP for the first time in decades - or in the case of Bishop Auckland and Blyth Valley - for the first time since the seat was created.

Downing Street said earlier that if Mr Johnson was returned to Downing Street, there would be a minor cabinet reshuffle on Monday.

"This video can not be played Election 2019: Corbyn 'will not lead party in future campaign' Jeremy Corbyn has said he will not lead Labour into the next election, following a ""very disappointing night"". With one seat left to declare, the party has won 203 seats. Mr Corbyn said he would stay on as leader during a ""process of reflection"", and said Brexit had ""polarised"" politics which had ""overridden normal political debate"". But others within Labour, including former MPs who lost their seats, blamed Mr Corbyn's leadership. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Corbyn was not intending to resign and it could take until April for a leadership contest to take place. On the night, the Conservatives won a big majority, sweeping aside Labour strongholds across northern England, the Midlands and Wales in areas which backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum. Some traditional Labour constituencies, such as Darlington, Sedgefield and Workington, in the north of England, will have a Conservative MP for the first time in decades - or in the case of Bishop Auckland and Blyth Valley - for the first time since the seat was created. At 33%, Labour's share of the vote is down around eight points on the 2017 general election and is lower than that achieved by Neil Kinnock in 1992. LIVE: Updates and reaction as results come in,external Tories take Labour seats as they head for majority Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson loses seat Speaking at his election count in Islington North, where he was re-elected with a reduced majority, Mr Corbyn said Labour had put forward a ""manifesto of hope"" and criticised the ""way the media behaved"" towards his party during the campaign. But he added: ""Brexit has so polarised and divided debate in this country, it has overridden so much of a normal political debate."" ""I recognise that has contributed to the results that the Labour Party has received this evening all across this country."" Labour primarily campaigned on a promise to end austerity by increasing spending on public services. The party also promised to renegotiate Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit deal, and then put it to a referendum vote alongside the option of remaining in the EU. That strategy was criticised by party chairman Ian Lavery, who said it had led voters in traditional Labour seats to believe it was ""a Remain party"". ""They believe they should have been listened to - and they think that the Labour party have totally reneged on the result,"" he said. But he added the strategy was not ""Jeremy Corbyn's decision"", as it had beenapproved by delegatesat the party's September conference. Former Labour MP John Mann said the leader's unpopularity on the doorstep was palpable and Mr Corbyn should have ""gone already"". Others have blamed the party's support for another Brexit referendum and the long-running anti-Semitism row. Margaret Hodge, MP for Barking, said Labour had become the ""nasty party"". Given the result, you might assume Jeremy Corbyn would swiftly fall on his sword - but he has instead called for a period of quiet reflection. Party rules make it difficult to oust him, but already senior figures are asking how long this period will last. Senior figures at Westminster and in local government feel delaying an inevitable leadership contest will lead to a similar result in May's council elections. Mr Corbyn seems intent on staying in place until someone from his wing of the party is ready to take over - but the defeat of shadow minister Laura Pidcock has eliminated one of the potential left-wing leadership challengers. Those who would prefer shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer are keen that a new leader is in place soon to challenge Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit policy. The battle to establish the reasons for the defeat has already begun. The narrative from the leadership that Brexit was to blame will be challenged robustly by those who want the party to change direction. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell, a key ally of Mr Corbyn, said he was ""heartbroken"" at the result and insisted he would not take on the party leadership temporarily. ""At some stage we'll go into a leadership election,"" he said. ""Jeremy wants to ensure there is a period of reflection."" Earlier, he said he did not think the Labour leader had been ""the big issue"" of the campaign. But former Labour justice secretary Lord Falconer called for the party to move quickly to replace Mr Corbyn as leader by March or April.

IN PICTURES:Binface, a baby and Boris Johnson Gareth Snell, who lost his Leave-backing Stoke-on-Trent Central seat, called for both Mr Corbyn and Mr McDonnell to quit. He accused senior figures in the shadow cabinet, who are defending Remain-voting seats in London, of ""sacrificing"" candidates in marginal constituencies in the Midlands and the north of England. Elsewhere in the city, Ruth Smeeth, who lost her Stoke-on-Trent North seat to the Conservatives, described the election result as ""devastating"". ""For me, this is about whether the Labour Party has any right to exist [and] whether we have anything left to say,"" she said. Another Labour MP to lose her seat, Caroline Flint in Don Valley, said: ""So many of my voters could not and did not want to support Jeremy Corbyn to be prime minister."" She added: ""There are moderate MPs who have driven us into a dead-end regarding Brexit and they have put the pursuit of Remain at the expense of our working-class heartlands and I feel annoyed, to say the least, about that."" This video can not be played Labour candidate Gareth Snell calls for Jeremy Corbyn to step down Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, speaking after holding his Holborn and St Pancras seat, said: ""As a whole movement, we need to reflect on this result and understand it together, but we also have a duty to rebuild, starting now."" Yvette Cooper, who unsuccessfully challenged Mr Corbyn for her party's leadership in 2015, said the results showed Labour has ""to change as a party"". She said Brexit had played a ""significant part"" in her party's performance, but the election ""was not just about Brexit"". ""It was about their perceptions of the party, their perceptions of the leadership,"" she added. Speaking after an earlier exit poll predicted heavy losses for Labour, former Labour home secretary Alan Johnson told ITV News that Mr Corbyn had been ""incapable of leading"" and ""worse than useless at all the qualities you need to lead a political party."" Polling expert Professor Sir John Curtice said: ""It was clear that lots of Remain voters had doubts about Jeremy Corbyn's ability to handle Brexit and indeed, more broadly to handle anything."" In a statement, the Jewish Labour Movement - affiliated to the party for a century and representing about 2,500 members - said Labour's failure ""lies squarely with the party's leadership"". ""Because of the public's rejection of Corbyn as prime minister, the confused position on Brexit, or its total failure to tackle anti-Jewish racism, the party must truly listen,"" the statement said.
