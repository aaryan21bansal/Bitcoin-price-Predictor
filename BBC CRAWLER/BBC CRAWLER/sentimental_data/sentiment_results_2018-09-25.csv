"Life expectancy in the UK has stopped improving for the first time since 1982, when figures began. Women's life expectancy from birth remains 82.9 years and for men it is 79.2, the figures from the Office for National Statistics, for 2015-17, show. In some parts of the UK, life expectancy has even decreased. For men and women in Scotland and Wales, it declined by more than a month. Men in Northern Ireland have seen a similar fall. For women in Northern Ireland, and for men and women in England, life expectancy at birth is unchanged. How long are you going to live? UK among worst for life expectancy rises Why did more people die last winter? The ONS said the stalling of life expectancy was linked to a particularly high number of deaths from 2015 to 2017, which coincided with a bad flu season and excess winter deaths. It said there was ""much ongoing debate"" about the reasons behind this and what direction the trend may take in the future. It is not clear what is driving the trend, but some academics have argued that government austerity policies, such as cuts to social care budgets in England, must have played a part. Ministers have said that no such causation can be proved, although Public Health England has been asked to carry out a review of life expectancy trends. Dr Kingsley Purdam, senior lecturer in social research methods and statistics at the University of Manchester, said the figures were ""shocking"". ""Poverty, austerity and cuts to public services are impacting on how long people are living in the UK,"" he said. ""We all need to look after our health but many of us, including the most vulnerable populations, need help at a time when evidence suggests that services are being cut. ""The lost years of life have an impact not just on the individual but on those people who are ultimately left behind including partners, children and grandchildren."" But Prof Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said there were other factors that might explain the stall in progress. ""We still do not know how much this is a result of direct health effects such as flu epidemics, how much is a result of social and economic factors, and how much is a failure to go on improving smoking cessation or other preventive measures,"" he said. The data also shows that the UK lags behind other leading countries for life expectancy, including Switzerland, Japan, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy. Of the countries the ONS compared the UK with, Switzerland was the nation with the longest life expectancy for men. For women, it is Japan. Men in Switzerland are expected to live to 81.5 years. Women in Japan are predicted to live to 87. Throughout the 20th Century, the UK experienced steady improvements in life expectancy at birth, resulting in a larger and older population. This has been attributed to healthier lifestyles among the population as it ages, such as reduced smoking rates, and improvements in treating infectious illnesses and conditions such as heart disease. But in recent years, the progress has slowed. And in the latest data it has ground to a halt. The population of people who are 90 or over is still increasing but this is due to previous improvements in life expectancy going back many decades. The number of centenarians decreased slightly between 2016 and 2017, reflecting low numbers of births during World War One. But the ONS said it was expected to continue to increase again from 2019. By Robert Cuffe, BBC News head of statistics Since the 1980s, life expectancy has been going up by roughly two months a year every year, as we saw fewer deaths due to smoking or heart problems. But after 2011, that rate of improvement has been slowing. It could be because it's hard to keep on improving every year. It could be because of hard winters or difficult flu seasons. But we're not sure about exactly what has caused this trend. So this data is really telling us about death rates in the UK for the past three years. And we can be sure that picture in death rates is real. How sure can we be that you'll live as long as the ONS predicts? Not very - the ONS is not making precise predictions about what will happen in the future to determine how long you live. Medical breakthroughs, pandemics and the wars of the next 80 years are impossible to predict. A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: ""Recent trends in life expectancy and mortality in the UK can also be seen in a number of countries across Europe, North America and Australia. ""As part of our long-term plan for the health service, we are taking action to help people live longer and healthier lives - cancer survival is at a record high while smoking rates are at an all-time low - backed by our additional funding of an extra Â£20.5bn a year by 2023-24, which will transform care for cancer and other chronic diseases.""

"This video can not be played Theresa May, who is in New York for a UN meeting, spoke to the BBC about immigration and Brexit Prime Minister Theresa May has said it would ""not be in the national interest"" for a general election to take place before the UK leaves the European Union in March 2019. Mrs May told journalists accompanying her to New York she was focused on delivering Brexit. The next general election is not due until 2022. But Labour has been demanding an earlier vote if MPs reject any deal struck between the UK and the EU. At the weekend Downing Street dismissed a newspaper report of contingency planning for a general election, and Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the idea was ""for the birds"". Asked by journalists if she could promise there would not be an election before the UK leaves the EU, Mrs May replied: ""What I'm doing is working to deliver a good deal with Europe in the national interest. ""It would not be in the national interest to have an election."" Labour votes to keep referendum option Corbyn: More EU talks if deal rejected Immigration cut 'shouldn't hurt economy' Mrs May also told BBC political correspondent Ben Wright that any MPs thinking of voting against a deal she reached with the EU should ""recall"" their ""duty"" in delivering on the 2016 referendum result. ""I'm working to bring a good deal back from the EU,"" she said. ""Members of the House of Commons, when they look at that deal and remember that we are delivering on the vote of the British people - that is what must be at the forefront of people's thinking."" The prime minister also reiterated her view that having no deal in place when the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019 would be ""better than a bad deal"". She said the government was doing the ""right, sensible"" thing in issuing advice for people to prepare for a no-deal scenario.

"This video can not be played Malian ""Spiderman"" rescues Paris child - then meets French president The father of a child who was dramatically rescued after dangling from a Paris balcony has been given a three-month suspended sentence. Convicted of neglecting his parental responsibilities, the man has also been ordered to take a course in being a better parent. Malian migrant Mamoudou Gassama scaled four floors of the building with his bare hands to save the four year old, who was left unsupervised. His feat led to international acclaim. Mr Gassama has since been given French citizenship and personally thanked by President Emmanuel Macron. 'Spiderman' becomes French citizen How case shines light on today's France Travelling is a rite of passage for many Malians The father, who has not been named, left the little boy alone to go shopping and then delayed his return to play Pokemon Go, prosecutors said at the time. The child's mother had remained in RÃ©union, where the family is from. The father's lawyer Romain Ruiz told Le Figaro that his client was very aware of the mistake he had made.

"Roman Abramovich had wished to settle in the Swiss resort of Verbier The Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich was denied Swiss residency because police warned that he could be a threat to Switzerland, reports say. Switzerland's federal police advised officials to reject his application over suspicions he might be involved in money laundering or have contact with criminal organisations. Mr Abramovich denies any wrongdoing. The owner of Chelsea football club has never been indicted in Switzerland or elsewhere. The allegations are based on unverified police suspicions which emerged after the Zurich-based publisher Tamedia obtained a letter written by police. Mr Abramovich's lawyer has said that the billionaire has never had, or been alleged to have, connections with criminal organisations. He fought a legal battle to try to prevent the story being published. The Tamedia group has won that battle after several months and now its news outlets,including 24 heures,external, have reported that the Federal Office of Police viewed Mr Abramovich's potential presence in the country as a danger to public security and to Switzerland's reputation. The police did not set out the basis for their claims, the reports say. Mr Abramovich's lawyer Daniel Glasl, said he was extremely disappointed by the publication of confidential information from Swiss government files. The legal team had filed a request for correction of facts to the police and would be filing a criminal complaint regarding dissemination of the information, he said. ""Despite multiple requests, FedPol has failed to provide any evidence supporting these defamatory allegations,"" he added. The oligarch had hoped to establish his legal residence as the Swiss Alpine resort of Verbier. Earlier this yearhe withdrew his application to renew his British visaafter a delay apparently prevented him from travelling to the UK for Chelsea's victory over Manchester United in the FA Cup final. He has since taken Israeli citizenship, according to Israeli media. Israel grants all Jews who move to the state citizenship under its law of return. Israeli passport holders can travel to the UK for a visit without a visa, but Russians cannot. By Imogen Foulkes, BBC News, Bern Swiss cantons have the freedom to fast track foreign residency permits if the applicant is wealthy, and whose taxes could therefore be beneficial to the local community. Among others, Tina Turner, Lewis Hamilton, and quite a few wealthy Russians have benefited from this practice. But with Roman Abramovich other considerations were clearly at play. The canton of Valais approved his residency application, but the Swiss Federal Police knocked it back. Allegations of money laundering or other criminal activity by Mr Abramovich are unproven, but the Swiss authorities do not need proof: for them the merest hint of such activities is reason enough to turn an application down. For decades Switzerland, and its secretive banks, were almost a byword for money laundering. More recently there has been a big effort to tighten up the laws on financial crime, and to punish offenders. The aim: to get rid of the dodgy money image and replace it with one of upstanding trustworthiness. Mr Abramovich's attempt to appeal directly to the head of the Federal Police will not have done him any favours. He is not the first Russian millionaire to have his application rejected by Switzerland, he just happens to be the most famous. Mr Abramovich (right) owns the London-based Premier League football club Chelsea The 51-year-old is one of Russia's richest people He reportedly sold dolls before making his fortune in oil in the 1990s after the collapse of the former Soviet Union Mr Abramovich was a one-time business partner of the late tycoon Boris Berezovky, an associate of former Russian President Boris Yeltsin Critics say the two businessmen used their Kremlin ""family"" ties to acquire key state companies for below market value Abramovich served as governor of Russia's Chukotka region He is believed to be close to Russian President Vladimir Putin Abramovich 'withdraws' UK visa application Abramovich 'eligible to become Israeli' New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"A CCTV screengrab highlights Khalid Masood driving along Westminster Bridge Security barriers were not installed on London's Westminster Bridge ahead of the March 2017 attack there because it was not judged to be a likely terror target, a senior policeman has said. The bridge links Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament, and the London Eye - all major tourist sites. Four pedestrians and a police officer were killed during the attack launched by Khalid Masood. The inquest into their deaths is taking place at the Old Bailey in London. Chief Superintendent Nick Aldworth, who is responsible for protective security in London, was asked why crash barriers were not in place, especially after two deadly vehicle attacks in Nice and Berlin where the perpetrators drove into crowds of people. He told Gareth Patterson QC, representing the victims' families, that the bridge was not seen ""as a specific location for a specific threat"", and there was no need ""to mitigate against that threat"". Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Andreea Cristea, 31, were killed when Masood drove an SUV into them on the bridge. PC Keith Palmer was stabbed to death while on duty outside Parliament. Clockwise from top left - PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade, Leslie Rhodes, Andreea Cristea and Kurt Cochran all lost their lives Chief Supt Aldworth also addressed allegations that Scotland Yard has tried to ""pass the buck"" over claims the area was not properly patrolled. The court has heard that PC Lee Ashby and PC Nicholas Sanders - the armed officers on patrol - had not been near Carriage Gates, where PC Palmer was standing, for nearly an hour before the attack. Official guidelines said armed officers should be in ""close proximity"" to the gates when they were open. But the pair said they were unaware of that guidance. Westminster attacker 'told children he would die' Who was attacker Khalid Masood? Victims of the Westminster terror attack They have said their presence elsewhere in New Palace Yard was in line with instructions they received on the ground. ""Police constables are being hung out to dry to protect you, the senior leadership team"", said Susannah Stevens, the lawyer representing PC Palmer's sisters and parents. Chief Supt Aldworth said he did not accept there had been a systemic failure. He told the inquest that when he was at Westminster, he had tried to ""anchor officers in close proximity to Carriage Gates"", instead of near the MPs' entrance to the Palace of Westminster - which is in an area that is already secure. It was ""completely unnecessary and not good tactical thinking"" to have them near the members' entrance, he added. This video can not be played The inquest was shown CCTV footage of Westminster attacker Khalid Masood's final preparations The hearing also heard from a clinical psychologist who said that Khalid Masood met the criteria for ""anti-social personality disorder"" and could be described as a psychopath. Dr Brock Chisholm, a consultant clinical psychologist, said Masood had ""an impaired ability to empathise"", that he ""appeared be very controlling"", and that his relationships were mostly ""superficial, shallow, short-lived."" Westminster attacker 'sent kissing emoji' He told the court Masood viewed himself as ""special in the eyes of God"", and that he appears to have felt ""mentally quite out of control"". He added that he believed Masood had developed an extremist mindset somewhere between his second prison term and going to Saudi Arabia. The inquest also heard from a toxicology expert, who said that tests showed Masood was a user of anabolic steroids, which can increase aggression. Professor David Cowan was unable to say how recently Masood had taken steroids, but said he believed he had used the drug ""over a period of time,"" although he was ""not a particularly heavy user"". An inquest into the death of Masood - who was shot dead by armed officers - will take place when the current inquest comes to an end.

"Emissions tests on diesel cars have not been carried out during MOTs in Northern Ireland for 12 years, despite being legally required. The tests were crucial, an air pollution expert told BBC Spotlight, and not to do them was ""virtually criminal"". The government is legally required to do an emissions test on diesels. The Driver & Vehicle Agency (DVA) said its staff do a ""visual test"" and make a ""personal judgement"" about emissions. MoT changes come into force in NI MOT tests to have 22 new checks Missed MOT tests cost NI drivers Â£225,000 Four-year MOT exemption proposed It means there are potentially tens of thousands of diesel cars with illegal emissions on the road in Northern Ireland. Both EU and Northern Ireland domestic law requires the government to do an emissions test on diesels at MOT using a machine called a smoke meter. The smoke meter test is routinely carried out in the rest of the UK where MOTs are done in private garages rather than state-run centres. This video can not be played Lack of diesel emissions tests 'virtually criminal' According to Professor Robert Lee of Birmingham University, failure to do the test means the government in Northern Ireland is breaking the law. Friends of the Earth has said they could now take legal action in both Belfast and Brussels. as a result. The tests were introduced at MOT in Northern Ireland in 2006 but were suspended 12 weeks later due to concerns about health and safety in the testing halls. They have never been reintroduced. The Driver & Vehicle Agency said its staff do a 'visual test' where they make a 'personal judgement' about a car's emissions The DVA, which runs MOTs, told Spotlight reintroducing a smoke meter test for diesel cars would require ""a significant investment programme"". It said its staff do a ""visual test"" where they make a ""personal judgement"" about a car's emissions. SDLP MLA John Dallat said the failure to do the tests was a ""scandal"" which required a ""thorough inquiry"". This video can not be played Failure to do diesel tests 'a scandal' He added: ""I'm sure there are very few people watching this programme that haven't seen cars emitting huge volumes of black smoke and wondering how on earth those things are on the road. ""Now we know. If those tests were there, those cars would be gone."" Spotlight bought a second hand diesel car which was due for MOT and booked a test. Our confirmation email and the NI Direct website both informed us that the MOT would involve a metered smoke test to check the car's emissions. That was not true. We secretly filmed throughout the test and there was no evidence of a metered smoke test. Professor Harrison told Spotlight he was shocked by what we found. ""This is a very straightforward test and it's quite an effective way of picking up the grossly emitting vehicles. Not to do it, I would regard as virtually criminal,"" he said. The DVA's chief executive, Paul Duffy, who has been in post since 2013, answered Spotlight's questions to both his own organisation and the Department for Infrastructure. He said: ""Resuming the metered smoke test for diesel cars will require a significant investment programme, which will also provide additional capacity to address the growing demand for vehicle tests across Northern Ireland and which is currently under way."" He said a new centre in Belfast equipped to do the test would be open in late 2021. Upgrading the rest would require funding approval. He added: ""The communication to motorists by way of a vehicle test reminder and a vehicle test appointment notification uses generic letters issued to all motorists and includes information applicable to a range of vehicle categories including HGVs and buses. ""The information on the letters is not tailored or specific to any category of vehicle."" He said his organisation would now review its published communications.

"The spread of fire inside Grenfell Tower was so horrendous that no-one should ever have been allowed to live there, a fire chief has said. Deputy assistant commissionerAndrew O'Loughlin told the inquiry into the disaster that the failure of the building could not have been foreseen. He was defending the decision to tell residents to remain in their homes. People in flats not yet reached by smoke and fire should have been protected by the building, he said. Mr O'Loughlin was the most senior London Fire Brigade Officer on the scene and was in charge of the incident when the advice to ""stay put"" was given to residents. After 02:47 BST, residents were encouraged to escape if they could, rather than await rescue. But the commissioner said that firefighters had reason to expect that the ""stay put"" advice would keep residents safe. He said: ""You wouldn't expect fire to spread around the building like it did on the outside. And for it to fail so catastrophically - we'd never expected or anticipated that. ""We would not expect the internal protection to fail so badly as well. So my expectation was people who were safe in their flats should stay safe in their flats."" Andrew O'Loughlin said the building's safety measures failed ""catastrophically"" Grenfell Tower was 'unsafe to live in' One firefighter told the inquiry earlier thatthe advice for unaffected residents to stay put was redundant by about 01:50. But Mr O'Loughlin rejected suggestions that the advice should have changed earlier, arguing that the spread of the fire was something that ""none of us could ever have expected."" ""The building was so horrendous several hours later that I think no-one should have lived in the building,"" he said. The inquiry also heard from assistant commissioner Andrew Roe, who described what he believed were failings in the facade and the internal compartments that were meant to prevent fire spreading. Mr Roe, who arrived on the scene at 02:29, said he was able ""to look laterally through the building, I could see right through compartments and see that flame spread."" He said: ""The fact the facade had kind of acted as the petrol, as it were, to spread the fire all over the building was one thing, that was obviously genuinely shocking, but it was the complete failure of the building system that caught me by surprise."" Asbestos warning for Grenfell survivors I hope you get justice, says firefighter Meghan takes mum to Grenfell cookbook launch The inquiry heard that it took 25 minutes before Mr O'Loughlin was informed that the advice to residents to stay put had been abandoned at 02:47. Mr O'Loughlin said he was confused by the change and did not think it would necessarily make much difference to residents already trapped inside their flats. ""The change to 'stay put' is, if people feel they can escape then they should try to, but I don't think it's trying to tell people they should go into a smoke-filled environment,"" he said. Communicating the change to residents was also ""not easily done"" as there was no mechanism for contacting each flat in the west London tower block, he added. The blaze on June 14 2017 caused the deaths of 72 residents.

"Alan Hogg, far right, pictured with his wife, buying the pick-up truck which was stolen The bodies of a UK millionaire and his Thai wife have been found in northern Thailand nearly a week after what police suspect was a contract killing. The bodies of Alan Hogg, 64, and Nod Suddaen, 64, were discovered buried on their property in Phrae province. Police say Mr Hogg, who was from Edinburgh, was shot dead, while his wife was killed with a hammer. Three suspects have been held. They are alleged to have been hired to carry out the attack by Nod Suddaen's brother. He has now been arrested. ""The motive for the killings was a long-running internal family conflict, feuds and property,"" local police commander Manas Kerdsukho told the AFP news agency. The bodies of Alan Hogg and his wife were found on their property on Tuesday The couple were reported missing last week. The three alleged killers were arrested after police tracked down a pick-up truck said to have been taken from Mr Hogg's property. They later admitted killing Mr Hogg and his wife, police say.

"Arlene Foster has been the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) since December 2015 The DUP leader has said Jonathan Bell's BBC interview about a flawed green energy scheme directly led to the collapse of the NI assembly. Arlene Foster was giving evidence to the Renewable Heat Incentive inquiry. She was in charge of energy matters for NI when the scheme was set up in 2012, while Mr Bell was enterprise minister between 2015 and 2016. Overgenerous subsidies meant costs grew and left taxpayers with a Â£490m bill. Live: Foster in cash-for-ash hot seat Q&A: What is the RHI inquiry? Timeline: Renewable Heat Incentive scandal On Tuesday, Mrs Foster told the inquiry that Mr Bell - who was her successor as enterprise minister - had pressed a ""nuclear button""by going public with claims that DUP special advisers delayed his plans to close down the controversial scheme. He gave an interview to the BBC's Stephen Nolan show in December 2016, in which he also alleged the advisers secretly tried to ""cleanse the record"" of references to Mrs Foster. Mrs Foster told the inquiry that ""paranoia set in with Jonathan"" after a BBC Spotlight programme revealed the scheme's overspend, and Mr Bell felt the party was trying to blame him for the debacle. However she said that was not the case, but it was all in Mr Bell's own mind. Mr Bell has since told the inquiry that after he went public about RHI, he becamethe victim of a ""massive smear campaign"" orchestrated by the DUP. Mrs Foster, who was Northern Ireland's first minister in December 2016, said he had caused such a reaction with his allegations, some of them ""very confused"" and that he ""had to take what was coming to him"". She set out how assembly and executive officials had agreed a plan to deal with cost controls, but that when Mr Bell spoke to the BBC, that plan went ""out the window"". ""We were then on a trajectory to the assembly and executive collapsing,"" she added. Pressed further on that, she said Mr Bell had ""taken a route with Stephen Nolan which caused the downfall of the executive"". Northern Ireland has been without devolved government for more than 500 days The weeks that followed saw Sinn FÃ©in, the DUP's then partner in government, demand Mrs Foster stand aside as first minister until an investigation into the scheme was completed. She refused to do so, and on 9 January 2017, the late Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister, which led to a snap assembly election. More than a year and a half later, talks deadlines have failed and the Northern Ireland assembly remains in limbo. Earlier on Tuesday, Mrs Foster said it is a ""great regret"" to her that she did not sack Jonathan Bell as enterprise minister when she became first minister in 2016. Mr Bell replaced her as enterprise minister in May 2015. The RHI inquiry hasheard evidence from a number of witnesses that he was unsuitable for the job. Asked why she had not replaced him when she took over the party reins, Mrs Foster said an assembly election campaign was looming and that removing him at that time could have raised political questions over his suitability as a candidate for the party. Mrs Foster said there was a general view in the party that Mr Bell should not remain in post, but she said other party officials asked: ""How much harm can he do in three months?"" She also claimed there was a concern he could ""go in inverted commas 'rogue' if he was replaced as a minister"" when Mrs Foster replaced Peter Robinson. Mrs Foster said Mr Bell never accepted her leadership, nor did he take his responsibilities seriously and she claimed he acted as if he was ""to be served, rather than serve"". She said he ""hero-worshipped"" Mr Robinson and when he retired, it showed in Mr Bell's behaviour. ""I take full responsibility for my actions as first minister and the decision to keep him in post until the election was over,"" she added. Jonathan Bell told the RHI inquiry he was stopped from closing the scheme by several DUP special advisers Earlier on Tuesday, Mrs Foster was challenged to explain why she forgot about a meeting in which she was told of problems with the RHI scheme. The meeting happened in early June 2015 after Mrs Foster became finance minister. She told the public inquiry -which was set up to investigate the scheme's failings in January 2017- the warning was the first time she had been made aware of possible problems. Northern Ireland's former first minister headed up the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Deti) when the RHI scheme was designed in 2012. Crucial controls to limit the scheme's cost were not introduced, somethingshe has since said is her ""deepest political regret"". But Mrs Foster - who spent six months as finance minister from June 2015 before being elevated to party leader and first minister - fiercely contested claims by Jonathan Bell, her party colleague and successor as enterprise minister, that she ordered him to keep the scheme open. In the wake of his allegations, she faced calls to step aside to allow a judge-led public inquiry into the scheme. Her time as first minister was brought to an abrupt end when the late Martin McGuinness of Sinn FÃ©in resigned as deputy first minister, forcing an election last March. She remains DUP leader, butthere has been no return to Stormont for almost 600 days, due to the ongoing impasse between her party and Sinn FÃ©in. Mrs Foster said she was told about the issues by former DUP special adviser (Spad) Timothy Cairns, who was then working in the enterprise department. He told Mrs Foster that officials in enterprise had ""dropped the ball"" and failed to ensure the proper approvals were in place for spending on RHI. Mrs Foster said she had ""no clear recollection"" of the meeting, although she did not dispute that it happened. She said she had conflated the meeting in early June, with another later that month where Mr Cairns had asked for help from Mrs Foster's ministerial adviser Andrew Crawford, who had just spent seven years in enterprise. Inquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin asked why she had no recollection of the early June meeting. The RHI public inquiry is being chaired by Sir Patrick Coghlin and has heard 93 days of evidence so far She said she did not believe it had been presented to her as a ""big issue"". Sir Patrick said: ""If someone comes along and tells you that a scheme which had developed under your bailiwick is in difficulties to the extent that the department has dropped the ball, one might have thought, you would have thought that was quite important."" Mrs Foster said she could not explain why she had forgotten about the meeting, but added she had many matters to deal with in her role as finance minister. Three former DUP special advisers - John Robinson, Stephen Brimstone, Timothy Johnston - will appear before the RHI inquiry later this week Also on Tuesday, Mrs Foster conceded there was ""room for improvement"" in how unelected special advisers (Spads) are appointed by political parties at Stormont. The inquiry has already heard claims that the DUP had its own practice of appointing advisers to ministers, which directly went against the ministerial code that states ministers are supposed to choose who they want to advise them. Mr Bell had claimed he would not have chosen Timothy Cairns as his Spad, but he signed a pre-written letter drafted by the party confirming he was choosing Mr Cairns. Mrs Foster told the inquiry she acknowledged the need for improvement, but said it had to come ""across the board"" from all political parties at Stormont. Sir Patrick said it seemed to him that there had been a common approach by the parties that there was ""an act and a mandatory code, but no-one pays a great deal of attention to it"". Mrs Foster said she could understand the panel's ""frustration"" about the code, but said there had been legislative changes throughout the past 10 years to how advisers were appointed. ""Should there be more, yes I think there probably should, in terms of transparency,"" she added. In addition to Mrs Foster, three senior DUP officials will also be giving evidence to the inquiry this week: Wednesday: Former Spad and current DUP director of communications, John Robinson Thursday: Former Spad Stephen Brimstone Friday: Former Spad and current DUP chief executive, Timothy Johnston On Tuesday, the DUP leader also said she understood why the conduct of her former closest adviser - Andrew Crawford - was a matter of huge concern for the RHI inquiry. He was her most senior adviser in the finance department in summer 2015, as the scheme's costs were rocketing. At that time, he was engaged in conversations with the poultry industry, one of the biggest beneficiaries of the scheme. She said she knew Mr Crawford was having discussions with others in the party about energy issues but not specifically about RHI cost controls. But her evidence is that she never asked him for details and he did not provide it. The inquiry has heard how Mr Crawford had a series of engagements with fellow DUP adviser Timothy Cairns about potential cuts in subsidies for businesses on the scheme - many of them poultry farms. Mr Crawfordpredicted a huge spike in applications- something which later occurred putting the scheme hugely over-budget. Andrew Crawford was an adviser to then-enterprise minister Arlene Foster when the RHI scheme was set up He also offered anecdotal evidence that empty poultry sheds were being heated to maximise subsidy returns, and suggested a scheme change that would have ensured poultry farmers maintained their potential income from the scheme even after it was amended. Inquiry panellist Keith MacLean said not only had Mr Crawford been giving ""bad advice"", but was suggesting something that worked against efforts to control the scheme spend. Mrs Foster said he never raised allegations of scheme abuse, or the potential of an applications spike with her. She told the inquiry she now believed both of those issues should have been raised with her as finance minister, both because of the alleged abuse and the potential impact of spending commitments on public finances. Dr MacLean said it was not hard to see why the inquiry was concerned about the calibre of people being appointed as Spads. He said: ""It gives us a big question as to what on earth was your Spad doing in this involvement without your knowledge?"" ""I accept that,"" Mrs Foster said. The inquiry has also heard evidence Mr Crawfordsent confidential government documents to family members who were RHI claimants. The documents warned them about the plans to introduce cost controls to remove the lucrative subsidies. Inquiry counsel David Scoffield asked Mrs Foster that if the panel finds Mr Crawford breached standards, to what degree she holds some responsibility for his actions as his former minister. Mrs Foster said she was accountable for Mr Crawford's behaviour, as she was for all her departmental officials. But she said she failed to see how she could ""be responsible for that breach"", if a special adviser acted outside the rules. ""If he had committed a criminal offence as a Spad, I don't see how the panel would be asking me to be responsible for that,"" she said. ""I'm accountable but I'm not responsible.""

"The controversial lifestyle brand founded by Oscar-winning actress Gwyneth Paltrow has opened its first UK store. Goop's pop-up store in Notting Hill, west London, opens on Tuesday until late January. Its online store is also available to European customers for the first time in its 10-year history. Goop has been criticised by doctors and scientists who allege that it uses pseudo-science to peddle products. Goop began in September 2008 as a newsletter produced by Paltrow for her friends. It has since grown into an lifestyle and beauty business reportedly worth Â£190m ($250m), with a website, online store, pop-up shops, a magazine and a series of so-called ""wellness summits"". The website has content on beauty, food, fashion and travel, and sells a range of health-related products along with make-up, jewellery, clothing, bags and even sex toys. Paltrow is part of a long list of celebrities with businesses in health, fitness and fashion, including actress Jessica Alba's Honest Beauty and Beyonce's 22 Days Nutrition. Gwyneth Paltrow has increasingly come under scrutiny from scientists and doctors who say she uses pseudoscience to sell products. Followinga lawsuit earlier this year, the website was forced to pay $145,000 (Â£112,000) for making unscientific claims about vaginal ""eggs"". Goop claimed the eggs, which are made from jade and rose quartz and can be inserted into the vagina, could balance hormones and regulate menstrual cycles. The company said it had not received any complaints about those claims. ""It's important to hold companies accountable for unsubstantiated claims, especially when the claims have the potential to affect women's health,"" said Tony Rackauckas, the Orange County District Attorney who led the legal action. Goop has also attracted controversy for promoting coffee enema machines and for recommending women steam-clean their vaginas to rebalance hormones and clean their uteruses. Recently, Paltrow revealed that plans to create a magazine in partnership with Conde Nast fell apart after the publisher insisted on fact-checking Goop articles. The magazine closed after two issues were published online. ""They're a company that's really in transition and do things in a very old-school way,"" she told the New York Times. ""We realised we could just do a better job of it ourselves in-house."" Goop has since hired a lawyer to vet all claims on its website, and recruited an editor from Conde Nast to run its magazine. While some retailers are finding trading difficult, Goop joins other online businesses such as Amazon in opening bricks and mortar stores. ""A lot of the online retailers will do this more and more, because rather than have a permanent physical store open just the once, a pop up becomes an event,"" says retail expert Clare Bailey. ""It's a great way to acquire customers who wouldn't buy from an online store but want to see products and have a chat about them, and to build customer loyalty."" Shoppers are greeted by a series of olive trees - some of the many flowers, trees and herbs nestled around the shop's four floors. Goop designed the ""California-inspired"" store with London-based interior designer Fran Hickman. Its minimalistic white walls, wooden set-pieces, potted plants and pastel hues lend a sense of calm. Walk around and you'll spot racks of clothing, jewellery and books on health and wellbeing written by owner Gwyneth Paltrow. There's also a range of homewares on offer as well as an array of health and beauty products including Goop's own skincare range, which it says are made from ""organic ingredients"".

"Jeremy Corbyn is expected to use his conference speech in Liverpool to pledge an expansion of free childcare. Labour has previously said it would offer 30 hours of ""genuinely free"" childcare to all parents of two, three and four-year-olds in England. Mr Corbyn will say Labour will also offer extra, means-tested subsidised hours on top of this allowance. These will be free for the poorest households and cost no more than Â£4 per hour for higher incomes, Labour says. Corbyn: More EU talks if deal rejected Currently most working parents in England and Wales are entitled to 30 free childcare hours for three and four-year-old children during term time. Campaigners say this has left some childcare providers struggling to remain open because of increased running costs and a lack of government funding. Mr Corbyn will say the current offer is ""free in name only"", describing Labour's ""universal"" offer as a ""vital and long overdue change"". He will also promise to improve the pay and skill levels of childcare staff. ""Opportunity matters most in the earliest years of life,"" he will say. ""It is a crucial time to open up children's life chances. Driving up standards of childcare will make that vital difference for millions of our children."" Households where a parent earns more than Â£100,000 are also not currently eligible for free child care. Labour say the plans will cost Â£4.5bn. It would be paid for, a spokesman said, by ""taxes on the top 5% of earners and big companies"". CBI deputy director general Josh Hardie said: ""Business has long called for support to parents to make childcare more affordable. ""The challenge will be to find ways to fund affordable childcare sustainably and sensibly. The prize will be significant for working families across the UK and can play a serious role in reducing the gender pay gap."" Children and families minister Nadhim Zahawi, responding for the Conservatives, said it was another ""unfunded promise"" from Mr Corbyn.

"This video can not be played Survivors react to Bill Cosby's prison sentence for sexual assault A judge in Pennsylvania has jailed US comedian Bill Cosby for three to 10 years for sexual assault. Cosby, 81, was also categorised as a sexually violent predator, meaning he must undergo counselling for life and be listed on the sex offender registry. The actor declined to make a statement when offered the opportunity. At a retrial in April,Cosby was found guilty of three counts of sexual assaultfor drugging and molesting Andrea Constand in 2004. Cosby's request for bail pending appeal was denied. He was also fined $25,000 (Â£19,000) plus the prosecution costs. After the sentencing, he was led away in handcuffs from the courtroom. He was then driven to Montgomery County Correctional Facility. Cosby's attorney had asked for his sentence to be restricted to house arrest, saying he was too frail for prison. The actor had been under house arrest since April. Seven questions answered about Cosby case The comedian became a household name in 1980s America when he starred in the Cosby Show TV sitcom, playing the father in a well-to-do African-American family living in Brooklyn, New York. Such was his popularity that he was dubbed ""America's Dad"". ""This was a serious crime,"" Judge Steven O'Neill was quoted as saying,externalby CNN after pronouncing the sentence in the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown. ""Mr Cosby, this has all circled back to you. The day has come, the time has come."" In June 2017, the former Temple University basketball administrator described how Cosby, whom she had viewed as a ""mentor"", had given her pills that left her ""frozen"" and unable to stop his assault. Inher impact statement,external, as carried by the National Post, she said: ""To truly understand the impact that the sexual assault has had on my life, you have to understand the person that I was before it happened."" Andrea Constand said the assault ""robbed"" her of her trust in others After the sentencing, Cosby (centre) was taken to Montgomery County Correctional Facility ""I was at the top of my game, certain that the groundwork provided by my education and athletic training would stand me in good stead whatever challenges lay ahead..."" she said. ""After the assault, I wasn't sure what had actually happened but the pain spoke volumes. The shame was overwhelming. Self-doubt and confusion kept me from turning to my family or friends as I normally did. I felt completely alone, unable to trust anyone, including myself."" The ticking clock for rape survivors The rise and fall of Quaaludes She wrote that she had stopped eating, sleeping and socialising. Tormented by nightmares, she finally told her mother the truth about what had happened. ""Bill Cosby took my beautiful, healthy young spirit and crushed it,"" she said. ""He robbed me of my health and vitality, my open nature, and my trust in myself and others."" ""Instead of looking back, I am looking forward to looking forward,"" she added. ""I want to get to the place where the person I was meant to be gets a second chance."" Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele paid tribute to Ms Constand, saying: ""We are all better off because she is in our lives. You've heard about how this assault changed her life... To put herself out like this, for years, in front of a worldwide audience is extremely difficult for anyone. ""She could've lived a quiet life but she knew it was important to see that justice was served."" Nada Tawfik, BBC News, Pennsylvania Bill Cosby showed little emotion and no remorse during his sentencing. At this defining moment in his life, there were no family members or former cast mates with him for moral support. The court was filled, though, with several of his accusers who sat in the rows behind Andrea Constand. Model Janice Dickenson clapped her hands in anticipation and joy, others quietly held hands. Their relief was evident when his sentence was finally read out. This was a moment they never thought possible. And they had front seats to witness it. The three counts on which Cosby was convicted were merged into one after an agreement between the defence and prosecutors, AFP News agency reports. Cosby can apply for parole after three years - such a request would be reviewed by a special committee. However, he could end up serving the maximum 10-year-sentence. Psychologist Kristen Dudley testified that Cosby showed signs of a mental disorder and was likely to reoffend. Ahead of the sentence, the judge designated him a sexually violent predator, despite the defence's argument that Cosby's age and blindness meant he was not a threat. Bill Cosby: The fall of 'America's Dad' Tuesday's classification means he will need to register with state police and notify any community he lives in of his sex offender status, as well as undergo mandatory counselling for life. Neighbours, childcare centres and schools will have to be notified of his whereabouts. Cosby's wife, Camille, did not attend the sentencing. Kevin Steele praised the victim's courage Cosby's spokesman, Andrew Wyatt, dismissed the trial as ""the most racist and sexist"" in the history of the US, and said the convicted man was a victim of a ""sex war"". District Attorney Steele summed up Cosby's fall from fame to ignominy: ""For decades the defendant has been able to hide his true self and hide his crimes using his fame and fortune. ""He's hidden behind a character... but it was fiction... He used his acting skills, that endearing TV persona, to win over his victims and keep them silent... ""Someone who has a lot of money, someone who is famous, someone who can get a lot of attention all over the world just by showing up some place to eat shouldn't get a free pass for his crimes or be allowed to walk free."" 'MeToo' and the scale of sexual abuse What has #MeToo actually changed? Some 60 other women have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct but charges have not been brought because of the statute of limitations.

"Cosby became a global star in the 1980s Bill Cosby was once known to millions as ""America's Dad"", but the comedian had his reputation shattered when he was sentenced to three to 10 years in jail after being convicted of sexual assault. That judgement has now been overturned, and the 83-year-old has walked free from prison after serving two years of the sentence. His role as the benevolent, jumper-wearing Dr Cliff Huxtable in 1980s hit sitcom The Cosby Show made him a national treasure in the US. But more than a dozen women accused Mr Cosby of misconduct, and one case made it to court. Although a jury failed to reach a verdict in June 2017,a retrial originally led to a conviction less than a year later.But in June 2021,Pennsylvania's highest court ruled he had been denied a fair trial, quashing the guilty verdict. How did this man, a household name for so long in America, rise and fall so far? Born in 1937 in a social housing complex in Philadelphia, the young William Henry Cosby Jr shone shoes and worked at a local supermarket to help his family make ends meet. His early life was touched by tragedy when one of his four brothers died and he, the oldest, became a father figure. Accounts of his school years portray a joker and a storyteller who loved to entertain classmates. After school he joined the US Navy, then went to university and worked part-time as a bartender. Filling in for a club comedian, he laid the path for his future fame. His debut on NBC's Tonight Show in 1963 led to a recording contract with Warner Brothers, and the release of a series of award-winning comedy albums. On one of those, 1968's To Russell, My Brother, Whom I Slept With, he established the themes that would define his work - the father as a loving disciplinarian; siblings who could plot together one minute, then scream blue murder the next; and a confidence in the bonds of family. Cosby, shown here in 1973, began his career in the nightclubs of Greenwich Village The album sleeve noted: ""During his time on stage, Cosby never once told a joke. He didn't sing or dance or do tricks. All he did was talk"" - but the performer had the 10,000-strong audience in the palm of his hand throughout. By the time the album was released, Mr Cosby was already a TV star. In 1965, he had become the first black actor to star in a drama series, when he was cast in the espionage show I Spy. He played Alexander Scott, an undercover agent posing as a tennis instructor, alongside Robert Culp, who played fellow agent Kelly Robinson. Premiering during a time of great upheaval for race relations in the US, it was banned by some stations in the southern states. But Cosby went on to earn three consecutive best actor Emmys for his role - a record that still stands. Although black actors had appeared in TV comedies before, Cosby's role in the primetime drama I Spy was groundbreaking Despite his prominence on TV, Mr Cosby made a conscious decision not to directly address race relations in his act - preferring a more subtle challenge to the status quo. ""A white person listens to my act, and he laughs, and he thinks: 'Yeah, that's the way I see it, too,'"" he once said. ""OK. He's white. I'm Negro. And we both see things the same way. That must mean that we are alike. Right? ""So I figure this way, I'm doing as much for good race relations as the next guy."" The Cosby Show, which was launched by NBC in 1984 and aired for eight seasons, was his biggest success and established him as a household name. Based on his stand-up routines, Mr Cosby's portrayal of an educated, affluent doctor - Heathcliff ""Cliff"" Huxtable - and the trials of raising five young children drew parallels with his own life. His TV wife, Claire, was loosely based on his own wife Camille, whom he married in 1964. Bill Cosby's wife Camille has stood by him The sitcom was watched by about30 million viewers,externaleach week. By 1989, its star was earning $4m (Â£2.5m) a month in syndication rights alone. When the show was cancelled in 1992, Mr Cosby embarked on a number of projects including film roles, but was never able to emulate the success of his star vehicle. In 2013, he receivedrave reviews,externalfor his first TV stand-up show in 30 years, which led to a national tour. But his comeback fell apart as several women came forward with allegations of sexual assault going back almost 30 years. The accusations first surfaced in 2005, when Andrea Constand, a staff member at Cosby's former university, said she had been drugged and molested by the star at his home a year earlier. Prosecutors declined to press charges, citing lack of evidence, but Ms Constand filed a civil case against the comedian. Due to statute of limitations law, Andrea Constand was the only alleged sex assault victim who could bring charges against Cosby Thirteen women, 12 of whom remained anonymous, agreed to be witnesses, each with a similar account of sexual assault. Mr Cosby denied the accusations, which his lawyer called ""preposterous"", and the case was settled out of court in 2006 for an undisclosed sum. In subsequent years, some of Ms Constand's fellow witnesses told their stories to the media. But the accusations were not comprehensively reported until Mr Cosby's planned TV comeback thrust him back into the limelight. More than 50 women accused the star of sexual assault or rape, but due to time limits on cases, only one - Andrea Constand - took the case to criminal court. Why is there a time limit on sexual assault cases in the US? Mr Cosby's lawyers consistently denied the charges, asking why the women had not made legal complaints at the time when they said they were assaulted. In 2014 Mr Cosby said he had not addressed the allegations in public because ""a guy doesn't have to answer to innuendos"". But shortly afterwards, previously unseencourt papers from 2005came to light and showed he had admitted obtaining sedatives to give to young women he wanted to have sex with. The sedatives, called Quaaludes, render people unable to move. The rise and fall of Quaaludes Timeline of Cosby accusations The accusations disrupted his hopes of a return to show business. Cable station TV Land pulled repeats of The Cosby Show, some of his stand-up shows were called off and protesters showed up to the ones that he still put on. His statue was removed from the MGM Hollywood Studios park in Florida, and several colleges removed honorary degrees they had given him. Cosby addressing Temple University students at a commencement ceremony in 2003 His portraits were taken down from the walls in his alma mater, Temple University in Philadelphia, and he resigned from the board of trustees. At first, it appeared unlikely that any criminal action would be taken against Mr Cosby, partly because most US states have of statutes of limitation in cases of rape and sexual assault. However, one case came to criminal trial - that of Andrea Constand. The case was seen as one of the biggest US celebrity court case since the murder trial of former American football player OJ Simpson in 1995. In June 2017, Ms Constandtold her story in court for the first time, having previously been barred from doing so due to the 2006 settlement. She said Mr Cosby had given her pills that he claimed were herbal and said would ""take the edge off"", but which left her virtually paralysed. ""In my head, I was trying to get my hands to move or my legs to move, but I was frozen"", she said. About 20 minutes later, she said, he put his hand on her genitals. ""I wasn't able to fight it in any way,"" she told the court. ""I wanted it to stop."" Mr Cosby continued to deny the allegations. He did not give evidence in court buthad one witness. In the end, with Mr Cosby possibly facing the rest of his life in prison if found guilty, the jury was deadlocked, and a mistrial was declared in June 2017. The retrial, which began on 9 April 2018, took place in a changed atmosphere. A flood of sexual misconduct accusations against powerful men in the entertainment industry such as Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey had triggered the #MeToo movement. The trial in Pennsylvania became one of the first celebrity cases of the #MeToo era. The decision by the judge to allow five more women to testify against him was seen as a key development. On this occasion, the jury took two days to find the comedian guilty on all three counts of sexual assault. Months later, he was sentenced to a total of three to 10 years in prison. After serving two years of the jail sentence, in June Pennsylvania's highest court overturned his conviction for sexual assault. Hours later, Mr Cosby was driven away from the prison. The court found that Mr Cosby had been denied due process and should not have been put on trial because he had reached an agreement with the previous prosecutor in 2005 that he would not be charged. ""He must be discharged, and any future prosecution on these particular charges must be barred"", it wrote ina 79-page ruling,external. But despite the outcome, some legal analysts said Mr Cosby would not be able to go back to the life he knew before. His reputation would be ""forever tarnished"", said defence lawyer Rikki Klieman of CBS News. ""He does not go back to being America's Dad, everything that he lost in terms of the trappings of his life - his reputation, his TV jobs, his night club jobs, his being a spokesperson - all of that is gone.""

"Mr Cosby has maintained that his sexual encounters were consensual Bill Cosby has been convicted of sexual assault by a Pennsylvania jury. After years of allegations from dozens of women, how did we get to this point? Mr Cosby was convicted of three counts of aggravated indecent assault against Andrea Constand in a retrial at a courthouse in Pennsylvania. Bill Cosby is an American comedian and actor best known for his role as the father in the television hit The Cosby Show which ran from 1984-92 and was a huge hit in the US and around the globe. At one point he was the highest-paid actor in the US. He was born on a council estate in Philadelphia and started his career as a stand-up comedian in 1962, debuting on NBC's The Tonight Show in 1963. In 1965, he became the first black actor to star in a drama series in the US, in the espionage show I Spy. He earned three consecutive best actor Emmys for his role, at a time of high race tensions in the US. The Cosby Show was described by TV critics as ""transformational piece of American culture"". He portrayed a doctor called Cliff Huxtable raising five children with his wife. By 1989, he was earning $4m (Â£2.5m) a month in syndication rights alone. In 2013 he did a national stand-up tour and received rave reviews. After that, several women began to come forward with allegations of sexual assault, some going back nearly 30 years. Bill Cosby: America's Dad under fire He was on trial for a charge of three counts of felony indecent assault, alleged by a former colleague, Andrea Constand. Cosby has been found guilty on all three counts. It is the only criminal case Cosby has faced thus far related to sexual assault accusations dating back years. Ms Constand, a former employee of Temple University who now lives in Canada, has said that she came to think of Cosby as a ""mentor and a friend"" before she said he made unwanted sexual advances. She went to visit him at his home in 2004 to discuss her career and her future where she said he drugged and sexually assaulted her. A criminal complaint unsealed last year details the encounter. She and Cosby settled a lawsuit in 2006 and she was paid an undisclosed sum. Prosecutors re-opened her case last summer when they realised the statute of limitations had not run out and after other women had come forward. Cosby victim 'paralysed' by drugs In other states, he faces defamation lawsuits for branding his accusers liars. Over the years, nearly 60 women have come forward accusing Mr Cosby of sexual assault. Thirty-five of those womentold their stories to New York Magazine,externalin 2015. They alleged he assaulted them in their own homes and even in public. In another case, an accuser named Judy Huth said Cosby molested her when she was 15 years old, forcing her to perform a sexual act on him at the Playboy mansion in Los Angeles. Criminal charges were not filed against Cosby because of the statute of limitations. His lawyers called Ms Huth's claims discredited or decades old. In another prominent case, a 25-year-old model named Chloe Goins sued Cosby for a sexual assault at the Playboy Mansion she says happened in 2008. She sought criminal charges but prosecutors decline to pursue them. He maintains the sexual encounters were consensual. In Ms Constand's case, he said she never said no, though she never said yes either. A deposition for her case showed that he admitted pursuing sex with younger women and giving them Quaaludes, a sedative. He said he was confident his behaviour was not rape. The New York Times described the deposition as presenting Cosby as ""as an unapologetic, cavalier playboy, someone who used a combination of fame, apparent concern and powerful sedatives in a calculated pursuit of young women"". The first trial failed to reach a verdict in the spring of 2017. In the second trial, the judge allowed more evidence to be admitted, for the defence and the prosecution. So the court heard testimony from four more accusers, evidence not allowed in the first trial, when only Ms Constand's account was heard. That meant the prosecution could establish a pattern of behaviour on the part of the disgraced comedian. There was also new evidence that worked in Cosby's favour. A new defence witness who once worked with Ms Constand had talked about fabricating evidence against a celebrity for financial gain. And a $3.38m payment that Cosby paid to her in a 2006 settlement - which the defence said showed she was a gold-digger - had not been previously disclosed. Since the first trial failed to reach a verdict in early 2017, there has been a slew of cases brought by women alleging sexual assault by high-profile men. The men and women of the jury were asked during selection how much they knew about #MeToo and directed to make their decision based only on the evidence of this case. But it would have been hard to ignore the new climate in which women have felt empowered to make accusations and a prevailing view that complaints no longer be ignored. One of Cosby's accusers, Lili Bernard, said after the verdict: ""The MeToo movement has shown that women are worthy of being believed."" Since the allegations against Cosby first arose several years ago, Cosby's work - including TV shows, films, and stand-up performances - has been pulled from many US networks, including TV Land, Centric, and Bounce TV. Netflix and NBC both ended planned projects with Cosby after the assault charges as well. In 2015, he was dropped by his talent agency, CAA. Streaming television giant Hulu also eventually dropped The Cosby Show, though at the time they claimed it was unrelated to the rape allegations. As writer and producer Larry Wilmore told the LA Times last year: ""His legacy is forever going to be tarnished."" In addition to Cosby's erasure on television, he also lost several honorary titles and degrees following the accusations. In 2014, the Navy revoked his honorary title of Chief Petty Officer. Several US universities revoked Cosby's honorary degrees in the years leading up to the trial, including Brown University, the University of Connecticut, Tufts University, Oberlin College, Marquette University, and Fordham University. Shortly after Thursday's guilty verdict, Wesleyan University announced they would do the same.

"This video can not be played Would Jeremy Corbyn vote Leave or Remain now? The UK government would have to return to the EU negotiating table if Parliament rejects its Brexit deal, Jeremy Corbyn has told the BBC. Mr Corbyn said Labour would decide whether to back the deal based on its six tests - which the party says the government is currently nowhere near meeting. He denied this made the possibility of no Brexit deal more likely. He also refused to say how he would vote if there is another EU referendum. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""We are the opposition party, our job is to challenge the government."" ""It's a hypothetical question,"" he said. Mr Corbyn was speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg ahead of his speech at the Labour conference in Liverpool on Wednesday. Also at the party conference, Labour delegates approved a motion that would keep all options - including a fresh referendum - on the table if MPs are deadlocked over Brexit. Reality Check: What is Labour's Brexit plan? Labour votes to keep Remain vote option Kuenssberg: So where does Labour now stand on Brexit? The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and negotiations are still taking place between the two sides. Parliament is set to vote on the outcome of the talks, with Prime Minister Theresa May saying this will be a choice between her deal and leaving without one. Earlier, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer it looked ""increasingly likely""Labour's testswould not be met and it would vote against the deal in Parliament. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Corbyn said he did not know what the deal would look like, but if it was rejected by MPs, the government ""will have to go back to the EU and say 'our parliament can't agree to this'"". He predicted the government would ""collapse itself"" and cause a general election. Mr Corbyn denied he was pushing the UK closer to leaving without a deal - a scenario Labour has repeatedly warned about - saying: ""What we're making more likely is that we will force a deal that protects jobs and living standards on both sides of the Channel."" He added: ""What are we supposed to do - keep quiet and say nothing and leave it to the incompetence of this government?"" Speaking on a visit to New York, Prime Minister Theresa May told the BBC Labour was ""playing politics"" over the final UK-EU deal. ""The Labour Party are saying they will vote against any deal that I bring back from Europe, regardless of how good it is for the United Kingdom, and they would support any deal that Europe gave to us, regardless of how bad it was for the United Kingdom,"" she said. ""That's not working for the national interest - that's playing politics."" Labour says it could call for another EU referendum if the Brexit deal is rejected and there is no general election - and it is not ruling out that one option could be to stay in the EU. Theresa May has ruled out a public vote on the outcome of her Brexit negotiations - but it is not yet clear what will happen if Parliament votes it down. Pro-EU campaigners say MPs will have ""multiple opportunities"" to legislate for a so-called ""People's Vote"", including by amending laws that have been promised to implement the UK's withdrawal. Mr Corbyn denied leaving the door open to this scenario was letting down Leave voters, saying Labour was telling them ""that we will deal with the situation as it comes up and we will understand, many of them, the reasons why they voted Leave"". The Labour leader cited de-industrialisation and anger at the loss of quality skilled jobs as factors behind the 2016 referendum result. On the possibility of another referendum, he added: ""We haven't said there's going to be anything yet. ""What we've said is all options must be considered if and when this government collapses or its negotiations collapse - the options are still there.""

"Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died in a hospital in Nice after collapsing on a BA flight Pret A Manger did not label ""artisan"" baguettes as containing sesame seeds despite six allergic reaction cases in the year before a girl died, an inquest has heard. Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, 15, reacted to the sesame in the outlet's baguette which she bought at Heathrow Airport before flying to France in July 2016. She collapsed on the flight, suffered a cardiac arrest anddied within hours. A Pret A Manger representative said allergen policy had since been changed. There were nine cases of sesame-related allergy incidents in the year before Natasha died, including six that involved ""artisan baguettes"", according to a complaint log for the company. In one of these cases a woman nearly died after suffering an anaphylactic reaction from a baguette in October 2015, West London Coroner's Court heard. Natasha's mother, brother and father have been unable to bear unpacking her holiday bag Jeremy Hyam QC said the customer's family afterwards gave Pret A Manger a ""specific warning"", but the chain still failed to label sandwiches with allergy information. The firm's head of Risk and Compliance, Jonathan Perkins, said Pret reviewed its warning notices in April 2016. ""When we get it wrong, we like to put it right,"" Mr Perkins said. However, Nadim Ednan-Laperouse claims there was no label on the fridge the day his daughter died. Sesame is one of 14 allergens that consumers must be made aware of when it is used as an ingredient in food products, according toEU Regulations,external However, the EU rules say individual member states are responsible for deciding on how information about non pre-packaged food is provided to the customer The UK'sFood Regulations 2014,externalallow freshly handmade, non pre-packaged food to not be individually labelled Pret confirmed at the time of Natasha's death products would not have been individually labelled with allergen or ingredient information, and that this was within regulations However, Pret said there were signs in the fridge and at till points telling consumers with allergies to speak to a manager for advice or to seeits allergen guide,external Natasha, from Fulham in west London, had just finished school for the summer and was on her way to Nice for a four-day ""special treat"" with her best friend, Bethany, and her father. The teenager, who suffered from numerous allergies, bought the artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette from a Pret branch at the airport's Terminal 5. She became ill 20 minutes into the flight before pleading with her father to help her. Mr Ednan-Laperouse had previouslydescribed the ""agony""of putting a phone to his daughter's ear so that his wife and son could say goodbye to her when he realised she might not survive. Mr Hyam said: ""There was a clear concern being repeatedly raised that artisan baguettes were causing sesame seed allergy problems, which were not properly responded to by Pret."" Mr Perkins replied: ""We responded appropriately to each individual complaint at the time."" Latest news and stories across London Food regulations do not require eateries like Pret, where food is handmade and packaged on the premises, to put allergen information on each individual food item. Pret opts to provide the information orally and is supposed to have stickers within fridges telling customers to ask staff members for details. UK regulations mean some foods can be sold without individual labels denoting which allergens they contain Mr Hyam suggested Pret's approach lacked consistency, as it labelled some products ""gluten free"" and gave ingredient outlines on fridge shelves. A photo of the branch where Natasha bought her sandwich, taken eight days after her death, appeared to show a fridge without the allergy sticker. The general manager of the branch at the time said on Monday that he was ""confident and sure"" he had put stickers on the tills and fridges - but the inquest heard a health officer from Hillingdon Council visited in May 2017 and reported ""no till stickers to be seen at the till area"". Mr Perkins said the changes made to Pret's allergy policy were ""sound and just"" but ""there is more that can be done"". ""The parent in me would want to change everything... the professional in me has to remain grounded,"" he added. ""The learning for me is that humans are fallible in their actions, we will at some times get things wrong."" The inquest is expected to last until Friday.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned against ignoring the lessons of 20th Century history Last year's assault by the president on the United Nations and its multilateralism - the effort to bring groups of countries together to pursue a common goal - was vastly amplified this year. It was amplified partly  by Mr Trump's complete condemnation of globalism in general and of the International Criminal Court in particular, but also by his even stronger championing of individual national sovereignty, love of country and patriotism. For Mr Trump that is the only path to freedom and securing the rights of America's people. The UN secretary general provided a clear counter-narrative in his speech. Antonio Guterres was careful not to target President Trump by name but his message was transparent. He warned of a world walking the road of populism and isolationism once more, ignoring the lessons of 20th Century history - particularly in the 1930s - and risking a descent towards another global conflict. After today's speeches the canyon which divides multilateralism's detractors and its defenders is more starkly visible, more blindingly lit, than ever before. ""Iran's leaders sow chaos, death and destruction,"" he said. This video can not be played US-Iran sanctions: What do they mean? ""They do not respect their neighbours or borders or the sovereign rights of nations. Instead, Iran's leaders plunder the nation's resources to enrich themselves and spread mayhem across the Middle East and far beyond."" Iranian President Hassan Rouhani responded by criticising the Trump administration for its hostility towards Iran while urging the US to return to negotiations. Mr Rouhani said dialogue should begin by ending threats and what he called ""unjust sanctions"", adding that no nation could be brought to the negotiating table by force. ""The United States' understanding of international relations is authoritarian. In its estimation might makes right. Its understanding of power, not of legal and legitimate authority, is reflected in bullying and imposition,"" he said in New York. In August, the US reinstated sanctions targeting the Iranian government's purchase of US dollars, Iran's trade in gold and other precious metals, and its automotive sector. In November, a second batch of potentially more damaging sanctions will be reimposed on Iran's oil and shipping sectors as well as its central bank. Mr Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, warned Iran's leaders about the consequences of ""crossing"" the US. ""I might imagine they would take me seriously when I assure them today that if you cross us, our allies or our partners, if you harm our citizens, if you continue to lie, cheat and deceive, yes, there will indeed be Hell to pay,"" he told a conference in New York. Iran has accused Mr Trump of waging ""psychological warfare"" against it.and denies any involvement in terrorism. It insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful. Remaining members in the nuclear deal - the UK, China, France, Germany and Russia - say they will set upa new payment system to maintain business with Iran and bypass US sanctions. Iran nuclear deal: Key details Iran deal: EU shields firms from US law The system would facilitate oil companies and businesses to continue trading without relying on the US-led global market and dollar, but exactly how the system would work is still being determined. The US leader said his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June had led to developments unimaginable only a few months ago. He said North Korean missiles and rockets had stopped flying in all directions, and North Korean nuclear testing had ceased. ""With support from many countries here today we have engaged with North Korea to replace the spectre of conflict with a bold and new push for peace,"" he said. North Korea crisis in 300 words North Korea's missile and nuclear programme North Korea 'continuing nuclear programme' ""I would like to thank Chairman Kim for his courage and for the steps he has taken, though much work remains to be done."" Sanctions, he said, would stay in place until North Korea's ""denuclearisation occurs"". On Monday,Mr Trump said he expected a second summit with Mr Kim soon. On world trade, he said his administration would not tolerate any further ""abuses"". He accused China of widespread product dumping and the theft of intellectual property, all of which, he argued, had led to a massive US trade deficit. He accused the oil-producing cartel Opec of ""ripping off"" the world while many of its member countries relied on American military support. He rejected the idea of globalism and praised the virtues of patriotism. He said illegal immigration helped fund criminal networks while it made life difficult for local populations. Migration, he said, should not be governed by international bodies. At the same time, countries that migrants were leaving should be helped to build a better future for their people. Mr Trump also praised India for raising millions of people out of poverty ""and into the middle class"", hailed Saudi Arabia's ""bold, new"" reforms, commended Israel as a ""thriving democracy"" and said Poland was a country that stood up for its own sovereignty. Speaking after Mr Trump, France's centrist president said that he would ""never stop upholding the principle of sovereignty"" but it should not be used as a weapon. Mr Macron argued for multilateralism ""I will not leave the principle of sovereignty of peoples in the hands of nationalists who use it to attack the universality of our values,"" he said. Arguing for dialogue, he said: ""I do not believe in the law of the strongest... I believe in a third way which obliges us to push through a new model, a new global balance. ""We will not win in the 21st Century except with a strong multilateralism.""

"Donatella Versace with Versace chief Jonathan Akeroyd (left) and Michael Kors chief executive John Idol US fashion giant Michael Kors has confirmed a $2.1bn takeover of Versace in a move that has outraged some fans of the Italian fashion house. Creative director, Donatella Versace, has run Versace since the 1997 murder of her brother Gianni. She called the sale a ""very exciting moment"" and said it would ""allow Versace to reach its full potential"". Donatella will continue to lead Versace's ""creative vision"", said Michael Kors chief executive John Idol. Mr Idol said Versace represented the ""epitome of Italian fashion luxury"" and its acquisition was an important milestone for the company, which is being renamed Capri Holdings. Private equity firm Blackstone Group, which bought a 20% stake in the firm four years ago, will sell its holding. The new owner plans to increase the number of Versace outlets from 200 to 300 stores. It also plans to more than double turnover to $2bn, partly by boosting the percentage of footwear and accessories - a category that is often more affordable and faster-selling - from 35% to 60% of revenues. Donatella Versace and Elton John in 1991 Versace's vivid and distinctive brand has been worn by some of the world's highest-profile stars and graced the pages of newspapers and magazines more often than almost any other luxury fashion brand. A key moment came in 1994 when the unknown Elizabeth Hurley accompanied boyfriend Hugh Grant to the premiere of Four Weddings and a Funeral. The tabloids could not believe the sight. Versace, until then just another Italian fashion brand, became synonymous with ""That Dress"". Liz Hurley in ""That Dress"" - with Hugh Grant - at the Four Weddings and A Funeral premiere The brand has since been most valued by the glitzier ranks of the famous, with Michael Jackson and Princess Diana among its fans. She attended Gianni Versace's funeral, along with Elton John, who has also been a keen wearer of Versace. The newer generation include Nicki Minaj, a clutch of Kardashians and Jenners, and the Beckham family, the latter are among the mere 161 people Donatella follows on Twitter. Allow Instagram content?

But those fearing a despoiling of the Versace magic may be worrying unnecessarily. Michael Kors is also known as a luxury brand, although a lot of its ranges carry lower price tags, which give the label a far wider customer base. He designed the first women's ready-to-wear collection for high-end Paris fashion house Celine. Customers have included Taylor Swift, Angelina Jolie, the leading Trump women and Michelle Obama. The business expanded last year by buying luxury shoemaker Jimmy Chooanother tabloid fashion favourite, for almost Â£900m. The Versace purchase will help position Michael Kors as a competitor to French luxury conglomerates LVMH and Kering and the Swiss company Richemont, analysts said. Versace reported sales of â¬686m for 2016 and its chief executive Jonathan Akeroyd, who will also stay on, said earlier this year that annual turnover was soon expected to exceed â¬1bn. With Donatella remaining at the creative helm, the Versace fans who have protested at the takeover may not notice any change. After all, why buy a well-loved business and tear up what makes it appealing? Gianni and Donatella Versace in 1996 - the year before the designer was murdered Born 1959 in Long Island, New York State. Studied acting but decided to become fashion designer at aged 14. Enrolled at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City but dropped out after only nine months to work at Lothar's boutique in Manhattan. In 1981, Kors launched his Michael Kors women's label at upmarket New York store, Bergdorf Goodman. Filed for bankruptcy protection in 1993 but relaunched four years later with a cheaper line, while also becoming the first women's ready-to-wear designer for French luxury fashion house, Celine. Left Celine in 2003 to focus on his own brand.

It was first spotted by ecologist and ornithologist Dave Andrews, who said it had been feeding around barges near Gravesend in Kent.

Vessels are being kept clear, with the British Divers Marine Life Rescue urging the public not to get too close and ""to watch it from the shore"". The beluga whale was pictured swimming in the Thames off Coalhouse Fort in Essex Crowds gathered to look from the river bank after the whale was spotted in the River Thames near Gravesend, east of London Tanya Ferry, environment manager at the Port of London Authority which is monitoring the whale, said it was unclear what the whale could eat. ""We do have quite a lot of plastic bags, which could be quite an issue,"" she said.

Richard Sabin, principal curator of mammals at the Natural History Museum, said photos and videos he had seen appeared to show a beluga whale. ""The white body colour, absence of a prominent dorsal fin, bulbous forehead and general swimming motion all suggest this very strongly,"" he said. ""The beluga is an Arctic/sub-Arctic species, so is a long way outside its usual range of distribution."" Belugas, also known as white whales, are ""one of the most familiar and easily distinguishable"" of all whales, according to National Geographic. They range from 13ft (3.9m) to 20ft (6.1m) in length and have distinctive rounded foreheads. Belugas are commonly found in coastal waters of the Arctic Ocean, but are also at home in large rivers. They can move between salt and fresh water. They are common to Alaska, Russia, Canada, and Greenland. The whales were nicknamed ""canaries of the sea"" by early whalers due to their squeaks and squawks. Beluga calls variously resemble a cork being prized from a bottle or a creaking door, along with sounds described as clicks, squeaks, chirps, bleats, moans, groans, and whistles.

"Jeremy Corbyn is expected to use his conference speech in Liverpool to pledge an expansion of free childcare. Labour has previously said it would offer 30 hours of ""genuinely free"" childcare to all parents of two, three and four-year-olds in England. Mr Corbyn will say Labour will also offer extra, means-tested subsidised hours on top of this allowance. These will be free for the poorest households and cost no more than Â£4 per hour for higher incomes, Labour says. Corbyn: More EU talks if deal rejected Currently most working parents in England and Wales are entitled to 30 free childcare hours for three and four-year-old children during term time. Campaigners say this has left some childcare providers struggling to remain open because of increased running costs and a lack of government funding. Mr Corbyn will say the current offer is ""free in name only"", describing Labour's ""universal"" offer as a ""vital and long overdue change"". He will also promise to improve the pay and skill levels of childcare staff. ""Opportunity matters most in the earliest years of life,"" he will say. ""It is a crucial time to open up children's life chances. Driving up standards of childcare will make that vital difference for millions of our children."" Households where a parent earns more than Â£100,000 are also not currently eligible for free child care. Labour say the plans will cost Â£4.5bn. It would be paid for, a spokesman said, by ""taxes on the top 5% of earners and big companies"". CBI deputy director general Josh Hardie said: ""Business has long called for support to parents to make childcare more affordable. ""The challenge will be to find ways to fund affordable childcare sustainably and sensibly. The prize will be significant for working families across the UK and can play a serious role in reducing the gender pay gap."" Children and families minister Nadhim Zahawi, responding for the Conservatives, said it was another ""unfunded promise"" from Mr Corbyn.

"Arlene Foster has been the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) since December 2015 The DUP leader has said Jonathan Bell's BBC interview about a flawed green energy scheme directly led to the collapse of the NI assembly. Arlene Foster was giving evidence to the Renewable Heat Incentive inquiry. She was in charge of energy matters for NI when the scheme was set up in 2012, while Mr Bell was enterprise minister between 2015 and 2016. Overgenerous subsidies meant costs grew and left taxpayers with a Â£490m bill. Live: Foster in cash-for-ash hot seat Q&A: What is the RHI inquiry? Timeline: Renewable Heat Incentive scandal On Tuesday, Mrs Foster told the inquiry that Mr Bell - who was her successor as enterprise minister - had pressed a ""nuclear button""by going public with claims that DUP special advisers delayed his plans to close down the controversial scheme. He gave an interview to the BBC's Stephen Nolan show in December 2016, in which he also alleged the advisers secretly tried to ""cleanse the record"" of references to Mrs Foster. Mrs Foster told the inquiry that ""paranoia set in with Jonathan"" after a BBC Spotlight programme revealed the scheme's overspend, and Mr Bell felt the party was trying to blame him for the debacle. However she said that was not the case, but it was all in Mr Bell's own mind. Mr Bell has since told the inquiry that after he went public about RHI, he becamethe victim of a ""massive smear campaign"" orchestrated by the DUP. Mrs Foster, who was Northern Ireland's first minister in December 2016, said he had caused such a reaction with his allegations, some of them ""very confused"" and that he ""had to take what was coming to him"". She set out how assembly and executive officials had agreed a plan to deal with cost controls, but that when Mr Bell spoke to the BBC, that plan went ""out the window"". ""We were then on a trajectory to the assembly and executive collapsing,"" she added. Pressed further on that, she said Mr Bell had ""taken a route with Stephen Nolan which caused the downfall of the executive"". Northern Ireland has been without devolved government for more than 500 days The weeks that followed saw Sinn FÃ©in, the DUP's then partner in government, demand Mrs Foster stand aside as first minister until an investigation into the scheme was completed. She refused to do so, and on 9 January 2017, the late Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister, which led to a snap assembly election. More than a year and a half later, talks deadlines have failed and the Northern Ireland assembly remains in limbo. Earlier on Tuesday, Mrs Foster said it is a ""great regret"" to her that she did not sack Jonathan Bell as enterprise minister when she became first minister in 2016. Mr Bell replaced her as enterprise minister in May 2015. The RHI inquiry hasheard evidence from a number of witnesses that he was unsuitable for the job. Asked why she had not replaced him when she took over the party reins, Mrs Foster said an assembly election campaign was looming and that removing him at that time could have raised political questions over his suitability as a candidate for the party. Mrs Foster said there was a general view in the party that Mr Bell should not remain in post, but she said other party officials asked: ""How much harm can he do in three months?"" She also claimed there was a concern he could ""go in inverted commas 'rogue' if he was replaced as a minister"" when Mrs Foster replaced Peter Robinson. Mrs Foster said Mr Bell never accepted her leadership, nor did he take his responsibilities seriously and she claimed he acted as if he was ""to be served, rather than serve"". She said he ""hero-worshipped"" Mr Robinson and when he retired, it showed in Mr Bell's behaviour. ""I take full responsibility for my actions as first minister and the decision to keep him in post until the election was over,"" she added. Jonathan Bell told the RHI inquiry he was stopped from closing the scheme by several DUP special advisers Earlier on Tuesday, Mrs Foster was challenged to explain why she forgot about a meeting in which she was told of problems with the RHI scheme. The meeting happened in early June 2015 after Mrs Foster became finance minister. She told the public inquiry -which was set up to investigate the scheme's failings in January 2017- the warning was the first time she had been made aware of possible problems. Northern Ireland's former first minister headed up the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Deti) when the RHI scheme was designed in 2012. Crucial controls to limit the scheme's cost were not introduced, somethingshe has since said is her ""deepest political regret"". But Mrs Foster - who spent six months as finance minister from June 2015 before being elevated to party leader and first minister - fiercely contested claims by Jonathan Bell, her party colleague and successor as enterprise minister, that she ordered him to keep the scheme open. In the wake of his allegations, she faced calls to step aside to allow a judge-led public inquiry into the scheme. Her time as first minister was brought to an abrupt end when the late Martin McGuinness of Sinn FÃ©in resigned as deputy first minister, forcing an election last March. She remains DUP leader, butthere has been no return to Stormont for almost 600 days, due to the ongoing impasse between her party and Sinn FÃ©in. Mrs Foster said she was told about the issues by former DUP special adviser (Spad) Timothy Cairns, who was then working in the enterprise department. He told Mrs Foster that officials in enterprise had ""dropped the ball"" and failed to ensure the proper approvals were in place for spending on RHI. Mrs Foster said she had ""no clear recollection"" of the meeting, although she did not dispute that it happened. She said she had conflated the meeting in early June, with another later that month where Mr Cairns had asked for help from Mrs Foster's ministerial adviser Andrew Crawford, who had just spent seven years in enterprise. Inquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin asked why she had no recollection of the early June meeting. The RHI public inquiry is being chaired by Sir Patrick Coghlin and has heard 93 days of evidence so far She said she did not believe it had been presented to her as a ""big issue"". Sir Patrick said: ""If someone comes along and tells you that a scheme which had developed under your bailiwick is in difficulties to the extent that the department has dropped the ball, one might have thought, you would have thought that was quite important."" Mrs Foster said she could not explain why she had forgotten about the meeting, but added she had many matters to deal with in her role as finance minister. Three former DUP special advisers - John Robinson, Stephen Brimstone, Timothy Johnston - will appear before the RHI inquiry later this week Also on Tuesday, Mrs Foster conceded there was ""room for improvement"" in how unelected special advisers (Spads) are appointed by political parties at Stormont. The inquiry has already heard claims that the DUP had its own practice of appointing advisers to ministers, which directly went against the ministerial code that states ministers are supposed to choose who they want to advise them. Mr Bell had claimed he would not have chosen Timothy Cairns as his Spad, but he signed a pre-written letter drafted by the party confirming he was choosing Mr Cairns. Mrs Foster told the inquiry she acknowledged the need for improvement, but said it had to come ""across the board"" from all political parties at Stormont. Sir Patrick said it seemed to him that there had been a common approach by the parties that there was ""an act and a mandatory code, but no-one pays a great deal of attention to it"". Mrs Foster said she could understand the panel's ""frustration"" about the code, but said there had been legislative changes throughout the past 10 years to how advisers were appointed. ""Should there be more, yes I think there probably should, in terms of transparency,"" she added. In addition to Mrs Foster, three senior DUP officials will also be giving evidence to the inquiry this week: Wednesday: Former Spad and current DUP director of communications, John Robinson Thursday: Former Spad Stephen Brimstone Friday: Former Spad and current DUP chief executive, Timothy Johnston On Tuesday, the DUP leader also said she understood why the conduct of her former closest adviser - Andrew Crawford - was a matter of huge concern for the RHI inquiry. He was her most senior adviser in the finance department in summer 2015, as the scheme's costs were rocketing. At that time, he was engaged in conversations with the poultry industry, one of the biggest beneficiaries of the scheme. She said she knew Mr Crawford was having discussions with others in the party about energy issues but not specifically about RHI cost controls. But her evidence is that she never asked him for details and he did not provide it. The inquiry has heard how Mr Crawford had a series of engagements with fellow DUP adviser Timothy Cairns about potential cuts in subsidies for businesses on the scheme - many of them poultry farms. Mr Crawfordpredicted a huge spike in applications- something which later occurred putting the scheme hugely over-budget. Andrew Crawford was an adviser to then-enterprise minister Arlene Foster when the RHI scheme was set up He also offered anecdotal evidence that empty poultry sheds were being heated to maximise subsidy returns, and suggested a scheme change that would have ensured poultry farmers maintained their potential income from the scheme even after it was amended. Inquiry panellist Keith MacLean said not only had Mr Crawford been giving ""bad advice"", but was suggesting something that worked against efforts to control the scheme spend. Mrs Foster said he never raised allegations of scheme abuse, or the potential of an applications spike with her. She told the inquiry she now believed both of those issues should have been raised with her as finance minister, both because of the alleged abuse and the potential impact of spending commitments on public finances. Dr MacLean said it was not hard to see why the inquiry was concerned about the calibre of people being appointed as Spads. He said: ""It gives us a big question as to what on earth was your Spad doing in this involvement without your knowledge?"" ""I accept that,"" Mrs Foster said. The inquiry has also heard evidence Mr Crawfordsent confidential government documents to family members who were RHI claimants. The documents warned them about the plans to introduce cost controls to remove the lucrative subsidies. Inquiry counsel David Scoffield asked Mrs Foster that if the panel finds Mr Crawford breached standards, to what degree she holds some responsibility for his actions as his former minister. Mrs Foster said she was accountable for Mr Crawford's behaviour, as she was for all her departmental officials. But she said she failed to see how she could ""be responsible for that breach"", if a special adviser acted outside the rules. ""If he had committed a criminal offence as a Spad, I don't see how the panel would be asking me to be responsible for that,"" she said. ""I'm accountable but I'm not responsible.""

"This video can not be played Delegates cheer as Keir Starmer says ""nobody is ruling out remain as an option"" in a further Brexit referendum Labour delegates have approved a motion that would keep all options - including a fresh referendum - on the table if MPs are deadlocked over Brexit. It was passed by a show of hands at the party conference in Liverpool. The vast majority were in favour of the motion, with only a small number against. Leader Jeremy Corbyn - who has previously ruled out another EU referendum - has said he will respect the result of the vote. Sir Keir Starmer said earlier that the option of staying in the EU would be on the ballot paper in any future referendum if Labour gets its way. In his party conference speech, the shadow Brexit secretary said all options should be kept on the table, including a so-called People's Vote, to ""stop a destructive Tory Brexit"". But a senior Unite official said another vote would ""reopen the wounds of Brexit"" not heal them. Labour's policy had been to force an election if MPs are deadlocked over Brexit but members succeeded in getting a debate on getting a fresh referendum on to the agenda at the conference. Starmer insists Labour 'clear' on EU vote Kuenssberg: Labour's conference '360' Sir Keir told Labour activists if a general election was not possible ""then other options must be kept open"". ""That includes campaigning for a public vote,"" he said. ""It is right for Parliament to have the first say but if we need to break the impasse, our options must include campaigning for a public vote and nobody is ruling out Remain as an option."" Please upgrade your browser Monday saw confusion over whether the leadership thought any fresh referendum should include staying in the EU as an option. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he thought any vote should be on the terms of a Brexit deal - rather than on remaining in the EU. This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? But he later said ""all options"" were on the table - a point reinforced by Sir Keir. Labour - which wants the UK to remain in a customs union but not the single market - has not ruled out voting for any deal Mrs May brings back from Brussels, ahead of the UK's 29 March departure date. But Sir Keir said the six tests his party has set - including guarantees on workers' rights and retaining the economic benefits of existing market arrangements - were unlikely to be met. ""Some have said Labour could vote for any deal the Tories reach. Some have said we may abstain. Some have said we may vote for a vague deal,"" he said. ""So, let me be very clear - right here, right now: if Theresa May brings back a deal that does not meet our tests - and that looks increasingly likely - Labour will vote against it. No ifs, no buts. ""And if the prime minister thinks we'll wave through a vague deal asking us to leap blindfolded into the unknown, she can think again."" But Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner said any vote on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations could not be a re-run of the 2016 in-out referendum. ""Despite what Keir said earlier, it's a public vote on the terms of our departure,"" he said. ""We desperately need a better, fairer society - we need to heal the wounds of Brexit, not reopen them, and only our movement, united with a proud socialist government, is capable of doing that."" The Labour Leave campaign group, which backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum, said Sir Keir was ""playing with fire"" and talk of a referendum made Labour look like ""the party of Remain"". ""We're damaging the Labour brand and alienating our supporters,"" said its general secretary Brendan Chilton. ""We have already had a vote on the UK's membership of the EU; it's been done and dusted. The Labour Party and its members must accept this and move on."" The prime minister's Chequers plan, which would see the UK staying closely aligned to the EU in some areas, such as the trade in goods, has been criticised by EU leaders and many of her own MPs. The Conservatives accused Labour of ""playing political games"". ""Labour seem determined to take us all back to square one by rejecting a deal out of hand then trying to delay Brexit and re-run the referendum,"" said Brexit minister Robin Walker. 12 key Brexit words you need to know Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"This video can not be played Survivors react to Bill Cosby's prison sentence for sexual assault A judge in Pennsylvania has jailed US comedian Bill Cosby for three to 10 years for sexual assault. Cosby, 81, was also categorised as a sexually violent predator, meaning he must undergo counselling for life and be listed on the sex offender registry. The actor declined to make a statement when offered the opportunity. At a retrial in April,Cosby was found guilty of three counts of sexual assaultfor drugging and molesting Andrea Constand in 2004. Cosby's request for bail pending appeal was denied. He was also fined $25,000 (Â£19,000) plus the prosecution costs. After the sentencing, he was led away in handcuffs from the courtroom. He was then driven to Montgomery County Correctional Facility. Cosby's attorney had asked for his sentence to be restricted to house arrest, saying he was too frail for prison. The actor had been under house arrest since April. Seven questions answered about Cosby case The comedian became a household name in 1980s America when he starred in the Cosby Show TV sitcom, playing the father in a well-to-do African-American family living in Brooklyn, New York. Such was his popularity that he was dubbed ""America's Dad"". ""This was a serious crime,"" Judge Steven O'Neill was quoted as saying,externalby CNN after pronouncing the sentence in the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown. ""Mr Cosby, this has all circled back to you. The day has come, the time has come."" In June 2017, the former Temple University basketball administrator described how Cosby, whom she had viewed as a ""mentor"", had given her pills that left her ""frozen"" and unable to stop his assault. Inher impact statement,external, as carried by the National Post, she said: ""To truly understand the impact that the sexual assault has had on my life, you have to understand the person that I was before it happened."" Andrea Constand said the assault ""robbed"" her of her trust in others After the sentencing, Cosby (centre) was taken to Montgomery County Correctional Facility ""I was at the top of my game, certain that the groundwork provided by my education and athletic training would stand me in good stead whatever challenges lay ahead..."" she said. ""After the assault, I wasn't sure what had actually happened but the pain spoke volumes. The shame was overwhelming. Self-doubt and confusion kept me from turning to my family or friends as I normally did. I felt completely alone, unable to trust anyone, including myself."" The ticking clock for rape survivors The rise and fall of Quaaludes She wrote that she had stopped eating, sleeping and socialising. Tormented by nightmares, she finally told her mother the truth about what had happened. ""Bill Cosby took my beautiful, healthy young spirit and crushed it,"" she said. ""He robbed me of my health and vitality, my open nature, and my trust in myself and others."" ""Instead of looking back, I am looking forward to looking forward,"" she added. ""I want to get to the place where the person I was meant to be gets a second chance."" Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele paid tribute to Ms Constand, saying: ""We are all better off because she is in our lives. You've heard about how this assault changed her life... To put herself out like this, for years, in front of a worldwide audience is extremely difficult for anyone. ""She could've lived a quiet life but she knew it was important to see that justice was served."" Nada Tawfik, BBC News, Pennsylvania Bill Cosby showed little emotion and no remorse during his sentencing. At this defining moment in his life, there were no family members or former cast mates with him for moral support. The court was filled, though, with several of his accusers who sat in the rows behind Andrea Constand. Model Janice Dickenson clapped her hands in anticipation and joy, others quietly held hands. Their relief was evident when his sentence was finally read out. This was a moment they never thought possible. And they had front seats to witness it. The three counts on which Cosby was convicted were merged into one after an agreement between the defence and prosecutors, AFP News agency reports. Cosby can apply for parole after three years - such a request would be reviewed by a special committee. However, he could end up serving the maximum 10-year-sentence. Psychologist Kristen Dudley testified that Cosby showed signs of a mental disorder and was likely to reoffend. Ahead of the sentence, the judge designated him a sexually violent predator, despite the defence's argument that Cosby's age and blindness meant he was not a threat. Bill Cosby: The fall of 'America's Dad' Tuesday's classification means he will need to register with state police and notify any community he lives in of his sex offender status, as well as undergo mandatory counselling for life. Neighbours, childcare centres and schools will have to be notified of his whereabouts. Cosby's wife, Camille, did not attend the sentencing. Kevin Steele praised the victim's courage Cosby's spokesman, Andrew Wyatt, dismissed the trial as ""the most racist and sexist"" in the history of the US, and said the convicted man was a victim of a ""sex war"". District Attorney Steele summed up Cosby's fall from fame to ignominy: ""For decades the defendant has been able to hide his true self and hide his crimes using his fame and fortune. ""He's hidden behind a character... but it was fiction... He used his acting skills, that endearing TV persona, to win over his victims and keep them silent... ""Someone who has a lot of money, someone who is famous, someone who can get a lot of attention all over the world just by showing up some place to eat shouldn't get a free pass for his crimes or be allowed to walk free."" 'MeToo' and the scale of sexual abuse What has #MeToo actually changed? Some 60 other women have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct but charges have not been brought because of the statute of limitations. However, Cosby does face defamation lawsuits for branding his accusers liars. ""I'm overwhelmed by the number of women who were willing to go through this process with usâ¦ telling their stories of being drugged, assaulted or raped by Bill Cosby,"" said District Attorney Steele. Lili Bernard and former model Janice Dickinson - both Cosby accusers present at the hearing - tweeted on Tuesday: ""May justice be served! #MeToo"". Allow Twitter content?

"People from the EU should face the same immigration rules as those from elsewhere, once the UK has completely left the bloc, the cabinet has agreed. The agreement in principle follows arecommendation of the independent Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), which was also backed by Labour. The cabinet unanimously supported a system based on skills rather than nationality, a source told the BBC. But some fear that a bar on low-skilled EU migrants may damage business. The prime minister has repeatedly vowed to end unlimited immigration from Europe after Brexit. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said: ""Ending freedom of movement as it stands has become a rhetorical non-negotiable for Theresa May."" The detail of Cabinet discussion on immigration But Hilary Benn, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons Brexit select committee, said the move was a mistake. ""It would have been sensible to give preference to EU citizens given the close relationship we want to have,"" he told a fringe meeting at the party's conference in Liverpool. The cabinet agreement came after a presentation from the MAC chairman, Prof Alan Manning, at a lengthy meeting on Monday. According to one source, the principle was agreed that the UK would not show bias towards immigrants from any one part of the world over another when granting access to work. However, one cabinet source told the BBC the agreement did not constitute a firm decision and a government source said there could be ""light touch migration"" rules for EU nationals as part of any wider Brexit trade deal. The government does not call this ""preferential"" treatment because a similar arrangement  could be struck with, for example, the US as part of a UK-US trade deal. The EU's principle of freedom of movement currently allows people from the European Economic Area - all EU countries, as well as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein - plus Switzerland, to travel and work within the area without visas, regardless of skills. Anyone wanting to move to the UK from outside the EU, as well as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland, to work or study needs to apply for one of a number of visas. These range from Tier 1, preserved for investors and ""exceptional talent"", to Tier 5 visas for short-term voluntary and educational programmes. The two most common are the Tier 2 skilled worker visas and Tier 4 student visas. Currently, no Tier 3 - unskilled labour - visas are being given out. Some of these visas allow people to apply to bring dependants such as children and partners. Visas work on a points-based system and the criteria have got tougher in recent years. For example, for a Tier 2 ""experienced skilled worker"" visa, people now need to be paid at least Â£30,000 to apply, up almost Â£10,000 from 2011. People get more points for higher salaries or if their job is on the list of shortage occupations. Most visas come with other conditions, including knowledge of English, the need for a sponsor and agreeing not to claim benefits for a period of time. How has EU migration changed the UK? 10 charts explaining the UK's immigration system The UK is due to withdraw from the European Union on 29 March next year, although an ""implementation period"" lasting until 31 December 2020 has been agreed as part of the proposed Brexit deal being negotiated between the UK and the EU. In that transition period, EU citizens arriving in the UK would enjoy the same rights and guarantees as those who arrive beforehand. The same would apply to UK expats on the continent. It remains unclear what would happen in the event of a ""no-deal"" Brexit, as the transition period would not then happen and the new migration system would, government sources say, have to be ""tapered in"" because it would not be ready by March. Please upgrade your browser Last week, the Migration Advisory Committee, an independent public body which advises ministers on migration issues, called for the annual limit on the number of high-skilled workers from outside the EU granted permission to work to be scrapped. Currently set at 20,700 a year, the cap - imposed by Mrs May when at the Home Office - has resulted in thousands of IT specialists and NHS candidates being denied visas. A change in the rules for NHS workers was announced in June after pressure from health bosses. Lobby groups such as the Campaign for Science and Engineering have argued that job offers in other areas, such as science and engineering, should also be exempt from the rules. Home Secretary Sajid Javid has previously said he was taking a ""fresh look"" at the Tier 2 cap. Some business groups, particularly in industries such as agriculture and hospitality, have warned that any future arrangement barring low-skilled migrants could cause disruption. It is understood that at Monday's cabinet meeting Business Secretary Greg Clark raised the concerns of businesses at a sudden change, arguing that there could be pressure for a gradual, rather than immediate shake up after Brexit. The Chancellor Philip Hammond agreed that was likely but sources say there was a unanimous decision to move to a new system based on the principle of equal access, albeit with the acceptance that some sectors would need low skilled migrants from the EU.

According to one source, the principle was agreed that the UK would not show bias towards immigrants from any one part of the world over another when granting access to work. However, one cabinet source told the BBC the agreement did not constitute a firm decision and a government source said there could be ""light touch migration"" rules for EU nationals as part of any wider Brexit trade deal. The government does not call this ""preferential"" treatment because a similar arrangement  could be struck with, for example, the US as part of a UK-US trade deal. The EU's principle of freedom of movement currently allows people from the European Economic Area - all EU countries, as well as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein - plus Switzerland, to travel and work within the area without visas, regardless of skills. Anyone wanting to move to the UK from outside the EU, as well as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland, to work or study needs to apply for one of a number of visas. These range from Tier 1, preserved for investors and ""exceptional talent"", to Tier 5 visas for short-term voluntary and educational programmes. The two most common are the Tier 2 skilled worker visas and Tier 4 student visas. Currently, no Tier 3 - unskilled labour - visas are being given out. Some of these visas allow people to apply to bring dependants such as children and partners. Visas work on a points-based system and the criteria have got tougher in recent years. For example, for a Tier 2 ""experienced skilled worker"" visa, people now need to be paid at least Â£30,000 to apply, up almost Â£10,000 from 2011. People get more points for higher salaries or if their job is on the list of shortage occupations. Most visas come with other conditions, including knowledge of English, the need for a sponsor and agreeing not to claim benefits for a period of time. How has EU migration changed the UK? 10 charts explaining the UK's immigration system The UK is due to withdraw from the European Union on 29 March next year, although an ""implementation period"" lasting until 31 December 2020 has been agreed as part of the proposed Brexit deal being negotiated between the UK and the EU. In that transition period, EU citizens arriving in the UK would enjoy the same rights and guarantees as those who arrive beforehand. The same would apply to UK expats on the continent. It remains unclear what would happen in the event of a ""no-deal"" Brexit, as the transition period would not then happen and the new migration system would, government sources say, have to be ""tapered in"" because it would not be ready by March.

Currently set at 20,700 a year, the cap - imposed by Mrs May when at the Home Office - has resulted in thousands of IT specialists and NHS candidates being denied visas. A change in the rules for NHS workers was announced in June after pressure from health bosses. Lobby groups such as the Campaign for Science and Engineering have argued that job offers in other areas, such as science and engineering, should also be exempt from the rules. Home Secretary Sajid Javid has previously said he was taking a ""fresh look"" at the Tier 2 cap. Some business groups, particularly in industries such as agriculture and hospitality, have warned that any future arrangement barring low-skilled migrants could cause disruption. It is understood that at Monday's cabinet meeting Business Secretary Greg Clark raised the concerns of businesses at a sudden change, arguing that there could be pressure for a gradual, rather than immediate shake up after Brexit. The Chancellor Philip Hammond agreed that was likely but sources say there was a unanimous decision to move to a new system based on the principle of equal access, albeit with the acceptance that some sectors would need low skilled migrants from the EU.

"This video can not be played The whale was thought to be feeding in the area A beluga whale has been seen swimming in the River Thames. It was first spotted by ecologist and ornithologist Dave Andrews, who said it had been feeding around barges near Gravesend in Kent. The Whale and Dolphin Conservation said it was ""obviously very lost and quite possibly in trouble"". Vessels are being kept clear, with the British Divers Marine Life Rescue urging the public not to get too close and ""to watch it from the shore"". The beluga whale was pictured swimming in the Thames off Coalhouse Fort in Essex Crowds gathered to look from the river bank after the whale was spotted in the River Thames near Gravesend, east of London Tanya Ferry, environment manager at the Port of London Authority which is monitoring the whale, said it was unclear what the whale could eat. ""We do have quite a lot of plastic bags, which could be quite an issue,"" she said. ""We're hoping if we give it enough space and keep an eye on it, it will find its own way out of the Thames to an environment that's more appropriate for it.

She added the animal was ""swimming strongly"" and it would hopefully swim back out to sea. Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society spokesman Danny Groves said as the whales were high Arctic species, ""this one is thousands of miles from where it should be"".

Richard Sabin, principal curator of mammals at the Natural History Museum, said photos and videos he had seen appeared to show a beluga whale. ""The white body colour, absence of a prominent dorsal fin, bulbous forehead and general swimming motion all suggest this very strongly,"" he said. ""The beluga is an Arctic/sub-Arctic species, so is a long way outside its usual range of distribution."" Belugas, also known as white whales, are ""one of the most familiar and easily distinguishable"" of all whales, according to National Geographic. They range from 13ft (3.9m) to 20ft (6.1m) in length and have distinctive rounded foreheads. Belugas are commonly found in coastal waters of the Arctic Ocean, but are also at home in large rivers. They can move between salt and fresh water. They are common to Alaska, Russia, Canada, and Greenland. The whales were nicknamed ""canaries of the sea"" by early whalers due to their squeaks and squawks. Beluga calls variously resemble a cork being prized from a bottle or a creaking door, along with sounds described as clicks, squeaks, chirps, bleats, moans, groans, and whistles.

"The spread of fire inside Grenfell Tower was so horrendous that no-one should ever have been allowed to live there, a fire chief has said. Deputy assistant commissionerAndrew O'Loughlin told the inquiry into the disaster that the failure of the building could not have been foreseen. He was defending the decision to tell residents to remain in their homes. People in flats not yet reached by smoke and fire should have been protected by the building, he said. Mr O'Loughlin was the most senior London Fire Brigade Officer on the scene and was in charge of the incident when the advice to ""stay put"" was given to residents. After 02:47 BST, residents were encouraged to escape if they could, rather than await rescue. But the commissioner said that firefighters had reason to expect that the ""stay put"" advice would keep residents safe. He said: ""You wouldn't expect fire to spread around the building like it did on the outside. And for it to fail so catastrophically - we'd never expected or anticipated that. ""We would not expect the internal protection to fail so badly as well. So my expectation was people who were safe in their flats should stay safe in their flats."" Andrew O'Loughlin said the building's safety measures failed ""catastrophically"" Grenfell Tower was 'unsafe to live in' One firefighter told the inquiry earlier thatthe advice for unaffected residents to stay put was redundant by about 01:50. But Mr O'Loughlin rejected suggestions that the advice should have changed earlier, arguing that the spread of the fire was something that ""none of us could ever have expected."" ""The building was so horrendous several hours later that I think no-one should have lived in the building,"" he said. The inquiry also heard from assistant commissioner Andrew Roe, who described what he believed were failings in the facade and the internal compartments that were meant to prevent fire spreading. Mr Roe, who arrived on the scene at 02:29, said he was able ""to look laterally through the building, I could see right through compartments and see that flame spread."" He said: ""The fact the facade had kind of acted as the petrol, as it were, to spread the fire all over the building was one thing, that was obviously genuinely shocking, but it was the complete failure of the building system that caught me by surprise."" Asbestos warning for Grenfell survivors I hope you get justice, says firefighter Meghan takes mum to Grenfell cookbook launch The inquiry heard that it took 25 minutes before Mr O'Loughlin was informed that the advice to residents to stay put had been abandoned at 02:47. Mr O'Loughlin said he was confused by the change and did not think it would necessarily make much difference to residents already trapped inside their flats. ""The change to 'stay put' is, if people feel they can escape then they should try to, but I don't think it's trying to tell people they should go into a smoke-filled environment,"" he said. Communicating the change to residents was also ""not easily done"" as there was no mechanism for contacting each flat in the west London tower block, he added. The blaze on June 14 2017 caused the deaths of 72 residents.

"Head teacher Amit Amin says the policy will help people report pupils who cycle dangerously Children have been told they will be banned from cycling to their south London school if they do not put number plates on their bikes. Teachers at Stanley Park High, in Carshalton, are introducing the scheme so members of the public can report pupils cycling dangerously. The secondary school said the main aim was to keep children safe. Charity Cycling UK questioned why Stanley Park High ""want to make cycling to school more difficult"". On the school's website,head teacher Amit Amin wrote,external: ""All students who cycle to school will be required to display a school-issued bicycle number plate when riding to and from school. ""Students without a number plate will not be permitted to cycle to school, or lock their bicycles on school grounds."" Mr Amin said the measure was in response to incidents of children cycling in a way that ""endangers themselves and others"". A school statement added: ""Our absolute priority is the safety of our students, and the aim of this initiative is simply to ensure their safety as they travel to and from school."" The plates are being introduced on 1 October as part of a scheme to encourage cycling, which includes subsidised bike lights and maintenance workshops. Latest news and stories from London Duncan Dollimore, of Cycling UK, said Mr Amin's actions were ""part of a trend of head teachers trespassing on parental responsibilities"". Mr Dollimore said schools should focus on encouraging local authorities to adopt 20mph speed limits and traffic-calming measures instead of making ""cycling to school more difficult"". Schools across England have imposed various restrictions recently, includingcycling safety testsandmandatory helmets. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died in a hospital in Nice after collapsing on a BA flight Pret A Manger did not label ""artisan"" baguettes as containing sesame seeds despite six allergic reaction cases in the year before a girl died, an inquest has heard. Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, 15, reacted to the sesame in the outlet's baguette which she bought at Heathrow Airport before flying to France in July 2016. She collapsed on the flight, suffered a cardiac arrest anddied within hours. A Pret A Manger representative said allergen policy had since been changed. There were nine cases of sesame-related allergy incidents in the year before Natasha died, including six that involved ""artisan baguettes"", according to a complaint log for the company. In one of these cases a woman nearly died after suffering an anaphylactic reaction from a baguette in October 2015, West London Coroner's Court heard. Natasha's mother, brother and father have been unable to bear unpacking her holiday bag Jeremy Hyam QC said the customer's family afterwards gave Pret A Manger a ""specific warning"", but the chain still failed to label sandwiches with allergy information. The firm's head of Risk and Compliance, Jonathan Perkins, said Pret reviewed its warning notices in April 2016. ""When we get it wrong, we like to put it right,"" Mr Perkins said. However, Nadim Ednan-Laperouse claims there was no label on the fridge the day his daughter died. Sesame is one of 14 allergens that consumers must be made aware of when it is used as an ingredient in food products, according toEU Regulations,external However, the EU rules say individual member states are responsible for deciding on how information about non pre-packaged food is provided to the customer The UK'sFood Regulations 2014,externalallow freshly handmade, non pre-packaged food to not be individually labelled Pret confirmed at the time of Natasha's death products would not have been individually labelled with allergen or ingredient information, and that this was within regulations However, Pret said there were signs in the fridge and at till points telling consumers with allergies to speak to a manager for advice or to seeits allergen guide,external Natasha, from Fulham in west London, had just finished school for the summer and was on her way to Nice for a four-day ""special treat"" with her best friend, Bethany, and her father. The teenager, who suffered from numerous allergies, bought the artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette from a Pret branch at the airport's Terminal 5. She became ill 20 minutes into the flight before pleading with her father to help her. Mr Ednan-Laperouse had previouslydescribed the ""agony""of putting a phone to his daughter's ear so that his wife and son could say goodbye to her when he realised she might not survive. Mr Hyam said: ""There was a clear concern being repeatedly raised that artisan baguettes were causing sesame seed allergy problems, which were not properly responded to by Pret."" Mr Perkins replied: ""We responded appropriately to each individual complaint at the time."" Latest news and stories across London Food regulations do not require eateries like Pret, where food is handmade and packaged on the premises, to put allergen information on each individual food item. Pret opts to provide the information orally and is supposed to have stickers within fridges telling customers to ask staff members for details. UK regulations mean some foods can be sold without individual labels denoting which allergens they contain Mr Hyam suggested Pret's approach lacked consistency, as it labelled some products ""gluten free"" and gave ingredient outlines on fridge shelves. A photo of the branch where Natasha bought her sandwich, taken eight days after her death, appeared to show a fridge without the allergy sticker. The general manager of the branch at the time said on Monday that he was ""confident and sure"" he had put stickers on the tills and fridges - but the inquest heard a health officer from Hillingdon Council visited in May 2017 and reported ""no till stickers to be seen at the till area"". Mr Perkins said the changes made to Pret's allergy policy were ""sound and just"" but ""there is more that can be done"". ""The parent in me would want to change everything... the professional in me has to remain grounded,"" he added. ""The learning for me is that humans are fallible in their actions, we will at some times get things wrong."" The inquest is expected to last until Friday.

"Kevin Systrom (R) and Mike Krieger continued to run Instagram after it was acquired by Facebook in 2012 The co-founders of photo-sharing giant Instagram, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, are both leaving the firm. Mr Systrom, chief executive, said they were departing to ""explore our curiosity and creativity again"". Instagram, purchased by Facebook in 2012 for $1bn (Â£760m) in cash and stock, has more than a billion users. There had been reports of tension between the pair and Facebook, and the departures add to what has been a troubling year for the parent company. Kevin Systrom talks to BBC's Newsbeat How Instagram became a social media giant Mr Systrom, 34, the CEO, and Mr Krieger, 32, the chief technical officer, started the image sharing site in 2010 and continued to run the service after it was acquired by Facebook. Not a great deal. They reportedly only told the Facebook leadership on Monday so the departure appears pretty sudden. In a blog post,Mr Systrom said: ""We're now ready for our next chapter."",external He added: ""Building new things requires that we step back, understand what inspires us, and match that with what the world needs; that's what we plan to do."" There was no animosity in the blog post. Mr Systrom said the pair both remained ""excited for the future of Instagram and Facebook"". Allow Twitter content?

CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement that Instagram reflected the founders' ""combined creative talents"". ""I've learned a lot working with them for the past six years and have really enjoyed it,"" he said. ""I'm looking forward to seeing what they build next."" The four biggest hazards of social media Facebook and Instagram introduce time limit tool Are Instagram stars facing a brand backlash? The BBC understands that tension started to grow between Mr Systrom and Mr Zuckerberg as far back as 2014 when Facebook purchased WhatsApp. The social network spent $19bn on the chat app in 2014, and Instagram's co-founder is said to have become concerned that he had sold out too soon. The dominance of Facebook may have grated with Instagram's founding ethos He also saw Snapchat prosper - an app Facebook had tried and failed to take over. ""The irony is that Kevin built the more successful product,"" one insider commented. There are reports that Mr Systrom had sought to maintain Instagram's independence and that this trickled down to make staff on Facebook and Instagram less inclined to be collaborative. But there was pressure for their two apps to become more integrated, and features were added allowing, for example, Instagram Stories - videos that self-destruct after 24 hours - to be cross-posted to Facebook. Despite remaining Instagram's figurehead at product launches and other public appearances, Mr Systrom's influence declined over time, a source told the BBC, as more Facebook executives were transferred to the photo service. ""Kevin maybe didn't have the fight in him anymore and probably didn't agree with some of the product decisions,"" the source said. ""This is just the natural end to an era."" Analysis by Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter The firm was quite deliberately treated like a separate company owned by Facebook, rather than merely a department or division, because it was Instagram's culture that made it such a valuable acquisition. Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger were responsible for that culture - the entire feel of an app that was in many respects the anti-Facebook. It lacked the clutter and noise that had made Facebook bloated in many people's eyes. But slowly, in recent years, the Instagram app started putting on that weight. Algorithmic ordering of the timeline... and ads, so many ads. One of the names being touted as the next boss of Instagram is Adam Mosseri. He's currently head of product, and has a CV that some of Instagram's loyal users might find ominous - he was formerly in charge of Facebook's Newsfeed. Indeed not. In fact it echoes what happened with WhatsApp. Its chief executive and co-founderJan Koum said in April he would quit the popular messaging servicehe co-founded in 2009 and sold to Facebook in 2014. Oddly,Mr Koum's departure statement is similar to Mr Systrom's. Analysts of that move also spoke of clashes with Facebook. Mr Koum's departure sparked an executive reshuffle that saw the tightening of Mr Zuckerberg's control over operations. Facebook has been under intense pressure this year over the issues of safeguarding customer data and the misuse of its platforms by those wishing to spread fake news, including for political ends. In March, in the week Mr Zuckerberg apologised for the handling of a historic data breach, Facebook ended $58bn (Â£44bn) lower in value. Mr Systrom and Mr Krieger met while studying at Stanford University. The two were inspired to create the Instagram app - originally launched just for iPhones in 2010 - by old Polaroid pictures. This video can not be played Instagram boss shares his secrets Instagram had about 30 million users in 2012, the year it was purchased by Facebook for what appeared to be an eye-watering $1bn. It was also ad-free. That changed. But so did the number of users - now more than a billion. The Forbes billionaires list estimates Kevin Systrom's net worth at $1.4bn,external. Mike Krieger's net worth is less. There are no definitive figures, ranging from $100m to $500m. One Twitter post highlighted the use of the word ""again"" in Mr Systrom's ""explore our curiosity and creativity again"". ""Was it a slight dig from Systrom with the 'again'? You be the judge (I judge yea),"" wrote Kara Swisher. NBC media reporter Dylan Byers wrote that the Instagram pair had saved Mr Zuckerberg. Allow Twitter content?

"Arlene Foster has been the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) since December 2015 The DUP leader has said Jonathan Bell's BBC interview about a flawed green energy scheme directly led to the collapse of the NI assembly. Arlene Foster was giving evidence to the Renewable Heat Incentive inquiry. She was in charge of energy matters for NI when the scheme was set up in 2012, while Mr Bell was enterprise minister between 2015 and 2016. Overgenerous subsidies meant costs grew and left taxpayers with a Â£490m bill. Live: Foster in cash-for-ash hot seat Q&A: What is the RHI inquiry? Timeline: Renewable Heat Incentive scandal On Tuesday, Mrs Foster told the inquiry that Mr Bell - who was her successor as enterprise minister - had pressed a ""nuclear button""by going public with claims that DUP special advisers delayed his plans to close down the controversial scheme. He gave an interview to the BBC's Stephen Nolan show in December 2016, in which he also alleged the advisers secretly tried to ""cleanse the record"" of references to Mrs Foster. Mrs Foster told the inquiry that ""paranoia set in with Jonathan"" after a BBC Spotlight programme revealed the scheme's overspend, and Mr Bell felt the party was trying to blame him for the debacle. However she said that was not the case, but it was all in Mr Bell's own mind. Mr Bell has since told the inquiry that after he went public about RHI, he becamethe victim of a ""massive smear campaign"" orchestrated by the DUP. Mrs Foster, who was Northern Ireland's first minister in December 2016, said he had caused such a reaction with his allegations, some of them ""very confused"" and that he ""had to take what was coming to him"". She set out how assembly and executive officials had agreed a plan to deal with cost controls, but that when Mr Bell spoke to the BBC, that plan went ""out the window"". ""We were then on a trajectory to the assembly and executive collapsing,"" she added. Pressed further on that, she said Mr Bell had ""taken a route with Stephen Nolan which caused the downfall of the executive"". Northern Ireland has been without devolved government for more than 500 days The weeks that followed saw Sinn FÃ©in, the DUP's then partner in government, demand Mrs Foster stand aside as first minister until an investigation into the scheme was completed. She refused to do so, and on 9 January 2017, the late Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister, which led to a snap assembly election. More than a year and a half later, talks deadlines have failed and the Northern Ireland assembly remains in limbo. Earlier on Tuesday, Mrs Foster said it is a ""great regret"" to her that she did not sack Jonathan Bell as enterprise minister when she became first minister in 2016. Mr Bell replaced her as enterprise minister in May 2015. The RHI inquiry hasheard evidence from a number of witnesses that he was unsuitable for the job. Asked why she had not replaced him when she took over the party reins, Mrs Foster said an assembly election campaign was looming and that removing him at that time could have raised political questions over his suitability as a candidate for the party. Mrs Foster said there was a general view in the party that Mr Bell should not remain in post, but she said other party officials asked: ""How much harm can he do in three months?"" She also claimed there was a concern he could ""go in inverted commas 'rogue' if he was replaced as a minister"" when Mrs Foster replaced Peter Robinson. Mrs Foster said Mr Bell never accepted her leadership, nor did he take his responsibilities seriously and she claimed he acted as if he was ""to be served, rather than serve"". She said he ""hero-worshipped"" Mr Robinson and when he retired, it showed in Mr Bell's behaviour. ""I take full responsibility for my actions as first minister and the decision to keep him in post until the election was over,"" she added. Jonathan Bell told the RHI inquiry he was stopped from closing the scheme by several DUP special advisers Earlier on Tuesday, Mrs Foster was challenged to explain why she forgot about a meeting in which she was told of problems with the RHI scheme. The meeting happened in early June 2015 after Mrs Foster became finance minister. She told the public inquiry -which was set up to investigate the scheme's failings in January 2017- the warning was the first time she had been made aware of possible problems. Northern Ireland's former first minister headed up the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Deti) when the RHI scheme was designed in 2012. Crucial controls to limit the scheme's cost were not introduced, somethingshe has since said is her ""deepest political regret"". But Mrs Foster - who spent six months as finance minister from June 2015 before being elevated to party leader and first minister - fiercely contested claims by Jonathan Bell, her party colleague and successor as enterprise minister, that she ordered him to keep the scheme open. In the wake of his allegations, she faced calls to step aside to allow a judge-led public inquiry into the scheme. Her time as first minister was brought to an abrupt end when the late Martin McGuinness of Sinn FÃ©in resigned as deputy first minister, forcing an election last March. She remains DUP leader, butthere has been no return to Stormont for almost 600 days, due to the ongoing impasse between her party and Sinn FÃ©in. Mrs Foster said she was told about the issues by former DUP special adviser (Spad) Timothy Cairns, who was then working in the enterprise department. He told Mrs Foster that officials in enterprise had ""dropped the ball"" and failed to ensure the proper approvals were in place for spending on RHI. Mrs Foster said she had ""no clear recollection"" of the meeting, although she did not dispute that it happened. She said she had conflated the meeting in early June, with another later that month where Mr Cairns had asked for help from Mrs Foster's ministerial adviser Andrew Crawford, who had just spent seven years in enterprise. Inquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin asked why she had no recollection of the early June meeting. The RHI public inquiry is being chaired by Sir Patrick Coghlin and has heard 93 days of evidence so far She said she did not believe it had been presented to her as a ""big issue"". Sir Patrick said: ""If someone comes along and tells you that a scheme which had developed under your bailiwick is in difficulties to the extent that the department has dropped the ball, one might have thought, you would have thought that was quite important."" Mrs Foster said she could not explain why she had forgotten about the meeting, but added she had many matters to deal with in her role as finance minister. Three former DUP special advisers - John Robinson, Stephen Brimstone, Timothy Johnston - will appear before the RHI inquiry later this week Also on Tuesday, Mrs Foster conceded there was ""room for improvement"" in how unelected special advisers (Spads) are appointed by political parties at Stormont. The inquiry has already heard claims that the DUP had its own practice of appointing advisers to ministers, which directly went against the ministerial code that states ministers are supposed to choose who they want to advise them. Mr Bell had claimed he would not have chosen Timothy Cairns as his Spad, but he signed a pre-written letter drafted by the party confirming he was choosing Mr Cairns. Mrs Foster told the inquiry she acknowledged the need for improvement, but said it had to come ""across the board"" from all political parties at Stormont. Sir Patrick said it seemed to him that there had been a common approach by the parties that there was ""an act and a mandatory code, but no-one pays a great deal of attention to it"". Mrs Foster said she could understand the panel's ""frustration"" about the code, but said there had been legislative changes throughout the past 10 years to how advisers were appointed. ""Should there be more, yes I think there probably should, in terms of transparency,"" she added. In addition to Mrs Foster, three senior DUP officials will also be giving evidence to the inquiry this week: Wednesday: Former Spad and current DUP director of communications, John Robinson Thursday: Former Spad Stephen Brimstone Friday: Former Spad and current DUP chief executive, Timothy Johnston On Tuesday, the DUP leader also said she understood why the conduct of her former closest adviser - Andrew Crawford - was a matter of huge concern for the RHI inquiry. He was her most senior adviser in the finance department in summer 2015, as the scheme's costs were rocketing. At that time, he was engaged in conversations with the poultry industry, one of the biggest beneficiaries of the scheme. She said she knew Mr Crawford was having discussions with others in the party about energy issues but not specifically about RHI cost controls. But her evidence is that she never asked him for details and he did not provide it. The inquiry has heard how Mr Crawford had a series of engagements with fellow DUP adviser Timothy Cairns about potential cuts in subsidies for businesses on the scheme - many of them poultry farms. Mr Crawfordpredicted a huge spike in applications- something which later occurred putting the scheme hugely over-budget. Andrew Crawford was an adviser to then-enterprise minister Arlene Foster when the RHI scheme was set up He also offered anecdotal evidence that empty poultry sheds were being heated to maximise subsidy returns, and suggested a scheme change that would have ensured poultry farmers maintained their potential income from the scheme even after it was amended. Inquiry panellist Keith MacLean said not only had Mr Crawford been giving ""bad advice"", but was suggesting something that worked against efforts to control the scheme spend. Mrs Foster said he never raised allegations of scheme abuse, or the potential of an applications spike with her. She told the inquiry she now believed both of those issues should have been raised with her as finance minister, both because of the alleged abuse and the potential impact of spending commitments on public finances. Dr MacLean said it was not hard to see why the inquiry was concerned about the calibre of people being appointed as Spads. He said: ""It gives us a big question as to what on earth was your Spad doing in this involvement without your knowledge?"" ""I accept that,"" Mrs Foster said. The inquiry has also heard evidence Mr Crawfordsent confidential government documents to family members who were RHI claimants. The documents warned them about the plans to introduce cost controls to remove the lucrative subsidies. Inquiry counsel David Scoffield asked Mrs Foster that if the panel finds Mr Crawford breached standards, to what degree she holds some responsibility for his actions as his former minister. Mrs Foster said she was accountable for Mr Crawford's behaviour, as she was for all her departmental officials. But she said she failed to see how she could ""be responsible for that breach"", if a special adviser acted outside the rules. ""If he had committed a criminal offence as a Spad, I don't see how the panel would be asking me to be responsible for that,"" she said. ""I'm accountable but I'm not responsible.""

"Head teacher Amit Amin says the policy will help people report pupils who cycle dangerously Children have been told they will be banned from cycling to their south London school if they do not put number plates on their bikes. Teachers at Stanley Park High, in Carshalton, are introducing the scheme so members of the public can report pupils cycling dangerously. The secondary school said the main aim was to keep children safe. Charity Cycling UK questioned why Stanley Park High ""want to make cycling to school more difficult"". On the school's website,head teacher Amit Amin wrote,external: ""All students who cycle to school will be required to display a school-issued bicycle number plate when riding to and from school. ""Students without a number plate will not be permitted to cycle to school, or lock their bicycles on school grounds."" Mr Amin said the measure was in response to incidents of children cycling in a way that ""endangers themselves and others"". A school statement added: ""Our absolute priority is the safety of our students, and the aim of this initiative is simply to ensure their safety as they travel to and from school."" The plates are being introduced on 1 October as part of a scheme to encourage cycling, which includes subsidised bike lights and maintenance workshops. Latest news and stories from London Duncan Dollimore, of Cycling UK, said Mr Amin's actions were ""part of a trend of head teachers trespassing on parental responsibilities"". Mr Dollimore said schools should focus on encouraging local authorities to adopt 20mph speed limits and traffic-calming measures instead of making ""cycling to school more difficult"". Schools across England have imposed various restrictions recently, includingcycling safety testsandmandatory helmets. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Stefan Lofven waved as he and his wife Ulla arrived at the Swedish parliament on Tuesday Sweden's centre-left prime minister, Stefan Lofven, will have to stand down after losing the support of parliament. The anti-immigration Sweden Democrats (SD) backed the vote to remove him, weeks after a general election that delivered a hung parliament. Mr Lofven was opposed by 204 MPs, with 142 voting in favour. The parliamentary speaker will now propose a new prime minister, with centre-right leader Ulf Kristersson seen as the most likely candidate. Mr Lofven is expected to stay on as caretaker prime minister while his replacement is decided, in a process that could take weeks. Mr Lofven, the leader of the Social Democrats, came to power in 2014. In this month's election, his centre-left bloc won 144 seats, one more than the centre-right bloc led by Mr Kristersson. Sweden Democrats tap immigration fears Neither of the blocs intends to govern with the SD, the third-largest party in the new parliament with 62 seats. A member of Mr Kristersson's Moderate party, Andreas Norlen, was confirmed as the parliament's new speaker on Monday, with the support of SD. Shattering Swedish calm The new face of the far-right in Europe The splintered nature of the house makes securing a stable government tricky because: Mr Lofven's party has ruled out backing a centre-right minority government Two of the four members of the centre-right bloc say they will quit if it negotiates a deal with the SD If there are four unsuccessful attempts to form a government, that will trigger fresh elections - something which has never happened before. By Matilda Welin, BBC Monitoring Most Swedish news media are providing live commentary on an unprecedented moment in Swedish politics. The main bone of contention is whether the blocs can stomach supporting each other, or if they will seek support from the Sweden Democrats - something several party leaders have promised never to do. ""Now, Sweden enters no man's land"", said the liberal daily Dagens Nyheter. ""The situation is lockedâ¦Sweden will never get a government unless one or more party leaders can break their promises."" The issue risks ripping previous allies apart. ""The government formation may destroy the Alliance from within"", said Public Service's political commentator Mats Knutsson. A new interpretation of the constitution has taken effect for this election, which only adds to the uncertainty. ""Now comes something that can be compared to parliamentary driving in the dark"", said Sweden's biggest daily, Svenska Dagbladet. ""Nobody wants to back down, nobody is showing any willingness to compromise, everyone wants it in a way that benefits them the most"", prominent commentator Lena Mellin said in tabloid Aftonbladet. ""Where are all the adults in the room? Not in parliament, that's for sure."" Speaking after the vote, Mr Lofven, who is still the leader of the largest party, said he intended to work to form another government across the political divide. ""I see good opportunities to continue as prime minister,"" he said. Mr Lofven said he did not believe that fresh elections were something voters wanted but he added that he would never support a government that relied on the SD. Mr Kristersson said that a new government was needed - one with broad political support. While the SD is expected to back the Moderate candidate, Mr Lofven warned the centre-right bloc on Tuesday against relying on the support of a party ""founded by Nazis"". Mr Lofven's Social Democrats stood for election as part of a coalition with the Green Party. The radical Left Party won 28 seats. While it did not join Mr Lofven's government, it did provide parliamentary support. The centre-right bloc is made up of Mr Kristersson's Moderates and three other parties: the Centre Party, the Christian Democrats and the Liberals. The SD is a nationalist, anti-immigration party which was linked to neo-Nazis and other far-right groups for years. It only entered parliament in 2010. In the years since, it has become the third-largest party - a political success story. Officially, it welcomes supporters from all backgrounds but its history means it has been shunned by the mainstream political parties since it first won seats. Jimmie Akesson, leader of the SD, on the campaign trail with the party's floral logo The SD has been keen to change its image but there have been some scandals, and several party members have been expelled in recent years for racist behaviour or links to right-wing groups. Traditionally, its supporters have been working-class men. But the party won 18% of the vote in the recent general election - up from 13% four years ago - demonstrating a growing base in Sweden.

"More than Â£500m was stolen from customers of British banks in the first half of 2018, figures have shown. Industry group UK Finance said Â£145m of that was due to authorised push payment (APP) scams, in which people are conned into sending money to another account. But Â£358m was lost to unauthorised fraud, which includes transactions made without account holders' knowledge. Unauthorised fraud victims are usually refunded by their banks, but most victims of APP fraud do not get their money back. This is because current legislation means they are liable for any losses incurred if they authorise a payment themselves. 'I was conned out of Â£13,000' Should banks cover the losses from scams? The new safeguards that could help stop the scams ""Purchase scams"", in which people are duped into paying for products or services that do not exist, were the most prevalent form of APP fraud reported in the first six months of 2018. These scams often happen online, and examples include payments made for cars or holidays that are never delivered or provided. There were also 3,866 reported cases of impersonation scams, in which criminals pretend to be from a financial institution or law enforcement, and trick account holders into transferring money. During the first six months of 2017, APP scams led to Â£101m in losses, but UK Finance said this year's Â£44m increase was partly down to four more banks reporting data. When you transfer money from your bank account, you are asked to enter three pieces of information:  the name of the payee, their account number, and the sort code. However, only the last two are cross-checked by the bank. So putting in the correct name is no guarantee that person will get the money. UK Finance offers the following advice: Never disclose security details, such as your PIN or full banking password Don't assume an email, text or phone call is authentic Don't be rushed - a genuine organisation won't mind waiting Listen to your instincts - you know if something doesn't feel right Stay in control - don't panic and make a decision you'll regret The group's managing director for economic crime, Katy Worobec, said the new figures underlined that fraud was a ""major threat"" to the UK, and added that the ""proceeds go on to fund terrorism, people smuggling and drug trafficking"". Ms Worobec also emphasised that two-thirds of all unauthorised fraud was successfully thwarted by UK financial institutions. But Gareth Shaw, of the consumer group Which?, said the banks' efforts to tackle fraud had been ""woefully insufficient"". APPs were the subject of a ""super-complaint"" made in September 2016 to regulators by Which?, which has been calling for banks to shoulder more responsibility when victims are tricked in this way. ""They have not done enough to protect their customers, who continue to lose life-changing sums of money to ever-more sophisticated crooks,"" Mr Shaw said. But he welcomed plans by the Payments System Regulator to introduce a reimbursement scheme for victims of APP fraud.

"Alan Hogg, far right, pictured with his wife, buying the pick-up truck which was stolen The bodies of a UK millionaire and his Thai wife have been found in northern Thailand nearly a week after what police suspect was a contract killing. The bodies of Alan Hogg, 64, and Nod Suddaen, 64, were discovered buried on their property in Phrae province. Police say Mr Hogg, who was from Edinburgh, was shot dead, while his wife was killed with a hammer. Three suspects have been held. They are alleged to have been hired to carry out the attack by Nod Suddaen's brother. He has now been arrested. ""The motive for the killings was a long-running internal family conflict, feuds and property,"" local police commander Manas Kerdsukho told the AFP news agency. The bodies of Alan Hogg and his wife were found on their property on Tuesday The couple were reported missing last week. The three alleged killers were arrested after police tracked down a pick-up truck said to have been taken from Mr Hogg's property. They later admitted killing Mr Hogg and his wife, police say. The British embassy in Thailand has so far made no public comment on the issue. Mr Hogg moved to Thailand several years ago and had built a luxury villa in Phrae which included a swimming pool and a summer house, reports say.

"Kevin Systrom (R) and Mike Krieger continued to run Instagram after it was acquired by Facebook in 2012 The co-founders of photo-sharing giant Instagram, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, are both leaving the firm. Mr Systrom, chief executive, said they were departing to ""explore our curiosity and creativity again"". Instagram, purchased by Facebook in 2012 for $1bn (Â£760m) in cash and stock, has more than a billion users. There had been reports of tension between the pair and Facebook, and the departures add to what has been a troubling year for the parent company. Kevin Systrom talks to BBC's Newsbeat How Instagram became a social media giant Mr Systrom, 34, the CEO, and Mr Krieger, 32, the chief technical officer, started the image sharing site in 2010 and continued to run the service after it was acquired by Facebook. Not a great deal. They reportedly only told the Facebook leadership on Monday so the departure appears pretty sudden. In a blog post,Mr Systrom said: ""We're now ready for our next chapter."",external He added: ""Building new things requires that we step back, understand what inspires us, and match that with what the world needs; that's what we plan to do."" There was no animosity in the blog post. Mr Systrom said the pair both remained ""excited for the future of Instagram and Facebook"". Allow Twitter content?

CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement that Instagram reflected the founders' ""combined creative talents"". ""I've learned a lot working with them for the past six years and have really enjoyed it,"" he said. ""I'm looking forward to seeing what they build next."" The four biggest hazards of social media Facebook and Instagram introduce time limit tool Are Instagram stars facing a brand backlash? The BBC understands that tension started to grow between Mr Systrom and Mr Zuckerberg as far back as 2014 when Facebook purchased WhatsApp. The social network spent $19bn on the chat app in 2014, and Instagram's co-founder is said to have become concerned that he had sold out too soon. The dominance of Facebook may have grated with Instagram's founding ethos He also saw Snapchat prosper - an app Facebook had tried and failed to take over. ""The irony is that Kevin built the more successful product,"" one insider commented. There are reports that Mr Systrom had sought to maintain Instagram's independence and that this trickled down to make staff on Facebook and Instagram less inclined to be collaborative. But there was pressure for their two apps to become more integrated, and features were added allowing, for example, Instagram Stories - videos that self-destruct after 24 hours - to be cross-posted to Facebook. Despite remaining Instagram's figurehead at product launches and other public appearances, Mr Systrom's influence declined over time, a source told the BBC, as more Facebook executives were transferred to the photo service. ""Kevin maybe didn't have the fight in him anymore and probably didn't agree with some of the product decisions,"" the source said. ""This is just the natural end to an era."" Analysis by Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter The firm was quite deliberately treated like a separate company owned by Facebook, rather than merely a department or division, because it was Instagram's culture that made it such a valuable acquisition. Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger were responsible for that culture - the entire feel of an app that was in many respects the anti-Facebook. It lacked the clutter and noise that had made Facebook bloated in many people's eyes. But slowly, in recent years, the Instagram app started putting on that weight. Algorithmic ordering of the timeline... and ads, so many ads. One of the names being touted as the next boss of Instagram is Adam Mosseri. He's currently head of product, and has a CV that some of Instagram's loyal users might find ominous - he was formerly in charge of Facebook's Newsfeed. Indeed not. In fact it echoes what happened with WhatsApp. Its chief executive and co-founderJan Koum said in April he would quit the popular messaging servicehe co-founded in 2009 and sold to Facebook in 2014. Oddly,Mr Koum's departure statement is similar to Mr Systrom's. Analysts of that move also spoke of clashes with Facebook. Mr Koum's departure sparked an executive reshuffle that saw the tightening of Mr Zuckerberg's control over operations. Facebook has been under intense pressure this year over the issues of safeguarding customer data and the misuse of its platforms by those wishing to spread fake news, including for political ends. In March, in the week Mr Zuckerberg apologised for the handling of a historic data breach, Facebook ended $58bn (Â£44bn) lower in value. Mr Systrom and Mr Krieger met while studying at Stanford University. The two were inspired to create the Instagram app - originally launched just for iPhones in 2010 - by old Polaroid pictures. This video can not be played Instagram boss shares his secrets Instagram had about 30 million users in 2012, the year it was purchased by Facebook for what appeared to be an eye-watering $1bn. It was also ad-free. That changed. But so did the number of users - now more than a billion. The Forbes billionaires list estimates Kevin Systrom's net worth at $1.4bn,external. Mike Krieger's net worth is less. There are no definitive figures, ranging from $100m to $500m. One Twitter post highlighted the use of the word ""again"" in Mr Systrom's ""explore our curiosity and creativity again"". ""Was it a slight dig from Systrom with the 'again'? You be the judge (I judge yea),"" wrote Kara Swisher. NBC media reporter Dylan Byers wrote that the Instagram pair had saved Mr Zuckerberg. Allow Twitter content?

"Next has reported better-than-expected sales following this summer's heatwave but warned of Brexit-related risks to its business. Buoyant trading for the first six months of the year led the clothing retailer to raise its profit forecast for the full year by Â£10m to Â£727m. Next said,externalthe UK retail market remained ""volatile"" and it remained ""cautious"" in its outlook. The Brexit-related risks include higher tariffs on goods imported into the UK. However, queues and delays at UK and EU ports as a result of increased customs declarations for other companies posed the biggest risk. The retailer said it was preparing for the possibility that the UK leaves the EU without a transition period or a free trade agreement in place. However, it downplayed the impact a no-deal outcome would have on its business. Next's better-than-expected results come in contrast to some of the downbeat news from other High Street retailers, and sent its shares up more than 7% in morning trading. The retailer said full-price sales in the first six months of the year beat expectations, rising by 4.5%. However, the trend of sales moving online and away from High Street stores continued. Sales at its shops fell 6.9% to Â£925.1m, but online sales jumped 16.8% to Â£892.3m. As a result total group sales were up 3.8% to Â£1.98bn and pre-tax profit rose 0.5% to Â£311.1m. Debenhams attempts to 'bring joy back' to High Street Moss Bros shares dive on profit warning ""When we issued our August Trading Statement we believed that there was a high risk that the sales gained in July would be offset by losses in August. As it turned out, we did not experience any material loss of sales in August or early September,"" said Next chief executive Lord Wolfson. However, he added: ""The UK retail market remains volatile, subject to powerful structural and cyclical changes. As expected, sales in our stores (which now account for just under half of our turnover) continue to be challenging."" Julie Palmer of Begbies Traynor said Next's ""continued success"" owed much to its early entry into catalogue sales with the launch of Next Directory in 1988: ""This was a natural fit with the subsequent rise of online shopping and gave Next a distinct advantage, which they still benefit from 30 years later."" However, she added. many of Next's rivals were ""light years behind"" and would ""continue to struggle"". Next also has a ""more agile"" retail estate with shorter leases and profitable stores, said Sofie Willmott of GlobalData. ""Stores remain a declining part of the business but Next is utilising physical locations to its advantage, for example by adding in concessions to drive revenue and give shoppers other reasons to visit Next, and also as a back-up stock pool for online orders,"" she added. Next chief Lord Wolfson voted in favour of Brexit Next said it was ""well advanced"" in its preparations in case neither a transition period nor a free-trade agreement were in place by the time of Brexit next March. But it said the no-deal risks did not pose a ""material threat to the ongoing operations and profitability"" of Next in the UK or EU. Next said in the ""unlikely event"" that free-trade agreements were not put in place, the cost of goods could rise by up to about Â£20m, which would add less than 0.5% to its prices. The company said it would be ""in the interest"" of both the UK and remaining EU nations that the UK's departure from the EU was ""carefully managed, accompanied by a period of transition and some form of agreement for free trade"". Last year,Lord Wolfson, who voted in favour of Brexit, warned that failingto secure a ""smooth"" departure from the EU could result in ""years of economic decline"" for the UK. Emma Simpson, business correspondent The news from Next is certainly a lot brighter than the gloomy headlines from other big names on the High Street. But these figures shouldn't be interpreted as a sign of an improvement in consumer spending. Next is a very well run business which is managing its costs and has been has been far more agile in dealing with the huge structural shift to online sales. Although sales in its physical stores are down, this weakness is being offset with continuing growth online. Just under half of its Next brand sales are now online. Most of its stores remain profitable and the average length of its leases is just over six years. This retailer seems to be navigating the changes better than most of its big rivals.

"Head teacher Amit Amin says the policy will help people report pupils who cycle dangerously Children have been told they will be banned from cycling to their south London school if they do not put number plates on their bikes. Teachers at Stanley Park High, in Carshalton, are introducing the scheme so members of the public can report pupils cycling dangerously. The secondary school said the main aim was to keep children safe. Charity Cycling UK questioned why Stanley Park High ""want to make cycling to school more difficult"". On the school's website,head teacher Amit Amin wrote,external: ""All students who cycle to school will be required to display a school-issued bicycle number plate when riding to and from school. ""Students without a number plate will not be permitted to cycle to school, or lock their bicycles on school grounds."" Mr Amin said the measure was in response to incidents of children cycling in a way that ""endangers themselves and others"". A school statement added: ""Our absolute priority is the safety of our students, and the aim of this initiative is simply to ensure their safety as they travel to and from school."" The plates are being introduced on 1 October as part of a scheme to encourage cycling, which includes subsidised bike lights and maintenance workshops. Latest news and stories from London Duncan Dollimore, of Cycling UK, said Mr Amin's actions were ""part of a trend of head teachers trespassing on parental responsibilities"". Mr Dollimore said schools should focus on encouraging local authorities to adopt 20mph speed limits and traffic-calming measures instead of making ""cycling to school more difficult"". Schools across England have imposed various restrictions recently, includingcycling safety testsandmandatory helmets. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Next said in the ""unlikely event"" that free-trade agreements were not put in place, the cost of goods could rise by up to about Â£20m, which would add less than 0.5% to its prices. The company said it would be ""in the interest"" of both the UK and remaining EU nations that the UK's departure from the EU was ""carefully managed, accompanied by a period of transition and some form of agreement for free trade"". Last year,Lord Wolfson, who voted in favour of Brexit, warned that failingto secure a ""smooth"" departure from the EU could result in ""years of economic decline"" for the UK. Emma Simpson, business correspondent The news from Next is certainly a lot brighter than the gloomy headlines from other big names on the High Street. But these figures shouldn't be interpreted as a sign of an improvement in consumer spending. Next is a very well run business which is managing its costs and has been has been far more agile in dealing with the huge structural shift to online sales. Although sales in its physical stores are down, this weakness is being offset with continuing growth online. Just under half of its Next brand sales are now online. Most of its stores remain profitable and the average length of its leases is just over six years. This retailer seems to be navigating the changes better than most of its big rivals.

"This video can not be played Delegates cheer as Keir Starmer says ""nobody is ruling out remain as an option"" in a further Brexit referendum Labour delegates have approved a motion that would keep all options - including a fresh referendum - on the table if MPs are deadlocked over Brexit. It was passed by a show of hands at the party conference in Liverpool. The vast majority were in favour of the motion, with only a small number against. Leader Jeremy Corbyn - who has previously ruled out another EU referendum - has said he will respect the result of the vote. Sir Keir Starmer said earlier that the option of staying in the EU would be on the ballot paper in any future referendum if Labour gets its way. In his party conference speech, the shadow Brexit secretary said all options should be kept on the table, including a so-called People's Vote, to ""stop a destructive Tory Brexit"". But a senior Unite official said another vote would ""reopen the wounds of Brexit"" not heal them. Labour's policy had been to force an election if MPs are deadlocked over Brexit but members succeeded in getting a debate on getting a fresh referendum on to the agenda at the conference. Starmer insists Labour 'clear' on EU vote Kuenssberg: Labour's conference '360' Sir Keir told Labour activists if a general election was not possible ""then other options must be kept open"". ""That includes campaigning for a public vote,"" he said. ""It is right for Parliament to have the first say but if we need to break the impasse, our options must include campaigning for a public vote and nobody is ruling out Remain as an option."" Please upgrade your browser Monday saw confusion over whether the leadership thought any fresh referendum should include staying in the EU as an option. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he thought any vote should be on the terms of a Brexit deal - rather than on remaining in the EU. This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? But he later said ""all options"" were on the table - a point reinforced by Sir Keir. Labour - which wants the UK to remain in a customs union but not the single market - has not ruled out voting for any deal Mrs May brings back from Brussels, ahead of the UK's 29 March departure date. But Sir Keir said the six tests his party has set - including guarantees on workers' rights and retaining the economic benefits of existing market arrangements - were unlikely to be met. ""Some have said Labour could vote for any deal the Tories reach. Some have said we may abstain. Some have said we may vote for a vague deal,"" he said. ""So, let me be very clear - right here, right now: if Theresa May brings back a deal that does not meet our tests - and that looks increasingly likely - Labour will vote against it. No ifs, no buts. ""And if the prime minister thinks we'll wave through a vague deal asking us to leap blindfolded into the unknown, she can think again."" But Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner said any vote on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations could not be a re-run of the 2016 in-out referendum. ""Despite what Keir said earlier, it's a public vote on the terms of our departure,"" he said. ""We desperately need a better, fairer society - we need to heal the wounds of Brexit, not reopen them, and only our movement, united with a proud socialist government, is capable of doing that."" The Labour Leave campaign group, which backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum, said Sir Keir was ""playing with fire"" and talk of a referendum made Labour look like ""the party of Remain"". ""We're damaging the Labour brand and alienating our supporters,"" said its general secretary Brendan Chilton. ""We have already had a vote on the UK's membership of the EU; it's been done and dusted. The Labour Party and its members must accept this and move on."" The prime minister's Chequers plan, which would see the UK staying closely aligned to the EU in some areas, such as the trade in goods, has been criticised by EU leaders and many of her own MPs. The Conservatives accused Labour of ""playing political games"". ""Labour seem determined to take us all back to square one by rejecting a deal out of hand then trying to delay Brexit and re-run the referendum,"" said Brexit minister Robin Walker. 12 key Brexit words you need to know Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"Mike Hall was fatally struck by a car during a road race in Australia Briton Mike Hall, one of the world's best ultra-endurance cyclists, died almost instantly when he was hit by a car during a race in Australia last year, an inquest has heard. Mr Hall, 35,had been competing in the Indian Pacific Wheel Racewhen he was struck on a highway near Canberra. An inquest has heard evidence that it was dark at the time and would have been hard for a motorist to see. Driver Shegu Bobb, 19, thought he had hit a kangaroo, the hearing was told. Mr Hall, from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, suffered major head, spinal and abdominal injuries, the Coroner's Court in the Australian Capital Territory heard. He had been in second place when he was hit by Mr Bobb's car at 06.22 local time on 31 March last year. The vehicle was travelling at 100km/h (62 mph). The coast-to-coast race - in which cyclists ride a 5,500km (3,400 miles) route from Fremantle to Sydney - was known for its difficulty, the inquest heard. A tribute to Mike Hall at the site of the crash Counsel assisting the inquest, Ken Archer, described the event as a ""Hunger Games on wheels"", with some riders completing up to 400km a day and sleeping only four hours a night. He said Mr Hall had been wearing dark clothing with little reflective material at the time of the collision. However, the inquest was also played documentary footage of Mr Hall racing at night in which he was visible. Mr Bobb was on his way to work at the time of the accident. Police told the court that he had been distracted by a parked truck as he turned on to the highway, and had no time to avoid the collision. No charges have been laid against Mr Bobb. He had suffered significant distress and shock after the crash, the inquest heard. The cyclist's death shocked the sport and prompted memorial rides in Australia and the UK. It also led to the cancellation of this year's Indian Pacific Wheel Race. Hall won the 2012 World Cycle Race and had been living in Monmouthshire, South Wales. His family has travelled to Australia to attend the inquest, which concludes on Thursday.

"This video can not be played Brett Kavanaugh: ""I've never sexually assaulted anyone"" US President Donald Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court says he will not pull out because of ""false accusations"". Brett Kavanaugh rejected allegations of sexual misconduct levelled against him by two women, telling Fox News he had ""never sexually assaulted anyone"". The judge and one of his accusers are due to testify publicly on Thursday. Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation would tilt the US top court in favour of conservatives for years to come, marking a major victory for Mr Trump. His first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, will give evidence to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, followed by rebuttal testimony from Judge Kavanaugh. She alleges he drunkenly tried to remove her clothing, pinned her to a bed and covered her mouth at a high school party when she was 15 and he was 17. And on Sunday, a former Yale University classmate said Mr Kavanaugh once exposed himself to her at a party. Judge Kavanaugh appeared on conservative-leaning Fox News alongside his wife, Ashley, on Monday night, as Republicans fought to keep his nomination on track. ""I'm not going to let false accusations drive us out of this process,"" Judge Kavanaugh said in an interview with Martha MacCallum. He strongly denied the latest allegation saying he ""never sexually assaulted anyone, in high school or otherwise"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""We're looking for a fair process where I can be heard defending my integrity, my lifelong record of promoting dignity and equality for women - starting with the women who knew me when I was 14 years old,"" Judge Kavanaugh told Fox News. #WhyIDidntReport supports Professor Ford The truth about false assault accusations Could Kavanaugh confirmation be derailed? ""I'm not questioning and have not questioned that perhaps Dr Ford at some point in her life was sexually assaulted by someone in some place, but what I know is I've never sexually assaulted anyone."" He added he was a virgin for ""many years"" after leaving high school. On Sunday, Deborah Ramirez, a Yale university classmate of Judge Kavanaugh,told the New Yorker,externalthat he had exposed himself to her at a dormitory party in the early 1980s. ""I remember a penis being in front of my face,"" she said. ""I knew that's not what I wanted, even in that state of mind."" Ms Ramirez, 53, said she ended up touching the man's genitals while attempting to push him away. This video can not be played Why it can take sexual assault allegations years to come out She says she remembers Brett Kavanaugh standing next to her and laughing as he pulled up his pants. The article says Ms Ramirez acknowledges gaps in her memory caused by alcohol that night. The New York Times said it had been unable to corroborate her story, despite ""several dozen"" interviews. This video can not be played Kavanaugh protesters arrested on Capitol Hill Aformer roommate of the judge at Yale, James Roche, has issued a statement,externallargely supporting Ms Ramirez. Mr Roche said he had become close friends with her at Yale. Even though he did not observe the incident she described, he believed Ms Ramirez to be ""unusually honest and straightforward"" and could not imagine she had made the story up. Michael Avenatti, a US lawyer known for representing adult film actress Stormy Daniels in her cases against President Trump, told reporters he is representing a third woman with ""credible information"" about sexual misconduct allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. He said he expected his client to come forward with her claims against Judge Kavanaugh within 48 hours. Speaking at the United Nations in New York on Monday, Mr Trump said Judge Kavanaugh's accusers had come ""out of the woodwork"" to make ""highly unsubstantiated"" and ""totally political"" allegations. ""There's a chance this could be one of the single most unfair, unjust things to happen to a candidate for anything,"" he said. Trump challenges Kavanaugh accuser Why is the US top court so important? Who are the justices? Meanwhile, senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said: ""It's starting to feel like a vast left-wing conspiracy."" Her phrase echoed Hillary Clinton's 1998 depiction of infidelity allegations against her husband, President Bill Clinton, as a ""vast right-wing conspiracy"". Democrats have continued to call for the vote to be delayed to allow for the claims to be fully investigated. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington Republican strategists have been saying for weeks that they believe Brett Kavanaugh could still be confirmed to the Supreme Court - if no new accusers emerge. Now another woman has come forward. Deborah Ramirez's recollection of the events from their first year at Yale is admittedly foggy. And as with Christine Blasey Ford, there are no supporting witnesses. Nevertheless, it becomes increasingly difficult for Judge Kavanaugh's side to dismiss what could now be characterised as a pattern of conduct, rather than an isolated accusation. Thursday's hearing, if it takes place, will probably be as much about Judge Kavanaugh's history with alcohol and the 1980s teen party culture as it will about any specific incident. That is much trickier ground for the nominee. The latest developments are already forcing both sides deeper into their partisan trenches. The White House is sticking by its man and focusing fire on what it views as a Democratic conspiracy. Those on the left see Republicans in a headlong rush to confirmation no matter the consequences or new information coming to light. Meanwhile, in the middle, are the same handful of moderate Republican senators. And in just over a month, mid-term voters also will have their say.

"A report says there should be no limit on the number of high-skilled workers, such as doctors, coming to the UK to work The cap on the number of high-skilled migrants coming to the UK should be scrapped, according toa key report commissioned by the government ahead of Brexit,external. The Migration Advisory Committee says these workers make a more positive contribution to the public finances. It suggests EU workers should be subject to the same visa rules as other migrants. But it notes the UK might offer them special status under a Brexit deal. The government has said it will ""carefully consider"" the committee's proposals. How has EU migration changed the UK? Labour backed the report, calling for an ""end to discrimination"" against non-EU migrants. Under the current system, workers from the European Economic Area (EEA) - which includes all EU countries including the UK, as well as Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein - enjoy freedom of movement, travelling and working within the area without visas. The committee recommends a policy allowing greater access for higher-skilled migration while restricting access for lower-skilled workers. It suggests extending the current scheme for high-skilled non-EEA migrants - known as a Tier 2 visa - to those from EEA countries as well. As part of this process, the cap on the total amount of workers allowed to enter under Tier 2 should be abolished and the range of jobs eligeable for the visas expanded, the committee says. Current policy is to allow 20,700 high-skilled workers into the UK each year on Tier 2 visas. The current salary threshold for such visas is Â£30,000, which the report says should be retained. Top priority is given to jobs on a ""shortage occupation list,external"". Examples include: Geophysicists Mining engineers 3D computer animators Games designers Cyber security experts Emergency medicine consultants Paediatric consultants With regard to low-skilled workers, the committee says it is ""not convinced there needs to be a work route for low-skilled workers"" from the EU to fill jobs in industries such as catering or hospitality. The ""possible exception"" to this rule could be for seasonal agriculture, where 99% of the workers come from EU countries. Reality Check: Who are the low-skilled EU workers? It also does not recommend that there should be exceptions for workers coming to the UK to work in the public sector. The committee - which is made up of independent experts, says it does not seen any ""compelling reasons to offer a different set of rules"" for workers from the EEA than those from other countries - unless such a position has been arrived at as part of the Brexit negotiations. ""A migrant's impact depends on factors such as their skills, employment, age and use of public services, and not fundamentally on their nationality,"" it says. Do we really know how many people come to the UK? Taking stock of where we are with Brexit Brexit: All you need to know The report goes on to say there is no evidence that increased European migration has damaged life in the UK. It concludes that EU migrants pay more in tax than they receive in benefits, contribute more to the NHS workforce than the healthcare they access, and have no effect on crime rates. It says the impact of all EEA migration to the UK since 2004 was almost certainly less than that of the fall in the value of the pound following the referendum vote. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent The report says there should be no route to ensure low-skilled workers can come in from the EU Ministers commissioned this report because they needed clear facts on the role of European workers in the country - and the implications of ending their freedom of movement. But it's too soon to know how many of the committee's recommendations will be adopted because of the Brexit elephant in the room. So while the experts want no special immigration deal for future EU workers (the report does not concern those who are already living in the UK), it doesn't consider whether a special deal would be good or bad for Britain. Such a deal is a possibility. The prime minister's Chequers plan proposes a ""mobility framework"" - a system allowing British and EU citizens to study and work in each other countries, potentially linked to a trade deal. So if the ministers offer special access for future EU workers, in return for something they want for the UK, this report won't help us know whether it is worth it. The MAC was asked to do the research in July 2017 by then Home Secretary Amber Rudd. It is thought it could shape the government's post-Brexit immigration policy. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Mrs May might start ""sketching out"" her plans for this at October's Conservative Party conference. He added that the report would increase pressure on her to not compromise on freedom of movement during the Brexit negotiations. Please upgrade your browser Stephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said if the recommendations were adopted, it would signal ""the biggest change to the UK labour market in a generation"" and would represent a ""huge shift"" for sectors such as hotels and food manufacturing. He said: ""If enacted, these proposals would effectively end low-skilled migration, while prioritising mid- and high-skill migration in areas where we have labour shortages. The Royal College of Nursing welcomed the recommendations, saying the UK had long depended on recruiting nursing professionals from around the world. But Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said the report was ""blind to the impact"" of EU migration to a number of communities. He said the proposals would ""permit continued high levels of immigration"" and ""the overall outcome would be to weaken immigration control"". The government says it will listen to the report and bring in an immigration system that works for the whole of the UK, adding: ""EU citizens play an important and positive role in our economy and society and we want that to continue after we leave"". Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the UK's immigration policy should be ""based on our economic needs, while meeting our legal obligations and treating people fairly"". ""[This] means ending the discrimination against non-EU migrants, especially from the Commonwealth,"" she added. But Yvette Cooper, Labour MP and chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the report was ""puzzling"" with ""significant gaps"" between the MAC's research and recommendations. ""The MAC admit they have ignored the crucial relationship between immigration and trade,"" she said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Immigration policy is about deciding who can come to the UK and what they can do while they are here. But how exactly does this system work? Net migration is the difference between the number of people arriving in the UK versus the number leaving, for at least 12 months. This is what the government means when they talk about reducing net migration to the tens of thousands. Although net migration is at its lowest point since early 2014, it still stands at 244,000. Migrants make up a bigger proportion of the UK population now than they did in 2000. While non-EU nationals have remained a fairly stable percentage of the population as a whole, EU nationals are making up an increased proportion. This is due to the freedom of movement rules between EU member states. EU citizens are free to live and work in any of the bloc's 28 member states - set to fall to 27 when the UK leaves - without the need for a visa. This is known as free movement of labour, one of the EU's four freedoms along with capital, goods and services. There are some restrictions - after three months, EU migrants should prove that they are working, a student or have sufficient resources to support themselves without relying on the benefits system. Although all EU nations take advantage of free movement, the greatest movers to the UK in recent years have been from Eastern European countries. For those wanting to move to the UK from outside the EU, to work or study, there are different rules. You must apply for one of a number of visas. These can range from Tier 1, preserved for investors and ""exceptional talent"", to Tier 5 visas for short-term voluntary and educational programmes. The two most common are the Tier 2 skilled worker visas and Tier 4 student visas. Currently, no Tier 3 - unskilled labour - visas are being given out. Some of these visas allow you to apply to bring dependants such as children and partners. Visas work on a points-based system. The criteria for these visas has got tougher in recent years. For example, for a Tier2 ""experienced skilled worker"" visa, you now need to be paid at least Â£30,000 to apply, up almost Â£10,000 from 2011. You get more points for higher salaries or if your job is on the list of shortage occupations. The number of these Tier 2 visas handed out is currently capped at 20,700 per year. Most visas come with other conditions, including a knowledge of English, the need for a sponsor and agreeing not to claim benefits for a period of time. The different rules for EU and non-EU migrants mean their reasons for moving to the UK are considerably different. For people who want to claim asylum, they must first reach the UK. Once they have claimed asylum, they are given housing and financial support by the government until their application is dealt with. After that they might be granted refugee status, allowed to stay for other reasons or sent home. If an applicant or their dependant is denied asylum, they can appeal against the decision. There is usually a high rate of success in these appeals - in 2017, there were 17,390 asylum appeals heard in a lower asylum tribunal, of which 6,854 were successful. The UK has also committed to taking in 20,000 Syrian refugees by 2020 as part of the international humanitarian effort. If you have been in the UK for at least five years without living elsewhere, you can apply for British citizenship. To do so, you need to pass English language and Life in the UK tests and be of ""good character"". In 2016, the majority of people granted British citizenship came from two areas: sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. People who breach the terms of their entry visas (or simply overstay as tourists), are breaking the law. It is not entirely clear how many illegal immigrants there are in the UK, althoughestimatesrange from 300,000 to over a million. Although tough rules have been gradually introduced under successive governments, the ""hostile environment"" policy of 2012 bolstered attempts to make life in the UK more difficult for illegal immigrants. This has included reducing ability to access work, healthcare and housing. Enforced removals refers to those who are physically removed from the country. If someone disagrees with a decision made by the Home Office they can take it to an immigration and asylum tribunal. In 2012, legal aid was removed for many immigration cases, and there has been a recent decrease in cases heard. In 2017, 53% of the total claims ruled on were rejected. This increases to 60% when just taking into account asylum tribunals. People might go to an immigration tribunal for a number of reasons, including breaches of freedom of movement, human rights and issues relating to family.

"This video can not be played Gosia admits it is now a difficult situation for all concerned but says Talia should be with her A mother whose baby daughter was taken from her at 15 weeks old is fighting for her to be returned six years on. Talia Szymanowicz was abducted and taken to Libya by her father in 2012 and mum Gosia wants her back in the UK. ""I know it won't be easy but with help we will be together,"" said Gosia, who speaks to her only child via Skype. Her local MP in Cardiff wants the government to step in and do more. The Home Office said it did not routinely comment on individual cases. ""My daughter should be with me and I should be with my daughter,"" Gosia said. ""With love everything is possible."" But the situation is complicated. The parents who abduct their own children The extraordinary story of how I found my parents How a toddler was snatched by two teenage girls Gosia's estranged husband Maher Belaid was jailed after returning to the UK alone and failing to reunite the little girl with her mother, leaving Talia instead with her grandmother near Tripoli. He has now been released and facing deportation. As for helping Talia - who has a British passport - the Foreign Office (FCO) says because it has no consular presence it cannot help British people leave Libya. Security in the north African country is regarded as so fragile, with terrorist attacks ""very likely"", that the FCO has consistently advised against all travel to Libya since 2014. Maher Belaid could face deportation which was deferred after his release from prison Talia was just four months old when her father took her to Heathrow Airport. It was while his wife was shopping in Cardiff, ahead of a planned family trip to see Gosia's mother in Poland. When Belaid did not return as planned, Gosia spent the night phoning the police and hospital emergency departments, fearing something had happened to them. At 23:00 her husband called to say he was in Tunisia, and Talia was safe. ""That moment, I just started to scream - to shout,"" she said. ""The 13th of November 2012 changed my life."" Since then Gosia has been doing all she can to bring her daughter home. Belaid returned to the UK alone in 2014 and was arrested at the airport. He was jailed for six years for failing to comply with a court order to return his daughter, who has remained with Talia's grandmother near Tripoli. He was released in August last year after serving half his sentence and was told deportation proceedings would be deferred for 12 months, to allow time for Talia to be returned to the UK. Man rescued from air pocket in shipwreck WATCH: Gay girl's suicide prompts church changes As progress has not been made, Gosia - who works as a carer - is now concerned that her estranged husband will be deported, removing any chance of her being reunited with her daughter. But in March after four years without contact, Gosia has been able to have regular Skype conversations with her daughter - thanks to the Reunite charity. Now six, Talia speaks Arabic, with only a little English, so Belaid translates the three-way conversations from his home in London. Gosia believes time is running out for the situation to be resolved ""When I first saw her I was very nervous about how she would be, because she doesn't know me,"" said Gosia. ""I thought maybe she wouldn't like to speak with me - but I was happy and surprised she spoke with me and she gave me lots of kisses, and made a heart with her hands. ""Every day for me is very difficult because when I go to sleep I just think 'What is she doing and who is dressing her now?' Every day I think about Talia."" It has been hard for Gosia to hear her daughter call someone else ""mum"" and she knows a reunion will be tough for everyone. ""I know it won't be easy but with help we will be together."" Gosia Szymanowicz with newborn Talia Jo Stevens, the Labour MP for Cardiff Central wants the Foreign and Justice Secretaries to look again at the case. ""Time is running out,"" she said. ""There is a court order that requires Talia to be returned to the UK, and so if the ex-husband is not prepared to do that, all options should be on the table in terms of returning him to prison. ""It needs political will, it needs legal experts involved - part of the problem has been a lack of availability of legal aid and I make an appeal, if anyone has expertise and can help, please get in touch with me, we need all hands on board to help get her home. ""It makes me angry that someone can flout the law here, that foreign countries don't abide by international human rights. At the centre of this is an innocent child that has not been able to see her mother."" A Home Office spokesman said: ""All removal decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, with the individual circumstances of each case given very careful consideration.""

"Thousands of migrants arrive in Italy every year after crossing the Mediterranean The Italian government has passed a decree which will make it easier to deport migrants and strip them of Italian citizenship. Migrants could now be expelled if they are found guilty of serious crimes such as rape and assault. Previously, this was only possible at the end of a lengthy appeals process. Interior Minister Matteo Salvini described the measure as ""a step forward to make Italy safer"". The measure needs the backing of lawmakers. The decree also envisages that asylum seekers accused of drug dealing will have their applications denied, Mr Salvini said. He has been a prominent figure in a public immigration crackdown in Italy since his government, a coalition between the right-wing League party and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, came to power in June. The minister has frequently come into conflict with rescue ship operators and last month was involved in a public stand-off about the disembarkation of 150 migrants on a coast guard ship on the island of Sicily. Mr Salvini is under investigation for his role in the dispute. Rescue ship allowed to disembark in Sicily In a separate development, a rescue vessel operating in the central Mediterranean Sea has had its registration revoked by Panama leaving its future operations in jeopardy. When the Aquarius next docks, it will have to remove its Panama maritime flag and cannot set sail without a new registration, raising the possibility it may end up stuck in port. It is the last private rescue ship picking up migrants trying to cross from Libya to Europe and is currently sailing to the French port of Marseille with migrants on board. Migrant taxi service or charitable rescuers? On board the migrant ship Aquarius The man who cut the migrant flow to Italy The charities running the Aquarius accuse the Italian government of pressuring Panama into deflagging it. The two groups which lease it, MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) and SOS MediterranÃ©e, say they were notified of the decision by the Panama Maritime Authority (PMA) on Saturday. The Panama Maritime Authority (PMA) only registered the ship last month, after the Gibraltar authorities revoked its flag The authority is said to have described the ship as a ""political problem"" for the country's government, and said Italian authorities had urged them to take ""immediate action"" against them, according to SOS MediterranÃ©e. Mr Salvini, who has previously described the aid boats as a ""taxi service"" for migrants, denies his country put pressure on Panama. According to the United Nations, more than 1,700 migrants have died trying to cross to Europe in 2018. The Aquarius has been operating in the area since February 2016, finding itself at the centre of diplomatic stand-offs in recent months over where to land rescued migrants. It was under the flag of the Gibraltar Maritime Administration until August this year, when it was given ""notice of removal"" and re-registered with Panama. Migration to Europe in charts Mediterranean crossings 'deadlier than ever' The ship's operators say they were notified of the new decision while on a current mission, and say they have 58 survivors on board from two boats they found in distress. In a joint statement, the charities insisted they were in ""full compliance"" with maritime law and denounced the decision as condemning hundreds to death. The statement asks for European governments to step in to allow the vessel to continue its operations by either reassuring the Panamanian authorities or issuing it a new flag.

"Dellen Millard at his father's firm MillardAir A former Canadian millionaire and twice-convicted murderer has been convicted of killing his father, whose death was initially ruled a suicide. Dellen Millard wept when he heard the judge pronounce him guilty of murdering his father Wayne Millard. Millard is already serving two life sentences for the murders of Laura Babcock and Tim Bosma. He inherited the family fortune after his father was found shot in the head. The 2012 death was originally ruled a suicide, but on Monday an Ontario Superior Court judge found him guilty of shooting his father while he slept. Millard had told police his father had been depressed and an alcoholic. ""He carried some great sadness with him throughout life that I never knew - he never wanted to share that with me,"" he said the day after his father died. Dellen Millard: The fun-loving heir whose killings stunned Canada But employees at MillardAir, the family's aviation company, said there had been tensions between Millard and his father, according to a CBC investigation. Six months later, the disappearance of Tim Bosma set off a chain of investigations that would eventually lead to Millard being charged with three murders. The 32-year-old was trying to sell his vehicle when Millard responded to an ad online. Millard and his friend Mark Smich met Bosma at his family home outside Hamilton, Ontario. Bosma agreed to go with the pair while they took it for a test drive in May 2013. He was never seen again. ""It was just a truck, a stupid truck,"" Bosma's wife said, before Smich and Millard's arrest. Bosma's truck was eventually found by police on a property owned by Millard's mother, and soon he and Smich became prime suspects in his murder. The truck had been stripped, but gunshot residue and traces of his blood were found inside. Police also began digging around into Millard's past, his father's death, and the disappearance of his former partner Laura Babcock the year before. Three months before his father's death, Babcock had gone missing. Eventually, police would learn that she had been involved in a love triangle between Millard and his current girlfriend, and that Millard had promised to ""remove her from our lives"". Her body was never found, but soon after her disappearance Millard purchased an incinerator. Police have never been able to identify Babcock's and Bosma's remains, but believe both were shot and their bodies burned. Millard and Smich were found guilty of Bosma's murder in 2016; they were also found guilty of murdering Babcock in 2017. Police then began to re-examine Wayne Millard's apparent suicide following the convictions, Prosecutors alleged Millard wanted to kill his father to protect his inheritance, which was being used to fund a new aviation business. Millard said he was at Smich's house the night of his father's death, but phone records reveal he travelled back to his father's house in the early hours of the morning. A gun purchased by Millard illegally was also found next to his father with Millard's DNA on it. Smich was not charged in the death of Millard's father.

"This video can not be played The find is part of a 10-year archaeological project Archaeologists have found a 400-year-old shipwreck off the coast of Portugal, in what one specialist called the ""discovery of a decade"". Spices, ceramics and cannons engraved with Portugal's coat of arms all lie around the wreck, found near Cascais, close to the capital Lisbon. The team believe the ship was returning from India when it sank sometime between 1575 and 1625. This was at the height of Portugal's spice trade with Asia. Who owns treasure hidden under the sea? Hunting the shipwrecks of the slave trade At a depth of 12m (40ft) the wreck was very well preserved, project director Jorge Freire told Reuters news agency. ""From a heritage perspective, this is the discovery of the decade,"" he said, calling it ""the most important find of all time"" for the country. The project's head called the wreck ""very well-preserved"" Chinese porcelain from the late 16th and early 17th centuries was also among the wreck, as were bronze artillery pieces and cowry shells - a currency used in the slave trade. Cascais municipal council said the ship was found at the start of September while dredging the mouth of the Tagus river, which runs past the resort town through Lisbon. Mayor Carlos Carreiras told the Guardian newspaper it was an ""extraordinary discovery"", which will reinforce their ""collective identity and shared values"".

"Mike Hall was fatally struck by a car during a road race in Australia Briton Mike Hall, one of the world's best ultra-endurance cyclists, died almost instantly when he was hit by a car during a race in Australia last year, an inquest has heard. Mr Hall, 35,had been competing in the Indian Pacific Wheel Racewhen he was struck on a highway near Canberra. An inquest has heard evidence that it was dark at the time and would have been hard for a motorist to see. Driver Shegu Bobb, 19, thought he had hit a kangaroo, the hearing was told. Mr Hall, from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, suffered major head, spinal and abdominal injuries, the Coroner's Court in the Australian Capital Territory heard. He had been in second place when he was hit by Mr Bobb's car at 06.22 local time on 31 March last year. The vehicle was travelling at 100km/h (62 mph). The coast-to-coast race - in which cyclists ride a 5,500km (3,400 miles) route from Fremantle to Sydney - was known for its difficulty, the inquest heard. A tribute to Mike Hall at the site of the crash Counsel assisting the inquest, Ken Archer, described the event as a ""Hunger Games on wheels"", with some riders completing up to 400km a day and sleeping only four hours a night. He said Mr Hall had been wearing dark clothing with little reflective material at the time of the collision. However, the inquest was also played documentary footage of Mr Hall racing at night in which he was visible. Mr Bobb was on his way to work at the time of the accident. Police told the court that he had been distracted by a parked truck as he turned on to the highway, and had no time to avoid the collision. No charges have been laid against Mr Bobb. He had suffered significant distress and shock after the crash, the inquest heard. The cyclist's death shocked the sport and prompted memorial rides in Australia and the UK. It also led to the cancellation of this year's Indian Pacific Wheel Race. Hall won the 2012 World Cycle Race and had been living in Monmouthshire, South Wales. His family has travelled to Australia to attend the inquest, which concludes on Thursday.

"Victims and their children are being put at risk when domestic abusers return to the community, a report says. HM Inspectorate of Probation found that, in seven out of 10 cases, protection for victims was inadequate. Chief inspector Dame Glenys Stacey said the private Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) responsible for managing offenders in England and Wales were ""nowhere near effective enough."" The government has announced it will scrap their contracts in 2020. The report said probation officers' failure to understand the danger to victims of abuse was of ""grave concern"" in some instances. Dame Glenys said: ""Too often we were left wondering how safe victims and children were, especially when practitioners failed to act on new information indicating that they could be in danger."" Inspectors examined 112 cases in five areas of England, discovering that only 27% of eligible offenders had been referred to an accredited programme designed to prevent further abuse. Home visits were often considered a ""luxury"", and they were only carried out in 19% of the cases where the circumstances required them. Probation officers said their workload of up to 60 complex cases each and a lack of training made it hard to be effective. One said: ""It's a fingers-crossed approach."" Labour backs paid leave for abuse victims 'Not enough support' for male abuse victims Private probation contracts to end early In one example given by inspectors, an offender was allowed to move back in with his partner and child - without social services being informed or probation asking for the assessment of the child's safeguarding needs. Another was allowed to leave an abuse prevention programme because he said he had childcare responsibilities. The watchdog said that in seven cases seen by inspectors, the failure to take essential action to protect victims were so concerning they had to demand immediate remedial action. CRCs were created in an overhaul of probation services in 2014. The privately-owned companies manage thousands of low- and medium-risk offenders across England and Wales, while the high-risk cases are handled by the public National Probation Service. Women's Aid Chief Executive Katie Ghose said the report shows CRCs were ""failing victims"" and were ""currently not fit for purpose when it comes to domestic abuse cases"". Inspectors said that too often CRCs focused on meeting contractual targets at the expense of safe practice. Probation officers regarded meeting a 15-day sentencing plan target as a success, for instance. But the report said that in some cases it was necessary to take immediate action to safeguard victims and children. Prisons and Probation Minister Rory Stewart said the government was taking ""decisive action"" by ending the contracts early. He said it was also investing Â£22m in support for prisoners returning to the community and consulting on the future of probation services. ""By putting in place new arrangements, we will heed the lessons from what has and hasn't worked, so probation plays its full part in tackling domestic abuse and protecting victims,"" he said. Under a proposed new system, 10 probation regions would be created in England, with each containing one NPS division and one CRC. In Wales, the NPS would assume responsibility for the management of all offenders.

"This video can not be played Delegates cheer as Keir Starmer says ""nobody is ruling out remain as an option"" in a further Brexit referendum Labour delegates have approved a motion that would keep all options - including a fresh referendum - on the table if MPs are deadlocked over Brexit. It was passed by a show of hands at the party conference in Liverpool. The vast majority were in favour of the motion, with only a small number against. Leader Jeremy Corbyn - who has previously ruled out another EU referendum - has said he will respect the result of the vote. Sir Keir Starmer said earlier that the option of staying in the EU would be on the ballot paper in any future referendum if Labour gets its way. In his party conference speech, the shadow Brexit secretary said all options should be kept on the table, including a so-called People's Vote, to ""stop a destructive Tory Brexit"". But a senior Unite official said another vote would ""reopen the wounds of Brexit"" not heal them. Labour's policy had been to force an election if MPs are deadlocked over Brexit but members succeeded in getting a debate on getting a fresh referendum on to the agenda at the conference. Starmer insists Labour 'clear' on EU vote Kuenssberg: Labour's conference '360' Sir Keir told Labour activists if a general election was not possible ""then other options must be kept open"". ""That includes campaigning for a public vote,"" he said. ""It is right for Parliament to have the first say but if we need to break the impasse, our options must include campaigning for a public vote and nobody is ruling out Remain as an option.""

But he later said ""all options"" were on the table - a point reinforced by Sir Keir. Labour - which wants the UK to remain in a customs union but not the single market - has not ruled out voting for any deal Mrs May brings back from Brussels, ahead of the UK's 29 March departure date. But Sir Keir said the six tests his party has set - including guarantees on workers' rights and retaining the economic benefits of existing market arrangements - were unlikely to be met. ""Some have said Labour could vote for any deal the Tories reach. Some have said we may abstain. Some have said we may vote for a vague deal,"" he said. ""So, let me be very clear - right here, right now: if Theresa May brings back a deal that does not meet our tests - and that looks increasingly likely - Labour will vote against it. No ifs, no buts. ""And if the prime minister thinks we'll wave through a vague deal asking us to leap blindfolded into the unknown, she can think again."" But Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner said any vote on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations could not be a re-run of the 2016 in-out referendum. ""Despite what Keir said earlier, it's a public vote on the terms of our departure,"" he said. ""We desperately need a better, fairer society - we need to heal the wounds of Brexit, not reopen them, and only our movement, united with a proud socialist government, is capable of doing that."" The Labour Leave campaign group, which backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum, said Sir Keir was ""playing with fire"" and talk of a referendum made Labour look like ""the party of Remain"". ""We're damaging the Labour brand and alienating our supporters,"" said its general secretary Brendan Chilton. ""We have already had a vote on the UK's membership of the EU; it's been done and dusted. The Labour Party and its members must accept this and move on."" The prime minister's Chequers plan, which would see the UK staying closely aligned to the EU in some areas, such as the trade in goods, has been criticised by EU leaders and many of her own MPs. The Conservatives accused Labour of ""playing political games"". ""Labour seem determined to take us all back to square one by rejecting a deal out of hand then trying to delay Brexit and re-run the referendum,"" said Brexit minister Robin Walker. 12 key Brexit words you need to know Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"Kevin Systrom (R) and Mike Krieger continued to run Instagram after it was acquired by Facebook in 2012 The co-founders of photo-sharing giant Instagram, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, are both leaving the firm. Mr Systrom, chief executive, said they were departing to ""explore our curiosity and creativity again"". Instagram, purchased by Facebook in 2012 for $1bn (Â£760m) in cash and stock, has more than a billion users. There had been reports of tension between the pair and Facebook, and the departures add to what has been a troubling year for the parent company. Kevin Systrom talks to BBC's Newsbeat How Instagram became a social media giant Mr Systrom, 34, the CEO, and Mr Krieger, 32, the chief technical officer, started the image sharing site in 2010 and continued to run the service after it was acquired by Facebook. Not a great deal. They reportedly only told the Facebook leadership on Monday so the departure appears pretty sudden. In a blog post,Mr Systrom said: ""We're now ready for our next chapter."",external He added: ""Building new things requires that we step back, understand what inspires us, and match that with what the world needs; that's what we plan to do."" There was no animosity in the blog post. Mr Systrom said the pair both remained ""excited for the future of Instagram and Facebook"". Allow Twitter content?

CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement that Instagram reflected the founders' ""combined creative talents"". ""I've learned a lot working with them for the past six years and have really enjoyed it,"" he said. ""I'm looking forward to seeing what they build next."" The four biggest hazards of social media Facebook and Instagram introduce time limit tool Are Instagram stars facing a brand backlash? The BBC understands that tension started to grow between Mr Systrom and Mr Zuckerberg as far back as 2014 when Facebook purchased WhatsApp. The social network spent $19bn on the chat app in 2014, and Instagram's co-founder is said to have become concerned that he had sold out too soon. The dominance of Facebook may have grated with Instagram's founding ethos He also saw Snapchat prosper - an app Facebook had tried and failed to take over. ""The irony is that Kevin built the more successful product,"" one insider commented. There are reports that Mr Systrom had sought to maintain Instagram's independence and that this trickled down to make staff on Facebook and Instagram less inclined to be collaborative. But there was pressure for their two apps to become more integrated, and features were added allowing, for example, Instagram Stories - videos that self-destruct after 24 hours - to be cross-posted to Facebook. Despite remaining Instagram's figurehead at product launches and other public appearances, Mr Systrom's influence declined over time, a source told the BBC, as more Facebook executives were transferred to the photo service. ""Kevin maybe didn't have the fight in him anymore and probably didn't agree with some of the product decisions,"" the source said. ""This is just the natural end to an era."" Analysis by Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter The firm was quite deliberately treated like a separate company owned by Facebook, rather than merely a department or division, because it was Instagram's culture that made it such a valuable acquisition. Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger were responsible for that culture - the entire feel of an app that was in many respects the anti-Facebook. It lacked the clutter and noise that had made Facebook bloated in many people's eyes. But slowly, in recent years, the Instagram app started putting on that weight. Algorithmic ordering of the timeline... and ads, so many ads. One of the names being touted as the next boss of Instagram is Adam Mosseri. He's currently head of product, and has a CV that some of Instagram's loyal users might find ominous - he was formerly in charge of Facebook's Newsfeed. Indeed not. In fact it echoes what happened with WhatsApp. Its chief executive and co-founderJan Koum said in April he would quit the popular messaging servicehe co-founded in 2009 and sold to Facebook in 2014. Oddly,Mr Koum's departure statement is similar to Mr Systrom's. Analysts of that move also spoke of clashes with Facebook. Mr Koum's departure sparked an executive reshuffle that saw the tightening of Mr Zuckerberg's control over operations. Facebook has been under intense pressure this year over the issues of safeguarding customer data and the misuse of its platforms by those wishing to spread fake news, including for political ends. In March, in the week Mr Zuckerberg apologised for the handling of a historic data breach, Facebook ended $58bn (Â£44bn) lower in value. Mr Systrom and Mr Krieger met while studying at Stanford University. The two were inspired to create the Instagram app - originally launched just for iPhones in 2010 - by old Polaroid pictures. This video can not be played Instagram boss shares his secrets Instagram had about 30 million users in 2012, the year it was purchased by Facebook for what appeared to be an eye-watering $1bn. It was also ad-free. That changed. But so did the number of users - now more than a billion. The Forbes billionaires list estimates Kevin Systrom's net worth at $1.4bn,external. Mike Krieger's net worth is less. There are no definitive figures, ranging from $100m to $500m. One Twitter post highlighted the use of the word ""again"" in Mr Systrom's ""explore our curiosity and creativity again"". ""Was it a slight dig from Systrom with the 'again'? You be the judge (I judge yea),"" wrote Kara Swisher. NBC media reporter Dylan Byers wrote that the Instagram pair had saved Mr Zuckerberg. Allow Twitter content?

"Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died in a hospital in Nice after collapsing on a BA flight A 15-year-old girl who died after a severe allergic reaction to a baguette from an airport Pret a Manger said ""Daddy, help me"" as she struggled to breathe, an inquest has heard. Natasha Ednan-Laperouse became ill on a flight to Nice on 17 July 2016. Despite her father administering two EpiPen injections, Natashadied in a hospital in Nicewithin hours, West London Coroner's Court heard. Pret a Manger said it was ""deeply saddened"" by her death. Natasha from Fulham, west London, ate an artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette bought from a Pret shop at about 07:00 BST in Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport, the inquest heard. She began to feel ill about 20 minutes into the British Airways flight, and suffered a cardiac arrest and died later the same day. The inquest heard the baguette contained sesame - which Natasha was allergic to - but the ingredient was not listed on the packaging. Natasha's mother, brother and father attended the inquest at West London Coroner's Court The family's lawyer, Jeremy Hyam QC, became emotional as he read a statement by Natasha's father, Nadim Ednan-Laperouse, at the first day of the inquest on Monday. Natasha had just finished school for the summer and was on her way to Nice for a four-day ""special treat"" with her best friend, Bethany, and her father. Mr Ednan-Laperouse's statement said he first applied an EpiPen when Natasha felt her throat growing itchy and red hives appeared on her midriff. When her symptoms did not improve he then used her second EpiPen, the inquest heard. ""Natasha said that she still couldn't breathe and desperately looked at me, she said 'Daddy, help me, I can't breathe',"" the statement read. She soon lost consciousness and cabin staff and an onboard junior doctor applied CPR for the rest of the journey. Mr Ednan-Laperouse recalled being ""totally focused on saving her life"" and ""begging her to fight and live"", but as his hope began to fade that she would survive in hospital he put a phone to her ear so that her mother and brother could say goodbye, the inquest was told. ""The pain and agony of the call was beyond anything I have known,"" his statement said. Natasha had eaten a baguette just before boarding the plane at Heathrow Mr Ednan-Laperouse told the hearing he had bought the baguette as it ""contained all the ingredients she loved and could eat"" and the label gave ""no indication or mention that sesame seeds were present"". After his daughter's death, Mr Ednan-Laperouse - the founder of Wow Toys company - said he called his own mother and asked her to visit a branch of Pret a Manger in west London to examine a similar baguette. Finding no ingredients on the label or on the shelf, his mother made inquiries at the counter and was handed a folder of information. ""My mother looked down the list and found that the baguette dough had sesame seed inside it,"" his statement said. ""I was stunned that a big food company like Pret could mislabel a sandwich and this could cause my daughter to die."" Oliver Campbell QC, representing the chain, said Natasha's father ""must unfortunately be mistaken"" about his recollections of the packaging, because Pret food does not typically display ingredients. The inquest heard that Pret fridges usually had transparent stickers with white text outlining allergy information. Mr Hyam suggested these had not been in place at the airport branch in July 2016. Abdoulaye-Djouma Diallo, the general manager of the branch at the time, told the inquest he was ""confident and sure"" he had put stickers on the tills and fridges. However, Mr Hyam said a health officer from Hillingdon Council visited the branch in May 2017 and reported ""there were no till stickers to be seen at the till area"". Sesame is one of 14 allergens that consumers must be made aware of when it is used as an ingredient in food products, according toEU Regulations,external However, the EU rules say individual member states are responsible for deciding on how information about non pre-packaged food is provided to the customer The UK'sFood Regulations 2014,externalallow freshly handmade, non pre-packaged food to not be individually labelled Pret confirmed at the time of Natasha's death products would not have been individually labelled with allergen or ingredient information, and that this was within regulations However, Pret said there were signs in the fridge and at till points telling consumers with allergies to speak to a manager for advice or to seeits allergen guide,external Natasha had suffered from food allergies her entire life, but diligently scrutinised labels and was alert to the danger of cross-contamination, the inquest heard. She put ""her trust in food labelling"", her father's statement added. UK regulations mean some foods can be sold without individual labels denoting which allergens they contain Antihistamines, EpiPens and inhalers had never before failed to halt an allergic reaction, he said. In a statement ahead of Monday's hearing, Natasha's parents said she loved horse-riding, ice-skating, and wanted to pursue a career in law. They added that she had been ""so excited"" about what was going to be ""her best summer ever"". Representatives from Pret a Manger and BA are expected to give evidence at the inquest, the family's lawyer has said. The inquest is expected to last five days.

"This video can not be played Delegates cheer as Keir Starmer says ""nobody is ruling out remain as an option"" in a further Brexit referendum Labour delegates have approved a motion that would keep all options - including a fresh referendum - on the table if MPs are deadlocked over Brexit. It was passed by a show of hands at the party conference in Liverpool. The vast majority were in favour of the motion, with only a small number against. Leader Jeremy Corbyn - who has previously ruled out another EU referendum - has said he will respect the result of the vote. Sir Keir Starmer said earlier that the option of staying in the EU would be on the ballot paper in any future referendum if Labour gets its way. In his party conference speech, the shadow Brexit secretary said all options should be kept on the table, including a so-called People's Vote, to ""stop a destructive Tory Brexit"". But a senior Unite official said another vote would ""reopen the wounds of Brexit"" not heal them. Labour's policy had been to force an election if MPs are deadlocked over Brexit but members succeeded in getting a debate on getting a fresh referendum on to the agenda at the conference. Starmer insists Labour 'clear' on EU vote Kuenssberg: Labour's conference '360' Sir Keir told Labour activists if a general election was not possible ""then other options must be kept open"".

"This video can not be played John McDonnell says the new water firms will have ""unprecedented levels of openness and transparency"". Labour would force all large firms to give workers shares worth up to Â£500 a year each, John McDonnell has said. In his main party conference speech, the shadow chancellor set out plans for ""inclusive ownership funds"". He also announced that the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour. Existing bosses would be fired and control handed to workers, local councils and customers, with new executives hired on reduced salaries. Simon Jack: Can Labour's plan work? He told Labour delegates: ""There will be unprecedented openness and transparency in how the industry will be managed. ""We are ending the profiteering in dividends, vast executive salaries, and excessive interest payments. ""Surpluses will be reinvested in water infrastructure and staff, or used to reduce bills. Real investment will allow the highest environmental standards."" Ownership of the existing water and sewerage companies would be transferred to new Regional Water Authorities, with day-to-day operational management in the hands of professional management and the wider workforce. Existing shareholders would be compensated with bonds and all staff would be transferred to the same jobs, ""except for senior executives and directors, whose posts will be re-advertised on dramatically reduced salaries capped by our 20:1 pay ratio policy"", Labour sources said. The new authorities would be self-financing, along similar lines to Transport for London, which manages the London Underground, rail and bus services. Labour also plans to nationalise the railways, energy and mail industries. Mr McDonnell also announced: Plans for a new Public and Community Ownership Unit at the Treasury to bring PFI contracts in-house Plans to force companies to ""sign up to the Fair Tax Mark standards, demonstrating transparently that they pay their fair share of taxes"" A new international forum to deal with future economic crises, headed by Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz Plans to give workers in private industry more of a say - and a financial stake - in industry are a key plank of Labour's industrial strategy. Since its conference opened in Liverpool on Sunday, Labour has already announced plans for worker representation on company boards and to make employers provideup to 10 days' paid leave for victims of domestic violence. Under Labour's ""inclusive ownership fund"" proposal, Mr McDonnell said workers would be given a financial stake in their employers and more say over how companies are run. Firms would have to put 1% of their shares into the fund every year up to a maximum of 10%. The amount of share capital available to workers would be capped at Â£500, with the rest - estimated at Â£2.1bn a year by the end of a five-year Parliamentary term - going into a fund to pay for public services and welfare. The scheme would apply to companies with more than 250 workers, although smaller firms could set up inclusive ownership funds if they wanted to. Labour calculates that 40% of the UK's private sector workforce - some 10.7 million people - would initially be covered by the scheme. Dividend payouts would be made at a flat rate to all employees of the firm. The funds would be held and managed collectively, with a bar on selling or trading their shareholdings. The system would be similar to that operated by employee-owned retailer John Lewis. But payments from the fund would be made to individual, eligible employees, Labour sources said. Labour's plans are based on the John Lewis Partnership Workers' fund representatives would have voting rights in companies' decision-making processes in the same way as other shareholders. Labour aides said the creation of the funds would help redress growing inequalities after a decade when average pay has not increased in real terms. But the dividend payments would not be available to state employees - including workers in industries such as water, which Labour hopes to nationalise. Labour sources say the Â£2bn social dividend fund would ensure public sector workers and employees of smaller firms also benefited from what the party calls a ""broadening of ownership in our economy"". By BBC business editor Simon Jack Many companies offer incentives and discounts to employees who wish to build a shareholding over time. That is not the same as taking 10% of the company away from its current owners to stick in a fund for the workers and the government's benefit, which seems to be what the shadow chancellor is proposing. For a start, the workers will not be able to buy and sell the shares - so they won't really ""own"" them in a traditional sense. They will be eligible to receive dividends on the shares up to a value of Â£500 per worker per year. The government gets the rest. The Labour Party reckons this will raise about Â£2bn a year. It could end up much more. Let's take just one company - bumper dividend-payer Shell. Ten percent of its Â£12bn annual dividend comes to Â£1.2bn. If each of its 6,500 UK employees got Â£500 each (totalling Â£3.25m) that leaves Â£1.116bn for the government. That's just from one company - every year. Wow. Read more:Can Labour's shares giveaway work? Mr McDonnell told Labour delegates: ""Workers, who create the wealth of a company, should share in its ownership and, yes, in the returns that it makes. ""We believe it's right that we all share in the benefits that investment produces."" Ahead of the speech, he dismissed claims of an anti-business agenda, telling the BBC that a future Labour government would support the vast majority of ""entrepreneurial and ethical"" British firms to the hilt. But he said those which engaged in aggressive tax avoidance and whose ""standards did not match up to the rest"" could expect a tough response from the government. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, which represents big business in the UK, said Labour was ""wrong to assert that workers will be helped by these proposals in their current form"". She said: ""Their diktat on employee share ownership will only encourage investors to pack their bags and will harm those who can least afford it. If investment falls, so does productivity and pay."" The Conservatives said Labour's proposal was ""yet another tax rise"" that would make it harder for firms to ""take on staff and pay them a good wage"". Jack: Can Labour's shares giveaway work?
