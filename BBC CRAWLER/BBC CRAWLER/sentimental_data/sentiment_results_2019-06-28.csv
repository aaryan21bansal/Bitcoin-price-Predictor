"Yulia and Sergei Skripal both survived being poisoned in March last year A senior Russian military intelligence officer commanded the team suspected of the Salisbury poisoning, evidence uncovered by the BBC's Newsnight and the investigative website Bellingcat suggests. Details of the ""third man's"" trip to London in March 2018 have been assembled after the investigative website obtained his phone records and shared them with the BBC. In February,Bellingcat published information,externalidentifying Denis Sergeyev as a man who travelled to London under the false identity of Sergei Fedotov. They also established details of his career and connection to his country's military intelligence service, known by its Russian acronym, the GRU, and linked him to a 2015 suspected poisoning in Bulgaria. 'Stop irresponsible activity,' May tells Putin What happened to the Skripals? The website behind the Skripal revelation Newsnight understands that Denis Sergeyev holds the rank of major general in the GRU. The other two men (Alexander Mishkin and Anatoly Chepiga) are colonels. The pattern of his communications while in the UK indicates that Maj Gen Sergeyev liaised with officers in Moscow. Independently, sources speaking to Newsnight have pointed to Maj Gen Sergeyev being the operational commander. The developments come as Prime Minister Theresa Maycalled for an end to Russia's ""irresponsible and destabilising activity"", describing the Salisbury poisoning as a ""truly despicable act"". Russia denies any involvement in the attack. Evidence suggests Denis Sergeyev ran the operation to poison the Skripals Maj Gen Sergeyev arrived at London's Heathrow airport on the morning of Friday 2 March, and left on the afternoon of Sunday 4 March, after Novichok nerve agent was placed on the Skripals' front door handle in Salisbury, Wiltshire. Analysis by Bellingcat of position data from his phone shows that he stayed near Paddington station in west London, whereas the other men took a room in Bow, east London. During his visit, Maj Gen Sergeyev shunned wi-fi networks, using 4G and 3G connections to access the internet hundreds of times. His billing records show that he used secure messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Viber and Telegram, which might have been the way that he communicated with the other suspected members of his team. Although he spent much of his 2018 visit to the UK secreted away in Paddington, the phone data shared with Newsnight shows that on the morning of 3 March, Maj Gen Sergeyev made his way to the centre of the city, passing by Oxford Circus on his way to the Thames Embankment. It was there, as shown by correlating his position data with police information about the other suspects, that there was a 30 to 40-minute window when Maj Gen Sergeyev could have met the others before they caught a train from nearby Waterloo station to carry out their final reconnaissance in Salisbury. Police are still probing the questions of when Mr Chepiga and Mr Mishkin were given the Novichok nerve agent and how they disposed of it on 4 March. In addition to contaminating Mr Skripal, his daughter Yulia and Det Sgt Nick Bailey, in July 2018 the poison claimed the life of Dawn Sturgess and caused her partner Charlie Rowley - who found the discarded Novichok container - to fall ill. Bellingcat has established that while travelling to the UK and on all of the other operational trips he made during 2017-18, Maj Gen Sergeyev only spoke to a single telephone number, a Russian ""ghost mobile"" believed to be his connection to GRU headquarters. Although it resembles a pay as you go SIM, this number produces no cell tower or IMEI (the unique serial identifying the handset using a SIM card) information, and has for years remained unregistered to any individual, a violation of Russian law. Maj Gen Sergeyev took 10 calls from the Russian number while in London - and phoned it himself before departing Paddington on Sunday 4 March. While he was booked to leave on the same flight that evening as Colonels Chepiga and Mishkin, it is now believed that Maj Gen Sergeyev took an earlier flight home from Heathrow that afternoon. He left about an hour after police say the others planted the Novichok at Mr Skripal's home. Records show that, using his Sergei Fedotov alias, Maj Gen Sergeyev had visited the UK before, in 2016 and 2017. On the latter occasion, almost exactly one year before the poisoning, Colonel Mishkin was also in the country at the same time. Investigators believe that the Salisbury plan may have taken shape during this 2017 visit. Police had previously identified other suspects Although the evidence suggests long-term GRU surveillance of Mr Skripal and his daughter,as well as planning for an operation, it seems that the decision to take action in March 2018 may have been a last minute one. Christo Grozev from Bellingcat says the phone records show Maj Gen Sergeyev ""frantically calling travel agents"" on 1 March in order to book flights to London. Bellingcat's coup in obtaining his phone records follows its success in accessing travel, passport, and motoring databases for the suspects. Separately, journalists from the BBC Russian Service discovered that Maj Gen Sergeyev's wife works as a teacher in Moscow and that the couple listed the address of the GRU training academy as their own home on an official registry. Contacted in February, Mrs Sergeyeva described claims that her husband was part of the Salisbury operation as ""a fairy story"". Responding to Newsnight's story, the Metropolitan Police said: ""The investigation team continues to pursue a number of lines of inquiry, including identifying any other suspects who may have been involved in carrying out or planning the attack. We are not prepared to discuss further details of what remains an ongoing investigation.""

"Brazil is one of four countries in Mercosur The EU and South American economic bloc Mercosur have clinched a huge trade deal after 20 years of negotiations. EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said it was the EU's biggest deal to date and, at a time of trade tensions between the US and China, showed that ""we stand for rules-based trade"". Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro said it was ""historic"" and ""one of the most important trade deals of all time"". Mercosur consists of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay. Venezuela is also a member butit was suspended in 2016for failing to meet the group's basic standards. The deal aims to cut or remove trade tariffs, making imported products cheaper for consumers while also boosting exports for companies on both sides. It is set to create a market for goods and services covering nearly 800 million consumers, making it the largest in the world in terms of population. Five things about the EU-Japan trade deal What is Mercosur?,external The two parties began negotiating in 1999 but talks accelerated after US President Donald Trump's election in 2016. As a result EU-US talks were frozen. The EU has also concluded trade agreements with Canada, Mexico and Japan since Mr Trump's election. However, the EU deal with Mercosur could see savings on tariffs that are four times as big as those made in the Japan deal, EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said. Analysis by Daniel Gallas, South America business correspondent It is no small feat to close such a complicated deal at a time when free trade is under attack globally. Protectionism is clearly on the rise - with Brexit and the trade war between China and the US. The deal could significantly change the way Europeans do business in countries like Brazil - which has one of the world's most closed economies. High tariffs have historically kept European competitors at a disadvantage against national industries. Similarly, South American farmers will finally gain access to European food markets. Europeans and South Americans had a narrow window to close this deal, as elections in Argentina later this year could potentially shift the mood against free trade, as is happening in other parts of the world. Ms Malmstrom said negotiations had begun 20 years ago to the day. ""They have been long negotiations - tough, difficult, and at least I have said many times 'we are almost there'. Now we are. This is a landmark agreement,"" Ms Malmstrom said. She said it sent a strong message that both the EU and Mercosur were in favour of ""open, sustainable and rules-based trade"". Speaking to reporters, Argentine Foreign Minister Jorge Faurie said Mercosur had hitherto been a ""very closed commercial space"" but that the deal with the EU sent a ""very clear message about where we are going"". Argentina's Secretary of International Relations Horacio Reyser said it would boost GDP, create jobs and attract investment. He tweeted a video of the moment the deal was confirmed.

"This video can not be played The girl now known as ""Baby India"" was found after nearby residents heard cries A baby girl found inside a plastic bag in the US has families across the world ""waiting in line"" to adopt the ""miracle"" child, an official says. The baby, nicknamed India, was found on 6 June in Georgia after residents heard her crying and called the police. Police shared heart-rending bodycam footage of an officer tearing open the plastic bag in which she was swaddled. She was taken to hospital but doctors said she was unharmed and is now gaining weight. 'Hero' teen catches falling toddler Tsunami baby found alive in ditch Baby found in Sydney drain Three weeks on, baby India is said to be ""smiling"" and ""thriving"" in the custody of child services. She will remain there until she a permanent home is found for her. Forsyth County Sheriff's Office is yet to identify the baby's mother or relatives. In a Facebook post, it said it had ""no new information to share regarding baby India"". But according to Tom Rawlings, the director of Georgia's Division of Family and Children Services, there is no shortage of families willing to adopt her. ""We have people waiting in line to provide that child with a forever home,"" Mr Rawlings told ABC's Good Morning America. Residents called the police after hearing the baby crying in an area of woodland Since her dramatic rescue, which generated headlines internationally, hundreds of families have been in touch offering to adopt her, Mr Rawlings said. He described her survival as one of the most ""wonderful miracles I've seen in my life"". With her umbilical cord still attached, India was possibly just hours old when residents found her in an area of woodland in Forsyth County, north of Atlanta. Forsyth County sheriff Ron Freeman said it was ""divine intervention"" that India was found in a good condition. Baby girl found alive inside plastic bag.

"This video can not be played Footage captured the moment a car rammed into a crowd of counter-protesters in Charlottesville A man who drove his car into a crowd of protesters in the US city of Charlottesville, killing a woman, has apologised as he was sentenced to life in prison. James Alex Fields Jr, 22, was sentenced for numerous federal hate crimes committed in the August 2017 attack. Heather Heyer, 32, died when Fields drove his car into people protesting against a white nationalist rally. The avowed neo-Nazi has also beenconvicted of murder at the state level. He is set to be sentenced in that case next month. A reckoning in Charlottesville 'A battle for the soul of America' Why US right-wing groups are on the rise Speaking ahead of his sentencing on Friday, Fields apologised for the ""hurt and loss"" he had caused. ""Every day I think about how things could have gone differently and how I regret my actions. I'm sorry,"" he said. Fields pleaded guilty to 29 of 30 federal hate crimes under a deal with prosecutors who agreed not to seek the death penalty. His lawyers had asked for a more lenient sentence than life in prison, citing his age, a traumatic childhood and mental illness. Ms Heyer's parents told the court of the pain of losing their daughter. Her father Mark Heyer told Fields: ""I forgive you."" ""I hope he can heal one day and help others too,"" her mother, Susan Bro, said. Hundreds of neo-Nazis, white nationalists and Ku Klux Klan members gathered in Charlottesville, Virginia, on 12 August, 2017 for one of the largest white supremacist rallies in the US in decades. The ""Unite the Right"" march was organised to protest against plans to take down a statue of General Robert E Lee, who had fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the American Civil War. This video can not be played Photojournalist Ryan M Kelly was covering the protest when the car ploughed into the crowd Clashes broke out with counter-protesters, leaving dozens injured. Charlottesville victim 'a strong woman' Why I'm suing over crash footage conspiracy Graphic video footage shared widely on social media showed Fields driving his car into the counter-protesters, killing 32-year-old paralegal Ms Heyer and injuring others. Fields, a self-described neo-Nazi from Ohio, was 20 at the time of the attack. Federal prosecutors said he thought about harming others while driving to the Charlottesville rally. They noted that there was evidence on his social media profiles of him ""expressing support of the social and racial policies of Adolf Hitler and Nazi-era Germany, including the Holocaust"". Who is James Fields? Less than a month before the attack, they said he posted an image on Instagram showing a car driving into a crowd of people. ""You have the right to protest but I'm late for work,"" read the caption. White nationalists, neo-Nazis and members of the ""alt-right"" clashed with counter-protesters in Charlottesville Hours before the attack, he was photographed carrying a shield bearing the emblem of a far-right hate group. Even afterwards, Fields remained unrepentant, prosecutors said. In a phone call from prison in December 2017, he criticised Ms Heyer's mother. ""She is a communist. An anti-white liberal,"" Fields said. He went on to describe her as ""the enemy"". Fields' lawyers have argued that he felt intimidated and acted to protect himself in the August 2017 attack.

"Yulia and Sergei Skripal both survived being poisoned in March last year A senior Russian military intelligence officer commanded the team suspected of the Salisbury poisoning, evidence uncovered by the BBC's Newsnight and the investigative website Bellingcat suggests. Details of the ""third man's"" trip to London in March 2018 have been assembled after the investigative website obtained his phone records and shared them with the BBC. In February,Bellingcat published information,externalidentifying Denis Sergeyev as a man who travelled to London under the false identity of Sergei Fedotov. They also established details of his career and connection to his country's military intelligence service, known by its Russian acronym, the GRU, and linked him to a 2015 suspected poisoning in Bulgaria. 'Stop irresponsible activity,' May tells Putin What happened to the Skripals? The website behind the Skripal revelation Newsnight understands that Denis Sergeyev holds the rank of major general in the GRU. The other two men (Alexander Mishkin and Anatoly Chepiga) are colonels. The pattern of his communications while in the UK indicates that Maj Gen Sergeyev liaised with officers in Moscow. Independently, sources speaking to Newsnight have pointed to Maj Gen Sergeyev being the operational commander. The developments come as Prime Minister Theresa Maycalled for an end to Russia's ""irresponsible and destabilising activity"", describing the Salisbury poisoning as a ""truly despicable act"". Russia denies any involvement in the attack. Evidence suggests Denis Sergeyev ran the operation to poison the Skripals Maj Gen Sergeyev arrived at London's Heathrow airport on the morning of Friday 2 March, and left on the afternoon of Sunday 4 March, after Novichok nerve agent was placed on the Skripals' front door handle in Salisbury, Wiltshire. Analysis by Bellingcat of position data from his phone shows that he stayed near Paddington station in west London, whereas the other men took a room in Bow, east London. During his visit, Maj Gen Sergeyev shunned wi-fi networks, using 4G and 3G connections to access the internet hundreds of times. His billing records show that he used secure messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Viber and Telegram, which might have been the way that he communicated with the other suspected members of his team. Although he spent much of his 2018 visit to the UK secreted away in Paddington, the phone data shared with Newsnight shows that on the morning of 3 March, Maj Gen Sergeyev made his way to the centre of the city, passing by Oxford Circus on his way to the Thames Embankment. It was there, as shown by correlating his position data with police information about the other suspects, that there was a 30 to 40-minute window when Maj Gen Sergeyev could have met the others before they caught a train from nearby Waterloo station to carry out their final reconnaissance in Salisbury. Police are still probing the questions of when Mr Chepiga and Mr Mishkin were given the Novichok nerve agent and how they disposed of it on 4 March. In addition to contaminating Mr Skripal, his daughter Yulia and Det Sgt Nick Bailey, in July 2018 the poison claimed the life of Dawn Sturgess and caused her partner Charlie Rowley - who found the discarded Novichok container - to fall ill. Bellingcat has established that while travelling to the UK and on all of the other operational trips he made during 2017-18, Maj Gen Sergeyev only spoke to a single telephone number, a Russian ""ghost mobile"" believed to be his connection to GRU headquarters. Although it resembles a pay as you go SIM, this number produces no cell tower or IMEI (the unique serial identifying the handset using a SIM card) information, and has for years remained unregistered to any individual, a violation of Russian law. Maj Gen Sergeyev took 10 calls from the Russian number while in London - and phoned it himself before departing Paddington on Sunday 4 March. While he was booked to leave on the same flight that evening as Colonels Chepiga and Mishkin, it is now believed that Maj Gen Sergeyev took an earlier flight home from Heathrow that afternoon. He left about an hour after police say the others planted the Novichok at Mr Skripal's home. Records show that, using his Sergei Fedotov alias, Maj Gen Sergeyev had visited the UK before, in 2016 and 2017. On the latter occasion, almost exactly one year before the poisoning, Colonel Mishkin was also in the country at the same time. Investigators believe that the Salisbury plan may have taken shape during this 2017 visit. Police had previously identified other suspects Although the evidence suggests long-term GRU surveillance of Mr Skripal and his daughter,as well as planning for an operation, it seems that the decision to take action in March 2018 may have been a last minute one. Christo Grozev from Bellingcat says the phone records show Maj Gen Sergeyev ""frantically calling travel agents"" on 1 March in order to book flights to London. Bellingcat's coup in obtaining his phone records follows its success in accessing travel, passport, and motoring databases for the suspects. Separately, journalists from the BBC Russian Service discovered that Maj Gen Sergeyev's wife works as a teacher in Moscow and that the couple listed the address of the GRU training academy as their own home on an official registry. Contacted in February, Mrs Sergeyeva described claims that her husband was part of the Salisbury operation as ""a fairy story"". Responding to Newsnight's story, the Metropolitan Police said: ""The investigation team continues to pursue a number of lines of inquiry, including identifying any other suspects who may have been involved in carrying out or planning the attack. We are not prepared to discuss further details of what remains an ongoing investigation.""

Over at Yeovilton, near the Glastonbury Festival in Somerset, conditions reached a warm 28.3C (83F), but were still some way off 2017's record temperature of 31.2C (88F). The rising heat is in part due to warm air originating from northern Africa that hasbrought a scorching heatwave to a large swathe of Europe. Several countries have reported record temperatures this week, including France which hit an all-time heat record of 44.3C (111F) on Friday. The temperature reached a warm 28.3C at Glastonbury on Friday NHS England and emergency services have issued warnings to the British public to take care in the hot conditions, with temperatures expected to touch a nearly recording breaking 35C on Saturday.

"The two cyclists' bike wheels get stuck in the tram grooves Two cyclists who were thrown from their bikes while crossing tram tracks in Edinburgh have won undisclosed damages from the city council. Elizabeth Fairley and Ian Lowdean sued after being injured in falls in Haymarket and Princes Street. The council had denied liability, insisting the cyclists should have taken more care. But in a Court of Session ruling, judge Lady Wolffe said ""they bore no responsibility"" for the accidents. A further 39 claims by cyclists against the council and Edinburgh Trams, which had been put on hold, are now expected to proceed. In May 2017a cyclist died after her wheel became stuck in tram tracksand she fell into the path of a minibus in Princes Street. Zhi Min Soh, from Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, was a medical student at Edinburgh University at the time of the accident. The Court of Session heard that Elizabeth Fairley suffered facial and knee injuries in her 2013 fall. She said she was ""hugely relieved"" by the ruling and added: ""Edinburgh Council said the accident was my fault but we can now see from this court case that the tram lines are to blame and are very dangerous. ""The council must get to work and make sure the lines are now made safe so we can avoid any more accidents and injury."" A spokesman for Ms Fairley's legal representatives, Thompsons Solicitors, said: ""This is a landmark legal decision which completely vindicates the years of concern expressed by cyclists over the appalling dangers posed by the tram lines."" Ms Fairley, an advanced nurse practitioner, was travelling from the Royal Hospital for Sick Children to her home in Corstorphine when she came off her bike. She told how she had approached the tram line at Haymarket with cautionas a previous incident had made her aware of the danger of a wheel getting caught in the tracks. She said: ""I knew from that previous experience you had to cross them, if at all possible, at 90 degrees. It is not always possible, but anything to avoid your wheel getting dragged back into the tram tracks. ""It all happened in a split second. The bike got thrown over. I got thrown over to the right-hand side and fell on the road."" Ms Fairley, who was wearing a cycling helmet,originally sued for Â£50,000,but the court heard that the amount of damages to be paid had been agreed. Mr Lowdean originally sued for Â£15,000. In her ruling, Lady Wolffe said: ""In submissions, the defender submitted that each pursuer failed to take care for his or her own safety. However, there was no specification of how or in what manner they had failed to do so. ""I have considered the evidence about the few specific steps it was suggested they could take, and concluded that the evidence does not support the defenders' cases of contributory negligence against the pursuers.""

"This video can not be played Mrs May was unsmiling as she greeted Mr Putin, in a frosty start to their meeting in Japan. Russia must end its ""irresponsible and destabilising activity"", Theresa May has told President Vladimir Putin in one-to-one talks, Downing Street said. Describing the Salisbury poisoning as a ""truly despicable act"", she said the two suspects - believed to be Russian military intelligence officers - must be ""brought to justice"". Mrs May said the UK was open to a ""different relationship"" but that ""this behaviour could never be repeated"". The Kremlin denies any involvement. The UK believes two officers from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, were behind the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, in March 2018. Conservative leadership candidate Boris Johnson has said Russia will ""always let you down"", adding it was ""very difficult to find any defence for their behaviour"" when it came to the Salisbury poisonings. Speaking at the latest Tory party hustings in Exeter, he said there is a ""global sense of repulsion at the way Russia behaves"". Mr Johnson added that ""every British prime minister, every foreign secretary"" in the past 10 years thought they could have a ""normalisation"" with Russia but were let down. Meanwhile, Jeremy Hunt, running against Mr Johnson to be the next prime minister, has calledcomments made by Mr Putin about Western liberalism""an absolute disgrace"". ""It's all very easy to be disparaging about democracy when you've never had to bother with it at home,"" Mr Hunt said. Referring to the attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal, he said: ""My worry about Russia is that they're up to their old tricks."" Mrs May and Mr Putin met for talks on the margins of the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, on Friday - the first formal bilateral meeting between the two leaders since the Salisbury incident. What happened to the Skripals? Who is Sergei Skripal? Is Putin right? Is liberalism really dead? What is the G20 and why does it meet? It comes as Mr Putin,in an interview with the Financial Times,external, dismissed the Skripal poisoning as a ""fuss about spies"" and attacked liberalism, a core principle of western democracy. As they met, the two leaders shook hands but there appeared to be little warmth, with Mrs May looking serious and unsmiling, as the pair began their meeting. Downing Street said Mrs May had told the Russian president that the use of a deadly nerve agent on the streets of Salisbury formed part of a wider pattern of unacceptable behaviour. She said the UK had irrefutable evidence that Russia was behind the attack that led to the death of a British citizen, Dawn Sturgess. Mrs May also said the UK would continue to ""unequivocally defend liberal democracy"" and protect the human rights and equality of all groups, including LGBT people. This video can not be played ""Russia needs to recognise its acts and stop acting in this way,"" says the prime minister. After the issue of Mrs May's facial expression was raised by a reporter on Russian TV, Vladimir Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, praised the prime minister for her ""friendly and constructive attitude"". Mr Peskov said there had been a ""a long pause in communication"" between Russia and Britain, adding that ""the fact itself that the meeting took place is very positive."" Speaking to BBC deputy political editor John Pienaar ahead of the meeting on Friday, Mrs May said the UK had already set out evidence on the attack in Salisbury last year and made charges against two Russians. ""Russia does not allow the extradition of its nationals, but European arrest warrants are out for those two individuals and if they set foot outside Russia we will be making every effort that they are brought to justice,"" she said. ""Russia needs to recognise its acts and stop acting in this way - and stop its other destabilising activities around the world, including, for example, its use of disinformation and cyber-attacks,"" she added. Yulia and Sergei Skripal fell ill after Mr Skripal's front door was sprayed with Novichok Mr Skripal and his daughter both survived the poisoning in March last year, but a British woman, Dawn Sturgess, died last July after coming into contact with the nerve agent Novichok through handling a contaminated perfume bottle. Scotland Yard and the CPS say there is sufficient evidence to charge two Russians - who go by the names of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov - for attempted murder. However, Mr Putin has insisted they are civilians, not criminals. He said he hoped ""a few preliminary steps"" would be made towards restoring relations between Russia and the UK. This video can not be played ""Our friends had been suggesting for a long time that we visit this wonderful town"" - Novichok suspects speaking in October 2018 However, he appeared to have little sympathy for Mr Skripal. The former Russian military intelligence colonel was jailed after being accused of spying for Britain, before being released as part of a spy swap. ""Treason is the gravest crime possible and traitors must be punished,"" Mr Putin told the newspaper. ""I am not saying that the Salisbury incident is the way to do it. Not at all. But traitors must be punished. ""Listen, all this fuss about spies and counterspies, it is not worth serious interstate relations. This spy story, as we say, it is not worth five kopecks. Or even five pounds, for that matter."" The Russian President has previouslylabelled Mr Skripal as a ""traitor"" and a ""scumbag"". The Skripal poisoning froze relations between Russia and the UK.The UK expelled23 Russian diplomats who Mrs May claimed were undeclared intelligence officers following the Salisbury attack, and Russia responded byexpelling UK diplomats.

"As a teenager, Khuram Butt - the ringleader of the London Bridge terror attack - was a cannabis-smoking ""wannabe bad man"" who regularly indulged in petty crime. As an adult, he retained all of those habits - even as he attacked others for being ""bad"" Muslims. Those closest to him paint a picture of an easily-influenced man given to obsessions. It was that obsessive nature which led him to Islamic extremism and, ultimately, to murder. Details of his life emergedduring the inquest into those deaths,external. Although coroner Mark Lucraft said none of the members of Butt's family who gave evidence was a ""convincing witness"", their accounts reveal a controlling man with a history of violence, who lived a life of contradictions. Born in Jhelum, Pakistan, on 20 April 1990, Khuram Butt had two older siblings, brother Saad and sister Haleema. His father ran a furniture business and while his family members were practising Muslims, they were not particularly religious. They arrived in the UK in 1998 on a visitors' visa when Butt was eight. All three of the children attended schools in Forest Gate and Stratford in east London, with Butt doing well in his end of school exams - he gained 11 GCSEs. The family attempted to claim asylum, which was initially refused. But in 2004 - following the death of his father from a heart attack - Butt was given indefinite leave to remain in the UK. He worked as a cashier at a pizza takeaway after school, before getting a job in the stockroom at Topshop on London's Oxford Street. He received his first police caution at 18 for fraudulently using a friend's payment card on public transport. From his teenage years Butt went clubbing, smoked drugs, indulged in casual sex and was described as a ""wannabe gangster"". In 2009 he became an office assistant at a removals firm. But despite being in full-time employment, later working in a number of KFC takeaways, the life of petty crime still appealed. In December 2010, when he was 20, he received a second caution for common assault occasioning actual bodily harm after a scuffle with a security guard at a shopping centre. Two year's later, Butt's sister married. At the wedding he met a man named Hashim Rehman, whose uncle had worked with his father. Afterwards Butt began to be more observant. He spent time with him, reading Islamic literature and praying five times a day. He also ended a relationship with his then girlfriend because she refused to convert to Islam. Mr Rehman told police that rediscovering religion changed Butt, initially making him a softer and more humble man. Butt went on to ask Mr Rehman for his sister Zahrah's hand, and they were married on 25 December. Brother of London Bridge killer 'sorry' London attacker's widow 'will not grieve' Initially, his newly found fervour for Islam was seen as a good thing. He began staying in and attended his mosque more regularly. But the inquest heard his religious devotion began tipping into an increasingly extreme version of Islam. On their wedding day, Butt insisted his new wife should wear a burqa and sat her behind a wooden screen so she could only be seen by him. His brother later took the screen down. After returning from their honeymoon in Pakistan, Butt moved Ms Rehman into the home he shared with his mother, brother and sister-in-law. His brother, Saad, said that Butt insisted his new wife wore a full-face veil and gloves inside the house. ""I think that says it all. He was the sort of person who did everything 100%,"" Mr Butt told the inquest. ""Random sexual encounters, lots of girlfriends, drug taking and now that he has gone into Islam he wants to do it 100%."" Saad said this was one of a series of things his brother did that made him ""uncomfortable"". Butt would also get angry with his sister, he said, if she came to visit without wearing a headscarf, and asked for videos of him dancing at her wedding to be deleted. In September 2014, he and his wife moved into a small one-bedroom flat in Barking, east London. Once there, Butt put up a curtain pole in their hallway so that male visitors couldn't see his wife. ""With his friends he was 100% strict,"" his wife told the inquest. ""I was not allowed to see them and they were not allowed to see me."" Instead she would prepare and cook meals for the gatherings he would regularly hold, before spending the rest of the night in their bedroom watching television on her laptop. Inside the flat Butt shared with his wife and two children Ms Rehman said for a time she and their son, born in 2014, were his sole focus - but he soon became intensely focused on the war in Syria. His manager at KFC said they also noticed a marked change in his behaviour and appearance at work. Butt began to shave his head and grew a beard. A colleague said around this time they had a discussion about themurder of soldier Lee Rigbyand Butt told them it was ""an eye for an eye"". His wife became aware that he was associating withhate preacher Anjem Choudarytowards the end of 2014. She said she warned him to ""stay away from people like that"" but told the inquest Butt was stubborn and would never do what people asked of him. Ms Rehman said her husband met Choudary at a dawah stall (a public display promoting Islam) in Stratford or nearby East Ham. After that initial meeting Butt would listen to Choudary's speeches on YouTube, and he hosted him at his home on at least one occasion. A friend said Butt was ""energised"" in Choudary's company and described him as being ""like a lion out of a cage"". Yet despite his new obsession with religion, Butt still dabbled in drug use and petty crime. His brother-in-law described him as ""very impressionable"". In September 2015 another brother-in-law, Usman Darr, reported Butt to the anti-terrorist hotline after he defended the Islamic State group's execution of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death in a cage. Butt already had an ""anger problem"", Ms Rehman said. Soon, he began starting fights with other Muslims who he believed were not ""true"" followers of Islam. Butt and his wife had a ""massive"" argument in late 2015 when he decided he wanted a second wife and she left him for a month. London Bridge attacker 'energised' by Choudary Police 'unaware' London Bridge attacker reported It was at this time that The Jihadis Next Door aired on Channel 4. The documentary filmed a number of British extremists meeting across the country and included scenes showing Butt and others confronting police officers in London's Regent's Park. Ms Rehman told the inquest she first became aware of the programme when she watched it at her parents' house. Butt hadn't told her anything about the programme or being filmed. The inquest heard that between 2015 and 2017 Butt expressed strong anti-Western views, shared videos of beheadings on WhatsApp, and was expelled from a mosque. He became increasingly angry, Saad told the inquest, over ""foreign policy, the wars, the injustices overseas"". He said that after several disagreements Butt stopped talking to his family about Syria. They thought he had changed his way of thinking - but he was secretly plotting an attack similar to those inManchesterandWestminster Bridge. ""In that sense he lived a double life,"" his brother added. In May 2016, Butt began to work for London Underground as a customer service assistant Just a couple of months later, Ms Rehman's family confiscated the couple's passports after Butt paid for flights to Turkey. She told her parents she suspected he wanted to take them and their infant son to Syria to join the Islamic State group and so her father destroyed the documents. In May 2016, Butt began to work for London Underground as a customer service assistant. His wife and family were delighted with his new job, but within weeks he started claiming sick pay after complaining his work-issued boots were damaging his feet. His wife told the inquest: ""It wasn't a genuine sickness - he just did not want to work."" Butt privately told his brother-in-law that he could not do the job because ""in the summer there are too many naked women walking around"". His employers later terminated his contract after deciding he had failed his probation. It was around this time he began coming home smelling of cannabis again. His wife said Butt began to attend the Ummah Fitness Centre while he was on sick leave. The gym was run by Sajeel Shahid and his partner, Sophie Rahman, who was the headteacher of the Ad-Deen Primary School in Ilford, a large commuter town to the east of London. Butt was asked by the couple to teach the Koran to children at the school - despite his criminal cautions, his appearance on The Jihadis Next Door, his lack of references and background checks. He began teaching a group of about six or seven children aged between seven and nine for two hours every afternoon. The schoolchanged its name before closing in 2017,external. Rachid Redouane, Youssef Zaghba and Butt outside the Ummah Fitness Centre In May 2017, just weeks before he launched his murderous attack, Butt and his wife had another child. By this point, his wife said, he simply wasn't interested in her or their growing family. Just minutes after she had given birth to their daughter he announced he was leaving the hospital ""to go the gym"" - where, it later emerged, he was meeting his fellow London Bridge attackers. Although Ms Rehman repeatedly asked him to spend more time at home with her and their children, her pleas fell on deaf ears. On Saturday 3 June 2017, Butt left their home for the last time. He left without kissing or saying goodbye to either of his children. Eight people were killed that evening. This account is told according to evidence given at the inquests into the deaths of the eight people killed, which began in May 2019.

"The London Bridge attack claimed eight innocent lives in 2017. But only now, at the end of an eight-week inquest, can we pull together the experiences of all those caught up in the harrowing events of that evening. The sun has gone down on a warm summer's night in London. Xavier Thomas and Christine Delcros walk hand in hand towards the Shard, a vast skyscraper that rises on the south side of London Bridge, for a cocktail after a day's sightseeing. But they never make it. Youssef Zaghba drives a hired van over the bridge and up on to the pavement. The French couple, unaware, are still chatting when it hits Mr Thomas from behind, catapulting him into the River Thames. Ms Delcros is lying seriously injured on the ground. She recalls: ""Suddenly I was under the impression there was a lot of light. I just heard myself say, 'That's how one dies - that's it.'"" She drifts in and out of consciousness, and asks for her fiance. Over a matter of seconds, the white van, weighed down with bags of gravel from B&Q, careers from road to pavement, and back again. Pedestrians run for their lives as the van knocks one down after another. Tyler Ferguson is a short way ahead on the bridge happily chatting to his fiancee, Chrissy Archibald, when he hears a man scream and the screech of tyres behind him. The van's wing mirror brushes his shoulder and there is a loud thud as Ms Archibald is swept under the wheels. She is left lying in the middle of the road. Mr Ferguson runs to her side and she dies in his arms. Meanwhile, the van veers on to the wrong side of Borough High Street and speeds past the Barrowboy and Banker pub, where all eyes have been glued to the Champions League final for most of the evening. Spanish team Real Madrid has just beaten Italy's Juventus. The van smashes into some railings, causing debris to rain down on diners sitting in a restaurant courtyard below, knocking one of them out. People outside the pub and passersby rush towards the van, thinking there's been an accident. They want to help but instead find themselves face-to-face with three armed attackers - the van driver Zaghba, Rachid Redouane and ringleader Khuram Butt. They are each carrying a 12-inch long ceramic pink kitchen knife from Lidl bound to their wrist with duct tape  - and begin attacking anyone in their path. Armed police are still minutes away. Until then, there is no line of defence between the crazed, predatory knifemen and the innocent Londoners and tourists, who just happen to be in the area at the time. Butt shouts out ""Allahu Akbar"" before stabbing Richard Livett, who has been watching the football in the pub. ""I felt what I thought initially was a punch in the back, which turned out to be him flailing his arm around the back of me and stabbing me,"" Mr Livett remembers. ""It was chaos all around. I was aware of screaming and shouting and people around me."" Sara Zelenak is on a night out with her friend In that chaos, Sara Zelenak and her friend, Priscila Goncalves, who are on a night out to have fun, become separated. ""I had no idea what was going on,"" Ms Goncalves says. ""People said 'run' - I started to run. I thought she was with me and then I looked - she was not."" Ms Zelenak has slipped in her heels on the wet pavement. There is no CCTV footage of the next few fateful moments but witnesses say James McMullan, who has been watching the football with friends in the pub, tries to help Ms Zelenak to her feet - but they're too late. The attackers set upon them with their knives, killing them both. The three men then make their way down a set of steps and into a courtyard in Borough Market, bustling with Saturday night diners and drinkers, many of them tourists. At that same moment Sebastian Belanger, who has also been watching the football, is coming towards the steps in the courtyard to investigate the noise from the crash. Under a dark archway, he is cornered and stabbed. Several people come out of the bars to try to save him, including Lisa Deacon, who puts into practice the first aid training she's been given a few weeks earlier. They spend a desperate half an hour trying to keep Mr Belanger alive - but without success. Boro Bistro courtyard was busy with diners Close by, Alexandre Pigeard, a waiter in French restaurant Boro Bistro is also drawn outside by the noise and straight into the path of the attackers, who stab him in the neck. Diners in the restaurant push tables aside, sending glasses smashing to the floor as they run for their lives. Andrius Vorobjovas nearly treads on a body in his haste to flee. By coincidence, two off-duty nurses are on separate nights out at Boro Bistro - Kirsty Boden is having a meal with two friends and Helen Kennett is drinking prosecco with her mother and sister to celebrate her birthday. Ms Kennett spots the injured Mr Pigeard being held upright by his attacker. ""Let me help you, I'm a nurse,"" she says, reaching out to him. The waiter shakes his head. ""No, just run."" Ms Kennett looks into the soulless eyes of the attacker. ""What's wrong with you?"" she asks. He looks at her and says ""No, what's wrong with you?"" before stabbing her in the neck. ""I was convinced I was going to die but I didn't want to die there,"" she recalls. It is two hours before she gets to an ambulance and is given medical help. Jack Baxter, who has been in the Barrowboy and Banker, watches Mr Pigeard running away, holding his neck. ""He had somebody else running to his right,"" he says. ""They were both running, looking at each other almost in shock at what happened and screaming to each other like 'what's going on?'"" Before long, Mr Pigeard collapses on the ground and is stabbed again. Ms Boden, the other nurse, does not survive the night. Within seconds of hearing the van crash, she is on her feet, telling her friends: ""I'm a nurse, I have to go and help."" All around her people are running for their lives but she goes to Mr Pigeard's side as he lies dying, and is stabbed in the head. Moments later, her friends spot her bright pink cardigan and see she's collapsed on the ground. They do their best to revive her, but she dies later that night. Ignacio Echeverria cycles towards the attackers Back on Borough High Street, two police officers are trying to tackle the knifemen who've just stabbed another man and woman. Ignacio Echeverria, who is cycling along the road with two friends, sees an injured man running away from London Bridge. ""It was like he didn't even think about it, but reacted immediately,"" remembers his friend, Guillermo Sanchez-Montisi. Mr Echeverria jumps off his bike, pulls his skateboard from his rucksack and swings it at the attackers. ""One of the attackers was covering his head as Ignacio was hitting him with the skateboard... then suddenly Ignacio was on the floor,"" says Mr Sanchez-Montisi, who runs away fearing he will be next. ""It was very painful to leave my friend but we were going to be next. When he was looking at me, he looked like the devil,"" he recalls. His friend can't be saved. Eight people are fatally wounded, many more are wandering the streets or lying on the ground, clutching wounds and spilling blood on to warm pavements. The attackers break into a run, with Butt pointing the way with his knife. Redouane ducks down to tie his laces. ""The place was in a panic,"" recalls Jonathan Moses, an off-duty junior doctor who is looking outside from a tapas bar on lockdown. ""I could hear people saying 'oh God, oh God, help, help, they've been stabbed.'"" He tells the staff guarding the locked door: ""I can't watch them die. You have to let me out and just lock the door after me."" Once outside, he finds wounded Marie Bondeville, who keeps telling him she's going to die. Dr Moses holds her hand and reassures her he's going to save her - and he does. He then helps to carry the skateboarder, Mr Echeverria, across London Bridge, continuing chest compressions while running. This time his patient can't be saved. ""Treat this like a warzone,"" one air ambulance doctor at the scene tells Dr Moses. Meanwhile, the attackers stab another person and another. US tourist Robert Piersant thinks a drunk has barged into him until he blacks out. His wife, Joyce, who is stabbed in the throat, knows in that instant her attacker wants to kill her. ""I can't explain why... it was in his eyes,'' she recalls. The attackers jog from one side of the road to the other, from cafe to pub to restaurant, picking out people at random and stabbing them over and over. Zaghba and Butt then strip off their jackets. Beneath they are wearing fake suicide vests, constructed from disposable water bottles and masking tape. In Elliot's Cafe, on the edge of Borough Market, customers are scrambling to find a safe spot when the attackers enter. The attackers shout that they are not happy with the way we are living our lives, recalls waitress Candice Hedge. From her hiding position under a table, she sees them stab one customer in the back - and then they see her. She puts her hands to her face but they stab her in the neck. She grabs a napkin to try to stem the bleeding, runs to the downstairs kitchen and waits with colleagues for the police to arrive some 30 minutes later. The attackers kick the locked doors open and enter the restaurant Outside Gerard Vowls, who has been watching the Champions League final, tries to stall the three knifemen by throwing chairs and pint glasses at them and calling them cowards. His makeshift weapons miss. He gestures through the glass front of the Black and Blue steakhouse, opposite Elliot's, to warn them. The sliding glass doors are locked but Redouane kicks them loose. As the attackers enter the bar area, customers and staff in the dining area escape out of another door. Redouane stabs Roy Larner, who does his best to fight back with his fists, while Butt tells Geoff Ho, another customer, to lie on the floor. ""No - you don't have to do this,"" he says, thinking that if he rushes at him, Butt might detonate his suicide vest and kill everyone. Mr Ho is repeatedly stabbed in the throat. The attackers make their way out through the now empty restaurant area, taking a swig of water from a bar tap. Butt washes the blood from his knife and wipes it on his beard. He then picks up a bottle to smash on the side of the table - another weapon. Butt tries to force his way into the bolted shut pub Five unarmed police officers confront the attackers, who shout ""Allahu Akbar"" and charge at the officers. Butt throws a bottle at PC Bartosz Tchorzewski. But they turn back and head for the Wheatsheaf pub just as Simon Edwards, who's been out for a meal and drink with friends, walks out. His wife, Nicole, swiftly drags him back into the pub and staff bolt the door shut. Butt is determined to force his way in. Mr Edwards watches as the bottom of the door, where there is no bolt, flexes with each kick. Butt then starts smashing window panes around the door with his knife handle, only stopping when he see his accomplices stabbing a man - Antonio Filis - outside the pub. Their knives only narrowly miss his lung. The police fear the attackers might detonate what they think are suicide vests The pub is suddenly filled with blue lights - armed police are outside. The attackers move towards the officers. Drop your knives, they say, as they shoot all three. Inside the pub, Mr Edwards drops to his knees to take cover when he hears a volley of bullets. One stray bullet comes through the pub window, misses Mr Edwards by centimetres and hits Neil McLellan, who's behind him, in the head. He survives. The police keep firing at the attackers, fearful they might detonate what they believe at the time to be suicide vests. On the street lie the bodies of the three attackers. The attack is over. Seven of their victims are dead. Xavier Thomas - who was thrown over the bridge parapet when he was struck by the van 10 minutes earlier - is not found for another three days, nearly two miles downstream. Absorbed in conversation and madly in love, Mr Thomas - the first of the attackers' victims - would have known nothing of the horrors inflicted on so many people on that devastating summer's night. This account of the attack at London Bridge on 3 June 2017 is told according to evidence given at the inquests into the deaths of the eight people killed, which began in May 2019. Months before the London Bridge attacks, five people were killed in a rampage that began on Westminster Bridge. Will was mown down by the attacker and a stranger looked after him.

"The coroner at the London Bridge inquests said he was ""not convinced"" MI5 and police missed any opportunities that would have prevented the attack. The inquests into the deaths of the eight victims ended with chief coroner of England and Wales Mark Lucraft concluding they were unlawfully killed. He said he would not be criticising MI5 and the police in his conclusions. But Mr Lucraft did criticise the lack of barriers on the bridge - a ""particularly vulnerable"" location. The attack, in June 2017, happened only two and half months after the Westminster Bridge attack. Mr Lucraft said the lack of barriers showed ""weaknesses in systems for assessing the need for such measures... and implementing them promptly"". The victims of the attack clockwise from top left - Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, Alexandre Pigeard, Sebastien Belanger, Ignacio Echeverria, Xavier Thomas, Sara Zelenak, Kirsty Boden But some victims' friends and families remain critical of the police. Philippe Pigeard, whose 26-year-old son Alexandre Pigeard was killed, also pointed to the lack of barriers, saying: ""I think this attack could have been prevented."" Speaking after the inquest concluded, he said there were ""a lot of missed opportunities"" to neutralise at least one of the attackers who was known to be dangerous. Christine Delcros, who was severely injured and lost her boyfriend, Xavier Thomas, in the attack highlighted a ""catalogue of failings"". Ms Delcros said it was ""staggering"" that Butt, a ""well known extremist"", was allowed to work within the London Transport network, and that ""opportunities to identify all the attackers and disrupt their activities did not occur"". Chaos and killings: 10 minutes at London Bridge Victims of the London Bridge attack The partygoer who turned into a killer Mr Pigeard also paid tribute to nurse Helen Kennett, who came to his son's aid. Ms Kennett, who was out to celebrate her birthday,was stabbed in the neckas she tried to help. Standing next to Ms Kennett outside court, Mr Pigeard said: ""I want to thank so much Helen for her courage. ""She came to help my son who was bleeding to death. She was stabbed too in a few seconds."" Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu disputed claims that opportunities were lost. Citing the coroner's findings, Mr Basu said: ""Even those closest to the attackers, and we have heard from them during the inquest, knew nothing of their murderous plans."" He said it will ""never be possible to stop every plot"". This video can not be played Philippe Pigeard believes the attack in which his son Alexandre was killed could have been stopped Summing up evidence earlier, the coroner had said the family of attacker Khuram Butt were not ""convincing witnesses"" in court. He said each of Butt's family members ""accepted that they should now have done more at the time"" and that they all ""knew something of his extreme views"". Four of Butt's family gave evidence during the inquest at the Old Bailey: his widow Zahrah Rehman, brother-in-law Usman Darr, brother Saad Butt, and sister Haleema Butt. Khuram Butt, 27, was the ringleader of the three attackers Mr Lucraft said he could understand the pressures on Saad Butt - whose daughter had been killed in an accident. But he said: ""It seems to me that on the basis of what he accepted he did know of his brother and the worrying views he was espousing, he did very little, if anything, to accurately monitor his brother's movements."" Earlier in the inquest Butt's widow,Ms Rehman, told the courthis actions were ""disgusting"" and their children would never know where his grave was. She said she would not grieve for his death and also denied prior knowledge of her husband's plot - although she said she had been worried he wanted to go to Syria. The coroner praised police officers, medics and members of the public who rushed to help on the night of the attack despite the danger. PC Charlie Guenigault, 27, was off duty when he took on the three attackers alongside British Transport Police PC Wayne Marques and Spanish banker Ignacio Echeverria. He said: ""In my head I just see all three of them standing in front of me, knives in hand and fake vests on and that look of, 'We're going to kill you,' basically that sort of anger in their eyes."" This video can not be played Anton Sobanski was driving the number 43 across London Bridge when the attack happened PC Guenigault, who was awarded the George Medal, said he ""played dead"" after being stabbed in the head. Ringleader Butt, 27, alongside Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge before getting out and stabbing people in and around Borough Market. Xavier Thomas, 45, Christine Archibald, 30, Sara Zelenak, 21, Sebastien Belanger, 36, James McMullan, 32, Kirsty Boden, 28, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Ignacio Echeverria, 39, were all killed. Another 48 people were injured. The three attackers were shot dead by police less than 10 minutes after the rampage began.

"Countries across Europe are sweltering under the heat Parts of Europe are scorching as a second heatwave in as many months brings record-breaking high temperatures, prompting governments to issue health alerts urging people to keep cool. This month's heat has, much like June's soaring temperatures, caused forest fires, buckled train tracks and led to warnings over air quality and water shortages. A red alert has been issued in France - with temperatures hitting 40.6C in Paris - while Belgian, German and Dutch temperature records could be broken for the second time in two days. Last month, France set an all-time high-temperature record of 46C, and new highs were set in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Andorra, Luxembourg, Poland and Germany - making it the hottest June on record. As the mercury continues to rise, experts tell the BBC why we should expect heatwaves to become more frequent. Heatwaves occur across northern Europe when high atmospheric pressure draws up hot air from northern Africa, Portugal and Spain, raising temperatures and increasing humidity. Timothy Hewson, who leads a forecasting team at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), said clear skies added to the strength of the sunshine, further increasing temperatures. He said dry soil conditions also contributed, as this resulted in less evaporation, which ordinarily cools the ground. In pictures: Europe tries to stay cool in the heat Regular heatwaves 'will kill thousands' Heatwaves are not uncommon, but according to weather experts they are being amplified by a rise in global temperatures and are likely to become more frequent - one of the more predictable impacts of our warming climate. A climate specialist at the UK's Meteorological Office, Grahame Madge, told the BBC that, while weather variations occurred naturally, the world was about one degree warmer than pre-industrial levels and, as a result, extreme weather was becoming more likely. ""Now when we get a heatwave, it is likely to be a degree or so more,"" he said. ""They are still extreme events, but they are also becoming more frequent."" This video can not be played A coati eating iced fruit in a Rome zoo The highest recorded temperature in Europe - 48C (118.4F) - was measured in Athens in July 1977, but on average the 20 warmest years since records began have all been within the past 22 years. The years2015-2018 make up the top four, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). A scientific study into last year's Europe-wide heatwave by the World Weather Attribution group concluded thathigh temperatures in the region were made more likely by human activities that contributed to climate change,external. Climate change: Where we are in seven charts If the current trend were to continue, heatwaves across Europe could occur as often as every other year by the 2040s, with the possibility that overall average temperatures might have risen by 3-5C by 2100, the report said. There is no universally accepted definition of a heatwave, due to variations in climate conditions in different world regions. Typically though, they are defined by an unseasonably hot period - usually five degrees or more above the average daily maximum - that lasts at least three days. Other factors considered by analysts, Mr Hewson said, included night-time temperatures, humidity and wind speed. Both humidity and low wind speeds can enhance a heatwave. The effects can be particularly extreme in large cities due to increased human activity and a mass of buildings, concrete and roads. The skeleton of a fish lies on a dry part of the bed of the River Loire in western France ""In terms of the time of year and spatial pattern of warmth, the ongoing event in Europe is quite similar to the 2015 European heatwave,"" Mr Hewson said. The most severely affected areas during that heatwave were southern and central Europe, but there were also temperature records set in Germany and Switzerland. Higher temperatures can affect anyone, but dehydration, heat exhaustion and heatstroke can have deadly consequences for people who suffer from cardiac, kidney and respiratory diseases, as well as the elderly and infants. ""Heatwaves can be dangerous because they reduce the capacity of the human body to regulate its own temperature, to keep it at safe levels,"" Mr Hewson said. Vulnerable people may suffer particularly if overnight temperatures do not drop below 25C, said Mr Madge, the Met Office climate specialist. What you should and shouldn't do during a heatwave Health professionals advise that anyone experiencing headaches, dizziness, loss of appetite, nausea, excessive sweating, cramps, fast breathing or intense thirst should try to find a way to cool off. Tourists freshening up at a fountain near the Pantheon monument in Rome in June If a person's body temperature rises above 40C (104F), heat stroke can set in, requiring urgent medical help. Danger signs include sweat stopping and breathing difficulties. Heat stroke can lead to loss of consciousness and serious complications, including permanent damage to vital organs or even death. After the 2003 heatwave, about70,000 additional deaths were recorded,externalin Europe compared with previous years, according to a scientific and medical study. Multiple deaths have been reported in the latest heatwave. Two people died in Spain from suspected heatstroke, while UK police warned of the dangers of cooling off in rivers and lakes after a 12-year-old girl drowned. Nations with hotter climates, such as Australia and countries in North Africa and across the Middle East - where summer temperatures can often reach 50C - can still struggle with extreme weather. ""Their infrastructure might be able to cope with higher temperatures in general, but with anything away from the norm, everywhere struggles,"" Mr Madge said. When asked how they keep cool in extreme heat, BBC colleagues living in Nigeria, Tanzania, Yemen and Brazil had the following advice for countries with more variable climates: Clothing:Wear something loose and light, both in weight and in colour Washing:Shower frequently in cool water Stay hydrated:Consume lots of water Towels:Carry a small flannel to soak in water and daub your face Bedding:Sleep in thin cotton sheets Ventilation:Open windows (except in the midday sun), close shutters and use fans This video can not be played BBC colleagues from hot countries give their tips for staying cool In pictures: Europe tries to stay cool in the heat How to look after yourself in hot weather 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"The coroner at the London Bridge inquests said he was ""not convinced"" MI5 and police missed any opportunities that would have prevented the attack. The inquests into the deaths of the eight victims ended with chief coroner of England and Wales Mark Lucraft concluding they were unlawfully killed. He said he would not be criticising MI5 and the police in his conclusions. But Mr Lucraft did criticise the lack of barriers on the bridge - a ""particularly vulnerable"" location. The attack, in June 2017, happened only two and half months after the Westminster Bridge attack. Mr Lucraft said the lack of barriers showed ""weaknesses in systems for assessing the need for such measures... and implementing them promptly"". The victims of the attack clockwise from top left - Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, Alexandre Pigeard, Sebastien Belanger, Ignacio Echeverria, Xavier Thomas, Sara Zelenak, Kirsty Boden But some victims' friends and families remain critical of the police. Philippe Pigeard, whose 26-year-old son Alexandre Pigeard was killed, also pointed to the lack of barriers, saying: ""I think this attack could have been prevented."" Speaking after the inquest concluded, he said there were ""a lot of missed opportunities"" to neutralise at least one of the attackers who was known to be dangerous. Christine Delcros, who was severely injured and lost her boyfriend, Xavier Thomas, in the attack highlighted a ""catalogue of failings"". Ms Delcros said it was ""staggering"" that Butt, a ""well known extremist"", was allowed to work within the London Transport network, and that ""opportunities to identify all the attackers and disrupt their activities did not occur"". Chaos and killings: 10 minutes at London Bridge Victims of the London Bridge attack The partygoer who turned into a killer Mr Pigeard also paid tribute to nurse Helen Kennett, who came to his son's aid. Ms Kennett, who was out to celebrate her birthday,was stabbed in the neckas she tried to help. Standing next to Ms Kennett outside court, Mr Pigeard said: ""I want to thank so much Helen for her courage. ""She came to help my son who was bleeding to death. She was stabbed too in a few seconds."" Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu disputed claims that opportunities were lost. Citing the coroner's findings, Mr Basu said: ""Even those closest to the attackers, and we have heard from them during the inquest, knew nothing of their murderous plans."" He said it will ""never be possible to stop every plot"". This video can not be played Philippe Pigeard believes the attack in which his son Alexandre was killed could have been stopped Summing up evidence earlier, the coroner had said the family of attacker Khuram Butt were not ""convincing witnesses"" in court. He said each of Butt's family members ""accepted that they should now have done more at the time"" and that they all ""knew something of his extreme views"". Four of Butt's family gave evidence during the inquest at the Old Bailey: his widow Zahrah Rehman, brother-in-law Usman Darr, brother Saad Butt, and sister Haleema Butt. Khuram Butt, 27, was the ringleader of the three attackers Mr Lucraft said he could understand the pressures on Saad Butt - whose daughter had been killed in an accident. But he said: ""It seems to me that on the basis of what he accepted he did know of his brother and the worrying views he was espousing, he did very little, if anything, to accurately monitor his brother's movements."" Earlier in the inquest Butt's widow,Ms Rehman, told the courthis actions were ""disgusting"" and their children would never know where his grave was. She said she would not grieve for his death and also denied prior knowledge of her husband's plot - although she said she had been worried he wanted to go to Syria. The coroner praised police officers, medics and members of the public who rushed to help on the night of the attack despite the danger. PC Charlie Guenigault, 27, was off duty when he took on the three attackers alongside British Transport Police PC Wayne Marques and Spanish banker Ignacio Echeverria. He said: ""In my head I just see all three of them standing in front of me, knives in hand and fake vests on and that look of, 'We're going to kill you,' basically that sort of anger in their eyes."" This video can not be played Anton Sobanski was driving the number 43 across London Bridge when the attack happened PC Guenigault, who was awarded the George Medal, said he ""played dead"" after being stabbed in the head. Ringleader Butt, 27, alongside Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge before getting out and stabbing people in and around Borough Market. Xavier Thomas, 45, Christine Archibald, 30, Sara Zelenak, 21, Sebastien Belanger, 36, James McMullan, 32, Kirsty Boden, 28, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Ignacio Echeverria, 39, were all killed.

"Donald Trump teed off at the opening of his controversial Aberdeenshire golf course in 2012 The sand dunes at Donald Trump's Aberdeenshire golf resort are expected to lose their status as a nationally-important protected environment. Government watchdog Scottish Natural Heritage has recommended that Menie links be removed from an existing site of special scientific interest (SSSI). SNH concluded Mr Trump's golf course had ""destroyed"" the sand dune system, causing permanent habitat loss. The Trump Organisation reacted by calling the move a ""stitch-up"". It said the organisation had spent millions on the care, protection and maintenance of the SSSI area. SNH said it was ""unusual"" to remove an SSSI from the list but there was no longer a reason to protect the dunes. Scottish Green party co-convener Patrick Harvie, who campaigned against the development, said: ""It has ruined, destroyed, gubbed, the kind of natural environment that those paper protections were there to protect."" Donald Trump officially played his first round at the Trump International Golf Links, north of Aberdeen, in July 2012, more than four years before he became US president. It is partly built on Foveran Links - an SSSI originally listed as one of the finest examples of a ""dynamic"" mobile sand dune system in the UK. Before the course was built, the dune system moved north at substantial speeds - up to 11 metres per year - across an area of about 15 hectares. SNH warned a planning inquiry that the development would seriously damage the SSSI but permission was granted on the basis that the potential economic benefit would outweigh environmental harm. The sand dunes at Sand end burn looking north before and after the construction of the Trump International Golf Links. Two years ago SNH concluded that the site's special features had been ""partially destroyed"" with no prospect of recovery. It said there had been some permanent habitat loss - for example, where tracks, tees, fairways and greens had been constructed. There had been other habitat changes where mobile sand dunes were stabilised through the planting of marram grass. SNH is now beginning a three-month consultation on the formal process of delisting the SSSI. Sally Thomas, SNH's director of people and nature, said: ""The denotification of SSSIs is unusual, however in this case we have found there is no longer a reason to protect the dunes at Menie as they do not include enough of the special, natural features for which they were designated."" Ms Thomas said SNH worked with developers to ensure habitats and wildlife were protected when development work was undertaken. She said: ""Most of the time, development can take place without damaging important natural features, but this was not the case in this instance."" The Menie section of the Foveran SSSI comprised a range of special habitats, of which approximately one-third have been damaged. SNH said the Foveran Links SSSI was a ""very high quality example of a sand dune system characteristic of north east Scotland"". It now proposes merging what remains of the SSSI at Foveran Links with the adjacent Sands of Forvie and Ythan Estuary SSSI. Mr Harvie, from The Scottish Greens, said: ""The damage we predicted has come to pass. ""It demonstrates once again that this development should never have been allowed to go ahead."" Mr Harvie said it could never be acceptable for a ""precious, irreplaceable eco-system"" to be sold off for short-term economic gain. Trump opened his golf course seven years ago He said the legal protection designed to protect the site were ""torn up"" to allow the development to go ahead. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""Scottish ministers approved the Menie Golf Resort application in 2008 in line with the recommendation of the three independent Reporters which was that overall the economic and social benefits of the proposal justified the adverse environmental impacts caused."" In response to the announcement, the Trump Organisation issued a strongly-worded statement. Trump International Golf Links Scotland's executive vice-president, Sarah Malone, said: ""This is an utter disgrace and shows SNH has hit an all time low. To make an announcement to the media before informing us, the actual landowner, shows how politically-motivated this decision is. What other SSSI landowner is singled out in this way. ""It's a stitch-up. ""Before Donald Trump invested in the site, SNH had little interest in the SSSI at Foveran Links and did even less about it, and has barely been on property since.  Trump International funds a team of leading geomorphological consultants, ecologists and environmental experts and has spent millions on the care, protection and maintenance of the small area of SSSI in Scotland that it owns and yet SNH has offered no support, guidance or help. ""All this government agency wants to do is score political points and undermine that investment, custodianship and environmental management. No other SSSI site in the country has been afforded the amount of funding or expertise that Menie has and continues to receive.""

"In the words of the film, everything appears to be ""awesome"" in the world of Lego as it expands its empire by snapping up Legoland and Madame Tussauds owner Merlin Entertainments The Danish billionaire family that controls the Lego toy firm, with other investors, is paying Â£4.8bn for Merlin. Kirkbi Invest says it has the money and experience to ""realise the company's potential to grow"". Merlin also owns the London Eye, Alton Towers and Chessington Adventures. Kirkbi already owns almost a third of the shares in Merlin Entertainments, and says it does not expect the deal to lead to any significant changes. All existing Merlin attractions in the UK will remain open and it has no plans to sell any part of the business, it said. Kirkbi chief executive SÃ¸ren Thorup SÃ¸rensen said the group wanted to help the firm reach its ""full potential, which we believe is best pursued under private ownership"". ""With a shared understanding of the business and its culture, we believe that this group of investors has the unique collective resources necessary to equip Merlin, for their next phase of growth,"" he added. Private equity firm Blackstone - part of the investment group - said it had the ""substantial resources"" required to support Merlin's long-term plans ""which will require significant investment to ensure its long-term success"". Merlin is the second-largest operator of visitor attractions globally with more than 130 attractions in 25 countries. It said it had already rejected several approaches. The move comes just weeks after activist shareholder ValueAct Capital, which holds a 9.3% stake in Merlin, called on the company to find a private buyer. The sale means that Merlin's shares will be delisted from the London Stock Exchange, which it floated on six years ago. The offer price of 455p a share values Merlin's share capital at Â£4.77bn, but the deal also includes Â£1.2bn of debt giving the group an enterprise value of just under Â£6bn. Merlin chairman Sir John Sunderland said its board unanimously recommended the deal to the company's shareholders. ""The company has generated meaningful value since its IPO (Initial Public Offering), with significant growth in revenue, earnings and cash flow. ""The Merlin independent directors believe this offer represents an opportunity for Merlin shareholders to realise value for their investment in cash at an attractive valuation."" Alton Towers is one of Merlin's most popular attractions Merlin has faced some high-profile struggles, including a crash in 2015 at one of its Alton Towers rollercoaster which injured 16 people. Visitor numbers to its attractions were also hit by the terror attacks in London and poor weather which led to a profits warning in 2017. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst George Salmon said the firm's recent troubles meant the price agreed for the deal was lower than it would have been two years ago. ""For the new owners, the move is motivated by a desire to remove the company from the daily scrutiny of the public markets, and focus on longer-term investments,"" he said.

Sally Thomas, SNH's director of people and nature, said: ""The denotification of SSSIs is unusual, however in this case we have found there is no longer a reason to protect the dunes at Menie as they do not include enough of the special, natural features for which they were designated."" Ms Thomas said SNH worked with developers to ensure habitats and wildlife were protected when development work was undertaken. She said: ""Most of the time, development can take place without damaging important natural features, but this was not the case in this instance."" The Menie section of the Foveran SSSI comprised a range of special habitats, of which approximately one-third have been damaged. SNH said the Foveran Links SSSI was a ""very high quality example of a sand dune system characteristic of north east Scotland"". It now proposes merging what remains of the SSSI at Foveran Links with the adjacent Sands of Forvie and Ythan Estuary SSSI. Mr Harvie, from The Scottish Greens, said: ""The damage we predicted has come to pass. ""It demonstrates once again that this development should never have been allowed to go ahead."" Mr Harvie said it could never be acceptable for a ""precious, irreplaceable eco-system"" to be sold off for short-term economic gain. Trump opened his golf course seven years ago He said the legal protection designed to protect the site were ""torn up"" to allow the development to go ahead. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""Scottish ministers approved the Menie Golf Resort application in 2008 in line with the recommendation of the three independent Reporters which was that overall the economic and social benefits of the proposal justified the adverse environmental impacts caused."" In response to the announcement, the Trump Organisation issued a strongly-worded statement. Trump International Golf Links Scotland's executive vice-president, Sarah Malone, said: ""This is an utter disgrace and shows SNH has hit an all time low. To make an announcement to the media before informing us, the actual landowner, shows how politically-motivated this decision is. What other SSSI landowner is singled out in this way. ""It's a stitch-up. ""Before Donald Trump invested in the site, SNH had little interest in the SSSI at Foveran Links and did even less about it, and has barely been on property since.  Trump International funds a team of leading geomorphological consultants, ecologists and environmental experts and has spent millions on the care, protection and maintenance of the small area of SSSI in Scotland that it owns and yet SNH has offered no support, guidance or help. ""All this government agency wants to do is score political points and undermine that investment, custodianship and environmental management. No other SSSI site in the country has been afforded the amount of funding or expertise that Menie has and continues to receive.""

"One Education board member said plans for such an staff LGBT network had the potential to create ""tension"" in schools The chair of the Education Authority (EA) has expressed concern that plans for an LGBT staff network are generating ""substantial discussion"" at board meetings. That is according to as-yet unpublished draft EA board minutes seen by the BBC. Sharon O'Connor is recorded as making the comments during the board's meeting on 23 May 2019. According to the EA's draft business plan, the details of an LGBT network were to be in place by 30 June 2019. They were due to be approved at May's meeting. However that was delayed as some board members wanted more information on what an LGBT staff network would involve. One unidentified board member said plans for such a network had the potential to create ""tension"" in schools. A leading Unison trade union official has expressed concern about the delay and said LGBT staff networks are common across the public sector. They usually allow LGBT staff to get to know each other through both formal and informal events. The discussion over the EA network took place while the board were discussing the authority's draft business plan for 2019/20 at the 23 May meeting. Sharon O'Connor became the chair of the Education Authority in April 2015 A member said the board had not been given enough information about the proposed LGBT network and asked for consideration of the business plan to be deferred until that information was provided. According to the minutes of the meeting, the member ""said that the issue concerning staff networks would equally apply to teaching staff in schools"". ""He drew attention to a possible outworking of a staff network where a tension could arise between a member of staff and a Board of Governors, which related to the ethos of that school,"" the minutes said. During the subsequent discussion, another member said the draft business plan was ""heavily weighted towards HR issues and that it should prioritise activities that were child centred"". However, some of the other 21 board members expressed support for the proposed network. According to the minutes ""the chair recorded her concern that substantial discussion was being given to the LGBT staff network at board and committee meetings and not to any other activities set out in the plan"". Unison's regional organiser Fidelma Carolan, who also has responsibility for LGBT issues, told BBC News NI that a staff network was important in promoting inclusive workplaces. ""Any delay due to the board sends a really negative message to LGBT people working for the EA,"" she said. ""There have been no similar concerns raised about a disability staff network, for instance. ""We believe some people have taken a moral line on the issue."" In a statement, the EA's director of human resources Clare Duffield said the authority were making progress on equality and disability action plans. ""We have a diverse workforce who inspire, support and challenge children and young people to be the best they can be, whether that's in our schools, other educational settings or through the services we provide,"" she said. ""We want EA to be a great place to work and to develop all our people. ""We have a wide range of diversity and inclusion initiatives that support our colleagues. We will continue to support our staff.""

"Vladimir Putin says liberal ideals conflict with the interests of most people Vladimir Putin has said liberalism is ""obsolete"" in an interview before he left for the G20 summit. The Russian president said the ideology that has underpinned Western democracies for decades had ""outlived its purpose"". The Russian leader also praised the rise of populism in Europe and America, saying ideas like multiculturalism were ""no longer tenable"". His comments came in a wide-ranginginterview with the Financial Times,external. The piece was published as world leaders began talks on trade and security in Japan. ""[Liberals] cannot simply dictate anything to anyone,"" said Mr Putin, who is on his fourth term as president. Is Putin right? Is liberalism really dead? Why are the world's leaders meeting up? Trump-Xi showdown to dominate G20 summit He added that liberalism conflicted with ""the interests of the overwhelming majority of the population,"" and took aim at German Chancellor Angela Merkel for allowing large numbers of refugees to settle in Germany. ""This liberal idea presupposes that nothing needs to be done. That migrants can kill, plunder and rape with impunity because their rights as migrants have to be protected."" This video can not be played Donald Trump jokes to Vladimir Putin about Russian election meddling at the G20 summit Mr Putin, 66, also said Russia had ""no problems with LGBT personsâ¦ but some things do appear excessive to us"". ""They claim now that children can play five or six gender roles,"" he continued. ""Let everyone be happy, we have no problem with that. But this must not be allowed to overshadow the culture, traditions and traditional family values of millions of people making up the core population."" President Putin is a man who grew to maturity in the Soviet-era and was a servant of the Communist state. He regards the collapse of the Soviet Union as a tragedy, and has sought to establish Russia as a counterweight to the liberal Western order. So, to that extent, his comments are hardly surprising. Russia, though - with its relatively weak economy and many social problems - is hardly an example that many will want to follow. Nonetheless, where Mr Putin's remarks carry some weight is that the liberal order established in the wake of the World War Two is under stress like never before. The ramifications of the financial crisis; populist currents inside many liberal democratic countries; Brexit; the rise of China as a major economic force; and a US president who many critics see as corrosive to the established US-led order have combined to create a genuine sense of drift and unease. Aside from remarks on liberalism, Mr Putin also praised US President Donald Trump as a ""talented person"" who knew how to relate to voters. World leaders from 19 countries - and the European Union - are meeting in Japan from Friday to discuss economic policy and co-operation But the Russian leader also said American unilateralism was partly to blame for the ongoing trade war between China and the US, and for tensions with Iran in the Strait of Hormuz. But EU President Donald Tusk lashed out at Mr Putin on Friday, telling reporters he ""strongly [disagreed]"" with his sentiments on liberalism. ""Whoever claims that liberal democracy is obsolete also claims that freedoms are obsolete, that the rule of law is obsolete and that human rights are obsolete,"" said Mr Tusk. ""What I find really obsolete are authoritarianism, personality cults, the rule of oligarchs, even if sometimes they may seem effective,"" he added. Is Putin right? Is liberalism really dead?

"Countries across Europe are sweltering under the heat Parts of Europe are scorching as a second heatwave in as many months brings record-breaking high temperatures, prompting governments to issue health alerts urging people to keep cool. This month's heat has, much like June's soaring temperatures, caused forest fires, buckled train tracks and led to warnings over air quality and water shortages. A red alert has been issued in France - with temperatures hitting 40.6C in Paris - while Belgian, German and Dutch temperature records could be broken for the second time in two days. Last month, France set an all-time high-temperature record of 46C, and new highs were set in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Andorra, Luxembourg, Poland and Germany - making it the hottest June on record. As the mercury continues to rise, experts tell the BBC why we should expect heatwaves to become more frequent. Heatwaves occur across northern Europe when high atmospheric pressure draws up hot air from northern Africa, Portugal and Spain, raising temperatures and increasing humidity. Timothy Hewson, who leads a forecasting team at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), said clear skies added to the strength of the sunshine, further increasing temperatures. He said dry soil conditions also contributed, as this resulted in less evaporation, which ordinarily cools the ground. In pictures: Europe tries to stay cool in the heat Regular heatwaves 'will kill thousands' Heatwaves are not uncommon, but according to weather experts they are being amplified by a rise in global temperatures and are likely to become more frequent - one of the more predictable impacts of our warming climate. A climate specialist at the UK's Meteorological Office, Grahame Madge, told the BBC that, while weather variations occurred naturally, the world was about one degree warmer than pre-industrial levels and, as a result, extreme weather was becoming more likely. ""Now when we get a heatwave, it is likely to be a degree or so more,"" he said. ""They are still extreme events, but they are also becoming more frequent."" This video can not be played A coati eating iced fruit in a Rome zoo The highest recorded temperature in Europe - 48C (118.4F) - was measured in Athens in July 1977, but on average the 20 warmest years since records began have all been within the past 22 years. The years2015-2018 make up the top four, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). A scientific study into last year's Europe-wide heatwave by the World Weather Attribution group concluded thathigh temperatures in the region were made more likely by human activities that contributed to climate change,external. Climate change: Where we are in seven charts If the current trend were to continue, heatwaves across Europe could occur as often as every other year by the 2040s, with the possibility that overall average temperatures might have risen by 3-5C by 2100, the report said. There is no universally accepted definition of a heatwave, due to variations in climate conditions in different world regions. Typically though, they are defined by an unseasonably hot period - usually five degrees or more above the average daily maximum - that lasts at least three days. Other factors considered by analysts, Mr Hewson said, included night-time temperatures, humidity and wind speed. Both humidity and low wind speeds can enhance a heatwave. The effects can be particularly extreme in large cities due to increased human activity and a mass of buildings, concrete and roads. The skeleton of a fish lies on a dry part of the bed of the River Loire in western France ""In terms of the time of year and spatial pattern of warmth, the ongoing event in Europe is quite similar to the 2015 European heatwave,"" Mr Hewson said. The most severely affected areas during that heatwave were southern and central Europe, but there were also temperature records set in Germany and Switzerland. Higher temperatures can affect anyone, but dehydration, heat exhaustion and heatstroke can have deadly consequences for people who suffer from cardiac, kidney and respiratory diseases, as well as the elderly and infants. ""Heatwaves can be dangerous because they reduce the capacity of the human body to regulate its own temperature, to keep it at safe levels,"" Mr Hewson said. Vulnerable people may suffer particularly if overnight temperatures do not drop below 25C, said Mr Madge, the Met Office climate specialist. What you should and shouldn't do during a heatwave Health professionals advise that anyone experiencing headaches, dizziness, loss of appetite, nausea, excessive sweating, cramps, fast breathing or intense thirst should try to find a way to cool off. Tourists freshening up at a fountain near the Pantheon monument in Rome in June If a person's body temperature rises above 40C (104F), heat stroke can set in, requiring urgent medical help. Danger signs include sweat stopping and breathing difficulties. Heat stroke can lead to loss of consciousness and serious complications, including permanent damage to vital organs or even death. After the 2003 heatwave, about70,000 additional deaths were recorded,externalin Europe compared with previous years, according to a scientific and medical study. Multiple deaths have been reported in the latest heatwave. Two people died in Spain from suspected heatstroke, while UK police warned of the dangers of cooling off in rivers and lakes after a 12-year-old girl drowned. Nations with hotter climates, such as Australia and countries in North Africa and across the Middle East - where summer temperatures can often reach 50C - can still struggle with extreme weather. ""Their infrastructure might be able to cope with higher temperatures in general, but with anything away from the norm, everywhere struggles,"" Mr Madge said. When asked how they keep cool in extreme heat, BBC colleagues living in Nigeria, Tanzania, Yemen and Brazil had the following advice for countries with more variable climates: Clothing:Wear something loose and light, both in weight and in colour Washing:Shower frequently in cool water Stay hydrated:Consume lots of water Towels:Carry a small flannel to soak in water and daub your face Bedding:Sleep in thin cotton sheets Ventilation:Open windows (except in the midday sun), close shutters and use fans This video can not be played BBC colleagues from hot countries give their tips for staying cool In pictures: Europe tries to stay cool in the heat How to look after yourself in hot weather 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

The African Union will represent 55 countries from across the continent at future G20 meetings. The G20 - or Group of Twenty - is a club of countries that meets to discuss global economic and political issues. Between them, G20 countries account for85% of the world's economic output and more than 75% of world trade,external. They contain two-thirds of global population. The G20 members are the EU plus 19 nations: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the UK and the US. Some countries which are members of the G20 alsomeet as the G7. These are the world's seven leading industrialised countries. The African Union was invited to be become a permanent G20 member at the Delhi summit. The organisation represents 55 African countries. Profile: African Union The group was founded in 1999 afterthe Asian financial crisis. It was designed to be a forum for finance ministers and officials to discuss ways to restore economic stability. The first leaders' summit was held in 2008 in response to that year's global financial turmoil, to promote international cooperation. The G20 has broadened its focus in recent years to include issues such as climate change and sustainable energy. Every year, a different G20 member state takes over the presidency, and sets the agenda for the leaders' summit. Ajoint declarationfrom G20 members condemned""human suffering and adverse repercussions of the conflict in Ukraine on global food and energy security"", without directly criticising Russia. The Ukrainian government said the declaration was ""nothing to be proud of"", adding that a Ukrainian presence would have given participants a better understanding of the situation. Anew network of railways and shipping routes,externalwas announced by the US, India, Saudi Arabia and the EU, on the sidelines of the summit. It is designed to increase trade between South Asia, the Middle East and Europe. It is also meant to counter China's project to build new global trading routes, theBelt and Road Initiative. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi had wanted the summit to promote his country as a major global power, and himself as an important world leader, ahead of a general election due in spring 2024. He took the lead in inviting the AU to become a permanent member to the G20.

A row also broke out between India and China shortly before the summit, when Beijing released a mapclaiming the state of Arunachal Pradesh and the Aksai Chin plateau as Chinese territory. At the 2008 and 2009 leaders' summits, during the financial crisis, leadersagreed a host of measures to rescue the global economic system,external. But some critics argue thatsubsequent summits have been less constructive, often because of tensions between rival world powers,external. However, one-to-one meetings between leaders have often proved constructive. For example, at the 2019 summit in Osaka, then-US president Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinpingagreed to resume talks to settle a major trade dispute. G20 summits attract anti-globalisation protests. India's government ramped up security measures ahead of the Delhi event, closing roads around the venue, and deploying130,000 security officials across the city. Huge cut-outs of langur monkeys have been installed in Delhi to scare off smaller monkeys Novel measures were also taken to try to keeptroublesome monkeys away from the area.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump's joking reprimand to Putin US President Donald Trump has appeared to make light of Russian election interference during a meeting with the country's leader, Vladimir Putin. A smirking Mr Trump wagged his finger at the Russian president and said: ""Don't meddle in the election, please."" The pair were holding talks on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan. It was their first meeting since Robert Mueller concluded his investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. US intelligence agencies concluded that Russia was behind an effort to influence the presidential election with a state-authorised campaign of cyber-attacks and fake news stories planted on social media. Special counsel Mueller's report said it had not established that the Trump campaign criminally conspired with Russia to influence the election, although it did not exonerate the president of obstruction of justice.

The G20 is an annual meeting of leaders from the countries with the largest and fastest-growing economies - and this year is likely to see differences of opinion over climate change, Iran, protectionism and global trade, as well as a host of bilateral meetings between leaders. Mr Putin smiled as the US president delivered his light-hearted reprimand on election interference. But he was reserved ahead of the G20 talks with his American counterpart, only commenting that the pair had ""things to discuss"". However, in a wide-ranging interview with the Financial Times, published on Friday, he offered his thoughts on both global and domestic politics. He said liberalism was ""obsolete"", and praised the rise of populism both in Europe and the US. He also described Mr Trump as a ""talented person"" who knew how to relate to voters. ""It's a great honour to be with President Putin,"" Mr Trump said at the outset of the talks on Friday. ""We have a very, very good relationship."" On Wednesday, in comments made outside the White House, he refused to disclose what he was planning to discuss with the Russian leader. ""What I say to him is none of your business,"" he told reporters, bluntly. The meeting between the two leaders, their first since a summit in Helsinki last July, came at the start of an eagerly awaited G20 summit in Osaka. Scheduled meetings and set-piece events can often be overshadowed by the many bilateral talks, such as this, that happen on the sidelines. As well as his meeting with the US president, Mr Putin also met UK Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday. May tells Putin Salisbury attack 'can never be repeated' The pair staged a frosty photo opportunity before discussing some difficult subjects, includingthe poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal last year,by suspected Russian military intelligence officers. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in the attack. This video can not be played Mrs May was unsmiling as she greeted Mr Putin, in a frosty start to their meeting in Japan. French President Emmanuel Macron has said he wants strong wording in support of tackling climate change in any final leaders' statement. But the issue is a contentious one, given that the US is committed to pulling out ofthe landmark Paris climate agreement signed in 2015. The work to consolidate various opinions is expected to be ""difficult"", a Japanese official admitted on Thursday. The G20 is an annual meeting of leaders from the countries with the largest and fastest-growing economies The most closely watched talks are set to take place between Mr Trump and China's President Xi Jinping on Saturday, as the two countries try to resolve their bitter trade dispute. All eyes on Trump-Xi showdown US-China trade war in brief Talks ground to a halt last month when Mr Trump accused China of reneging on its promises and raised tariffs on $200bn (Â£159.2bn) worth of Chinese goods. The move came as a surprise to many who had thought the US and China were nearing a trade deal. China retaliated with its own tariff hikes. But there are reports that a trade truce could be struck over the weekend as the two leaders meet in Osaka. They last met at another G20 summit in Buenos Aires last year and, following a working dinner, agreed on a 90-day truce to their trade war. Ahead of the meeting, China warned against protectionist trade measures in comments that have been widely interpreted as a criticism of the US. ""Protectionism and bullying practices are on the rise, posing severe threats to economic globalisation and international order,"" a Chinese foreign ministry official said on Friday. Is Putin right?

"Vladimir Putin says liberal ideals conflict with the interests of most people Vladimir Putin has said liberalism is ""obsolete"" in an interview before he left for the G20 summit. The Russian president said the ideology that has underpinned Western democracies for decades had ""outlived its purpose"". The Russian leader also praised the rise of populism in Europe and America, saying ideas like multiculturalism were ""no longer tenable"". His comments came in a wide-ranginginterview with the Financial Times,external. The piece was published as world leaders began talks on trade and security in Japan. ""[Liberals] cannot simply dictate anything to anyone,"" said Mr Putin, who is on his fourth term as president. Is Putin right? Is liberalism really dead? Why are the world's leaders meeting up? Trump-Xi showdown to dominate G20 summit He added that liberalism conflicted with ""the interests of the overwhelming majority of the population,"" and took aim at German Chancellor Angela Merkel for allowing large numbers of refugees to settle in Germany. ""This liberal idea presupposes that nothing needs to be done. That migrants can kill, plunder and rape with impunity because their rights as migrants have to be protected."" This video can not be played Donald Trump jokes to Vladimir Putin about Russian election meddling at the G20 summit Mr Putin, 66, also said Russia had ""no problems with LGBT personsâ¦ but some things do appear excessive to us"". ""They claim now that children can play five or six gender roles,"" he continued. ""Let everyone be happy, we have no problem with that. But this must not be allowed to overshadow the culture, traditions and traditional family values of millions of people making up the core population."" President Putin is a man who grew to maturity in the Soviet-era and was a servant of the Communist state. He regards the collapse of the Soviet Union as a tragedy, and has sought to establish Russia as a counterweight to the liberal Western order. So, to that extent, his comments are hardly surprising. Russia, though - with its relatively weak economy and many social problems - is hardly an example that many will want to follow. Nonetheless, where Mr Putin's remarks carry some weight is that the liberal order established in the wake of the World War Two is under stress like never before. The ramifications of the financial crisis; populist currents inside many liberal democratic countries; Brexit; the rise of China as a major economic force; and a US president who many critics see as corrosive to the established US-led order have combined to create a genuine sense of drift and unease. Aside from remarks on liberalism, Mr Putin also praised US President Donald Trump as a ""talented person"" who knew how to relate to voters. World leaders from 19 countries - and the European Union - are meeting in Japan from Friday to discuss economic policy and co-operation But the Russian leader also said American unilateralism was partly to blame for the ongoing trade war between China and the US, and for tensions with Iran in the Strait of Hormuz. But EU President Donald Tusk lashed out at Mr Putin on Friday, telling reporters he ""strongly [disagreed]"" with his sentiments on liberalism. ""Whoever claims that liberal democracy is obsolete also claims that freedoms are obsolete, that the rule of law is obsolete and that human rights are obsolete,"" said Mr Tusk. ""What I find really obsolete are authoritarianism, personality cults, the rule of oligarchs, even if sometimes they may seem effective,"" he added. Is Putin right? Is liberalism really dead?

"This video can not be played Donald Trump's joking reprimand to Putin US President Donald Trump has appeared to make light of Russian election interference during a meeting with the country's leader, Vladimir Putin. A smirking Mr Trump wagged his finger at the Russian president and said: ""Don't meddle in the election, please."" The pair were holding talks on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan. It was their first meeting since Robert Mueller concluded his investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. US intelligence agencies concluded that Russia was behind an effort to influence the presidential election with a state-authorised campaign of cyber-attacks and fake news stories planted on social media. Special counsel Mueller's report said it had not established that the Trump campaign criminally conspired with Russia to influence the election, although it did not exonerate the president of obstruction of justice.

The G20 is an annual meeting of leaders from the countries with the largest and fastest-growing economies - and this year is likely to see differences of opinion over climate change, Iran, protectionism and global trade, as well as a host of bilateral meetings between leaders. Mr Putin smiled as the US president delivered his light-hearted reprimand on election interference. But he was reserved ahead of the G20 talks with his American counterpart, only commenting that the pair had ""things to discuss"". However, in a wide-ranging interview with the Financial Times, published on Friday, he offered his thoughts on both global and domestic politics. He said liberalism was ""obsolete"", and praised the rise of populism both in Europe and the US. He also described Mr Trump as a ""talented person"" who knew how to relate to voters. ""It's a great honour to be with President Putin,"" Mr Trump said at the outset of the talks on Friday. ""We have a very, very good relationship."" On Wednesday, in comments made outside the White House, he refused to disclose what he was planning to discuss with the Russian leader. ""What I say to him is none of your business,"" he told reporters, bluntly. The meeting between the two leaders, their first since a summit in Helsinki last July, came at the start of an eagerly awaited G20 summit in Osaka. Scheduled meetings and set-piece events can often be overshadowed by the many bilateral talks, such as this, that happen on the sidelines. As well as his meeting with the US president, Mr Putin also met UK Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday. May tells Putin Salisbury attack 'can never be repeated' The pair staged a frosty photo opportunity before discussing some difficult subjects, includingthe poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal last year,by suspected Russian military intelligence officers. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in the attack. This video can not be played Mrs May was unsmiling as she greeted Mr Putin, in a frosty start to their meeting in Japan. French President Emmanuel Macron has said he wants strong wording in support of tackling climate change in any final leaders' statement. But the issue is a contentious one, given that the US is committed to pulling out ofthe landmark Paris climate agreement signed in 2015. The work to consolidate various opinions is expected to be ""difficult"", a Japanese official admitted on Thursday. The G20 is an annual meeting of leaders from the countries with the largest and fastest-growing economies The most closely watched talks are set to take place between Mr Trump and China's President Xi Jinping on Saturday, as the two countries try to resolve their bitter trade dispute. All eyes on Trump-Xi showdown US-China trade war in brief Talks ground to a halt last month when Mr Trump accused China of reneging on its promises and raised tariffs on $200bn (Â£159.2bn) worth of Chinese goods. The move came as a surprise to many who had thought the US and China were nearing a trade deal. China retaliated with its own tariff hikes. But there are reports that a trade truce could be struck over the weekend as the two leaders meet in Osaka. They last met at another G20 summit in Buenos Aires last year and, following a working dinner, agreed on a 90-day truce to their trade war. Ahead of the meeting, China warned against protectionist trade measures in comments that have been widely interpreted as a criticism of the US. ""Protectionism and bullying practices are on the rise, posing severe threats to economic globalisation and international order,"" a Chinese foreign ministry official said on Friday. Is Putin right?

"The African Union is to become a member of the G20, after been invited to join on 9 September 2023, at the group's summit in India's capital Delhi. The African Union will represent 55 countries from across the continent at future G20 meetings. The G20 - or Group of Twenty - is a club of countries that meets to discuss global economic and political issues. Between them, G20 countries account for85% of the world's economic output and more than 75% of world trade,external. They contain two-thirds of global population. The G20 members are the EU plus 19 nations: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the UK and the US. Some countries which are members of the G20 alsomeet as the G7. These are the world's seven leading industrialised countries. The African Union was invited to be become a permanent G20 member at the Delhi summit. The organisation represents 55 African countries. Profile: African Union The group was founded in 1999 afterthe Asian financial crisis. It was designed to be a forum for finance ministers and officials to discuss ways to restore economic stability. The first leaders' summit was held in 2008 in response to that year's global financial turmoil, to promote international cooperation. The G20 has broadened its focus in recent years to include issues such as climate change and sustainable energy. Every year, a different G20 member state takes over the presidency, and sets the agenda for the leaders' summit. Ajoint declarationfrom G20 members condemned""human suffering and adverse repercussions of the conflict in Ukraine on global food and energy security"", without directly criticising Russia. The Ukrainian government said the declaration was ""nothing to be proud of"", adding that a Ukrainian presence would have given participants a better understanding of the situation. Anew network of railways and shipping routes,externalwas announced by the US, India, Saudi Arabia and the EU, on the sidelines of the summit. It is designed to increase trade between South Asia, the Middle East and Europe. It is also meant to counter China's project to build new global trading routes, theBelt and Road Initiative. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi had wanted the summit to promote his country as a major global power, and himself as an important world leader, ahead of a general election due in spring 2024. He took the lead in inviting the AU to become a permanent member to the G20. This video can not be played G20: Why it needs African Union at the table Both Russia's President Vladimir Putin and China's President Xi Jinping stayed away from the summit. Russia hails unexpected G20 'milestone' as Ukraine fumes In May 2023, China and Saudi Arabia boycotted aG20 meeting on tourism, which was held in Indian-administered Kashmir, because the Kashmir region contains territoryclaimed by Pakistan as well as India. A row also broke out between India and China shortly before the summit, when Beijing released a mapclaiming the state of Arunachal Pradesh and the Aksai Chin plateau as Chinese territory. At the 2008 and 2009 leaders' summits, during the financial crisis, leadersagreed a host of measures to rescue the global economic system,external. But some critics argue thatsubsequent summits have been less constructive, often because of tensions between rival world powers,external. However, one-to-one meetings between leaders have often proved constructive. For example, at the 2019 summit in Osaka, then-US president Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinpingagreed to resume talks to settle a major trade dispute. G20 summits attract anti-globalisation protests. India's government ramped up security measures ahead of the Delhi event, closing roads around the venue, and deploying130,000 security officials across the city. Huge cut-outs of langur monkeys have been installed in Delhi to scare off smaller monkeys Novel measures were also taken to try to keeptroublesome monkeys away from the area. Delhi has a huge monkey population and authorities needed to stop the animals from disrupting the summit.

"The Trump administration says protecting US steel and aluminium producers is a matter of national security The G20 group of finance ministers has said trade tensions could undermine the global economy. It called for greater dialogue to reduce the risk after a tense, two-day meeting in Argentina. The summit comes as the US ramped up trade tensions on Friday, saying it was ready toslap tariffs on all $500bn of imports from China. France's finance minister, meanwhile, said the EU should not negotiate trade with ""a gun to its head."" In a joint statement, the G20 ministers said risks to growth ""over the short and medium term have increased. These include rising financial vulnerabilities, heightened trade and geopolitical tensions."" ""International trade and investment are important engines of growth,"" they said, adding that they ""recognise the need to step up dialogue and actions to mitigate risks and enhance confidence."" The G20 summit comes as a trade war has escalated in recent weeks after the US opened fire on 6 July withtariffs on $34bn of Chinese goods. TheUS has since listed another $200bn worth of Chinese productsto be targeted and has threatened tariffs on an even greater amount. US President Donald Trump also described the EU as a ""foe"" on trade last week. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire warned that a trade war was now a reality at the G20 summit. He said the current US trade policy of imposing unilateral tariffs was based on ""the law of the jungle"". But US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin defended the tariffs and urged the EU and China to open their markets to allow free competition. The US has large trade deficits with both the 28-member EU and China. Given the US buys nearly four times as much from China as it sells to them,analysts fear it could seek alternative ways to get back at the US. The two-day summit in Buenos Aires brought together finance ministers and central bankers of the world's top 20 economies. How a US-China trade war could hurt us all Six ways China could retaliate in a trade war US-China trade row: What has happened so far? ""World trade cannot base itself on the law of the jungle and the unilateral increase of tariffs is the law of the jungle,"" Mr Le Maire said on Saturday. Partners or foes? Steven Mnuchin (left) and Bruno Le Maire at the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires ""The law of the fittest - this cannot be the future of global trade relations. The law of the jungle will only turn out losers, it will weaken growth, threaten the most fragile countries and have disastrous political consequences."" He added that a trade war was now a reality, and that the EU could not consider negotiating a free trade deal with the US without America first withdrawing its tariffs on steel and aluminium. Mr Mnuchin said it was pretty simple. ""My message is pretty clear, it's the same message the president delivered at the G7 (last month in Canada): if Europe believes in free trade, we're ready to sign a free trade agreement with no tariffs, no non-tariff barriers and no subsidies. It has to be all three,"" he said. Mr Mnuchin said China had to open its markets ""so we can compete fairly"". Little has caused Donald Trump more annoyance than the trading deficits between the US and its major partners. He believes that if you have a trade deficit - if you import more than you export - you are losing out. Tackling what he has called ""unfair trading practices"" has become a key plank of his administration. The European Union, China and the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) countries, Mexico and Canada, have been his main targets.

"This video can not be played What some Tory voters think of Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt Jeremy Hunt has urged Tory leadership rival Boris Johnson to ""be straight with people"" about what a no-deal Brexit would mean. The foreign secretary said Mr Johnson's ""million to one"" claim about the chance of a no-deal ""flies in the face of reality"". Mr Johnson said any suggestion Brexit could be delayed again would ""end up eroding trust in politics"". Both men have said they would try to renegotiate a deal with the EU. But Mr Johnson says the UK must leave the EU on 31 October, ""do or die"", with or without a deal. Mr Hunt says he would leave without a deal in October if there was no prospect of leaving with one - but has not ruled out a further delay and has called 31 October a ""fake deadline"". Compare the candidates Reject no-deal Brexit, say first ministers May refuses unconditional support for next PM Who chooses the next PM? No-deal Brexit: What you need to know They are competing for Conservative Party members' votes in the race to replace Theresa May as Conservative leader - and prime minister. At a hustings in Bournemouth, Mr Johnson was asked if he would rule out suspending Parliament - a controversial move - in order to push through a no-deal Brexit. Describing it as an ""archaic device"", he said: ""I'm not attracted to the idea of a no-deal exit from the EU but, you know, I think it would be absolutely folly to rule it out. I think it's an essential tool of our negotiation. ""I don't envisage the circumstances in which it will be necessary to prorogue Parliament, nor am I attracted to that expedient."" A no-deal exit would see the UK leave the customs union and single market overnight and start trading with the EU on World Trade Organization rules. Mr Johnson has said a mechanism known as GATT 24 could be used to prevent tariffs, if there was a no-deal Brexit. But in a letter to his rival, Mr Hunt quoted Leave-backing cabinet ministersLiam Foxand Geoffrey Cox, who have argued that this would require a deal with the EU. In his letter, he asked: ""Who is correct: You, or the Attorney General and the International Trade Secretary?"" He also questioned Mr Johnson's suggestion that a free trade agreement could be negotiated during an ""implementation period"", if no deal was reached - saying it was a ""fact"" that without a deal, there would be no implementation period and Brussels negotiators put the political cohesion of the EU before economics. ""We must be careful to face the facts as we find them. Will you be straight with people that no deal means no implementation period?"" At the hustings, Mr Johnson criticised Mr Hunt's suggestion that the current Brexit deadline of 31 October could be delayed again - having been pushed back from 29 March after MPs repeatedly rejected the deal Mrs May had agreed with the EU. ""Anybody who proposes any further delay is simply going to end up eroding trust in politics, eroding people's confidence in our democratic institutions further,"" he said. ""And further weakening out great Conservative Party and our mission to lead this country. ""And it simply won't work. Kick the can again and we kick the bucket, my friends, that's the sad reality."" He also stood by his suggestion that the chances of leaving the EU without a deal were a ""million to one"", arguing there had been a ""change in mood in Westminster"" and that there was now a ""growing opportunity to get this thing done with style"". In other answers from the hustings, Mr Hunt suggested he would quit as PM if he failed to deliver Brexit. Asked if he would ""fall on his sword"", he said: ""Of course, no PM is going to last any time at all if they don't deliver Brexit and deliver it very quickly."" He also ruled out involving Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage in negotiations with the EU: ""Nigel Farage doesn't want a deal, he wants a WTO Brexit straight away. ""And while I would be prepared to do that if there was no other alternative and I'm absolutely clear about that, I think it would be much better for our businesses and much better for our Union if we could get a deal and I haven't given up on that."" Mr Johnson dismissed his rival's pledge to cancel student debts for some entrepreneurs, saying: ""I think people, a lot of people, would automatically be defining themselves as entrepreneurs."" ""I think the more sensible things to look at are the interest rate, and a reduction of the interest rate, also looking at the cost of maintenance because I think those are very, very high and that people are paying a lot of money back over a long time."" The candidates are set to face each other at an ITV debate on 9 July and at an event hosted by the Sun newspaper and talkRADIO on 15 July.

"Sir Jony Ive, the Briton who over two decades helped turn Apple into the world's most valuable company, is leaving to set up his own venture. Sir Jonathan, designer of the iMac, iPod and iPhone, leaves later this year to start a creative firm, LoveFrom, with Apple as its first client. ""This just seems like a natural and gentle time to make this change,"" he said. Apple boss Tim Cook said his ""role in Apple's revival cannot be overstated"". But the departure comes at a time of wider change at the tech giant. Retail chief Angela Ahrendts left in April and investors have been worried about falling iPhone sales. Sir Jonathan said in a statement: ""After nearly 30 years and countless projects, I am most proud of the lasting work we have done to create a design team, process and culture at Apple that is without peer."" Little is known about LoveFrom, but it will be based in California and there are reports one area of focus will be wearable technology.News of his departure broke in an exclusive interview in the Financial Times,external. In the article, Sir Jonathan saidÂ Marc Newson, a friend and collaborator at Apple, would also join the new firm. There would also be ""a collection of creatives"" spanning several different disciplines beyond design, he said. The iPhone is the most profitable product in history He became head of Apple's design studio in 1996, when the company was in poor financial health and cutting jobs. The turnaround began with Sir Jonathan's iMac in 1998, and the iPod in 2001. Apple's founder, the late Steve Jobs, once said of Sir Jonathan: ""If I had a spiritual partner at Apple, it's Jony."" One of Sir Jonathan's most recent projects was finishing Apple's new corporate headquarters, Apple Park, an ultra-modern complex designed in partnership with British architects Foster + Partners. This video can not be played Why Apple is worth $1 trillion... and who could challenge it Ben Bajarin, analyst with Creative Strategies, said: ""It's the most significant departure of somebody who was a core part of the growth story"" under Mr Jobs. Sir Jonathan, knighted by the Queen in 2012, will not have an immediate successor. Since 2012, he has overseen design for both hardware and software at Apple, roles that had previously been separate. The departure of the ""thoughtful"" Sir Jonathan for his own company will be a loss for Apple, which is already facing challenges. From the ""ground-breaking"" iMac to Apple's ambitious new Apple Park campus, he has helped to shape one of the world's most successful companies. ""Jony is a singular figure in the design world and his role in Apple's revival cannot be overstated,"" said Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive. Who is Apple's top designer? Apple said on Thursday the roles would again be split, with design team leaders Evans Hankey taking over as vice-president of industrial design and Alan Dye becoming vice-president of human interface design. Ms Hankey is the first woman to lead Apple's industrial design team. Steve Jobs and Jony Ive, the Lennon and McCartney of Apple - it's impossible to see the company becoming what it is today without the most creative partnership in recent business history. Ive was a relatively junior figure when Jobs returned from exile to revive Apple. He picked out the British designer as a kindred spirit who shared his obsession with the idea that the look and feel of a product was as important as the technology inside it. Their first hit was the iMac, breaking away from the beige boxes that dominated the PC market to show that computers could be beautiful design objects. The iPod, the iPhone and the iPad followed, each setting new standards in product design which rivals rushed to imitate. Like Mr Ive's other designs, rivals rushed to imitate the iPod After the death of Steve Jobs, there was speculation that Jony Ive might one day move into the chief executive's office. That always seemed unlikely. Instead he remained the firm's design guru, the often parodied voice of those iconic Apple product videos, while Tim Cook drove the mighty profit machine ever onwards. In recent years, it has been harder to detect the Ive magic - while the Airpods look set to become another classic, the $999 stand for a Mac Pro monitor stand seemed to symbolise a company taking its fans for granted. But the man who started his career by designing toilets and toothbrushes and ended up giving us the most profitable product in history, the iPhone, is assured of his place in history.

"Donald Trump teed off at the opening of his controversial Aberdeenshire golf course in 2012 The sand dunes at Donald Trump's Aberdeenshire golf resort are expected to lose their status as a nationally-important protected environment. Government watchdog Scottish Natural Heritage has recommended that Menie links be removed from an existing site of special scientific interest (SSSI). SNH concluded Mr Trump's golf course had ""destroyed"" the sand dune system, causing permanent habitat loss. The Trump Organisation reacted by calling the move a ""stitch-up"". It said the organisation had spent millions on the care, protection and maintenance of the SSSI area. SNH said it was ""unusual"" to remove an SSSI from the list but there was no longer a reason to protect the dunes. Scottish Green party co-convener Patrick Harvie, who campaigned against the development, said: ""It has ruined, destroyed, gubbed, the kind of natural environment that those paper protections were there to protect."" Donald Trump officially played his first round at the Trump International Golf Links, north of Aberdeen, in July 2012, more than four years before he became US president. It is partly built on Foveran Links - an SSSI originally listed as one of the finest examples of a ""dynamic"" mobile sand dune system in the UK. Before the course was built, the dune system moved north at substantial speeds - up to 11 metres per year - across an area of about 15 hectares. SNH warned a planning inquiry that the development would seriously damage the SSSI but permission was granted on the basis that the potential economic benefit would outweigh environmental harm. The sand dunes at Sand end burn looking north before and after the construction of the Trump International Golf Links. Two years ago SNH concluded that the site's special features had been ""partially destroyed"" with no prospect of recovery. It said there had been some permanent habitat loss - for example, where tracks, tees, fairways and greens had been constructed. There had been other habitat changes where mobile sand dunes were stabilised through the planting of marram grass. SNH is now beginning a three-month consultation on the formal process of delisting the SSSI. Sally Thomas, SNH's director of people and nature, said: ""The denotification of SSSIs is unusual, however in this case we have found there is no longer a reason to protect the dunes at Menie as they do not include enough of the special, natural features for which they were designated."" Ms Thomas said SNH worked with developers to ensure habitats and wildlife were protected when development work was undertaken. She said: ""Most of the time, development can take place without damaging important natural features, but this was not the case in this instance."" The Menie section of the Foveran SSSI comprised a range of special habitats, of which approximately one-third have been damaged. SNH said the Foveran Links SSSI was a ""very high quality example of a sand dune system characteristic of north east Scotland"". It now proposes merging what remains of the SSSI at Foveran Links with the adjacent Sands of Forvie and Ythan Estuary SSSI. Mr Harvie, from The Scottish Greens, said: ""The damage we predicted has come to pass. ""It demonstrates once again that this development should never have been allowed to go ahead."" Mr Harvie said it could never be acceptable for a ""precious, irreplaceable eco-system"" to be sold off for short-term economic gain. Trump opened his golf course seven years ago He said the legal protection designed to protect the site were ""torn up"" to allow the development to go ahead. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""Scottish ministers approved the Menie Golf Resort application in 2008 in line with the recommendation of the three independent Reporters which was that overall the economic and social benefits of the proposal justified the adverse environmental impacts caused."" In response to the announcement, the Trump Organisation issued a strongly-worded statement. Trump International Golf Links Scotland's executive vice-president, Sarah Malone, said: ""This is an utter disgrace and shows SNH has hit an all time low. To make an announcement to the media before informing us, the actual landowner, shows how politically-motivated this decision is. What other SSSI landowner is singled out in this way. ""It's a stitch-up. ""Before Donald Trump invested in the site, SNH had little interest in the SSSI at Foveran Links and did even less about it, and has barely been on property since.  Trump International funds a team of leading geomorphological consultants, ecologists and environmental experts and has spent millions on the care, protection and maintenance of the small area of SSSI in Scotland that it owns and yet SNH has offered no support, guidance or help. ""All this government agency wants to do is score political points and undermine that investment, custodianship and environmental management. No other SSSI site in the country has been afforded the amount of funding or expertise that Menie has and continues to receive.""

"This video can not be played Mrs May was unsmiling as she greeted Mr Putin, in a frosty start to their meeting in Japan. Russia must end its ""irresponsible and destabilising activity"", Theresa May has told President Vladimir Putin in one-to-one talks, Downing Street said. Describing the Salisbury poisoning as a ""truly despicable act"", she said the two suspects - believed to be Russian military intelligence officers - must be ""brought to justice"". Mrs May said the UK was open to a ""different relationship"" but that ""this behaviour could never be repeated"". The Kremlin denies any involvement. The UK believes two officers from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, were behind the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, in March 2018. Conservative leadership candidate Boris Johnson has said Russia will ""always let you down"", adding it was ""very difficult to find any defence for their behaviour"" when it came to the Salisbury poisonings. Speaking at the latest Tory party hustings in Exeter, he said there is a ""global sense of repulsion at the way Russia behaves"". Mr Johnson added that ""every British prime minister, every foreign secretary"" in the past 10 years thought they could have a ""normalisation"" with Russia but were let down. Meanwhile, Jeremy Hunt, running against Mr Johnson to be the next prime minister, has calledcomments made by Mr Putin about Western liberalism""an absolute disgrace"". ""It's all very easy to be disparaging about democracy when you've never had to bother with it at home,"" Mr Hunt said. Referring to the attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal, he said: ""My worry about Russia is that they're up to their old tricks."" Mrs May and Mr Putin met for talks on the margins of the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, on Friday - the first formal bilateral meeting between the two leaders since the Salisbury incident. What happened to the Skripals? Who is Sergei Skripal? Is Putin right? Is liberalism really dead? What is the G20 and why does it meet? It comes as Mr Putin,in an interview with the Financial Times,external, dismissed the Skripal poisoning as a ""fuss about spies"" and attacked liberalism, a core principle of western democracy. As they met, the two leaders shook hands but there appeared to be little warmth, with Mrs May looking serious and unsmiling, as the pair began their meeting. Downing Street said Mrs May had told the Russian president that the use of a deadly nerve agent on the streets of Salisbury formed part of a wider pattern of unacceptable behaviour. She said the UK had irrefutable evidence that Russia was behind the attack that led to the death of a British citizen, Dawn Sturgess. Mrs May also said the UK would continue to ""unequivocally defend liberal democracy"" and protect the human rights and equality of all groups, including LGBT people. This video can not be played ""Russia needs to recognise its acts and stop acting in this way,"" says the prime minister. After the issue of Mrs May's facial expression was raised by a reporter on Russian TV, Vladimir Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, praised the prime minister for her ""friendly and constructive attitude"". Mr Peskov said there had been a ""a long pause in communication"" between Russia and Britain, adding that ""the fact itself that the meeting took place is very positive."" Speaking to BBC deputy political editor John Pienaar ahead of the meeting on Friday, Mrs May said the UK had already set out evidence on the attack in Salisbury last year and made charges against two Russians. ""Russia does not allow the extradition of its nationals, but European arrest warrants are out for those two individuals and if they set foot outside Russia we will be making every effort that they are brought to justice,"" she said. ""Russia needs to recognise its acts and stop acting in this way - and stop its other destabilising activities around the world, including, for example, its use of disinformation and cyber-attacks,"" she added. Yulia and Sergei Skripal fell ill after Mr Skripal's front door was sprayed with Novichok Mr Skripal and his daughter both survived the poisoning in March last year, but a British woman, Dawn Sturgess, died last July after coming into contact with the nerve agent Novichok through handling a contaminated perfume bottle. Scotland Yard and the CPS say there is sufficient evidence to charge two Russians - who go by the names of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov - for attempted murder. However, Mr Putin has insisted they are civilians, not criminals. He said he hoped ""a few preliminary steps"" would be made towards restoring relations between Russia and the UK. This video can not be played ""Our friends had been suggesting for a long time that we visit this wonderful town"" - Novichok suspects speaking in October 2018 However, he appeared to have little sympathy for Mr Skripal. The former Russian military intelligence colonel was jailed after being accused of spying for Britain, before being released as part of a spy swap. ""Treason is the gravest crime possible and traitors must be punished,"" Mr Putin told the newspaper. ""I am not saying that the Salisbury incident is the way to do it. Not at all. But traitors must be punished. ""Listen, all this fuss about spies and counterspies, it is not worth serious interstate relations. This spy story, as we say, it is not worth five kopecks. Or even five pounds, for that matter."" The Russian President has previouslylabelled Mr Skripal as a ""traitor"" and a ""scumbag"".

"In the words of the film, everything appears to be ""awesome"" in the world of Lego as it expands its empire by snapping up Legoland and Madame Tussauds owner Merlin Entertainments The Danish billionaire family that controls the Lego toy firm, with other investors, is paying Â£4.8bn for Merlin. Kirkbi Invest says it has the money and experience to ""realise the company's potential to grow"". Merlin also owns the London Eye, Alton Towers and Chessington Adventures. Kirkbi already owns almost a third of the shares in Merlin Entertainments, and says it does not expect the deal to lead to any significant changes. All existing Merlin attractions in the UK will remain open and it has no plans to sell any part of the business, it said. Kirkbi chief executive SÃ¸ren Thorup SÃ¸rensen said the group wanted to help the firm reach its ""full potential, which we believe is best pursued under private ownership"". ""With a shared understanding of the business and its culture, we believe that this group of investors has the unique collective resources necessary to equip Merlin, for their next phase of growth,"" he added. Private equity firm Blackstone - part of the investment group - said it had the ""substantial resources"" required to support Merlin's long-term plans ""which will require significant investment to ensure its long-term success"". Merlin is the second-largest operator of visitor attractions globally with more than 130 attractions in 25 countries. It said it had already rejected several approaches. The move comes just weeks after activist shareholder ValueAct Capital, which holds a 9.3% stake in Merlin, called on the company to find a private buyer.

"In the words of the film, everything appears to be ""awesome"" in the world of Lego as it expands its empire by snapping up Legoland and Madame Tussauds owner Merlin Entertainments The Danish billionaire family that controls the Lego toy firm, with other investors, is paying Â£4.8bn for Merlin. Kirkbi Invest says it has the money and experience to ""realise the company's potential to grow"". Merlin also owns the London Eye, Alton Towers and Chessington Adventures. Kirkbi already owns almost a third of the shares in Merlin Entertainments, and says it does not expect the deal to lead to any significant changes. All existing Merlin attractions in the UK will remain open and it has no plans to sell any part of the business, it said. Kirkbi chief executive SÃ¸ren Thorup SÃ¸rensen said the group wanted to help the firm reach its ""full potential, which we believe is best pursued under private ownership"". ""With a shared understanding of the business and its culture, we believe that this group of investors has the unique collective resources necessary to equip Merlin, for their next phase of growth,"" he added. Private equity firm Blackstone - part of the investment group - said it had the ""substantial resources"" required to support Merlin's long-term plans ""which will require significant investment to ensure its long-term success"". Merlin is the second-largest operator of visitor attractions globally with more than 130 attractions in 25 countries. It said it had already rejected several approaches. The move comes just weeks after activist shareholder ValueAct Capital, which holds a 9.3% stake in Merlin, called on the company to find a private buyer. The sale means that Merlin's shares will be delisted from the London Stock Exchange, which it floated on six years ago.

"This video can not be played What some Tory voters think of Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt Jeremy Hunt has urged Tory leadership rival Boris Johnson to ""be straight with people"" about what a no-deal Brexit would mean. The foreign secretary said Mr Johnson's ""million to one"" claim about the chance of a no-deal ""flies in the face of reality"". Mr Johnson said any suggestion Brexit could be delayed again would ""end up eroding trust in politics"". Both men have said they would try to renegotiate a deal with the EU. But Mr Johnson says the UK must leave the EU on 31 October, ""do or die"", with or without a deal. Mr Hunt says he would leave without a deal in October if there was no prospect of leaving with one - but has not ruled out a further delay and has called 31 October a ""fake deadline"". Compare the candidates Reject no-deal Brexit, say first ministers May refuses unconditional support for next PM Who chooses the next PM? No-deal Brexit: What you need to know They are competing for Conservative Party members' votes in the race to replace Theresa May as Conservative leader - and prime minister. At a hustings in Bournemouth, Mr Johnson was asked if he would rule out suspending Parliament - a controversial move - in order to push through a no-deal Brexit. Describing it as an ""archaic device"", he said: ""I'm not attracted to the idea of a no-deal exit from the EU but, you know, I think it would be absolutely folly to rule it out. I think it's an essential tool of our negotiation. ""I don't envisage the circumstances in which it will be necessary to prorogue Parliament, nor am I attracted to that expedient."" A no-deal exit would see the UK leave the customs union and single market overnight and start trading with the EU on World Trade Organization rules. Mr Johnson has said a mechanism known as GATT 24 could be used to prevent tariffs, if there was a no-deal Brexit. But in a letter to his rival, Mr Hunt quoted Leave-backing cabinet ministersLiam Foxand Geoffrey Cox, who have argued that this would require a deal with the EU. In his letter, he asked: ""Who is correct: You, or the Attorney General and the International Trade Secretary?"" He also questioned Mr Johnson's suggestion that a free trade agreement could be negotiated during an ""implementation period"", if no deal was reached - saying it was a ""fact"" that without a deal, there would be no implementation period and Brussels negotiators put the political cohesion of the EU before economics. ""We must be careful to face the facts as we find them. Will you be straight with people that no deal means no implementation period?"" At the hustings, Mr Johnson criticised Mr Hunt's suggestion that the current Brexit deadline of 31 October could be delayed again - having been pushed back from 29 March after MPs repeatedly rejected the deal Mrs May had agreed with the EU. ""Anybody who proposes any further delay is simply going to end up eroding trust in politics, eroding people's confidence in our democratic institutions further,"" he said. ""And further weakening out great Conservative Party and our mission to lead this country. ""And it simply won't work. Kick the can again and we kick the bucket, my friends, that's the sad reality."" He also stood by his suggestion that the chances of leaving the EU without a deal were a ""million to one"", arguing there had been a ""change in mood in Westminster"" and that there was now a ""growing opportunity to get this thing done with style"". In other answers from the hustings, Mr Hunt suggested he would quit as PM if he failed to deliver Brexit. Asked if he would ""fall on his sword"", he said: ""Of course, no PM is going to last any time at all if they don't deliver Brexit and deliver it very quickly."" He also ruled out involving Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage in negotiations with the EU: ""Nigel Farage doesn't want a deal, he wants a WTO Brexit straight away. ""And while I would be prepared to do that if there was no other alternative and I'm absolutely clear about that, I think it would be much better for our businesses and much better for our Union if we could get a deal and I haven't given up on that."" Mr Johnson dismissed his rival's pledge to cancel student debts for some entrepreneurs, saying: ""I think people, a lot of people, would automatically be defining themselves as entrepreneurs."" ""I think the more sensible things to look at are the interest rate, and a reduction of the interest rate, also looking at the cost of maintenance because I think those are very, very high and that people are paying a lot of money back over a long time."" The candidates are set to face each other at an ITV debate on 9 July and at an event hosted by the Sun newspaper and talkRADIO on 15 July.

"The London Bridge attack claimed eight innocent lives in 2017. But only now, at the end of an eight-week inquest, can we pull together the experiences of all those caught up in the harrowing events of that evening. The sun has gone down on a warm summer's night in London. Xavier Thomas and Christine Delcros walk hand in hand towards the Shard, a vast skyscraper that rises on the south side of London Bridge, for a cocktail after a day's sightseeing. But they never make it. Youssef Zaghba drives a hired van over the bridge and up on to the pavement. The French couple, unaware, are still chatting when it hits Mr Thomas from behind, catapulting him into the River Thames. Ms Delcros is lying seriously injured on the ground. She recalls: ""Suddenly I was under the impression there was a lot of light. I just heard myself say, 'That's how one dies - that's it.'"" She drifts in and out of consciousness, and asks for her fiance. Over a matter of seconds, the white van, weighed down with bags of gravel from B&Q, careers from road to pavement, and back again. Pedestrians run for their lives as the van knocks one down after another. Tyler Ferguson is a short way ahead on the bridge happily chatting to his fiancee, Chrissy Archibald, when he hears a man scream and the screech of tyres behind him. The van's wing mirror brushes his shoulder and there is a loud thud as Ms Archibald is swept under the wheels. She is left lying in the middle of the road. Mr Ferguson runs to her side and she dies in his arms. Meanwhile, the van veers on to the wrong side of Borough High Street and speeds past the Barrowboy and Banker pub, where all eyes have been glued to the Champions League final for most of the evening. Spanish team Real Madrid has just beaten Italy's Juventus. The van smashes into some railings, causing debris to rain down on diners sitting in a restaurant courtyard below, knocking one of them out. People outside the pub and passersby rush towards the van, thinking there's been an accident. They want to help but instead find themselves face-to-face with three armed attackers - the van driver Zaghba, Rachid Redouane and ringleader Khuram Butt. They are each carrying a 12-inch long ceramic pink kitchen knife from Lidl bound to their wrist with duct tape  - and begin attacking anyone in their path. Armed police are still minutes away. Until then, there is no line of defence between the crazed, predatory knifemen and the innocent Londoners and tourists, who just happen to be in the area at the time. Butt shouts out ""Allahu Akbar"" before stabbing Richard Livett, who has been watching the football in the pub. ""I felt what I thought initially was a punch in the back, which turned out to be him flailing his arm around the back of me and stabbing me,"" Mr Livett remembers. ""It was chaos all around. I was aware of screaming and shouting and people around me."" Sara Zelenak is on a night out with her friend In that chaos, Sara Zelenak and her friend, Priscila Goncalves, who are on a night out to have fun, become separated. ""I had no idea what was going on,"" Ms Goncalves says. ""People said 'run' - I started to run. I thought she was with me and then I looked - she was not."" Ms Zelenak has slipped in her heels on the wet pavement. There is no CCTV footage of the next few fateful moments but witnesses say James McMullan, who has been watching the football with friends in the pub, tries to help Ms Zelenak to her feet - but they're too late. The attackers set upon them with their knives, killing them both. The three men then make their way down a set of steps and into a courtyard in Borough Market, bustling with Saturday night diners and drinkers, many of them tourists. At that same moment Sebastian Belanger, who has also been watching the football, is coming towards the steps in the courtyard to investigate the noise from the crash. Under a dark archway, he is cornered and stabbed. Several people come out of the bars to try to save him, including Lisa Deacon, who puts into practice the first aid training she's been given a few weeks earlier. They spend a desperate half an hour trying to keep Mr Belanger alive - but without success. Boro Bistro courtyard was busy with diners Close by, Alexandre Pigeard, a waiter in French restaurant Boro Bistro is also drawn outside by the noise and straight into the path of the attackers, who stab him in the neck. Diners in the restaurant push tables aside, sending glasses smashing to the floor as they run for their lives. Andrius Vorobjovas nearly treads on a body in his haste to flee. By coincidence, two off-duty nurses are on separate nights out at Boro Bistro - Kirsty Boden is having a meal with two friends and Helen Kennett is drinking prosecco with her mother and sister to celebrate her birthday. Ms Kennett spots the injured Mr Pigeard being held upright by his attacker. ""Let me help you, I'm a nurse,"" she says, reaching out to him. The waiter shakes his head. ""No, just run."" Ms Kennett looks into the soulless eyes of the attacker. ""What's wrong with you?"" she asks. He looks at her and says ""No, what's wrong with you?"" before stabbing her in the neck. ""I was convinced I was going to die but I didn't want to die there,"" she recalls. It is two hours before she gets to an ambulance and is given medical help. Jack Baxter, who has been in the Barrowboy and Banker, watches Mr Pigeard running away, holding his neck. ""He had somebody else running to his right,"" he says. ""They were both running, looking at each other almost in shock at what happened and screaming to each other like 'what's going on?'"" Before long, Mr Pigeard collapses on the ground and is stabbed again. Ms Boden, the other nurse, does not survive the night. Within seconds of hearing the van crash, she is on her feet, telling her friends: ""I'm a nurse, I have to go and help."" All around her people are running for their lives but she goes to Mr Pigeard's side as he lies dying, and is stabbed in the head. Moments later, her friends spot her bright pink cardigan and see she's collapsed on the ground. They do their best to revive her, but she dies later that night. Ignacio Echeverria cycles towards the attackers Back on Borough High Street, two police officers are trying to tackle the knifemen who've just stabbed another man and woman. Ignacio Echeverria, who is cycling along the road with two friends, sees an injured man running away from London Bridge. ""It was like he didn't even think about it, but reacted immediately,"" remembers his friend, Guillermo Sanchez-Montisi. Mr Echeverria jumps off his bike, pulls his skateboard from his rucksack and swings it at the attackers. ""One of the attackers was covering his head as Ignacio was hitting him with the skateboard... then suddenly Ignacio was on the floor,"" says Mr Sanchez-Montisi, who runs away fearing he will be next. ""It was very painful to leave my friend but we were going to be next. When he was looking at me, he looked like the devil,"" he recalls. His friend can't be saved. Eight people are fatally wounded, many more are wandering the streets or lying on the ground, clutching wounds and spilling blood on to warm pavements. The attackers break into a run, with Butt pointing the way with his knife. Redouane ducks down to tie his laces. ""The place was in a panic,"" recalls Jonathan Moses, an off-duty junior doctor who is looking outside from a tapas bar on lockdown. ""I could hear people saying 'oh God, oh God, help, help, they've been stabbed.'"" He tells the staff guarding the locked door: ""I can't watch them die. You have to let me out and just lock the door after me."" Once outside, he finds wounded Marie Bondeville, who keeps telling him she's going to die. Dr Moses holds her hand and reassures her he's going to save her - and he does. He then helps to carry the skateboarder, Mr Echeverria, across London Bridge, continuing chest compressions while running. This time his patient can't be saved. ""Treat this like a warzone,"" one air ambulance doctor at the scene tells Dr Moses. Meanwhile, the attackers stab another person and another. US tourist Robert Piersant thinks a drunk has barged into him until he blacks out. His wife, Joyce, who is stabbed in the throat, knows in that instant her attacker wants to kill her. ""I can't explain why... it was in his eyes,'' she recalls. The attackers jog from one side of the road to the other, from cafe to pub to restaurant, picking out people at random and stabbing them over and over. Zaghba and Butt then strip off their jackets. Beneath they are wearing fake suicide vests, constructed from disposable water bottles and masking tape. In Elliot's Cafe, on the edge of Borough Market, customers are scrambling to find a safe spot when the attackers enter. The attackers shout that they are not happy with the way we are living our lives, recalls waitress Candice Hedge. From her hiding position under a table, she sees them stab one customer in the back - and then they see her. She puts her hands to her face but they stab her in the neck. She grabs a napkin to try to stem the bleeding, runs to the downstairs kitchen and waits with colleagues for the police to arrive some 30 minutes later. The attackers kick the locked doors open and enter the restaurant Outside Gerard Vowls, who has been watching the Champions League final, tries to stall the three knifemen by throwing chairs and pint glasses at them and calling them cowards. His makeshift weapons miss. He gestures through the glass front of the Black and Blue steakhouse, opposite Elliot's, to warn them. The sliding glass doors are locked but Redouane kicks them loose. As the attackers enter the bar area, customers and staff in the dining area escape out of another door. Redouane stabs Roy Larner, who does his best to fight back with his fists, while Butt tells Geoff Ho, another customer, to lie on the floor. ""No - you don't have to do this,"" he says, thinking that if he rushes at him, Butt might detonate his suicide vest and kill everyone. Mr Ho is repeatedly stabbed in the throat. The attackers make their way out through the now empty restaurant area, taking a swig of water from a bar tap. Butt washes the blood from his knife and wipes it on his beard. He then picks up a bottle to smash on the side of the table - another weapon. Butt tries to force his way into the bolted shut pub Five unarmed police officers confront the attackers, who shout ""Allahu Akbar"" and charge at the officers. Butt throws a bottle at PC Bartosz Tchorzewski. But they turn back and head for the Wheatsheaf pub just as Simon Edwards, who's been out for a meal and drink with friends, walks out. His wife, Nicole, swiftly drags him back into the pub and staff bolt the door shut. Butt is determined to force his way in. Mr Edwards watches as the bottom of the door, where there is no bolt, flexes with each kick. Butt then starts smashing window panes around the door with his knife handle, only stopping when he see his accomplices stabbing a man - Antonio Filis - outside the pub. Their knives only narrowly miss his lung. The police fear the attackers might detonate what they think are suicide vests The pub is suddenly filled with blue lights - armed police are outside. The attackers move towards the officers. Drop your knives, they say, as they shoot all three. Inside the pub, Mr Edwards drops to his knees to take cover when he hears a volley of bullets. One stray bullet comes through the pub window, misses Mr Edwards by centimetres and hits Neil McLellan, who's behind him, in the head. He survives. The police keep firing at the attackers, fearful they might detonate what they believe at the time to be suicide vests. On the street lie the bodies of the three attackers. The attack is over. Seven of their victims are dead. Xavier Thomas - who was thrown over the bridge parapet when he was struck by the van 10 minutes earlier - is not found for another three days, nearly two miles downstream. Absorbed in conversation and madly in love, Mr Thomas - the first of the attackers' victims - would have known nothing of the horrors inflicted on so many people on that devastating summer's night. This account of the attack at London Bridge on 3 June 2017 is told according to evidence given at the inquests into the deaths of the eight people killed, which began in May 2019. Months before the London Bridge attacks, five people were killed in a rampage that began on Westminster Bridge. Will was mown down by the attacker and a stranger looked after him.

"This video can not be played Mrs May was unsmiling as she greeted Mr Putin, in a frosty start to their meeting in Japan. Russia must end its ""irresponsible and destabilising activity"", Theresa May has told President Vladimir Putin in one-to-one talks, Downing Street said. Describing the Salisbury poisoning as a ""truly despicable act"", she said the two suspects - believed to be Russian military intelligence officers - must be ""brought to justice"". Mrs May said the UK was open to a ""different relationship"" but that ""this behaviour could never be repeated"". The Kremlin denies any involvement. The UK believes two officers from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, were behind the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, in March 2018. Conservative leadership candidate Boris Johnson has said Russia will ""always let you down"", adding it was ""very difficult to find any defence for their behaviour"" when it came to the Salisbury poisonings. Speaking at the latest Tory party hustings in Exeter, he said there is a ""global sense of repulsion at the way Russia behaves"". Mr Johnson added that ""every British prime minister, every foreign secretary"" in the past 10 years thought they could have a ""normalisation"" with Russia but were let down. Meanwhile, Jeremy Hunt, running against Mr Johnson to be the next prime minister, has calledcomments made by Mr Putin about Western liberalism""an absolute disgrace"". ""It's all very easy to be disparaging about democracy when you've never had to bother with it at home,"" Mr Hunt said. Referring to the attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal, he said: ""My worry about Russia is that they're up to their old tricks."" Mrs May and Mr Putin met for talks on the margins of the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, on Friday - the first formal bilateral meeting between the two leaders since the Salisbury incident. What happened to the Skripals? Who is Sergei Skripal? Is Putin right? Is liberalism really dead? What is the G20 and why does it meet? It comes as Mr Putin,in an interview with the Financial Times,external, dismissed the Skripal poisoning as a ""fuss about spies"" and attacked liberalism, a core principle of western democracy. As they met, the two leaders shook hands but there appeared to be little warmth, with Mrs May looking serious and unsmiling, as the pair began their meeting. Downing Street said Mrs May had told the Russian president that the use of a deadly nerve agent on the streets of Salisbury formed part of a wider pattern of unacceptable behaviour. She said the UK had irrefutable evidence that Russia was behind the attack that led to the death of a British citizen, Dawn Sturgess. Mrs May also said the UK would continue to ""unequivocally defend liberal democracy"" and protect the human rights and equality of all groups, including LGBT people. This video can not be played ""Russia needs to recognise its acts and stop acting in this way,"" says the prime minister. After the issue of Mrs May's facial expression was raised by a reporter on Russian TV, Vladimir Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, praised the prime minister for her ""friendly and constructive attitude"". Mr Peskov said there had been a ""a long pause in communication"" between Russia and Britain, adding that ""the fact itself that the meeting took place is very positive."" Speaking to BBC deputy political editor John Pienaar ahead of the meeting on Friday, Mrs May said the UK had already set out evidence on the attack in Salisbury last year and made charges against two Russians. ""Russia does not allow the extradition of its nationals, but European arrest warrants are out for those two individuals and if they set foot outside Russia we will be making every effort that they are brought to justice,"" she said. ""Russia needs to recognise its acts and stop acting in this way - and stop its other destabilising activities around the world, including, for example, its use of disinformation and cyber-attacks,"" she added. Yulia and Sergei Skripal fell ill after Mr Skripal's front door was sprayed with Novichok Mr Skripal and his daughter both survived the poisoning in March last year, but a British woman, Dawn Sturgess, died last July after coming into contact with the nerve agent Novichok through handling a contaminated perfume bottle. Scotland Yard and the CPS say there is sufficient evidence to charge two Russians - who go by the names of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov - for attempted murder. However, Mr Putin has insisted they are civilians, not criminals. He said he hoped ""a few preliminary steps"" would be made towards restoring relations between Russia and the UK. This video can not be played ""Our friends had been suggesting for a long time that we visit this wonderful town"" - Novichok suspects speaking in October 2018 However, he appeared to have little sympathy for Mr Skripal. The former Russian military intelligence colonel was jailed after being accused of spying for Britain, before being released as part of a spy swap. ""Treason is the gravest crime possible and traitors must be punished,"" Mr Putin told the newspaper. ""I am not saying that the Salisbury incident is the way to do it. Not at all. But traitors must be punished. ""Listen, all this fuss about spies and counterspies, it is not worth serious interstate relations. This spy story, as we say, it is not worth five kopecks. Or even five pounds, for that matter."" The Russian President has previouslylabelled Mr Skripal as a ""traitor"" and a ""scumbag"". The Skripal poisoning froze relations between Russia and the UK.The UK expelled23 Russian diplomats who Mrs May claimed were undeclared intelligence officers following the Salisbury attack, and Russia responded byexpelling UK diplomats.

"Too many military personnel live in poor quality housing - despite the Ministry of Defence spending Â£135m on refurbishments, a watchdog has said. A Public Accounts Committee (PAC) report warned that without improvements the military risked undermining morale and losing highly skilled individuals. It said satisfaction ""only rose slightly"", despite the MoD refurbishing around 3,800 homes. The MoD said providing good quality housing was a ""top priority"". The department provides subsidised housing to military personnel and their families. Barracks 'worse than the frontline' Service families 'let down' by housing PAC chairwoman Meg Hillier said: ""Too many military service personnel find themselves in living quarters where the standard is simply not good enough."" Poor quality accommodation ""puts a strain on working and family life"", the Labour MP added. ""The nation cannot afford to lose experienced and skilled personnel simply because their homes are not up to standard,"" she said. Housing satisfaction increased from 62% to 64% in the past year, the report by Westminster's public spending watchdog said. The MoD told the committee it would set the ""demanding target"" of raising that to 68% this year. The department said it was investing more than Â£80m a year to improve the quality of its homes, while building more than 1,500 new properties for service families. The PAC also criticised the military for being ""slow"" to react to changing social attitudes. Only those who are married or in a civil partnership are ""entitled to accommodation"", while those in long-term relationships only remain ""eligible"", the committee said. The MoD said it was ""modernising"" the way it provided housing, introducing new measures to support co-habitation and a pilot scheme offering privately rented homes alongside existing options. Under the scheme, MoD housing will no longer be allocated based on the rank of the personnel but instead on the size of the family. Ms Hillier urged the MoD to ""urgently"" reduce the number of empty properties it holds, while thousands of people across the country remain on waiting lists. The watchdog also called for military bosses to ""negotiate hard"" for taxpayers when negotiating future rent levels with the private housing provider it sold its estate to in 1996. The original sale was criticised by the PAC for having ""badly let down"" taxpayers. Barracks 'worse than the frontline' MoD homes standing empty across UK.

"This video can not be played Who are the Conservative Party members? Conservative MPs may have whittled the contenders in the leadership race down to the final two - but it will not be politicians who will decide who gets to be the next prime minister. Instead it will be the party's grassroots members who will decide which of Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson gets to succeed Theresa May. They will do so in a postal ballot, with the winner announced in the week beginning 22 July. In other words, it is members of the public - those who pay Â£25 a year to join the Conservative Party - who get the final say on who leads the country. There will not be a general election because the party is already in power. So, who are the Conservative Party's members and what do they think on key issues, not least, of course, Brexit? The Conservative Party membership iscurrently thought to be around 160,000,external- a rise of more than 30,000 in the past 12 months. The last time official figures were released was in March 2018, when they put the figure at 124,000. Jeremy Hunt: What's his track record? Boris Johnson: What's his track record? That is way down on the peak of nearly 3 million that the party boasted in the early 1950s. The Tories have far fewer members than the Labour Party. Even if we assume that Labour's membership has fallen from the late 2017 peak of more than 550,000, it still has a huge advantage over the Conservatives when it comes to campaigning on the ground. More like this What do voters make of Brexit now? How much difference does going to a top US university make? The main parties have been punished How Brexit hit the pound in your pocket Right now, however, none of that matters as much as the fact that those 160,000 or so rank-and-file members of the Conservative Party have a crucial role. They are going to be choosing the next prime minister of a country of over 65 million people - something which has never happened before. From studies of the 124,000 members that the party had in 2018, we know quite a lot about who they are and their beliefs. Most members of most parties in the UK are pretty middle-class. But Conservative Party members are the most middle-class of all: some 86% of them fall into the ABC1 category used by market researchers to describe the top social grade. Around a quarter of them are, or were, self-employed and nearly half of them work, or used to, in the private sector. Nearly four out of 10 put their annual income at over Â£30,000, and one in 20 put it at over Â£100,000. As such, Tory members are considerably better-off than most voters and, indeed, the members of other parties. On the other hand, the fact that 97% of Conservative Party members are white doesn't do much to distinguish them from their counterparts in other parties. It does inevitably mean, however, that ethnic minorities, who make up well over 10% of British people, are heavily under-represented in the Tory rank and file. So, too, are women. Other parties - notably Labour and the Greens, but also the SNP - now come close to gender balance, but seven out of 10 Conservative members are male. Tory members are also older than the members of most other parties. True, their average age may ""only"" be 57, but this disguises the fact that four out of 10 are over 65. They are concentrated in the southern half of England. Nearly 60% of Tory members live in London, the east, south-east and south-west. So much for demography and geography.  What about ideology? Well, not surprisingly, Tory Party members are more right-wing than the population as a whole. On a scale where zero represents very left-wing and 10 very right-wing, the average voter places themselves at the centre point. The average Conservative Party member places themselves at 7.6. Laura Kuenssberg: May was just overwhelmed Premiership in six charts The Theresa May story Certainly, grassroots Tories are socially conservative. Three-quarters of them believe, for instance, that young people today don't have enough respect for traditional values. Nearly six out of 10 support the death penalty. They are also conventionally right-wing on some aspects of economic policy. For example, only 15% of them believe that government should redistribute income from the better-off to those who are less well-off. But on other issues they hold views that may be more unexpected. A third of Tory rank-and-file members believe that ordinary working people do not get their fair share of the nation's wealth and that there is one law for the rich and one for the poor. About half believe that big business takes advantage of ordinary people. Interestingly, they have also cooled on austerity. In the summer of 2015, some 55% said government spending cuts hadn't gone far enough, but two years later that had fallen to 28%. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom quit amid a backlash against Brexit plans What Tory members haven't cooled on, however, is Brexit. Indeed, since we started tracking them in 2015, they've hardened their position. It is clear that they are not supporters of the deal negotiated by Theresa May. In fact, it is now the case that fully two-thirds of them back a no-deal Brexit - an outcome supported by only a quarter of voters as a whole. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Nor are they in the least bit keen on the idea of letting the public have another say on the UK's EU membership. Some 84% of them oppose the idea of a new referendum on the issue. In short, the grassroots aren't simply sceptical on Europe; they can't wait to leave, whatever that might take. Furthermore, a breakdown of YouGov polling data suggests that the 30,000 or so members who have joined in the past year are even more likely to be pro-Brexit. This, then, is the Conservative Party electorate. And those MPs hoping to succeed Mrs May will need to pitch their promises accordingly.

"This video can not be played The biggest moments from the first Democratic debate Democratic White House front-runners Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are offering starkly diverging visions for America in a TV debate. Mr Biden, a moderate, and Mr Sanders, an ultraliberal, are battling for the soul of the party as it ponders how best to take on President Donald Trump. Eight other candidates are vying on the stage in Miami, Florida, to impress voters ahead of next year's election. Sparks flew in the first debate with 10 other Democrats on Wednesday night. The crowd of contenders will be winnowed until a winner is picked at the party convention in July next year. Who shone in first Democratic debate? He or she will face the Republican president in the November 2020 election. Mr Biden, who served two terms as Barack Obama's vice-president, is aiming to consolidate his status at the tip of the field on Thursday night after recent missteps. The 76-year-old has flip-flopped on abortion, recanted after provoking liberal ire for calling Vice-President Mike Pence ""a decent guy"", and was strafed for touting his work decades ago with senators who favoured racial segregation. Mr Biden is an ideological centrist notable for his professed willingness to work with Republicans in order to govern. This video can not be played ""Economy good for a thin slice of America"" He has warned that embracing a more left-leaning platform will alienate the very working-class voters Democrats need to overcome Mr Trump. As pack leader, the former Delaware senator found a bullseye on his back as he took to the podium before a national TV audience of millions. He is flanked by nine competitors, including Mr Sanders standing right next to him, and they may sorely test his above-the-fray posture. On the stump, avowed Democratic socialist Mr Sanders has recently been attacking Mr Biden's record on trade and his vote for the Iraq war. The 77-year-old Vermont senator, who lost out to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 race for the party nomination, is promising a political revolution including free healthcare and cancelling student debt. But Mr Sanders has been losing ground in recent opinion polls to a rival liberal firebrand, Senator Elizabeth Warren. As the debate began, Mr Sanders confirmed he would raise taxes on American working families, but said they would end up paying less overall because of savings on healthcare. Biden pledged instead to eliminate Mr Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy. Mr Sanders pilloried the president as ""a pathological liar and a racist"". Choose your candidate and filter by category While the duel between the old guard heavyweights unfolds, younger candidates have a chance to present themselves as the future of the Democratic party. Two other top-tier candidates are setting out their policy stalls: Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old gay mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and 54-year-old Senator Kamala Harris of California. Both enjoyed brief initial surges in popularity, but their campaigns have so far not lived up to supporters' high hopes. Mr Buttigieg, a Harvard-educated military veteran, has been criticised back home for his handling of the police shooting of a black man, exposing fissures in his appeal to African Americans. This video can not be played How to pitch yourself to Iowa voters in five minutes Both have been jabbing at Mr Biden. Ms Harris has criticised the former vice-president for supporting a 1994 crime bill now blamed for mass incarceration of black men. Debate-watchers are keen to see whether the former San Francisco prosecutor will repeat that line of attack to his face. The only black woman in the field, she has been hotly tipped as a running mate for Mr Biden if he wins the nomination. The forum will include six other candidates who are all polling at one per cent or less. They are Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Michael Bennet, former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, congressman Eric Swalwell, self-help guru Marianne Williamson and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. Mr Biden found himself under early attack on an issue that he has presented as one of his strengths - political longevity. Mr Swalwell said: ""I was six years old when a presidential candidate came to the California Democratic convention and said, 'It's time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans.' ""That candidate was then-Senator Joe Biden. Joe Biden was right when he said it was time to pass the torch to a new generation Americans 32 years ago - he's still right today."" Mr Biden retorted: ""I'm still holding on to that torch."" Fellow septuagenarian Mr Sanders interjected: ""The issue, if I may say, is not generational. The issue is who has the guts to take on Wall Street, to take on the fossil fuel industry, to take on the big money interests."" As the debated descended into a free-for-all shouting match, Ms Harris was cheered for saying: ""America does not want to witness a food fight - they want to know how we're going to put food on their table!"" Healthcare dominated the first half hour of the debate. All of the candidates raised their hands when asked who would provide healthcare coverage for undocumented immigrants. But they argued over whether there should be government-run healthcare, or incremental change to the current US medical system dominated by the private marketplace. Mr Sanders outlined his plan for Medicare for All, a programme along the lines of Britain's NHS, though he was short on specifics of how it would be delivered. But Mr Biden said he opposed any Democrat that was against Obamacare, a veiled jab at Mr Sanders. Mr Biden pledged to build on Obamacare, saying: ""Urgency matters."" The flow of undocumented migrants over the US-Mexico border inspired two of the most powerful answers of the night. Her voice cracking, Ms Harris said:  ""A mother who pays a coyote to transport her child through their country of origin, through the entire country of Mexico, facing unknown peril, to come here. Why would that mother do that? ""I will tell you. Because she has decided for that child to remain where they are is worse. But what does Donald Trump do? He says, 'Go back to where you came from.' That is not reflective of our America and our values and it's got to to end!"" Mr Buttigieg drew more applause as he accused the Republican party of religious hypocrisy. ""For a party that associates itself with Christianity, to say it is OK, to suggest that that God would smile on the division of families at the hands of federal agents, that God would condone putting children in cages, has lost all claim to ever use religion language again,"" he said. One of the moderators pointed out to Mr Biden that the Obama administration had deported more than three million Americans, and asked if undocumented migrants should be kicked out of the country. ""Depending on if they committed a major crime, they should be deported."" Ms Warren is widely judged to have cemented her top-tier status after emerging from the debating ring on Wednesday night without a glove being laid upon her. The Massachusetts senator, who has pledged to institute a wealth tax and break up tech giants, railed on stage against nationwide income disparities as ""corruption, pure and simple"". Several lesser-known contenders turned their fire on one another as they vied to emerge from the shadows with only a limited time to make an impression. Ex-congressman Beto O'Rourke, Senator Cory Booker, former San Antonio mayor Julian Castro and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio clashed on everything from healthcare to foreign policy and immigration. They were united in opposition to Mr Trump, but disagreed on the extent to which the next president should shift the nation on a more liberal course - a theme sure to resurface on Thursday night. The first debate hauled in a surprisingly large 15.3 million viewers, according to estimates released by host NBC. The climactic round two is expected to draw an even bigger audience.
